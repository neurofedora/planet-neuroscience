              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13360">Symbolic dynamics of joint brain states during dyadic coordination</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to investigate the brain mechanisms that support coordination of behavior between individuals. Brain states in single individuals defined by the patterns of functional connectivity between brain regions are used to create joint symbolic representations of the evolution of brain states in two or more individuals performing a task together. These symbolic dynamics can be analyzed to reveal aspects of the dynamics of joint brain states that are related to coordination or other interactive behaviors. We apply this approach to simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) data from pairs of subjects engaged in two different modes of finger-tapping coordination tasks (synchronization and syncopation) under different interaction conditions (Uncoupled, Leader-Follower, and Mutual) to explore the neural mechanisms of multi-person motor coordination. Our results reveal that the dyads exhibit mostly the same joint symbols in different interaction conditions - the most important differences are reflected in the symbolic dynamics. Recurrence analysis shows that interaction influences the dwell time in specific joint symbols and the structure of joint symbol sequences (motif length). In synchronization, increasing feedback promotes stability with longer dwell times and motif length. In syncopation, Leader-Follower interactions enhance stability (increase dwell time and motif length), but Mutual feedback dramatically reduces stability. Network analysis reveals distinct topological changes with task and feedback. In synchronization, stronger coupling stabilizes a few states restricting the pattern of flow between states, preserving a core-periphery structure of the joint brain states. In syncopation, a more distributed flow amongst a larger set of joint brain states reduces the dominance of core joint brain states.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14082">Automatic recognition and detection of aphasic natural speech</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aphasia is a language disorder affecting one third of stroke patients. Current aphasia assessment does not consider natural speech due to the time consuming nature of manual transcriptions and a lack of knowledge on how to analyze such data. Here, we evaluate the potential of automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe Dutch aphasic speech and the ability of natural speech features to detect aphasia. A picture-description task was administered and automatically transcribed in 62 persons with aphasia and 57 controls. Acoustic and linguistic features were semi-automatically extracted and provided as input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our ASR model obtained a WER of 24.5%, outperforming earlier ASR models for aphasia. The SVM shows high accuracy (86.6%) at the individual level, with fluency features as most dominant to detect aphasia. ASR and semi-automatic feature extraction can thus facilitate natural speech analysis in a time efficient manner in clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14221">Emergence of brain function from structure: an algebraic quantum model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are governed by the brain's structural organization. Yet, the theoretical principles explaining how the physical architecture of the nervous system shapes its function remain elusive. Here, we combine concepts from quantum statistical mechanics and graph C*-algebras to introduce a theoretical framework where functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the underlying directed network. These equilibrium states, defined from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states formalism (KMS states), quantify the relative contribution of each neuron to the information flow within the connectome. Using the prototypical connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, we provide a comprehensive description of these KMS states, explore their functional implications, and establish the predicted functional network based on the nervous system's anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, we present a model for identifying the potential functional states of a detailed structural connectome and for conceptualizing the structure-function relationship.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14254">Integrated Brain Connectivity Analysis with fMRI, DTI, and sMRI Powered by Interpretable Graph Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal neuroimaging modeling has becomes a widely used approach but confronts considerable challenges due to heterogeneity, which encompasses variability in data types, scales, and formats across modalities. This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal contrastive learning utilizing a quantum encoder to integrate EEG (electroencephalogram) and image data. This groundbreaking attempt explores the integration of quantum encoders within the traditional multimodal learning framework. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, our method enhances the representation learning capabilities, providing a robust framework for analyzing time series and visual information concurrently. We demonstrate that the quantum encoder effectively captures intricate patterns within EEG signals and image features, facilitating improved contrastive learning across modalities. This work opens new avenues for integrating quantum computing with multimodal data analysis, particularly in applications requiring simultaneous interpretation of temporal and visual data.

                arXiv:2310.10005v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Downward causation is self-causation: the causal effect from the whole at the macro level to its parts at the micro level, and is regarded as a solution to the mind-body problem. However, no actual example of downward causation has been propsed. Here, we argue that a feedback control of micro-level neural mechanisms using macro-level algebraic structure information between neural network modules that is physically composed of neurons is a model of downward causation in the brain. We speculate that downward causation causes mathematical structure in our perceptual experience by controlling algebraic structure in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06500">Advantageous and disadvantageous inequality aversion can be taught through vicarious learning of others' preferences</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.06500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While enforcing egalitarian social norms is critical for human society, punishing social norm violators often incurs a cost to the self. This cost looms even larger when one can benefit from an unequal distribution of resources (i.e. advantageous inequity), as in receiving a higher salary than a colleague with the identical role. In the Ultimatum Game, a classic test bed for fairness norm enforcement, individuals rarely reject (punish) such unequal proposed divisions of resources because doing so entails a sacrifice of one's own benefit. Recent work has demonstrated that observing another's punitive responses to unfairness can efficiently alter the punitive preferences of an observer. It remains an open question, however, whether such contagion is powerful enough to impart advantageous inequity aversion to individuals. Using a variant of the Ultimatum Game in which participants are tasked with responding to fairness violations on behalf of another 'Teacher' - whose aversion to advantageous (versus disadvantageous) inequity was systematically manipulated-we probe whether individuals subsequently increase their punishment unfair after experiencing fairness violations on their own behalf. In two experiments, we found individuals can acquire aversion to advantageous inequity 'vicariously' through observing (and implementing) the Teacher's preferences. Computationally, these learning effects were best characterized by a model which learns the latent structure of the Teacher's preferences, rather than a simple Reinforcement Learning account. In summary, our study is the first to demonstrate that people can swiftly and readily acquire another's preferences for advantageous inequity, suggesting in turn that behavioral contagion may be one promising mechanism through which social norm enforcement - which people rarely implement in the case of advantageous inequality - can be enhanced.

                arXiv:2408.12664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep learning systems are scaled up to many billions of parameters, relating their internal structure to external behaviors becomes very challenging. Although daunting, this problem is not new: Neuroscientists and cognitive scientists have accumulated decades of experience analyzing a particularly complex system - the brain. In this work, we argue that interpreting both biological and artificial neural systems requires analyzing those systems at multiple levels of analysis, with different analytic tools for each level. We first lay out a joint grand challenge among scientists who study the brain and who study artificial neural networks: understanding how distributed neural mechanisms give rise to complex cognition and behavior. We then present a series of analytical tools that can be used to analyze biological and artificial neural systems, organizing those tools according to Marr's three levels of analysis: computation/behavior, algorithm/representation, and implementation. Overall, the multilevel interpretability framework provides a principled way to tackle neural system complexity; links structure, computation, and behavior; clarifies assumptions and research priorities at each level; and paves the way toward a unified effort for understanding intelligent systems, may they be biological or artificial.

                arXiv:1904.04579v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper suggests a statistical framework for describing the relations between the physical and conceptual entities of a brain-like model. Features and concept instances are put into context, where the paper suggests that features may be the electrical wiring, although chemical connections are also possible. With this idea, the actual length of the connection is important, because it is related to firing rates and neuron synchronization, but the signal type is less important. The paper then suggests that concepts are neuron groups that link feature sets and concept instances are determined by chemical signals from those groups. Therefore, features become the static horizontal framework of the neural system and concepts are vertically interconnected combinations of these. With regards to functionality, the neuron is then considered to be functional and the more horizontal memory structures can even be glial. This would also suggest that features can be distributed entities and not concentrated to a single area.

Following the successful application of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and Dynamic Audio Sensors (DAS), SNNs have found some proper paradigms, such as continuous visual signal tracking, automatic speech recognition, and reinforcement learning for continuous control, that have extensively supported their key features, including spike encoding, neuronal heterogeneity, specific functional circuits, and multiscale plasticity. Compared to these real-world paradigms, the brain contains a spiking version of the biology-world paradigm, which exhibits a similar level of complexity and is usually considered a mirror of the real world. Considering the projected rapid development of invasive and parallel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), as well as the new BCI-based paradigms that include online pattern recognition and stimulus control of biological spike trains, SNNs naturally leverage their advantages in energy efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. The biological brain has inspired the present study of SNNs and effective SNN machine-learning algorithms, which can help enhance neuroscience discoveries in the brain by applying them to the new BCI paradigm. Such two-way interactions with positive feedback can accelerate brain science research and brain-inspired intelligence technology.

Abstract: We explore statistical properties of BPS q-series for 3d N=2 strongly coupled supersymmetric theories that correspond to a particular family of 3-manifolds Y. We discover that gaps between exponents in the q-series are statistically more significant at the beginning of the q-series compared to gaps that appear in higher powers of q. Our observations are obtained by calculating saliencies of q-series features used as input data for principal component analysis, which is a standard example of an explainable machine learning technique that allows for a direct calculation and a better analysis of feature saliencies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13885">Neural Spacetimes for DAG Representation Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.13885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural Spacetimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries.

                arXiv:2408.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale linear equations and high dimension have been hot topics in deep learning, machine learning, control,and scientific computing. Because of special conjugate operation characteristics, time-variant complex conjugate matrix equations need to be transformed into corresponding real field time-variant large-scale linear equations. In this paper, zeroing neural dynamic models based on complex field error (called Con-CZND1) and based on real field error (called Con-CZND2) are proposed for in-depth analysis. Con-CZND1 has fewer elements because of the direct processing of complex matrices. Con-CZND2 needs to be transformed into the real field, with more elements, and its performance is affected by the main diagonal dominance of coefficient matrices. A neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive approximation approach (NHNSCAA) is innovatively proposed. Then Con-CZND1 conj model is constructed. Numerical experiments verify Con-CZND1 conj model effectiveness and highlight NHNSCAA importance.

                arXiv:2304.05346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global optimization problems are frequently solved using the practical and efficient method of evolutionary sophistication. But as the original problem becomes more complex, so does its efficacy and expandability. Thus, the purpose of this research is to introduce the Lagrange Elementary Optimization (Leo) as an evolutionary method, which is self-adaptive inspired by the remarkable accuracy of vaccinations using the albumin quotient of human blood. They develop intelligent agents using their fitness function value after gene crossing. These genes direct the search agents during both exploration and exploitation. The main objective of the Leo algorithm is presented in this paper along with the inspiration and motivation for the concept. To demonstrate its precision, the proposed algorithm is validated against a variety of test functions, including 19 traditional benchmark functions and the CECC06 2019 test functions. The results of Leo for 19 classic benchmark test functions are evaluated against DA, PSO, and GA separately, and then two other recent algorithms such as FDO and LPB are also included in the evaluation. In addition, the Leo is tested by ten functions on CECC06 2019 with DA, WOA, SSA, FDO, LPB, and FOX algorithms distinctly. The cumulative outcomes demonstrate Leo's capacity to increase the starting population and move toward the global optimum. Different standard measurements are used to verify and prove the stability of Leo in both the exploration and exploitation phases. Moreover, Statistical analysis supports the findings results of the proposed research. Finally, novel applications in the real world are introduced to demonstrate the practicality of Leo.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13840">Beyond Scale: The Diversity Coefficient as a Data Quality Metric for Variability in Natural Language Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2306.13840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current trends in pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on the scaling of model and dataset size. While the quality of pre-training data is considered an important factor for training powerful LLMs, it remains a nebulous concept that has not been rigorously characterized. To this end, we propose a formalization of one key aspect of data quality -- measuring the variability of natural language data -- specifically via a measure we call the diversity coefficient. Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed diversity coefficient aligns with the intuitive properties of diversity and variability, e.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. Then, we measure the diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets and demonstrate that their formal diversity is high compared to theoretical lower and upper bounds. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive set of controlled interventional experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMAv2 that demonstrate the diversity coefficient of pre-training data characterizes useful aspects of downstream model evaluation performance -- totaling 44 models of various sizes (51M to 7B parameters). We conclude that our formal notion of diversity is an important aspect of data quality that captures variability and causally leads to improved evaluation performance.

                arXiv:2403.12574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range and temporal resolution, are ideally suited for object detection, especially under scenarios with motion blur and challenging lighting conditions. However, while most existing approaches prioritize optimizing spatiotemporal representations with advanced detection backbones and early aggregation functions, the crucial issue of adaptive event sampling remains largely unaddressed. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which operate on an event-driven paradigm through sparse spike communication, emerge as a natural fit for addressing this challenge. In this study, we discover that the neural dynamics of spiking neurons align closely with the behavior of an ideal temporal event sampler. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive sampling module that leverages recurrent convolutional SNNs enhanced with temporal memory, facilitating a fully end-to-end learnable framework for event-based detection. Additionally, we introduce Residual Potential Dropout (RPD) and Spike-Aware Training (SAT) to regulate potential distribution and address performance degradation encountered in spike-based sampling modules. Empirical evaluation on neuromorphic detection datasets demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art spike-based methods with significantly fewer parameters and time steps. For instance, our method yields a 4.4\% mAP improvement on the Gen1 dataset, while requiring 38\% fewer parameters and only three time steps. Moreover, the applicability and effectiveness of our adaptive sampling methodology extend beyond SNNs, as demonstrated through further validation on conventional non-spiking models. Code is available at https://github.com/Windere/EAS-SNN.

                arXiv:2405.06419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates timeliness, especially when dealing with large datasets. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To meet these performance demands, we propose a novel backbone from the perspective of information fusion. Introducing the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module and the Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN), based on evidence theory, allows us to achieve superior performance. On the other hand, the perspective of multi-source information fusion effectively improves the accuracy of forecasting. Due to the fact that BPA is generated by fuzzy theory, TEFN also has considerable interpretability. In real data experiments, the TEFN partially achieved state-of-the-art, with low errors comparable to PatchTST, and operating efficiency surpass performance models such as Dlinear. Meanwhile, TEFN has high robustness and small error fluctuations in the random hyperparameter selection. TEFN is not a model that achieves the ultimate in single aspect, but a model that balances performance, accuracy, stability, and interpretability.

	<p>Delirium is often the first symptom of incipient acute illness or complications and must therefore be detected promptly. Nevertheless, routine screening for delirium in acute care hospital wards is often inadequate. We recently implemented a simple, user-friendly delirium screening test (RMA) that can be administered during ward rounds and routine nursing care. The test was found to be non-inferior to 4AT in terms of sensitivity and specificity. However, the dominant factors to take into account when assessing the performance of a test added to the routine work of busy acute care hospital wards are ease of administration, real-life amenability and the ability of the staff to adhere to testing requirements. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of daily RMA tests that were not administered as scheduled and the impact of these omissions on the overall real-world performance of RMA. Using point-in-time assessments of 4AT by an external rater, we found that complete RMA was administered in 88.8% of the days. Physicians omitted significantly more tests than nurses, but their results were more specific for delirium. Omissions reduced the sensitivity and specificity of RMA for delirium (compared to 4AT) from 90.7% to 81.7%, and from 99.2% to 87.8%, respectively. Ideally, the number of omitted RMA tests should be minimized. However, if over 85% of the daily quota of complete tests are administered, the sensitivity and specificity of RMA for diagnosing delirium as soon as it appears remain at acceptable levels.</p>

The identification of cancer driver genes is crucial for early detection, effective therapy, and precision medicine of cancer. Cancer is caused by the dysregulation of several genes at various levels of regulation. However, current techniques only capture a limited amount of regulatory information, which may hinder their efficacy. In this study, we present IMI-driver, a model that integrates multi-omics data into eight biological networks and applies Multi-view Collaborative Network Embedding to embed the gene regulation information from the biological networks into a low-dimensional vector space to identify cancer drivers. We apply IMI-driver to 29 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compare its performance with nine other methods on nine benchmark datasets. IMI-driver outperforms the other methods, demonstrating that multi-level network integration enhances prediction accuracy. We also perform a pan-cancer analysis using the genes identified by IMI-driver, which confirms almost all our selected candidate genes as known or potential drivers. Case studies of the new positive genes suggest their roles in cancer development and progression.

                <p>by Efrat Cohen-Davidi, Isana Veksler-Lublinsky</p>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. In animals, this regulation is achieved via base-pairing with partially complementary sequences on mainly 3’ UTR region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Computational approaches that predict miRNA target interactions (MTIs) facilitate the process of narrowing down potential targets for experimental validation. The availability of new datasets of high-throughput, direct MTIs has led to the development of machine learning (ML) based methods for MTI prediction. To train an ML algorithm, it is beneficial to provide entries from all class labels (i.e., positive and negative). Currently, no high-throughput assays exist for capturing negative examples. Therefore, current ML approaches must rely on either artificially generated or inferred negative examples deduced from experimentally identified positive miRNA-target datasets. Moreover, the lack of uniform standards for generating such data leads to biased results and hampers comparisons between studies. In this comprehensive study, we collected methods for generating negative data for animal miRNAs–target interactions and investigated their impact on the classification of true human MTIs. Our study relies on training ML models on a fixed positive dataset in combination with different negative datasets and evaluating their intra- and cross-dataset performance. As a result, we were able to examine each method independently and evaluate ML models’ sensitivity to the methodologies utilized in negative data generation. To achieve a deep understanding of the performance results, we analyzed unique features that distinguish between datasets. In addition, we examined whether one-class classification models that utilize solely positive interactions for training are suitable for the task of MTI classification. We demonstrate the importance of negative data in MTI classification, analyze specific methodological characteristics that differentiate negative datasets, and highlight the challenge of ML models generalizing interaction rules from training to testing sets derived from different approaches. This study provides valuable insights into the computational prediction of MTIs that can be further used to establish standards in the field.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involves aggregation of amyloid β and tau, neuron loss, cognitive decline, and neuroinflammatory responses. Both resident microglia and peripheral immune cells have been associated with the immune component of AD. However, the relative contribution of resident and peripheral immune cell types to AD predisposition has not been thoroughly explored due to their similarity in gene expression and function. To study the effects of AD associated variants on <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, we train convolutional neural network (CNN) regression models that link genome sequence to cell type-specific levels of open chromatin, a proxy for regulatory element activity. We then use <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis of regulatory sequences to predict the relative impact of candidate variants across these cell types. We develop and apply criteria for evaluating our models and refine our models using massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data. Our models identify multiple AD-associated variants with a greater predicted impact in peripheral cells relative to microglia or neurons. Our results support their use as models to study the effects of AD-associated variants and even suggest that peripheral immune cells themselves may mediate a component of AD predisposition. We make our library of CNN models and predictions available as a resource for the community to study immune and neurological disorders.

                <p>by Anubha Dey, Suresh Mudunuri, Manjari Kiran</p>

Synthetic lethality (SL) and synthetic viability (SV) are commonly studied genetic interactions in the targeted therapy approach in cancer. In SL, inhibiting either of the genes does not affect the cancer cell survival, but inhibiting both leads to a lethal phenotype. In SV, inhibiting the vulnerable gene makes the cancer cell sick; inhibiting the partner gene rescues and promotes cell viability. Many low and high-throughput experimental approaches have been employed to identify SLs and SVs, but they are time-consuming and expensive. The computational tools for SL prediction involve statistical and machine-learning approaches. Almost all machine learning tools are binary classifiers and involve only identifying SL pairs. Most importantly, there are limited properties known that best describe and discriminate SL from SV. We developed MAGICAL (<i>Multi-class Approach for Genetic Interaction in Cancer via Algorithm Learning</i>), a multi-class random forest based machine learning model for genetic interaction prediction. Network properties of protein derived from physical protein-protein interactions are used as features to classify SL and SV. The model results in an accuracy of ~80% for the training dataset (CGIdb, BioGRID, and SynLethDB) and performs well on DepMap and other experimentally derived reported datasets. Amongst all the network properties, the shortest path, average neighbor2, average betweenness, average triangle, and adhesion have significant discriminatory power. MAGICAL is the first multi-class model to identify discriminatory features of synthetic lethal and viable interactions. MAGICAL can predict SL and SV interactions with better accuracy and precision than any existing binary classifier.

                <p>by Jingjing Li, Laia Jordana, Haytham Mehsen, Xinyue Wang, Vincent Archambault</p>

In animals, mitosis involves the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and the sorting of individualized, condensed chromosomes. During mitotic exit, emerging nuclei reassemble a nuclear envelope around a single mass of interconnecting chromosomes. The molecular mechanisms of nuclear reassembly are incompletely understood. Moreover, the cellular and physiological consequences of defects in this process are largely unexplored. Here, we have characterized a mechanism essential for nuclear reassembly in <i>Drosophila</i>. We show that Ankle2 promotes the PP2A-dependent recruitment of BAF and Lamin at reassembling nuclei, and that failures in this mechanism result in severe nuclear defects after mitosis. We then took advantage of perturbations in this mechanism to investigate the physiological responses to nuclear reassembly defects during tissue development in vivo. Partial depletion of Ankle2, BAF, or Lamin in imaginal wing discs results in wing development defects accompanied by apoptosis. We found that blocking apoptosis strongly enhances developmental defects. Blocking p53 does not prevent apoptosis but enhances defects due to the loss of a cell cycle checkpoint. Our results suggest that apoptotic and p53-dependent responses play a crucial role in safeguarding tissue development in response to sporadic nuclear reassembly defects.

                <p>by Quinn K. Langdon, Jeffrey S. Groh, Stepfanie M. Aguillon, Daniel L. Powell, Theresa Gunn, Cheyenne Payne, John J. Baczenas, Alex Donny, Tristram O. Dodge, Kang Du, Manfred Schartl, Oscar Ríos-Cárdenas, Carla Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Molly Morris, Molly Schumer</p>

Over the past 2 decades, biologists have come to appreciate that hybridization, or genetic exchange between distinct lineages, is remarkably common—not just in particular lineages but in taxonomic groups across the tree of life. As a result, the genomes of many modern species harbor regions inherited from related species. This observation has raised fundamental questions about the degree to which the genomic outcomes of hybridization are repeatable and the degree to which natural selection drives such repeatability. However, a lack of appropriate systems to answer these questions has limited empirical progress in this area. Here, we leverage independently formed hybrid populations between the swordtail fish <i>Xiphophorus birchmanni</i> and <i>X</i>. <i>cortezi</i> to address this fundamental question. We find that local ancestry in one hybrid population is remarkably predictive of local ancestry in another, demographically independent hybrid population. Applying newly developed methods, we can attribute much of this repeatability to strong selection in the earliest generations after initial hybridization. We complement these analyses with time-series data that demonstrates that ancestry at regions under selection has remained stable over the past approximately 40 generations of evolution. Finally, we compare our results to the well-studied <i>X</i>. <i>birchmanni × X</i>. <i>malinche</i> hybrid populations and conclude that deeper evolutionary divergence has resulted in stronger selection and higher repeatability in patterns of local ancestry in hybrids between <i>X</i>. <i>birchmanni</i> and <i>X</i>. <i>cortezi</i>.

                <p>by Shawn D. Burton, Christina M. Malyshko, Nathaniel N. Urban</p>

Inhibitory circuits in the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) dynamically reformat olfactory information as it propagates from peripheral receptors to downstream cortex. To gain mechanistic insight into how specific OB interneuron types support this sensory processing, we examine unitary synaptic interactions between excitatory mitral and tufted cells (MTCs), the OB projection neurons, and a conserved population of anaxonic external plexiform layer interneurons (EPL-INs) using pair and quartet whole-cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices. Physiological, morphological, neurochemical, and synaptic analyses divide EPL-INs into distinct subtypes and reveal that parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking EPL-INs (FSIs) perisomatically innervate MTCs with release-competent dendrites and synaptically detonate to mediate fast, short-latency recurrent and lateral inhibition. Sparse MTC synchronization supralinearly increases this high-fidelity inhibition, while sensory afferent activation combined with single-cell silencing reveals that individual FSIs account for a substantial fraction of total network-driven MTC lateral inhibition. OB output is thus powerfully shaped by detonation-driven high-fidelity perisomatic inhibition.

                Recent work by Giusti and colleagues showed that circTulp4 modulates excitatory synaptic strength. Knocking down circTulp4 disrupts the excitation–inhibition (E/I) balance in mice and leads to hypersensitivity toward aversive stimuli.

                Quiescence is a prolonged but reversible state of cell-cycle arrest that is an adaptive feature of most adult stem cell populations. In the brain, quiescence helps to protect adult neural stem cells from stress and supports lifelong neurogenesis. Unfortunately however, entry into a quiescent or a slow-cycling state is also a malignant feature of brain cancer stem cells. In glioblastoma, where the process has been best characterised, quiescent glioma stem cells preferentially survive chemoradiation, and after therapy, reactivate to regrow the tumour and drive recurrence. In this Review, we discuss the in vitro and in vivo models that have been developed for studying neural stem cell quiescence and how these tools may be used to deepen biological understanding and to develop novel therapies targeting quiescent glioma stem cells.

">Dynamic modeling of EEG responses to natural speech reveals earlier processing of predictable words</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, it has become clear that EEG indexes the comprehension of natural, narrative speech. One particularly compelling demonstration of this fact can be seen by regressing EEG responses to speech against measures of how individual words in that speech linguistically relate to their preceding context. This approach produces a so-called temporal response function that displays a centro-parietal negativity reminiscent of the classic N400 component of the event-related potential. One shortcoming of previous implementations of this approach is that they have typically assumed a linear, time-invariant relationship between the linguistic speech features and the EEG responses. In other words, the analysis typically assumes that the response has the same shape and timing for every word - and only varies (linearly) in terms of its amplitude. In the present work, we relax this assumption under the hypothesis that responses to individual words may be processed more rapidly when they are predictable. Specifically, we introduce a framework wherein the standard linear temporal response function can be modulated in terms of its amplitude, latency, and temporal scale based on the expectedness of the current and prior words. We use the proposed approach to model EEG recorded from a set of participants who listened to an audiobook narrated by a single talker, and a separate set of participants who attended to one of two concurrently presented audiobooks. We show that expected words are processed faster - evoking lower amplitude N400-like responses with earlier peaks - and that this effect is driven both by the word's own predictability and the predictability of the immediately preceding word. Additional analysis suggests that this finding is not simply explained based on how quickly words can be disambiguated from their phonetic neighbors. As such, our study demonstrates that the timing and amplitude of brain responses to words in natural speech depend on their predictability. By accounting for these effects, our framework also improves the accuracy with which neural responses to natural speech can be modeled.

">Transcriptomically-measured gene expression predicts physiological variation across single neurons in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell transcriptomics measures the molecular landscape of individual neurons with unprecedented efficiency and scale. This insight has the potential to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of neuronal function, and to identify druggable targets for disease treatments. However, transcriptomics also suffers from greater measurement noise than traditional techniques (e.g., RT-PCR), which raises questions about its ability to offer insight into function at true single-cell resolution. We tested if transcriptomic data could yield insight into function of individual neurons in human and mouse neocortex by analyzing two datasets collected via Patch-Seq, a powerful technique for obtaining transcriptomic and physiology data from the same neuron. We found that computational models trained on single-cell transcriptomic data robustly predicted physiology of individual neurons. Critically, models trained on single cells outperformed those trained on cell type averages when predicting single-cell physiology. Thus, the standard approach of denoising single-cell transcriptomic data by averaging on cell types sacrifices functionally-relevant information. Our analysis also revealed novel relationships between gene expression and physiology, including a potential molecular substrate of human-mouse cross-species differences in the speed of single-neuron computation. Broadly, our findings highlight the promise of Patch-Seq for generating new insight into the molecular basis of neuronal function.

">Impact of intragenic NRXN1 deletions on early cortical development</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deletions in NRXN1 are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. While exonic deletions are well-studied, intragenic deletions, particularly in intron 5, are less understood and generally consider benign. Recent studies show exonic deletions impact isoform diversity during neurodevelopment, affecting neurogenesis and neuronal function. However, whether intragenic deletions impact isoform expression and neurodevelopment remains underexplored. Methods: We used hiPSCs from typically developing individuals (control) and those with NRXN1 intron 5 deletions to study neurodevelopment. HiPSCs were differentiated towards a cortical fate, with NRXN1 isoform expression, molecular differences, and neuronal morphology examined. Results: We observed distinct NRXN1 isoform expression dynamics during early neurodevelopment, with two expression peaks post-neuronal induction and NRXN1{beta} being most highly expressed. Both NRXN1 deletion and control lines showed similar acquisition of regional and cell fate identity, but significant differences in NRXN1 isoform expression were observed between deletion and control lines, and between deletion lines. RNA sequencing revealed genotype-dependent alterations, particularly in pathways related to synaptic function and neuronal morphology. Consistent with these findings, NRXN1 deletion lines exhibited altered dendrite outgrowth, with variations between deletion lines. Conclusions: Our results indicate a potential role for intron 5 in controlling NRXN1 isoform expression during neurodevelopment. Alterations in gene expression profiles, correlated with morphological changes, suggest a role for NRXN1 isoforms in shaping dendritic morphology. Molecular and cellular differences observed between lines with identical intronic deletions suggest that additional factors, such as genetic background or biological sex, may also play an important role in these phenotypes. Collectively, these findings indicate that NRXN1 intronic deletions are not benign, influencing isoform expression, cellular phenotypes, and neurodevelopment.

">A novel iPSC model of Bryant-Li-Bhoj neurodevelopmental syndrome demonstrates the role of histone H3.3 in neuronal differentiation and maturation</a></h4>

              
                Background Bryant-Li-Bhoj neurodevelopmental syndrome (BLBS) is neurogenetic disorder caused by variants in H3-3A and H3-3B, the two genes that encode the histone H3.3 protein. Ninety-nine percent of individuals with BLBS show developmental delay/intellectual disability, but the mechanism by which variants in H3.3 result in these phenotypes is not yet understood. As a result, only palliative interventions are available to individuals living with BLBS. Methods Here, we investigate how one BLBS-causative variant, H3-3B p.Leu48Arg (L48R), affects neurodevelopment using an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model differentiated to 2D neural progenitor cells (NPCs), 2D forebrain neurons (FBNs), and 3D dorsal forebrain organoids (DFBOs). We employ a multi-omic approach in the 2D models to quantify the resulting changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. We used immunofluorescence (IF) staining to define the identities of cells in the 3D DFBOs. Results In the 2D systems, we found dysregulation of both gene expression and chromatin accessibility of genes important for neuronal fate, maturation, and function in H3.3 L48R compared to control. Our work in 3D organoids corroborates these findings, demonstrating altered proportions of radial glia and mature neuronal cells. Conclusions These data provide the first mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of BLBS from a human-derived model of neurodevelopment, which suggest that the L48R increases H3-3B expression, resulting in the hyper-deposition of H3.3 into the nucleosome which underlies changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Functionally, this causes dysregulation of cell adhesion, neurotransmission, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling. These results are a crucial step towards preclinical development and testing of targeted therapies for this and related disorders.

">Using Dual-Coil TMS-EEG to Probe Bilateral Brain Mechanisms in Healthy Aging and Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                Background: A widespread observation in the cognitive neuroscience of aging is that older adults show a more bilateral pattern of task-related brain activation. These observations are based on inherently correlational approaches. The current study represents a targeted assessment of the role of bilaterality using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Objective: We used a novel bilateral TMS-stimulation paradigm, applied to a group of healthy older adults (hOA) and older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with two aims: First, to elucidate the neurophysiological effects of bilateral neuromodulation, and second to provide insight into the neurophysiological basis of bilateral brain interactions. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants received six forms of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): unilateral and bilateral rTMS trains at an alpha (8 Hz) and beta (18 Hz) frequency, as well as two sham conditions (unilateral, bilateral) mimicking the sounds of TMS. Results: First, time-frequency analyses of oscillatory power induced by TMS revealed that unilateral beta rTMS elicited rhythmic entrainment of cortical oscillations at the same beta-band frequency. Second, both bilateral alpha and bilateral beta stimulation induced a widespread reduction of alpha power. Lastly, healthy older adults showed greater TMS-related reductions in alpha power in response to bilateral rTMS compared to the MCI cohort. Conclusion: Overall, these results demonstrate frequency-specific responses to bilateral rTMS in the aging brain, and provide support for inhibitory models of hemispheric interaction across multiple frequency bands.

">Natural Language Processing Applied to Spontaneous Recall of Famous Faces Reveals Memory Dysfunction in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients</a></h4>

              
                Objective and Background. Epilepsy patients rank memory problems as their most significant cognitive comorbidity. Current clinical assessments are laborious to administer and score and may not always detect subtle memory decline. The Famous Faces Task (FF) has robustly demonstrated that left temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) patients remember fewer names and biographical details compared to right TLE (RTLE) patients and healthy controls (HCs). We adapted the FF task to capture subjects' entire spontaneous spoken recall, then scored responses using manual and natural language processing (NLP) methods. We expected to replicate previous group level differences using spontaneous speech and semi-automated analysis. Methods. Seventy-three (N=73) adults (28 LTLE, 18 RTLE, and 27 HCs) were included in a case-control prospective study design. Twenty FF in politics, sports, and entertainment (active 2008-2017) were shown to subjects, who were asked if they could recognize and spontaneously recall as much biographical detail as possible. We created human-generated and automatically-generated keyword dictionaries for each celebrity, based on a randomly selected training set of half of the HC transcripts. To control for speech output, we measured the speech duration, total word count and content word count for the FF task and a Cookie Theft Control Task (CTT), in which subjects were merely asked to describe a visual scene. Subjects' responses to FF and CTT tasks were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed in a blinded manner with a combination of manual and automated NLP approaches. Results. Famous face recognition accuracy was similar between groups. LTLE patients recalled fewer biographical details compared to HCs and RTLEs using both the gold-standard human-generated dictionary (24%+/-12% vs. 31%+/-12% and 30%+/-12%, p=0.007) and the automated dictionary (24%+/-12% vs. 31%+/-12% and 32%+/-13%, p=0.007). There were no group level differences in speech duration, total word count, or content word count for either the FF and CTT to explain difference in recall performance. There was a positive, statistically significant relationship between MOCA score and FF recall performance as scored by the human-generated (rho = .327, p= .029) and automatically-generated dictionaries (rho = .422, p= .004) for TLE subjects, but not HCs, an effect that was driven by LTLE subjects. Discussion. LTLE patients remember fewer details of famous people than HCs or RTLE patients, as discovered by NLP analysis of spontaneous recall. Decreased biographical memory was not due to decreased speech output and correlated with lower MOCA scores. NLP analysis of spontaneous recall can detect memory dysfunction in clinical populations in a semi-automated, objective, and sensitive manner.

">Investigating microscopic angioarchitecture in the human visual cortex in 3D with angioMASH tissue clearing and labelling</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive imaging techniques, such as ultra-high field fMRI, are intricately connected to the underlying vasculature and are approaching ever higher resolutions. For the analysis of fMRI signals over cortical depth at such high resolutions, microvascular differences might have to be taken into account. Therefore, a better understanding of the laminar distribution and interareal differences in the cortical vasculature is becoming more important. However, in comparison to cyto- and myeloarchitecture, the study of angioarchitecture has received far less attention and relatively few methods have been described to visualise the vascular network in the human brain. Here we present angioMASH, a method for double labelling angioarchitecture and cytoarchitecture in archival human brain tissue, based on the cytoarchitecture labelling and optical clearing of the recently published MASH protocol. The double labelling and optical clearing of thick human brain slices can be accomplished within 16 days. We use this method to acquire multi-resolution 3D datasets of combined cyto- and angioarchitecture in large human samples covering visual areas V1 and V2. We demonstrate for the first time, that classical angioarchitectonic features can be visualised in the human cortex and in 3D using tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy. Lastly, we show differences in the vessel density and orientation over cortical depth within and between the two areas. Especially in V1, the vascular density is not homogeneous over cortical depth, but shows distinct layering. These layers are also determined by changes in the orientation of the blood vessels from a predominantly radial to a more tangential distribution. In V2, differences in vascular density are less pronounced, but orientation profiles follow a similar trend over cortical depth. We discuss potential consequences of these differences for the interpretation of non-invasive functional imaging modalities such as fMRI or fNIRS.

">Progressive changes in functional connectivity between thalamic nuclei and cortical networks across learning</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is connected to cerebral cortex and subcortical regions, serving as a node within cognitive networks. It is a heterogeneous structure formed of functionally distinct nuclei with unique connectivity patterns. However, their contributions to cognitive functioning within networks is poorly understood. Recent animal research suggests that thalamic nuclei such as the mediodorsal nucleus play critical roles in goal-directed behaviour. Our aim was to investigate how functional integration of thalamic nuclei within cortical and subcortical networks changes whilst transitioning from more controlled goal-directed behaviour towards more automatic or habitual behaviour in humans. We analysed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a stimulus-response learning study to investigate functional connectivity (FC) changes across learning between thalamic nuclei with cortical networks and subcortical structures in healthy subjects. We defined subcortical regions-of-interest (ROIs) individually in native space, segmenting the thalamus into 47 nuclei and segmenting 38 subregions within the basal ganglia and hippocampus. Additionally, we defined 12 cerebral cortex ROIs via maximum-probability network templates. Learning-related connectivity changes were examined via ROI-to-ROI functional network analysis. Our results showed that learning was associated with: 1) decreasing FC between the frontoparietal network and higher order thalamic nuclei; 2) increasing FC between the cingulo-opercular network and pulvinar nuclei, 3) decreasing FC between the default mode network (DMN) and right mediodorsal nuclei; 4) increasing FC between the DMN and left mediodorsal nuclei, and 5) increasing intrathalamic FC. Together, this suggests that several thalamic nuclei are involved in the learning-related transition from controlled to more automatic behaviour.

">EEG Correlates of Cognitive Dynamics in Task Resumption after Interruptions: The Impact of Available Time and Flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Interruptions are a common aspect of everyday working life, negatively affecting both task performance and long-term psychological well-being. However, research suggests that the effects of interruptions can be mitigated in several ways, such as the opportunity to anticipate the interruptions and preparation time. Here, we used a retrospective visual working memory task to investigate the effects of duration and flexible resumption after interruptions, with 28 participants (18-30 years old) attending the experiment. For this main task participants were required to remember the orientations of a set of colored bars and retrieve one at the end of the trial in response to a retro-cue. This task was sometimes interrupted with an arithmetic task that was presented before the retro-cue. The period after the interruptions and the retro-cue was either short (no additional time), long (additional 1000 ms), or self-determined. Interruptions affected the main task performance irrespective of duration condition, while response times were shorter with the flexible condition. EEG analysis showed that having more time before resuming the interrupted task enabled stronger beta suppression which in turn modulated task performance, helping participants to safely disengage from the interrupting task, and refocus their attention back more efficiently. Further, flexibility in the timing of resumption provided additional benefits as seen in stronger oscillatory alpha and beta suppression to the retro-cue, also being related to better task performance. These results demonstrate the important role of resumption time and individual flexibility in dealing with interruptions.

">Spatiotemporal Decomposition of Whole-Brain Alpha Traveling Waves</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneously emerging traveling waves are present within the spatiotemporal patterns of alpha-band EEG oscillations, but current analysis methods are limited in parsing the diversity of global wave structures and their correlation with brain functions. To address this limitation, we constructed a rigorous mathematical framework, Weakly Orthogonal Conjugate Contrast Analysis (WOCCA), which decomposes the whole-brain EEG alpha oscillations into directionally independent traveling waves. For the first time, we systematically characterized propagating components in alpha-band resting-state EEG as a combination of rotational, longitudinal, and horizontal traveling wave patterns. The intensity, directionality, and morphological characteristics of these wave patterns account for the differences between cognitive states during rest and consciousness levels under sedation. Moreover, our WOCCA decomposition encompassed the state transition dynamics captured by EEG Microstate Analysis, a conventional analysis framework for alpha waves. These results not only established a novel approach for identifying and analyzing traveling waves but also provided evidence for the relationship between wave directionality and cooperative interactions in brain network.

">Motion correction with subspace-based self-navigation for combined angiography, perfusion and structural imaging</a></h4>

              
                Motion artifacts are problematic in many MRI modalities. Self-navigating approaches are desirable, since no additional scan time or hardware is required. However, the generation of a navigator image, to estimate and correct motion, is difficult in cases where the tissue contrast is changing during the navigator acquisition window, such as in magnetization-prepared methods. Here we propose a subspace approach to reconstruct accurate navigators in the presence of time-varying tissue contrast and apply it to a combined angiography, perfusion and structural imaging method using a golden ratio 3D cones trajectory. This arterial spin labeling-based pulse sequence relies on subtraction of label and control images to isolate the relatively weak blood signal, making it particularly susceptible to motion corruption. An inversion pulse leads to time-varying tissue contrast across the readout train, but by reconstructing subspace coefficient maps directly, artifacts due to the varying contrast were alleviated. This resulted in high-quality navigator images that were subsequently registered to estimate and correct for motion. In addition, a split-update method was proposed to efficiently reconstruct from mismatched label/control k-space data with locally low rank regularization enforced on the difference image. The correction process was tested with numerical simulation and in vivo data from 8 healthy subjects with and without cued motion. In numerical simulation, the subspace-based navigator achieved an 84% reduction in RMSE of residual motion compared to without motion correction. In vivo, motion correction resulted in noise-like and background artifacts being greatly reduced and vessel sharpness being noticeably improved. Correlation of angiography, perfusion and structural images with motion-free reference images also increased by 159%, 53% and 12%, respectively, after motion correction. These results show that subspace-based navigators can effectively improve the motion robustness of MR imaging in contrast-varying acquisitions.

">A sleep disturbance method by novel objects in the home cage to minimize stress</a></h4>

              
                Background The increasing prevalence of low sleep quality is a significant issue, particularly among adolescents, necessitating a deeper understanding of its biological consequences. In sleep research, various protocols are used for sleep deprivation or disturbance, each presenting its own set of confounding factors crucial to consider. New Method We developed a standardized seven-day sleep disturbance (SD) protocol using daily four-hour exposures to novel objects to minimize rodent stress. Objects were selected and characterized for wake-promoting properties, and exposure timing was structured to reduce variability and enhance experimental reliability and reproducibility. Results During the four hours of SD, the mice were efficiently sleep-deprived on the first and seventh day of SD. Thus, the selected objects efficiently sleep restricted the mice. On the first day of SD, the protocol induced sleep deprivation effect when measured over 24h, but by the seventh day, the mice recovered the sleep loss. Thus, this method is a sub-chronic sleep disturbance and not sleep deprivation. Fecal corticosterone concentrations remained unchanged during the seven days of SD. Comparison with existing methods This approach reduced the risk of stress through voluntary rather than forced wakefulness. Previously, novel objects have been exchanged randomly during mouse sleep initiation causing protocol variability and very frequent disturbances. Our protocol minimizes this by introducing the novel object in a structured manner. Conclusion We effectively disturbed the sleep of the mice during seven days without inflicting substantial stress. We further demonstrate the value of validating the efficiency of an SD protocol with 24h recordings.

">Exploring the role of the rich club in network control of neurocognitive states</a></h4>

              
                We present a systematic analysis of the rich club as a possible control center of brain dynamics. Contrary to research stressing control properties of the rich club, our results indicate that the rich club and high-degree regions were not involved in optimally controlling the human connectome for a set of data-driven and task-evoked patterns of activity. Indeed, low-degree peripheral regions were more suited towards this. Findings were stable across group-level and individual-level rich club definitions, various cognitively meaningful brain state transitions, and different parameter settings. A region's contribution to optimal control processes was associated with its affiliation with certain intrinsic connectivity networks and its position on the secondary, but not primary, cortical gradient. These results do not negate an integratory role of the rich club, but merely question its proposed role as a driver of control. Indeed, if it would inhabit such a role, we would have expected opposite results. Our findings fit with a position describing the rich club as a passive "data-highway" which, by means of its high connectivity, can be easily controlled by peripheral regions and thus facilitate relevant communication channels between them. We call for methodological expansions of the control theoretical toolbox allowing for elaborations on the temporal dynamics of control processes.

">Simultaneous GCaMP imaging and focal recording of tonic and phasic synapses: Probing short-term plasticity within a defined microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                GCaMP fluorescence has been widely used to monitor intracellular Ca2+. However, the physiological significance of the GCaMP signal in presynaptic terminals remains to be further elucidated. We investigated how the dynamics of GCaMP signals correlates with the activity dependence of short-term plasticity in synaptic transmission. We devised a local manipulation protocol that minimizes interference from muscular contraction during simultaneous Ca2+ imaging and focal recording at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where the tonic and phasic excitatory synapses can be compared side-by-side. By confining the local ionic microenvironment, this protocol enabled stable measurements across extended concentration ranges of Ca2+ or Sr2+ in saline. Compared to tonic synapses, phasic synapses displayed stronger GCaMP signals, along with faster facilitation and more severe depression. Upon repetitive stimulation (40 Hz), facilitation of transmission occurred during or immediately prior to the early rising phase (0.25 s) of the GCaMP signal, which could subsequently convert into a depression phase of transmission decline, most evident during a steeper and longer rise of GCaMP signals in higher Ca2+ saline. Typically, deepest depression occurred when GCaMP signals rose to a plateau. Phasic synapses with stronger GCaMP signal and deeper depression, more often exhibited lingering post-stimulation releases. In both tonic and phasic synapses, replacing Ca2+ with Sr2+ induced extreme asynchronous transmission coupled with post-stimulation lingering releases during the decay of GCaMP signals. Further applications of this focal recording-local manipulation protocol may help to probe additional mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission and plasticity.

">The role of protein shape in multiphasic separation within condensates</a></h4>

              
                Liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biological macromolecules leads to the formation of various membraneless organelles. LLPS can not only form homogenous condensates but also multilayered and multiphase condensates, which can mediate complex cellular functions. However, the factors that determine the topological features of multiphase condensates are not fully understood. Herein, we focused on Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a major postsynaptic protein that undergoes various forms of LLPS with other postsynaptic proteins, and present a minimalistic computational model that reproduces these forms of LLPS, including a form of two phase condensates, phase in phase (PIP) organization. Analyses of this model revealed that the competitive binding of two types of client proteins is required for the PIP formation. The PIP only formed when CaMKII had high valency and a short linker length. Such CaMKII proteins exhibited a low surface tension, a modular structure, and slow diffusion. These properties are consistent with the functions required by CaMKII to store information at the synaptic level. Thus, the computational modeling reveals new structure function relationships for CaMKII as a synaptic memory unit.

">Intra-individual variability in the effects of transcranial directcurrent stimulation on free choice saccade behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used as a tool to causally influence neural activity in humans non-invasively. Although most studies recruit a large number of participants in order to uncover population-level effects, growing evidence suggests that tDCS may be expected to induce different effects in different individuals, leading to large inter-individual variability and confounds in population-level testing. Alternatively, this variability may arise from intra-individual sources that are difficult to assess in standard designs. Here, we performed between 8 and 10 sessions of tDCS within individuals to understand how intra-individual variability impacts the inference of tDCS effects. We recruited 5 participants who underwent functional MRI to localize the human frontal eye field (FEF) homologue. An HD-tDCS montage was used to stimulate the target location based on individual MRI localizations, alternating the polarity between anodal or cathodal current over 8-10 repeated sessions during a 5 week period. Participants performed a free choice task before and after stimulation while recording EEG activity. We then developed a difference-in-difference method based on permutation testing to assess the likelihood of a causal effect of tDCS at different levels of abstraction: group-level, inter-individual, and intra-individual. At the group-level, we found evidence for an influence of tDCS on choice reaction times, which followed a reaction-time dependent change in alpha-band activity, and on how choices depended on recent history. However, individuals showed heterogeneous, and often contradictory, effects. We then analyzed the distribution of session permutations at the intra-individual level, and found a discrepancy between the inter-individual effects that survived significance testing and the intra-individual effects that correlated on a session-session basis. We argue that, while the observed variability may have arisen from a combination of inter and intra-individual differences relevant to tDCS-dependent mechanisms of action, it may be equally well explained by spurious effects arising from history-dependence between repeated measures that are typically assumed to be independent. In light of this, we assess the counterfactuals that must be evaluated in order to make data-driven inferences about the causal effects of tDCS on free choice behaviour and its neural correlates.

">Perception/action coupling in children with autism: insights from looking time and pupil dilation measurements</a></h4>

              
                The objective of this study was to characterize, through indices extracted from eye-tracking measurements, the spontaneous distinction of videos of daily actions with a variable perception/action coupling, depending on whether, for the same action, the video was presented in the forward reading direction (strong coupling), or in the backward reading direction (weaker coupling). 17 pairs of videos of daily actions performed by adults were viewed by 36 typically developing children and 28 children with ASD aged 7-18 years. During the exposure phase, they watched two videos of the same action (forward and backward) presented successively, before looking at these two videos in competition, in a second visual preference phase. During the exposure phase, all participants paid similar general attention to each of the videos. We found greater pupillary dilation for backward than forward actions in both groups, but significantly less in the ASD group. In the visual preference phase, both groups showed significantly greater looking times for backward actions over forward ones, with no difference between groups. If TD children perceived the kinematics of the backward videos as violating their expectations given the strong perception/action coupling they had already built over that action, on the contrary, the lower increased in pupil dilation found in ASD children could reflect altered perception/action coupling. This study confirms the validity of looking time and pupil dilation as behavioral and physiological markers that could be used in a 10-mn eye-tracking test to explore perception/action coupling in childhood and in ASD.

">A Tale of Two Environments: Divisive Normalization and the (In)Flexibility of Choice</a></h4>

              
                The Divisive Normalization (DN) function has been described as a 'canonical neural computation' in the brain that achieves efficient representations of sensory and choice stimuli. Recent theoretical work indicates that it efficiently encodes a specific class of Pareto-distributed stimuli. Does the brain shift to different encoding functions in other types of environments, or is there evidence for DN encoding in other types of environments? In this paper, using a within-subject choice experiment, we show evidence of the latter. Our subjects made decisions in two distinct choice environments with choice sets either drawn from a Pareto distribution or from a uniform distribution. Our results indicate that subjects' choices are better described by a divisive coding strategy in both environments. Moreover, subjects appeared to calibrate a DN function to match, as closely as possible, the actual statistical properties of each environment. These results suggest that the nervous system may be constrained to use divisive representations under all conditions.

">Repetitive neonatal pain increases spinal cord DNA methylation of the μ-opioid receptor</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive neonatal painful procedures experienced in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are known to alter the development of the nociceptive system and have long-lasting consequences, notably lower post-operative -opioid receptor levels in the spinal cord. Given the influence of the NICU on the epigenome, the present study hypothesized that neonatal procedural pain alters the DNA methylation status of the opioid receptor mu 1 encoding gene (Mor-1) in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglions (DRGs). To this end, the needle prick model of repetitive neonatal pain was used, and methylation of Mor-1 promotor was assessed in the spinal cord and the DRG using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Our findings demonstrated that neonatal procedural pain increased spinal cord Mor-1 promotor DNA methylation in the ipsilateral side as compared to the contralateral side, an effect that was not observed in the control animals, nor in the DRG. We also identified a behaviorally-associated CpG site following neonatal needle pricks. This study is the first to highlight a localized and noxious-stimuli-dependent effect of repetitive neonatal procedural pain on Mor-1 promotor methylation and emphasizes the need to explore the effects of repetitive neonatal procedural pain on the epigenome.

">Metastable Dynamics Emerge from Local Excitatory-Inhibitory Homeostasis in the Cortex at Rest</a></h4>

              
                The human cortex displays highly metastable dynamics at rest, underlying the spontaneous exploration of large-scale network states. This metastability depends on edge-of-bifurcation dynamics at the circuit level, which emerge due to the local control of firing rates through multiple mechanisms of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) homeostasis. However, it is unclear how the distinct forms of homeostasis contribute to the metastability of large-scale cortical networks. Here, we propose that individual mechanisms of E-I homeostasis contribute uniquely to the emergence of metastable dynamics and resting-state functional networks and test that hypothesis in a large-scale model of the human cortex. We show that empirical networks and dynamics can only be reproduced when accounting for multiple mechanisms of E-I homeostasis. More specifically, while the homeostasis of excitation and inhibition enhances metastability, the complementary regulation of intrinsic excitability ensures moderate levels of synchrony, maximizing the complexity of functional networks. Furthermore, the modulation of distance-to-bifurcation by the homeostasis of excitation and intrinsic excitability supports collective dynamics by compensating for strong input fluctuations in strongly connected areas. Altogether, our results show that cortical networks self-organize toward maximal metastability through the multi-factor homeostatic regulation of E-I balance, which controls local edge-of-bifurcation dynamics. Therefore, the functional benefits of combining multiple homeostatic mechanisms transcend the circuit level, supporting the rich spontaneous dynamics of large-scale cortical networks.

">NeuroAtlas: An Artificial Intelligence-based Framework for Annotation, Segmentation and Registration of Large Scale Biomedical Imaging Data</a></h4>

              
                With increasing neuroimaging modalities and data diversity, mapping brain regions to a standard atlas template has become a challenging problem. Machine learning in general and deep learning, in particular, have been providing robust solutions for several neuroimaging tasks, including brain image registration and segmentation. However, these methods require a large amount of data for ground-truth labels, annotated by human experts, which is time-consuming. In this work, we introduce NeuroAtlas, an AI-based framework for atlas generation and brain region segmentation. We showcase an end-to-end solution for brain registration and segmentation by providing i) a deep learning modeling suite with a variety of high-performing model architectures to map a brain atlas onto the input brain section and ii) a Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based plugin for large-scale data annotation with a feature of modifying the predicted labels for active learning. We demonstrate a robust performance of our framework on the human brains, captured through various imaging modalities and age groups, and demonstrate its application for mouse brains as well. NeuroAtlas tool will be open-sourced and entirely compatible with both local as well as cloud-based computing so that users can easily adapt to their neuroimaging custom datasets.

">Validating genuine changes in Heartbeat Evoked Potentials using Pseudotrials and Surrogate Procedures</a></h4>

              
                The brain continuously receives interoceptive information about the state and function of our internal organs. For instance, each time the heart beats, the brain responds by generating time-locked activity, known as heartbeat evoked potentials (HEP). When investigating HEPs, it is essential to adequately control for heartbeat-independent confounding activity to avoid false interpretation. In the present study, we highlight the pitfalls of uncontrolled analyses and advocate for the use of surrogate heartbeat analysis and pseudotrial correction, which are promising tools to control for spurious results. Surrogate heartbeat analysis involves shuffling the timing of heartbeats to verify the time-locking of HEP effects. Pseudotrial correction works by subtracting heartbeat-independent activity from HEPs. In this study we employ both procedures, validate them in simulations and apply them to real EEG data. Using EEG recordings obtained during the performance of an auditory novelty oddball task in a large population, we show that, without control analyses, pre-stimulus HEPs appear inversely related to task-related measures such as P300 event-related potential amplitudes and reaction time speed. However, these effects disappear after carefully controlling for heartbeat-unrelated EEG activity. Additionally, in real and simulated data, we show that pseudotrial correction has the potential to remove task-related confounds from HEPs, thereby uncovering real heartbeat-related effects that otherwise could be missed. This study therefore highlights issues that can arise when analyzing HEPs during tasks, provides solutions to overcome them, and gives recommendations for future studies to avoid pitfalls when analyzing and designing behavioral paradigms with HEPs.

">Segment AnyNeuron</a></h4>

              
                Image segmentation plays an integral part in neuroimage analysis and is crucial for understanding brain disorders. Deep Learning (DL) models have shown exponential success in computer vision tasks over the years, including image segmentation. However, to achieve optimal performance, DL models require extensive annotated data for training, which is often the bottleneck to expediting brain-wide image analysis. For segmenting cellular structures such as neurons, the annotation process is cumbersome and time-consuming due to the inherent structural, intensity, and background variations present in the data caused by genetic markers, imaging techniques, etc. We propose an Active Learning-based neuron segmentation framework (Segment AnyNeuron), which incorporates state-of-the-art image segmentation modules - Detectron2 and HQ SAM, and requires minimal ground truth annotation to achieve high precision for brain-wide segmentation of neurons. Our framework can classify and segment completely unseen neuronal data by selecting the most representative samples for manual annotation, thus avoiding the cold-start problem common in Active Learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for automated brain-wide segmentation of neurons on a variety of open-source neuron imaging datasets, acquired from different scanners and a variety of transgenic mouse lines.

">Structural and functional dissection of the Pacinian corpuscle reveals an active role of the inner core in touch detection</a></h4>

              
                Pacinian corpuscles are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptor end-organs that detect transient touch and high-frequency vibration. In the prevailing model, these properties are determined by the outer core, which acts as a mechanical filter limiting static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal-the sole site of touch detection in corpuscles. Here, we determine the detailed 3D architecture of corpuscular components and reveal their contribution to touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for rapid adaptation and frequency tuning. Instead, these properties arise from the inner core, composed of gap junction-coupled lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs) surrounding the afferent terminal. By acting as additional touch sensing structures, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast-inactivating ion channels. We propose a model in which Pacinian corpuscle function is mediated by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.

">Chronic intermittent alcohol yields sex-specific disruptions in cortical-striatal-limbic oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Background: While the neurobiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been extensively researched, the vast majority of these studies included only male organisms. However, there are significant sex differences in both the causes and consequences of alcohol misuse and dependence, suggesting sex-specific neurobiological mechanisms. The current study used a rodent model to determine whether chronic alcohol exposure impacts sex-specific neural circuits, and whether these changes contribute to the development of alcohol misuse. Methods: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer 10% alcohol before implanting bilateral electrodes into the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL), nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Half of the rats were then exposed to four weeks of chronic intermittent alcohol (CIA) vapor (14 hours on/10 hours off). During acute withdrawal (6-8 after the vapor turns off), local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the IL, NAcSh, and CeA during 30-minute self-administration sessions. Using an unbiased machine learning approach, we built predictive models to determine whether/which LFP features could distinguish CIA-exposed from control rats in each sex, as well as if any of these LFP features correlated with rates of alcohol self-administration. Results: Female rats self-administered more alcohol in general compared to males, but only males exposed to CIA showed increased alcohol intake during acute withdrawal. LFPs predicted CIA exposure in both sexes better than chance estimates, but models built on IL and NAcSh oscillations performed the best in males, while models built on IL and CeA LFPs performed best in females. High {gamma} LFPs recorded in the NAcSh correlated with rates of alcohol self-administration in males exposed to CIA, while only left-right NAcSh {beta} coherence correlated with drinking in control females. Conclusions: These data provide support for the hypothesis that the neural circuits driving alcohol dependence development are sex-specific, and that high frequency oscillations in the NAcSh may be related to the increased drinking observed in males exposed to CIA. Overall, these data add to our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings behind the sex differences observed in AUD and offer promising biomarkers for future therapeutic research.

">Glymphatic clearance is enhanced during sleep</a></h4>

              
                A recent publication questioned the existing literature by reporting that glymphatic clearance is enhanced by wakefulness. We show here that this is an erroneous conclusion, in that it was based on the assumption that tracer infusion is independent of the brain activity state. Utilizing dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and fluorescent fiber photometry, we report that less tracer enters the brains of awake animals, such that after adjusting for the injected tracer dose, brain glymphatic clearance is found to be enhanced by both sleep and anesthesia, and sharply suppressed by wakefulness.

">SynPull: a novel method for studying neurodegeneration-related aggregates in synaptosomes using super-resolution microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic dysfunction is one of the primary hallmarks of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, leading to cognitive and behavioural decline. While alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and tau are involved in the physiological functioning of synapses, their pathological aggregation has been linked to synaptic dysfunction. However, the methodology for studying the small (sub-diffraction limit) and soluble aggregates -often called oligomers, formed by these proteins is limited. Here we describe SynPull, a novel method combining single-molecule pulldown, super-resolution microscopy, and advanced computational analyses, in order to reliably study the quantity and morphology of the oligomeric alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, and AT8-positive tau aggregates in synaptosomes harvested from post-mortem human brain samples and mouse models. Using SynPull, we show that AT8-positive tau is the predominant aggregate type in AD, with significantly more aggregates compared to the control samples, yet the aggregate size does not differ between disease and control samples. Meanwhile, the relatively smaller amount of alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid aggregates found in the synapses are larger than the extra-synaptic ones. Collectively, these results show the utility of SynPull to study pathological aggregates in dementia, which can help further understand the disease mechanisms causing synaptic dysfunction.

">Lamellar Schwann cells in the Pacinian corpuscle potentiate vibration perception</a></h4>

              
                Pacinian corpuscles are among the most sensitive mechanoreceptors found in vertebrates and they are tuned to vibrations in the highest perceptible frequency range (100-2000Hz). One of their anatomical hallmarks is the onion-like cell layers surrounding the central axon. The innermost layers consist of ~60 densely packed lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), whose function remains largely unknown. Using high-resolution 3D electron microscopy we found that LSCs in Pacinian corpuscles of the mouse hindlimb do not form concentric rings, but complex, multilayered and intertwining assemblies that are connected via an estimated 5805.1 desmosomes and 4142.5 gap-junctions. LSCs make multiple converging contacts with the afferent axon and its protrusions with desmosomes. Using optogenetic manipulations of LSCs we demonstrate that their activation does not only drive reliable time-locked spiking in the axon, but that their inactivation significantly elevates the thresholds in-situ and increases perceptual thresholds behaviorally. Together these findings provide evidence that LSCs are a key element of somatosensory processing, actively potentiating mechanosensitivity in Pacinian corpuscles.

">Neurons as biosensors for discriminating neurological disorders in a brain-on-chip platform: Application to Alzheimer s Disease using patient CSF</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of aggregated amyloid beta peptide (A{beta}) leading to progressive neuronal loss and dysfunction. Current AD diagnosis involves biomarkers assays in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as A{beta} to validate the diagnosis. However, these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and can result in inaccurate diagnoses by not accounting for differential diagnose. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring new technologies for detecting AD biomarkers in biological fluids, though progress is hindered by an incomplete understanding of AD mechanisms and CSF composition. In this study, we used a standardized microfluidic platform to investigate the effects of synthetic A{beta} peptides and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD and healthy patients on neuronal functional activity. First, human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were characterized. Then, to modulate the functional activity of neurons, tetrodotoxin (TTX), a specific sodium channel blocker, was used as a control for inhibiting neuronal activity. Subsequently, glutamatergic neurons were chronically exposed to A{beta}O and patients CSF. MEA recordings were performed before and after the treatments to assess changes in network activity. Our results demonstrated that extracting key electrophysiological metrics allows for discrimination between healthy and AD CSF samples. This system could offer the potential for differential diagnosis and development of personalized therapeutic strategies.

">Functional imaging and connectome analyses reveal organizing principles of taste circuits in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Taste is crucial for many innate and learned behaviors. In the fly, taste impacts feeding, oviposition, locomotion, mating, and memory formation, to name a few. These diverse roles may necessitate the apparent distributed nature of taste responses across different circuits in the fly brain, leading to complexity that has hindered attempts to deduce unifying principles of taste processing and coding. Here, we combine information from the whole brain connectome with functional calcium imaging to examine the neural representation of taste at early steps of processing. We find that the representation of taste quality remains largely segregated in cholinergic and GABAergic local interneurons (LNs) that are directly postsynaptic to taste sensory neurons of the labellum. Although some taste projection neurons (TPNs) projecting to superior protocerebrum receive direct inputs from sensory neurons, many receive primarily indirect taste inputs via cholinergic LNs. Moreover, we found that cholinergic interneurons appear to function as nodes to convey feedforward information to dedicated sets of morphologically similar TPNs. Examining a small number of representative TPNs suggests that taste information remains mostly segregated at this level as well. Together, these studies suggest a previously unappreciated logic in the organization of fly taste circuits.

	<p>This study investigates the protective effects of magnesium sulfate on dopamine neurons in the retinas of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Rapidly progressing cognitive decline often precedes or coincides with the motor symptoms associated with PD. PD patients also frequently exhibit visual function abnormalities. However, the specific mechanisms underlying visual dysfunction in PD patients are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether magnesium homeostasis affects dopaminergic neurons in the retina of PD rats. Thirty-six rats were divided into four groups: (1) control, (2) control with magnesium sulfate (control/MgSO4), (3) Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and (4) Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease with magnesium sulfate (PD/MgSO4). The apomorphine-induced (APO) rotation test assessed the success of the PD models. The open-field experiment measured the rats&amp;amp;rsquo; anxiety levels. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glutamate levels, indicators of dopamine neuron survival, were detected using immunofluorescence staining. Protein levels of solute carrier family 41 A1 (SCL41A1), magnesium transporter 1 (MagT1), and cyclin M2 (CNNM2) in the retina were analyzed using Western blot. Results showed that, compared to the PD group, rats in the PD/MgSO4 group had improved psychological states and motor performance at two and four weeks post-surgery. The PD/MgSO4 group also exhibited significantly higher TH fluorescence intensity in the left retinas and lower glutamate fluorescence intensity than the PD group. Additional experiments indicated that the protein levels of SLC41A1, MagT1, and CNNM2 were generally higher in the retinas of the PD/MgSO4 group, along with an increase in retinal magnesium ion content. This suggests that magnesium sulfate may reduce glutamate levels and protect dopamine neurons in the retina. Thus, magnesium sulfate might have therapeutic potential for visual functional impairments in PD patients.</p>

	<p>This study examines the feasibility of using event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings as biomarkers for long-term memory item classification. Previous studies have identified old/new effects in memory paradigms associated with explicit long-term memory and familiarity. Recent advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled the classification of ERP trials under different conditions and the identification of features related to neural processes at the single-trial level. We employed this approach to compare three CNN models with distinct architectures using experimental data. Participants (N = 25) performed an association memory task while recording ERPs that were used for training and validation of the CNN models. The EEGNET-based model achieved the most reliable performance in terms of precision, recall, and specificity compared with the shallow and deep convolutional approaches. The classification accuracy of this model reached 62% for known items and 66% for unknown items. Good overall accuracy requires a trade-off between recall and specificity and depends on the architecture of the model and the dataset size. These results suggest the possibility of integrating ERP and CNN into online learning tools and identifying the underlying processes related to long-term memorization.</p>

	<p>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is the most common four-repeat tauopathy. PSP cases are typically characterized by vertical gaze palsy and postural instability; however, various phenotypes have been reported, making antemortem diagnosis based on clinical symptoms challenging. The development of biomarkers reflecting brain pathology and the ability to diagnose patients based on these biomarkers are essential for developing future intervention strategies, including disease-modifying therapies. However, despite many dedicated efforts, no highly specific fluid biomarker for PSP has yet been established. Conversely, several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) have been established, and an AT(N) classification system has been proposed. Typically, among patients with AD, CSF amyloid &amp;amp;beta;42 (A&amp;amp;beta;42), but not A&amp;amp;beta;40, is decreased, resulting in a reduction in the A&amp;amp;beta;42/A&amp;amp;beta;40 ratio, while tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and total tau (t-tau) are increased. Interestingly, the core CSF AD biomarkers show unique patterns in patients with PSP. Furthermore, reports have indicated that the CSF levels of both A&amp;amp;beta;42 and A&amp;amp;beta;40 are decreased independently of A&amp;amp;beta; accumulation in PSP. Therefore, the A&amp;amp;beta;42/A&amp;amp;beta;40 ratio could potentially be used to differentiate PSP from AD. Additionally, studies have reported that CSF p-tau and t-tau are reduced in PSP, and that the neurofilament light chain is remarkably increased compared to healthy controls and patients with AD, even though PSP is a neurodegenerative disease associated with tau accumulation. These PSP-specific changes in AD-related core biomarkers may reflect the pathology of PSP and contribute to its diagnosis. As such, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the observed decreases in A&amp;amp;beta; and tau levels could facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PSP.</p>

	<p>The presence of anxiety in individuals with epilepsy significantly influences their medical treatment and quality of life and often goes unrecognized or untreated, posing a challenge to differential diagnosis. The study aimed to investigate the influence of epilepsy characteristics on anxiety. The research involved 155 patients with generalized and focal drug-sensitive [DSE] and drug-resistant [DRE] epilepsy. Hamilton anxiety rating scale [HAS] was used to assess the symptoms of anxiety at three time points [baseline, 12, and 18 months]. DSE patients exhibited significantly lower HAM-A scores than patients with DRE at the initial visit [p = 0.000] after 12 [p = 0.000] and 18-month follow-up [p = 0.000]. Focal DRE patients presented higher HAM-A scores than focal DSE patients in the initial visit [p = 0.000] after 12 [p = 0.000] and 18 months [p = 0.000]. Medication responsiveness, seizure type, and illness duration emerged as significant anxiety predictors [p = 0.000]. After 18 months of follow-up, significant contributors to anxiety were drug responsivity and illness duration [p = 0.000]. The occurrence of anxiety in epilepsy patients is most significantly influenced by well-controlled epilepsy and a positive response to medication.</p>

	<p>Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is the result of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to follow and entrain its oscillatory activity to the phase and frequency of periodic auditory stimulation. Gamma-band ASSR has been increasingly investigated with intentions to apply it in neuropsychiatric disorders diagnosis as well as in brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface technologies. However, it is still debatable whether attention can influence ASSR, as the results of the attention effects of ASSR are equivocal. In our study, we aimed to systemically review all known articles related to the attentional modulation of gamma-band ASSRs. The initial literature search resulted in 1283 papers. After the removal of duplicates and ineligible articles, 49 original studies were included in the final analysis. Most analyzed studies demonstrated ASSR modulation with differing attention levels; however, studies providing mixed or non-significant results were also identified. The high versatility of methodological approaches including the utilized stimulus type and ASSR recording modality, as well as tasks employed to modulate attention, were detected and emphasized as the main causality of result inconsistencies across studies. Also, the impact of training, inter-individual variability, and time of focus was addressed.</p>

	<p>This work aims to shed light on the differential diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD) within the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), which represents a highly innovative field of clinical research. To this end, a critical review of the literature was conducted to identify and compare the clinical patterns and symptomatic overlaps among cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD, with an emphasis on their manifestation in both IPV victims and offenders. The results show that despite some symptomatic similarities, cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD have distinct clinical patterns of interpersonal violence. Specifically, disturbances in self-organization (DSO) are more commonly found in offenders, while the diagnosis of cPTSD seems more aligned with the psychological functioning of victims. In addition, cPTSD and specific characteristics of BPD, such as fear of rejection and instability of identity, constitute risk factors for IPV victimization. cPTSD is shown as a predisposing factor not only for IPV victims but also for offenders, while PTSD emerges as a consequential factor. The specific pathways linking PTSD, cPTSD, and BPD with IPV have significant implications for clinical practice. Further research is needed to understand these profiles and the mechanisms linking trauma-related features to IPV, which is crucial for implementing effective violence prevention programs.</p>

	<p>Tobacco consumption in schizophrenia (SCHZ) patients is highly prevalent. Data support the occurrence of sequential events during comorbidity establishment, and both smoking first, SCHZ second and SCHZ first, smoking second sequences have been proposed. To investigate whether these two possibilities lead to distinct outcomes of comorbidity, we used a phencyclidine-induced SCHZ model and nicotine exposure as a surrogate of smoking. C57Bl/6 mice were submitted to a protocol that either began with 4 days of phencyclidine exposure or 4 days of nicotine exposure. This period was followed by 5 days of combined phencyclidine + nicotine exposure. Locomotor sensitization and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) were assessed due to their well-known associations with SCHZ as opposed to rearing, an unrelated behavior. Nicotine priming potentiated phencyclidine-evoked sensitization. However, nicotine exposure after SCHZ modeling did not interfere with phencyclidine&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects. In the PPI test, nicotine after SCHZ modeling worsened the phencyclidine-evoked deficiency in males. In contrast, nicotine priming had no effects. Regarding rearing, nicotine priming failed to interfere with phencyclidine-mediated inhibition. Similarly, phencyclidine priming did not modify nicotine-mediated inhibition. The present results indicate that the sequence, either SCHZ-first or nicotine-first, differentially impacts comorbidity outcomes, a finding that is relevant for the identification of mechanisms of nicotine interference in the neurobiology of SCHZ.</p>

	<p>Over the past 20 years, there has been a growing interest in the processing of tool objects, and in the spatial S-R correspondence effects obtained with pictures of manipulable objects. Beyond the original affordance activation account, a location coding account has been proposed for such behavioral effects, which states that the location of the visually salient portion of an object speeds up spatially aligned motor responses and slows down misaligned ones. Furthermore, an additional action coding account has been proposed, according to which it is the direction of the action of the perceived object (e.g., &amp;amp;ldquo;pouring tea leftward&amp;amp;rdquo; when the spout of a teapot is leftward-oriented) that biases motor performance. We investigated this action coding account of S-R correspondence effects by comparing the reaction time (RT) performance of two groups: younger (6 to 9 years old) and older (10 to 13 years old) children. We assumed that knowledge of tool objects and the activation of action codes from object perception is proportional to age. Therefore, a larger correspondence effect was hypothesized for the older relative to the younger children&amp;amp;rsquo;s group. Consistently, a 34 ms correspondence effect was observed in the older children relative to the younger ones (18 ms). The results support the view that action direction is a constitutive feature of tool objects, which is subject to experience, and thus, to increasing knowledge over time.</p>

	<p>Ideomotor apraxia is a cognitive disorder most often resulting from acquired brain lesions (i.e., strokes or tumors). Neuroimaging and lesion studies have implicated several brain regions in praxis and apraxia, but most studies have described (sub)acute patients. This study aimed to extend previous research by analyzing data from 115 left hemisphere chronic stroke patients using the praxis subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, which is divided into four action types: facial, upper limb, complex, and instrumental. Lesion&amp;amp;ndash;symptom mapping was used to identify brain regions most critically associated with difficulties in each of the four subtests. Complex and instrumental action deficits were associated with left precentral, postcentral, and superior parietal gyri (Brodmann areas 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), while the facial and upper limb action deficits maps were restricted to left inferior, middle, and medial temporal gyri (Brodmann areas 20, 21, 22, and 48). We discuss ideas about neuroplasticity and cortical reorganization in chronic stroke and how different methodologies can reveal different aspects of lesion and recovery networks in apraxia.</p>

                Background There is no doubt that vaccination is crucial for preventing the spread of diseases; however, not every vaccine is perfect or will work for everyone. The main objective of this work is to predict which vaccine will be most effective for a candidate without causing severe adverse reactions and to categorize a patient as potentially at high risk of death from the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods A comprehensive analysis was conducted using a dataset on COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions, exploring binary and multiclass classification scenarios. Ensemble models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Light Gradient Boosting, and extreme gradient boosting algorithm, were utilized to achieve accurate predictions. Class balancing techniques like SMOTE, TOMEK_LINK, and SMOTETOMEK were incorporated to enhance model performance. Results The study revealed that pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, history of allergies, prior vaccinations, other medications, age, and gender were crucial factors associated with poor outcomes. Moreover, using medical history, the ensemble learning classifiers achieved accuracy scores ranging from 75% to 87% in predicting the vaccine type and mortality possibility. The Random Forest model emerged as the best prediction model, while the implementation of the SMOTE and SMOTETOMEK methods generally improved model performance. Conclusion The random forest model emerges as the top recommendation for machine learning tasks that require high accuracy and resilience. Moreover, the findings highlight the critical role of medical history in optimizing vaccine outcomes and minimizing adverse reactions.

                This work is an application of experimental temperature data previously collected in a residential building in Douala, Cameroon, in order to analyze thermal discomfort. The data was collected according to three occupancy scenarios over 12 month period using thermohygrometer sensors. The temperature data are analysed in comparison with the comfortable temperature range from 24°C to 28°C. The degree hour (DH) method was used to assess the severity of thermal discomfort in a hot and humid climate. The results reveal that the open C1, closed C2 and inhabited C3 rooms corresponding to scenarios C1, C2 and C3 respectively, have 7270.6°H, 9063.9°H and 10023°H. The inhabited room C3 has the largest DH and although the room C1 has the smallest DH, the latter largely exceeded the tolerable limit value of 1250°H set by the RE2020 Environmental Regulations. Results from this work can serve in building modelling for researchers and architects to act for the alleviation of thermal discomfort in regions with hot and humid climate.

                Background As graph datasets—including social networks, supply chains, and bioinformatics data—grow in size and complexity, researchers are driven to search for solutions enhancing model efficiency and speed. One avenue that may provide a solution is Quantum Graph Learning (QGL), a subfield of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) that applies machine learning inspired or powered by quantum computing to graph learning tasks. Methods We reevaluate Quantum Feature Embeddings (QFE), a QGL methodology published by Xu et al. earlier this year. QFE uses Variational Quantum Circuits to preprocess node features and then sends them to a classical Graph Neural Network (GNN), with the goal of increasing performance and/or decreasing total model size. Xu et al. evaluated this methodology by comparing its performance with the performance of variously-sized classical models on the benchmark datasets PROTEINS and ENZYMES, and they report success. Our core methodology and learning task remain unchanged. However, we have made several changes to the experimental design that enhance the rigor of the study: 1) we include the testing of models with no embedder; 2) we conduct a thorough hyperparameter search using a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm; and 3) we conduct stratified five-fold cross-validation, which mitigates the bias produced by our small datasets and provides multiple test statistics from which we can calculate a confidence interval. Results We produce classical models that perform comparably to QFE and significantly outperform the small classical models used in Xu et al.’s comparison. Notably, many of our classical models achieve this using fewer parameters than the QFE models we trained. Xu et al. do not report their total model sizes. Conclusion Our study sheds doubt on the efficacy of QFE by demonstrating that small, well-tuned classical models can perform just as well as QFE, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter tuning and rigorous experimental design.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-960/v1?src=rss">Identifying factors influencing faculty attitude towards digital technology in higher education and its impact on faculty engagement and work performance: a mediating analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study investigated the influence of various factors on Faculty Attitude, Faculty Engagement, and Work Performance in higher education. The study specifically examined the impact of faculty attitudes towards digital technology on their level of involvement and effectiveness in the classroom. Furthermore, it investigated how the utilization of digital technology by faculty members influences the connection between their attitudes and job performance. Methods The study utilized a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect thorough data to explore the factors influencing faculty attitude. A survey was performed among 438 faculty members from higher educational institutions in the Delhi and NCR region. Results The results indicated a strong positive relationship of perceived usefulness, mutual learning, institutional support, collaborativeness, creativity, critical thinking, and faculty attitude towards digital technology adoption in academic setting. Nevertheless, External Pressure did not exhibit a significant relationship. The study revealed that the attitude of faculty members has a significant impact on both their work performance and engagement. Additionally, faculty engagement was found to have a positive impact on work performance. The mediation Analysis revealed that Faculty Engagement served as a partial mediator in the association between Faculty Attitude and Work Performance. Conclusions The study’s implications underscore the urgent need of fostering positive attitudes and engagement among faculty members for enhancing their performance in academic settings. Some of the limitations and implication of the study and future direction of the research directions are suggested.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012361">aiSEGcell: User-friendly deep learning-based segmentation of nuclei in transmitted light images</a></h4>

Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images. This typically requires their fluorescent labeling. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images. This eliminates the need for transgenic or dye fluorescent labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging. However, this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists. Here, we introduce “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images. We extensively evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images. aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images, very similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information, e.g. for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining. aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line, and a napari graphical user interface. It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience.

                <p>by Bjarke Haldrup Pedersen, Filipa Bica Simões, Ivan Pogrebnyakov, Martin Welch, Helle Krogh Johansen, Søren Molin, Ruggero La Rosa</p>

Metabolism provides the foundation for all cellular functions. During persistent infections, in adapted pathogenic bacteria metabolism functions radically differently compared with more naïve strains. Whether this is simply a necessary accommodation to the persistence phenotype or if metabolism plays a direct role in achieving persistence in the host is still unclear. Here, we characterize a convergent shift in metabolic function(s) linked with the persistence phenotype during <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> colonization in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. We show that clinically relevant mutations in the key metabolic enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase, lead to a host-specialized metabolism together with a lower virulence and immune response recruitment. These changes in infection phenotype are mediated by impaired type III secretion system activity and by secretion of the antioxidant metabolite, pyruvate, respectively. Our results show how metabolic adaptations directly impinge on persistence and pathogenicity in this organism.

                <p>by Juan Du, Weiqiang Liu, Meng Li, Zihao Li, Xuanjing Li, Yichen Dai, Gaoming Liu, Xiao Wang, Pingfen Zhu, Vadim N. Gladyshev, Xuming Zhou</p>

The naked mole rat (NMR), <i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>, is known as the longest-lived rodent and is extraordinarily resistant to hypoxia and cancer. Here, both NMR embryonic fibroblasts (NEFs) and their mouse counterparts (MEFs) were subjected to anoxic conditions (0% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). A combination of comparative transcriptomics and proteomics was then employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Notably, we observed distinct levels of histone H1.2 (encoded by <i>HIST1H1C</i>) accumulation between NEFs and MEFs. Subsequent mechanistic analyses showed that higher H1.2 expression in NEFs was associated with the lower expression of its inhibitor, <i>PARP1</i>. Additionally, we discovered that H1.2 can directly interact with HIF-1α PAS domains, thereby promoting the expression of HIF-1α through facilitating the dimerization with HIF-1β. The overexpression of H1.2 was also found to trigger autophagy and to suppress the migration of cancer cells, as well as the formation of xenograft tumors, via the NRF2/P62 signaling pathway. Moreover, an engineered H1.2 knock-in mouse model exhibited significantly extended survival in hypoxic conditions (4% O<sub>2</sub>) and showed a reduced rate of tumor formation. Collectively, our results indicate a potential mechanistic link between H1.2 and the dual phenomena of anoxic adaptation and cancer resistance.

                <p>by Tea Kohlbrenner, Simon Berger, Ana Cristina Laranjeira, Tinri Aegerter-Wilmsen, Laura Filomena Comi, Andrew deMello, Alex Hajnal</p>

Germ cell apoptosis in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> hermaphrodites is a physiological process eliminating around 60% of all cells in meiotic prophase to maintain tissue homeostasis. In contrast to programmed cell death in the <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> soma, the selection of germ cells undergoing apoptosis is stochastic. By live-tracking individual germ cells at the pachytene stage, we found that germ cells smaller than their neighbors are selectively eliminated through apoptosis before differentiating into oocytes. Thus, cell size is a strong predictor of physiological germ cell death. The RAS/MAPK and ECT/RHO/ROCK pathways together regulate germ cell size by controlling actomyosin constriction at the apical rachis bridges, which are cellular openings connecting the syncytial germ cells to a shared cytoplasmic core. Enhancing apical constriction reduces germ cell size and increases the rate of cell death while inhibiting the actomyosin network in the germ cells prevents their death. We propose that actomyosin contractility at the rachis bridges of the syncytial germ cells amplifies intrinsic disparities in cell size. Through this mechanism, the animals can adjust the balance between physiological germ cell death and oocyte differentiation.

                Introduction Neuroinflammase, a key mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer and Parkinson, is influenced by statin, a lipid-binding protein. Studies show that statin can mitigate the likelihood of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease and can also reduce leukocytosis and T-regulatory function. Nevertheless, there is restricted literature on the use of statin in neuroinflammation. The objective of this investigation is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of statin use in neuroinflammation, providing valuable insights into research development and future research questions. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroinflammation and statins. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are Documents by Year, Most Global Cited Document, Most Relevant Sources, Factorial Map Of The Documents With The Highest Contributes, Documents by Author, Most Relevant Affiliations, Documents by Subject Area, Trend Topic, Network Visualization, Overlay visualization of scopus, database using Vosviewer, Density Visualization, Thematic Map, Thematic Evolution, Cluster Analysis, Qualitative Analysis, and Word Cloud. Conclusions The study highlights the potential for further research on statins and neuroinflammation, aiming to better understand their role in treating neuroinflammation and enhance the quality of life for patients with neuroinflammatory conditions.

                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Where did Ecuador’s foreign debt originate and grow to alarming levels? The purpose of this article is to describe, from an analytical perspective based on the contributions of various authors, the origin of Ecuador’s external debt with international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the support that these organizations provide for the development of the countries of the South, case Ecuador. To achieve this purpose, a documentary methodology was implemented that included an exhaustive review of studies focused on the specific variables subject to analysis, the PRISMA tool and Atlas.ti 23 were used. The results show that the creation of these financing agencies in their attempt to support the financial stability of developing countries has not been sufficiently effective in improving the welfare conditions of a good percentage of the population and has generated an imbalance in the sustained development of the poorest countries. It is concluded that the capitalist system gives predominant priority to the economic growth of nations, thus relegating in its model the consideration of human development. This orientation does not contribute effectively to the improvement of crucial aspects such: education, health and the standard of living of the population.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurofilament light chains (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains (pNfH), established as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cohorts, are now surrogate markers in clinical trials. This study extends their evaluation to a population level, with the aim of advancing their full establishment and assessing the transferability of biomarker findings from controlled cohorts to real-world ALS populations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured serum NfL and pNfH levels in all ALS patients (n = 790) and general population controls (n = 570) with available baseline samples participating in the epidemiological ALS Registry Swabia, providing platform-specific (ELLA™) reference data and Z-scores for controls, as well as reference data, disease-specific Z-scores and longitudinal data in ALS. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of neurofilaments and quantified the impact of ALS-related factors and non-ALS confounders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Neurofilaments showed high diagnostic and prognostic utility at the population level, with NfL superior to pNfH. The novel concept of a population-based ALS Z-score significantly improved the prognostic utility compared to absolute raw values. Both biomarkers increased more strongly with age in controls than in ALS, and age adjustment improved diagnostic accuracy. Our data show that disease progression rates, ALS phenotype, body mass index (BMI), and renal function need to be considered when interpreting neurofilament levels; longitudinal neurofilament levels were generally stable in individual patients, especially when adjusted for age and baseline levels.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Population-based assessment enhances the utility of particularly serum NfL as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in ALS and improves the translation of findings from controlled cohorts to real-world populations. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a highly prevalent subclinical inflammatory intestinal disorder associated with growth failure, impaired neurocognitive development, poor response to oral vaccines, and micronutrient deficiencies. However, EE research and clinical trials are hampered by the lack of non-invasive tools for measuring intestinal function in detail. This study aims to develop new tools for the measurement of multiple domains of gut functional capacity. Methods The GI TOOLS project is a cross-sectional study that will recruit adults aged 18-65 years with EE in Lusaka, Zambia. Each participant will undergo assessment of gut functional capacity using novel near-point-of-care tools and provide multiple samples for detailed laboratory analyses. Participants will also undergo endoscopy for collection of duodenal biopsies. Novel techniques include stable isotopes approaches to measuring digestion, absorption, and bidirectional transmucosal amino acid flux, a non-invasive fluorescence tool for real-time evaluation of gut permeability, and assessment of reverse permeation of intravenous antibiotics to be carried out separately in Zimbabwe. Stool and duodenal microbiome sequencing using MinION sequencing, metabolome analysis applied to plasma and intestinal fluids, blood immune cell phenotyping, in vitro epithelial barrier models, and duodenal immunohistochemistry will also be used to explore EE in depth. These will all be integrated with gold standard histology and mucosal morphometry, alongside lactulose permeation data, and stool and plasma biomarker analysis. The protocol has been approved by ethics committees and regulators in Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the UK. Participants will give informed consent before they can participate Anticipated outcomes Based on this extensive phenotyping, tests will be developed which can be simplified and refined for use in adults and children with EE, and for clinical trials. Findings from this project will be disseminated through in-person meetings with caregivers and regulatory bodies, presentations at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-955/v1?src=rss">Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Propensity to Cheat Scale Validation in the Ethiopian Public Higher Education Institutions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study was primarily intended to develop and validate a comprehensive and psychometrically acceptable measure of students’ propensity to cheat (PTC) behavior among undergraduate students in Ethiopian universities by assessing their engagement in different types of cheating behavior. Methods The present study employed an explanatory research design using a questionnaire based on the Propensity to Cheat Scale (PCS). The questionnaire was administered to 500 university students (male = 367 [73.4%]; female = 133 [26.6%]) selected from three Ethiopian public universities between November and January 2022. In order to measure the underlying variables of propensity towards cheating, a factor model is developed using exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the students’ perceived PTC. The internal consistency of the PTC scale was assessed using reliability analysis, and validity evaluations were conducted to confirm the scale’s discriminant and convergent validity. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results revealed a good fit to the data, and the internal consistency of the PCS was found to be strong, providing a reliable measure of students’ propensity for cheating. Validity evaluations, including discriminant validity and convergent validity, confirmed the validity of the scale. The average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability values also supported the scale’s convergent validity. The multidimensional concept of the PTC was supported by a four-factor solution consisting of 26 reliable and valid items. Conclusion The findings of the study demonstrate that the scale has also provided sufficient evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. By establishing discriminant and convergent validity, as well as reliability, through different validation procedures, the study has provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the PCS as an instrument for determining whether university students are likely to engage in cheating behavior.

     alt="Electro-Clinical Features and Functional Connectivity Analysis in SYN1-Related Epilepsy"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is currently scarce data on the electroclinical characteristics of epilepsy associated with synapsin 1 (<i>SYN1</i>) pathogenic variations. We examined clinical and electro-encephalographic (EEG) features in patients with epilepsy and <i>SYN1</i> variants, with the aim of identifying a distinctive electroclinical pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected and reviewed demographic, genetic, and epilepsy data of 19 male patients with <i>SYN1</i> variants. Specifically, we analyzed interictal EEG data for all patients, and electro-clinical data from 10 epileptic seizures in 5 patients, using prolonged video-EEG monitoring recordings. Inter-ictal EEG functional connectivity parameters and frequency spectrum of the 10 patients over 12 years of age, were computed and compared with those of 56 age- and sex-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The main electroclinical features of epilepsy in patients with <i>SYN1</i> were (1) EEG background and organization mainly normal; (2) interictal abnormalities are often rare or not visible on EEG; (3) more than 60% of patients had reflex seizures (cutaneous contact with water and defecation being the main triggers) isolated or associated with spontaneous seizures; (4) electro-clinical semiology of seizures was mainly temporal or temporo-insulo/perisylvian with a notable autonomic component; and (5) ictal EEG showed a characteristic rhythmic theta/delta activity predominating in temporo-perisylvian regions at the beginning of most seizures. Comparing patients with <i>SYN1</i> to healthy subjects, we observed a shift to lower frequency bands in power spectrum of interictal EEG and an increased connectivity in both temporal regions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A distinct epilepsy syndrome emerges in patients with <i>SYN1</i>, with a rather characteristic clinical and EEG pattern suggesting predominant temporo-insular involvement. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-954/v1?src=rss">Perspectives and guidance for developing artificial intelligence-based applications for healthcare using medical images [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential to transform healthcare and improve patient care. However, successful development and integration of AI models requires careful consideration of study designs and sample size calculations for development and validation of models, publishing standards, prototype development for translation and collaboration with stakeholders. As the field is relatively new and rapidly evolving there is a lack of guidance and agreement on best practices for most of these steps. We engaged stakeholders in the form of clinicians, researchers from academia and industry, and data scientists to discuss various aspects of the translational pipeline and identified the challenges researchers in the field face and potential solutions to them. In this viewpoint, we present the summary of our discussions as a brief guide on the process of developing AI-based applications for healthcare using medical images. We organized the entire process into six major themes (i.e., The gaps AI can fill in healthcare, Development of AI models for healthcare: practical and important things to consider, Good practices for validation of AI models for healthcare: study designs and sample size calculation, Points to consider when publishing AI models, Translation towards products, Challenges and potential solutions from a technical perspective) and presented important points as a rule of thumb. We conclude that successful integration of AI in healthcare requires a collaborative approach, rigorous validation, adherence to best practices as described and cited, and consideration of technical aspects.

                Background Sonneratia caseolaris, known as the red pidada, has been widely utilized by the Indonesian. S. caseolaris leaves contain various active compounds, contributing to their popularity in the treatment of various diseases. Mangrove leaves are also known to exhibit very high antioxidant activity. This study aims to assess the antioxidant activity of S . caseolaris leaves extracted using different solvents. The resulting extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) techniques. Methods Analysis of total flavonoids, total phenols, identification of active compounds with Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and bioinformatics were also carried out to obtain temporary conclusions about the antioxidant activity of S. caseolaris leaf extract. Results The results indicated that S. caseolaris leaves extracted with methanol and distilled water exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The analysis of total flavonoids and total phenols yielded results consistent with the antioxidant activity tests. LC-HRMS results identified three compounds in all S. caseolaris leaf extracts with antioxidant activity, namely Tempo, Choline, and Betaine. Tempo demonstrated a higher antioxidant activity than Choline and Betaine, as indicated by the binding affinity values in the bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions It is evident that S. caseolaris leaf extract has the potential to serve as an effective an antioxidant agent. Further research is needed to elucidate confirm the potential compounds in Sonneratia caseolaris leaves water extract interact with the target protein Keap1. S. caseolaris, in order to utilize them as active components in food and enhance antioxidant consumption among consumers.

                Purpose The current cadaveric report describes the abnormal origin and course of testicular arteries (TAs) in two donated cadavers, along with a renal artery (RA) duplication. Methods Dissection of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the abdominal aorta (AA) branching patterns were performed in 90-year-old- and 76-year-old formalin-embalmed donated male cadavers. Results Variants of the TA origin and course were identified, as coexisting with RA variants. Case 1: A right-sided RA (RRA) duplication (recorded as superior and inferior renal artery-SRA and IRA) with origin from the AA, coexisted with a right TA (RTA) that originated from the IRA and descended anteriorly to the ureter. The left TA (LTA) originated from the AA proximal to the origin of the left RA (LRA). The LTA coursed in front of the common drainage of the left testicular and renal vein into the IVC. Case 2: A bilateral RA duplication was identified and recorded as SRA and IRA. The right-sided SRA originated from the AA upper level and played the role of the accessory RA (ARA). The main perfusion of the right kidney was performed by the IRA which was further trifurcated into a superior polar, an inferior polar (IPA), and a TA. The RTA had a high origin from the IPA. Conclusion The current study reported two cases of TAs with abnormal origin and course accompanied by an RA duplication. A thorough knowledge of the origin and course of the TAs has clinical implications for the kidneys and testicle’ surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-69/v3?src=rss">What can we experience and report on a rapidly presented image? Intersubjective measures of specificity of freely reported contents of consciousness [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A majority of previous studies appear to support a view that human observers can only perceive coarse information from a natural scene image when it is presented rapidly (<100ms, masked). In these studies, participants were often forced to choose an answer from options that experimenters preselected. These options can underestimate what participants experience and can report on it. The current study aims to introduce a novel methodology to investigate how detailed information participants can report after briefly seeing a natural scene image. Methods: We used a novel free-report paradigm to examine what people can freely report following a rapidly presented natural scene image (67/133/267ms, masked). N = 670 online participants typed up to five words to report what they saw in the image together with confidence of the respective responses. We developed a novel index, Intersubjective Agreement (IA). IA quantifies how specifically the response words were used to describe the target image, with a high value meaning the word is not often reported for other images. Importantly, IA eliminates the need for experimenters to preselect response options. Results: The words with high IA values are often something detailed (e.g., a small object) in a particular image. With IA, unlike commonly believed, we demonstrated that participants reported highly specific and detailed aspects of the briefly (even at 67ms, masked) shown image. Further, IA is positively correlated with confidence, indicating metacognitive conscious access to the reported aspects of the image. Conclusion: These new findings challenge the dominant view that the content of rapid scene experience is limited to global and coarse gist. Our novel paradigm opens a door to investigate various contents of consciousness with a free-report paradigm.

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                The acceptance rate towards COVID-19 vaccination among the global population could be higher due to the need for more education or awareness of prevention strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, there is a dire need to reduce the population’s reluctance towards COVID-19 vaccination across the globe, which will ultimately lead to the implementation of prevention and control strategies against the COVID-19 virus and improving health outcomes across the globe. The following study intends to conduct a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and the current trends related to COVID-19 vaccination faced by the global population. The methodology employed in this study primarily focused on assessing secondary data by conducting a systematic literature review. Internet and electronic databases were used to select research articles to obtain secondary sources. Six articles were selected from ScienceDirect and Google Scholar for a systematic literature review. The keywords used for the selection of articles were “COVID-19,” “Global trends,” Reluctance, “and “vaccination.” The selected articles that were most suitable for the topic consisted of global trends related to COVID-19 vaccination. Six articles relevant to the topic were selected and reviewed. The selected articles showed data collection results from different research journals. The findings of the six research articles depicted common themes, such as each vaccine having a different level of access attitude towards the regional existence, which primarily depends on the variability to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness. Further studies are required to evaluate the factors and strategies that help healthcare organizations and governments reduce the reluctance to use the COVID-19 vaccine among populations worldwide.

                Dysregulation of RNA processing contributes to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, Wu et al. demonstrated that nuclear speckle dysfunction represents a converging toxic pathway contributed by both (GGGGCC)n repeat RNA and the noncanonical translation product poly-GR in C9ORF72-FTD/ALS. Impaired nuclear speckle integrity induces RNA mis-splicing and causes neuronal degeneration.

                The exon junction complex (EJC) is critical for the mRNA life cycle in eukaryotic cells. Alsina et al. report that the nucleating component of this complex, EIF4A3, acts non-canonically as a microtubule-binding protein in neurons to regulate axonal growth.

                Lingamallu et al. demonstrate that club cells (CCs), facultative stem cells of the lower airways, are maintained by canonical Notch signaling. Most CCs, excluding a subpopulation at NEBs and terminal bronchioles (v-CCs), transdifferentiate into multiciliated cells upon Notch inhibition. v-CCs escape due to β-catenin activation and repair airways post Notch inhibition.

                Yasumizu et al. identify MG-specific features in thymoma and thymic hyperplasia using spatial transcriptomics. Combining single-cell RNA-seq and GWAS data, they find MG susceptibility enriched in the medulla region of thymoma, characterized by specific immune cells. These findings provide a foundation for future MG research.

                de Kivit et al. reveal discerning lipidomes of conventional T cells (Tconvs) versus thymus-derived regulatory T cells (tTreg). Effector tTregs can use either glucose or lactate to synthesize long and unsaturated fatty acids, on which they rely for proliferation and suppressive function. These tTreg-specific properties may be therapeutically exploited.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68404">Inhibitors of the small membrane (M) protein viroporin prevent Zika virus infection</a></h4>

              
                <i>Flaviviruses</i>, including Zika virus (ZIKV), are a significant global health concern, yet no licensed antivirals exist to treat disease. The small Membrane (M) protein plays well-defined roles during viral egress and remains within virion membranes following release and maturation. However, it is unclear whether M plays a functional role in this setting. Here, we show that M forms oligomeric membrane-permeabilising channels <i>in vitro</i>, with increased activity at acidic pH and sensitivity to the prototypic channel-blocker, rimantadine. Accordingly, rimantadine blocked an early stage of ZIKV cell culture infection. Structure-based channel models, comprising hexameric arrangements of two <i>trans</i>-membrane domain protomers were shown to comprise more stable assemblages than other oligomers using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Models contained a predicted lumenal rimantadine binding site, as well as a second druggable target region on the membrane-exposed periphery. <i>In silico</i> screening enriched for repurposed drugs/compounds predicted to bind to either one site or the other. Hits displayed superior potency <i>in vitro</i> and in cell culture compared with rimantadine, with efficacy demonstrably linked to virion-resident channels. Finally, rimantadine effectively blocked ZIKV viraemia in preclinical models, supporting that M constitutes a physiologically relevant target. This could be explored by repurposing rimantadine, or development of new M-targeted-therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93062">The role of heterochronic gene expression and regulatory architecture in early developmental divergence</a></h4>

              
                New developmental programs can evolve through adaptive changes to gene expression. The annelid <i>Streblospio benedicti</i> has a developmental dimorphism, which provides a unique intraspecific framework for understanding the earliest genetic changes that take place during developmental divergence. Using comparative RNAseq through ontogeny, we find that only a small proportion of genes are differentially expressed at any time, despite major differences in larval development and life history. These genes shift expression profiles across morphs by either turning off any expression in one morph or changing the timing or amount of gene expression. We directly connect the contributions of these mechanisms to differences in developmental processes. We examine F<sub>1</sub> offspring – using reciprocal crosses – to determine maternal mRNA inheritance and the regulatory architecture of gene expression. These results highlight the importance of both novel gene expression and heterochronic shifts in developmental evolution, as well as the <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory factors in initiating divergence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87880">Drosophila model to clarify the pathological significance of OPA1 in autosomal dominant optic atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is a progressive form of blindness caused by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, mainly caused by mutations in the OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin <i>like</i> GTPase (<i>OPA1</i>) gene. <i>OPA1</i> encodes a dynamin-like GTPase present in the mitochondrial inner membrane. When associated with OPA1 mutations, DOA can present not only ocular symptoms but also multi-organ symptoms (DOA plus). DOA plus often results from point mutations in the GTPase domain, which are assumed to have dominant-negative effects. However, the presence of mutations in the GTPase domain does not always result in DOA plus. Therefore, an experimental system to distinguish between DOA and DOA plus is needed. In this study, we found that loss-of-function mutations of the <i>dOPA1</i> gene in <i>Drosophila</i> can imitate the pathology of optic nerve degeneration observed in DOA. We successfully rescued this degeneration by expressing the human <i>OPA1</i> (<i>hOPA1</i>) gene, indicating that <i>hOPA1</i> is functionally interchangeable with <i>dOPA1</i> in the fly system. However, mutations previously identified did not ameliorate the <i>dOPA1</i> deficiency phenotype. By expressing both WT and DOA plus mutant <i>hOPA1</i> forms in the optic nerve of <i>dOPA1</i> mutants, we observed that DOA plus mutations suppressed the rescue, facilitating the distinction between loss-of-function and dominant-negative mutations in <i>hOPA1</i>. This fly model aids in distinguishing DOA from DOA plus and guides initial <i>hOPA1</i> mutation treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94407">Association with TFIIIC limits MYCN localisation in hubs of active promoters and chromatin accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II</a></h4>

              
                MYC family oncoproteins regulate the expression of a large number of genes and broadly stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). While the factors that control the chromatin association of MYC proteins are well understood, much less is known about how interacting proteins mediate MYC’s effects on transcription. Here, we show that TFIIIC, an architectural protein complex that controls the three-dimensional chromatin organisation at its target sites, binds directly to the amino-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain of MYCN. Surprisingly, TFIIIC has no discernible role in MYCN-dependent gene expression and transcription elongation. Instead, MYCN and TFIIIC preferentially bind to promoters with paused RNAPII and globally limit the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters. Consistent with its ubiquitous role in transcription, MYCN broadly participates in hubs of active promoters. Depletion of TFIIIC further increases MYCN localisation to these hubs. This increase correlates with a failure of the nuclear exosome and BRCA1, both of which are involved in nascent RNA degradation, to localise to active promoters. Our data suggest that MYCN and TFIIIC exert an censoring function in early transcription that limits promoter accumulation of inactive RNAPII and facilitates promoter-proximal degradation of nascent RNA.

	<p>In neuropsychology and clinical psychology, the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) experiences for knowledge acquisition and the potential for modifying conduct are well documented. Consequently, the scope of VR experiences for educational purposes has expanded in the health field in recent years. In this study, we sought to assess the effectiveness of ViveDe in a psychoeducational caregiver program. ViveDe is a VR application that presents users with possible daily life situations from the perspective of individuals with dementia. These situations can be experienced in immersive mode through 360&amp;amp;deg; video. This research aimed to ascertain the associations between the sense of presence that can be achieved in VR and some users&amp;amp;rsquo; psychological characteristics, such as distress and empathetic disposition. The study involved 36 informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. These participants were assessed using scales of anxiety and depression, perceived stress, empathy, and emotional regulation. They were asked to participate in a six-session psychoeducation program conducted online on dementia topics, in addition to experiencing the ViveDe application. The immersive VR sessions enabled the caregivers to directly experience the symptoms of dementia (e.g., spatial disorientation, agnosia, difficulty in problem-solving, and anomia) in everyday and social settings. The results indicated that although the experience in ViveDe (evaluated using the XRPS scale and five questions about emotional attunement) showed efficacy in producing a sense of first-person participation in the symptoms of dementia, further research is needed to confirm this. The structural equation model provided evidence that the characteristics of individuals who enjoy the VR experience play a determining role in the perceived sense of presence, which in turn affects the efficacy of the VR experience as a psychoeducational tool. Further research will be conducted to ascertain the potential role of these elements in conveying change in the caregivers of people with dementia. This will help us study the long-term effectiveness of a large-scale psychoeducation program in VR.</p>

	<p>Musculoskeletal conditions often involve pain related to specific movements. However, most studies on the impact of experimental pain on motor performance and learning have used tonic pain models. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of experimental phasic pain during the preparation or execution of a reaching task on the acquisition and retention of sensorimotor adaptation. Participants were divided into three groups: no pain, pain during motor preparation, and pain during motor execution. Pain was induced over the scapula with a laser while participants performed a force field adaptation task over two days. To assess the effect of pain on motor performance, two baseline conditions (with or without pain) involving unperturbed pointing movements were also conducted. The results indicated that the timing of the nociceptive stimulus differently affected baseline movement performance. Pain during motor preparation shortened reaction time, while pain during movement execution decreased task performance. However, when these baseline effects were accounted for, no impact of pain on motor adaptation or retention was observed. All groups showed significant improvements in all motor variables for both adaptation and retention. In conclusion, while acute phasic pain during motor preparation or execution can affect the movement itself, it does not interfere with motor acquisition or retention during a motor adaptation task.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with inflammation and a high level of comorbidities. Atypical depression (AD) is a MDD subtype based on DSM criteria, that could have specific underlying biological mechanisms. AD is associated with elevated cardiovascular (CVD) comorbidities, higher risk of suicide attempts, hypersomnia, and anxiety disorder. In this study, we aim to investigate if AD and polysomnographic parameters could be associated with low-grade inflammation (LGI). LGI is defined by a range from 3 to 10 mg/L of C-reactive protein levels. We carried out a retrospective cohort study in which 765 individuals with MDD were split into two groups: with and without LGI. Our results exhibit differences between the groups for the polysomnographic parameters, with the LGI group showing parameters already associated with inflammation such as reduced rapid eye movement sleep and elevated hypoxemia markers (identified as CVD risk factor). We found that AD is associated with LGI (OR 1.48; p = 0.047) after adjustment. Likewise, we found an LGI prevalence in AD higher (34.8%) than in MDD without atypical features (26.8%). Overall, these results confirm the low-grade inflammation feature of AD and highlight polysomnographic parameters associated with LGI that could also act as risk factors in this context.</p>

	<p>Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a severe complication following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), linked to poor functional outcomes and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Timely DCI diagnosis is crucial but remains challenging. Dysregulated blood glucose, commonly observed after aSAH, may impair the constant glucose supply that is vital for brain function, potentially contributing to DCI. This study aimed to assess whether glucose indices could help identify at-risk patients and improve DCI detection. This retrospective, single-center observational study examined 151 aSAH patients between 2016 and 2019. Additionally, 70 of these (46.4%) developed DCI and 81 did not (no-DCI). To determine the value of glycemic indices for DCI, they were analyzed separately in patients in the period before (pre-DCI) and after DCI (post-DCI). The time-weighted average glucose (TWAG, p = 0.024), mean blood glucose (p = 0.033), and novel time-unified dysglycemic rate (TUDR140, calculated as the ratio of dysglycemic to total periods within a glucose target range of 70&amp;amp;ndash;140 mg/dL, p = 0.042), showed significantly higher values in the pre-DCI period of the DCI group than in the no-DCI group. In the time-series analysis, significant increases in TWAG and TUDR140 were observed at the DCI onset. In conclusion, DCI patients showed elevated blood glucose levels before and a further increase at the DCI onset. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings, as this retrospective, single-center study cannot completely exclude confounders and limitations. In the future blood glucose indices might become valuable parameters in multiparametric models to identify patients at risk and detect DCI onset earlier.</p>

                Background Insufficient and above WHO-recommended levels of iodine intake during pregnancy can lead to serious health outcomes. This study aimed to assess median urine iodine concentration and its associated risk factors among pregnant women in the Mbeya region, Tanzania. Method A cross sectional survey involving 420 pregnant women (n=420) aged 15-49, registered in Reproductive and Child Health Clinics was conducted. Socio-demographic and dietary factors were assessed by structured questionnaire and the urine samples were analyzed using the ammonium persulfate digestion method. Results Median urinary iodine concentration (mUIC) was 279.4μg/L and it ranged from 26.1 to 1915μg/L. Insufficient mUIC (below 150μg/L) was observed in 17.14% of participants, sufficient mUIC was 24.29% and 58.57% had mUIC above the recommended level (>250μg/L). Sample women who reported consuming fish in the last 24 hours had an increased risk of insufficient mUIC [Adjusted OR= 2.60 (95%CI 1.31-5.15)] while the risk was lower for those who attended at least primary education [AOR= 0.29 (CI 0.08-0.99)]. Further, sample women resident in Mbarali district, in the oldest age group (35-49) and having a higher socio-economic status were associated with an increased risk of having MUIC above recommended level [AOR=4.09 (CI 1.85-9.010], [AOR=2.51 (CI 0.99-6.330] and, [AOR=2.08 (CI 0.91-4.71) respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrated a significant association between geographical, age and socio-economic factors and median urine iodine concentration above the WHO-recommended level. Further, this study found association between inadequate iodine in diet and insufficient median urine iodine concentration. Therefore, educational programs on iodine intake should be strengthened.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-350/v2?src=rss">In-depth assessment of Iraqi physicians' adherence to treatment guidelines for different diseases: a qualitative study [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In healthcare settings, specialists from different fields may follow the most well-known, reliable, and easy-to-understand medical guidelines. This study aimed to determine Iraqi physicians’ adherence to treatment guidelines, to specify which treatment guidelines are utilized for each disease and identify their barriers to follow the guidelines. Methods: This was qualitative study including face-to-face and virtual semi-structured interviews with specialist physicians from different disciplines. The interviews were conducted between December 2021 and May 2022 in Kirkuk province, Iraq. The qualitative data generated through interviews was analyzed using thematic analysis. Result: The study recruited 48 specialists (27 male and 21 female) from seven medical specialties at two large government hospitals. Most physicians (38 /44) revealed that healthcare settings implement treatment guidelines in more than half of cases. American guideline was the most used among the participating physicians. European and British guidelines and textbooks were also used by some specialties. Unfortunately, most (43 out of 47) physicians were unaware of Iraqi treatment guideline. Most senior physicians often followed the same guidelines for one branch, with little variation in approach based on their experience and flexibility. Almost all participating physicians believed that shortages in treatment (46/47) and investigation/lab materials (45/47) and low patient adherence (44/47) are major barriers to implement the guideline(s). Six out of seven specialties experienced shortage in the essential medications that recommended by the guidelines Conclusions: Most physicians followed well-known international guidelines. Each specialty follows different guidelines relying on the disease. Medication shortage in the public hospitals was the main barrier facing physicians to implement treatment guidelines. Enhancing physician awareness of the Iraqi guidelines should be encouraged. Finally, securing essential medicines in public hospitals is pivotal to adopt evidence-based guidelines effectively.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in transcription and translation. Identification of circRNA-RBP (RNA-binding protein) interaction sites has become a fundamental step in molecular and cell biology. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to predict circRNA-RBP interaction sites and achieved impressive identification performance. However, those methods cannot effectively capture long-distance dependencies, and cannot effectively utilize the interaction information of multiple features. To overcome those limitations, we propose a DL-based model iCRBP-LKHA using deep hybrid networks for identifying circRNA-RBP interaction sites. iCRBP-LKHA adopts five encoding schemes. Meanwhile, the neural network architecture, which consists of large kernel convolutional neural network (LKCNN), convolutional block attention module with one-dimensional convolution (CBAM-1D) and bidirectional gating recurrent unit (BiGRU), can explore local information, global context information and multiple features interaction information automatically. To verify the effectiveness of iCRBP-LKHA, we compared its performance with shallow learning algorithms on 37 circRNAs datasets and 37 circRNAs stringent datasets. And we compared its performance with state-of-the-art DL-based methods on 37 circRNAs datasets, 37 circRNAs stringent datasets and 31 linear RNAs datasets. The experimental results not only show that iCRBP-LKHA outperforms other competing methods, but also demonstrate the potential of this model in identifying other RNA-RBP interaction sites.

                <p>by Lucas Rudelt, Daniel González Marx, F. Paul Spitzner, Benjamin Cramer, Johannes Zierenberg, Viola Priesemann</p>

A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales. This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., recurrent coupling or adaptation), but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this hypothesis. Here, we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Moreover, intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.

During embryonic development, tissues and organs are gradually shaped into their functional morphologies through a series of spatiotemporally tightly orchestrated cell behaviors. A highly conserved organ shape across metazoans is the epithelial tube. Tube morphogenesis is a complex multistep process of carefully choreographed cell behaviors such as convergent extension, cell elongation, and lumen formation. The identity of the signaling molecules that coordinate these intricate morphogenetic steps remains elusive. The notochord is an essential tubular organ present in the embryonic midline region of all members of the chordate phylum. Here, using genome editing, pharmacology and quantitative imaging in the early chordate <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> we show that Ano10/Tmem16k, a member of the evolutionarily ancient family of transmembrane proteins called Anoctamin/TMEM16 is essential for convergent extension, lumen expansion, and connection during notochord morphogenesis. We find that Ano10/Tmem16k works in concert with the plasma membrane (PM) localized Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) residing SERCA, RyR, and IP3R proteins to establish developmental stage specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling molecular modules that regulate notochord morphogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. In addition, we find that the highly conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors calmodulin (CaM) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) show an Ano10/Tmem16k-dependent subcellular localization. Their pharmacological inhibition leads to convergent extension, tubulogenesis defects, and deranged Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, suggesting that Ano10/Tmem16k is involved in both the “encoding” and “decoding” of developmental Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Furthermore, Ano10/Tmem16k mediates cytoskeletal reorganization during notochord morphogenesis, likely by altering the localization of 2 important cytoskeletal regulators, the small GTPase Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and the actin binding protein Cofilin. Finally, we use electrophysiological recordings and a scramblase assay in tissue culture to demonstrate that Ano10/Tmem16k likely acts as an ion channel but not as a phospholipid scramblase. Our results establish Ano10/Tmem16k as a novel player in the prevertebrate molecular toolkit that controls organ morphogenesis across scales.

                <p>by Weichen Zhou, Kalpita R. Karan, Wenjin Gu, Hans-Ulrich Klein, Gabriel Sturm, Philip L. De Jager, David A. Bennett, Michio Hirano, Martin Picard, Ryan E. Mills</p>

The transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes (Numts) has been linked to lifespan in nonhuman species and recently demonstrated to occur in rare instances from one human generation to the next. Here, we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in 2 ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 postmortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (<i>n</i> = 389), postmitotic brain tissue (<i>n</i> = 798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples, we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, an increase in the number of brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI) who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures whole-genome sequencing design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of 1 Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven by cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived <i>SURF1</i>-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan. These findings open the possibility that mito-nuclear horizontal gene transfer among human postmitotic tissues produces functionally relevant human Numts over timescales shorter than previously assumed.

Research articles published by the journal eLife are accompanied by short evaluation statements that use phrases from a prescribed vocabulary to evaluate research on 2 dimensions: importance and strength of support. Intuitively, the prescribed phrases appear to be highly synonymous (e.g., important/valuable, compelling/convincing) and the vocabulary’s ordinal structure may not be obvious to readers. We conducted an online repeated-measures experiment to gauge whether the phrases were interpreted as intended. We also tested an alternative vocabulary with (in our view) a less ambiguous structure. A total of 301 participants with a doctoral or graduate degree used a 0% to 100% scale to rate the importance and strength of support of hypothetical studies described using phrases from both vocabularies. For the eLife vocabulary, most participants’ implied ranking did not match the intended ranking on both the importance (<i>n</i> = 59, 20% matched, 95% confidence interval [15% to 24%]) and strength of support dimensions (<i>n</i> = 45, 15% matched [11% to 20%]). By contrast, for the alternative vocabulary, most participants’ implied ranking did match the intended ranking on both the importance (<i>n</i> = 188, 62% matched [57% to 68%]) and strength of support dimensions (<i>n</i> = 201, 67% matched [62% to 72%]). eLife’s vocabulary tended to produce less consistent between-person interpretations, though the alternative vocabulary still elicited some overlapping interpretations away from the middle of the scale. We speculate that explicit presentation of a vocabulary’s intended ordinal structure could improve interpretation. Overall, these findings suggest that more structured and less ambiguous language can improve communication of research evaluations.

                Background Melasma is a common dyschromia, mainly found in women with darker skin types. Although asymptomatic, melasma significantly impacts patients’ quality of life. Due to this complex pathogenesis, melasma is difficult to treat. Plant and plant-derived products have been explored as alternatives for the treatment of melasma. Methods This study utilized network pharmacology coupled with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanisms of three selected Cassipourea metabolites in the treatment of melasma. Results Of the 202 genes obtained from the 14 profiled metabolites, only PTGS2, TYR, ESR2, and ESR1 were common among metabolites and targets implicated in melasma. From this, The gene ontology highlighted the intracellular steroid hormone receptor, signalling pathway, macromolecular complex, and estrogen receptor activity as the top enriched functional annotations, while the KEGG pathway analysis identified five signalling pathways, from which the prolactin signalling pathway, endocrine resistance, and estrogen signalling pathway were implicated in the pathogenesis of melasma. These pathways were further connected by their linkage to ESR2 and ESR1., Of all Cassipourea metabolites and standards, with afzelechin having the highest docking score for both gens. Further binding interaction analysis showed that ESR2-bound tamoxifen had the highest binding free energy of -47.68 kcal/mol, however, among the interacting Cassipourea metabolites, sitosterol-glycoside exhibited the highest negative binding affinity for both ESR2 (-40.50 kcal/mol) and ESR1 (-78.97 kcal/mol) over 150 ns simulation, suggesting its potential as a dual modulator. Altogether, the metabolites presented remarkable binding stability and thermodynamic compactness with the apo-genes. Conclusion The finding that the selected Cassipourea metabolites are associated with the genes and enzymes implicated in melasma pathogenesis, together with their significant binding effects on the enriched genes, suggests their regulatory potential on the profiled targets and, consequently, in the treatment of melasma.

                Abstract* Background Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely used in the biomedical field due to its outstanding biological and mechanical properties. Originally employed as a temporary abutment in implantology, recent research has expanded its indications for more definitive applications, such as frameworks and dental post and core. This shift requires a thorough assessment of PEEK’s adhesion and mechanical characteristics. However, PEEK’s inert properties and intricate chemistry create difficulties in surface treatment, resulting in reduced surface energy and inadequate adhesion. Inducing specific physical and chemical changes aims to overcome these challenges and enhance adhesion for PEEK. Despite its numerous clinical trials, standardized protocols remain lacking. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of surface treatments on the bonding performance of PEEK posts. Methods A detailed search of the literature will be conducted across several databases including PubMed, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Additional databases such as Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Web of Science and EBSCO will also be included. The search strategy will target controlled randomized studies and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of surface treatments on PEEK post adhesion strength. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used to assess bias in non-randomized studies, while the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB II) tool will be employed for evaluating randomized controlled trials. Data extraction will focus on study design, treatment methods, outcomes and results. This systematic review protocol will adhere to the guidelines for systematic reviews outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion The discussion will explore the implications of findings on clinical practice, highlighting the importance of enhancing PEEK’s bioactivity and surface energy to improve bonding efficacy in dental procedures. Moreover, it will suggest areas for future research to advance dental materials science, aiming to optimize the utilization of PEEK in dental applications Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42024529783 (Registered on 08/04/2024).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-950/v1?src=rss">The epidemiologic case for urban health: conceptualizing and measuring the magnitude of challenges and potential benefits [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We discuss how epidemiology has been and can continue to be used to advance understanding of the links between urban areas and health informed by an existing urban-health conceptual framework. This framework considers urban areas as contexts for health, determinants of health and modifiers of health pathways, and part of a complex system that affects health. We highlight opportunities for descriptive epidemiology to inform the context of urban health, for example, by characterizing the social and physical environments that give rise to health and the actions that change those conditions. We then describe inferential tools for evaluating the impact of group-level actions (e.g., interventions, policies) on urban health, providing some examples, and describing assumptions and challenges. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges of applying systems thinking and methods to advance urban health. While different conceptual frames lead to different insights, each perspective demonstrates that urban health is a major and growing challenge. The effectiveness of urban health knowledge, action, and policy as the world continues to urbanize can be informed by applying and expanding upon research and surveillance methods described here.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94931">A ‘double-edged’ role for type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptors in pain disclosed by light-sensitive drugs</a></h4>

              
                We used light-sensitive drugs to identify the brain region-specific role of mGlu5 metabotropic glutamate receptors in the control of pain. Optical activation of systemic JF-NP-26, a caged, normally inactive, negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of mGlu5 receptors, in cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices and thalamus inhibited neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. Systemic treatment of alloswitch-1, an intrinsically active mGlu5 receptor NAM, caused analgesia, and the effect was reversed by light-induced drug inactivation in the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, and thalamus. This demonstrates that mGlu5 receptor blockade in the medial prefrontal cortex and thalamus is both sufficient and necessary for the analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. Surprisingly, when the light was delivered in the basolateral amygdala, local activation of systemic JF-NP-26 reduced pain thresholds, whereas inactivation of alloswitch-1 enhanced analgesia. Electrophysiological analysis showed that alloswitch-1 increased excitatory synaptic responses in prelimbic pyramidal neurons evoked by stimulation of presumed BLA input, and decreased BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of amygdala output neurons. Both effects were reversed by optical silencing and reinstated by optical reactivation of alloswitch-1. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the action of mGlu5 receptors in the pain neuraxis is not homogenous, and suggest that blockade of mGlu5 receptors in the BLA may limit the overall analgesic activity of mGlu5 receptor antagonists. This could explain the suboptimal effect of mGlu5 NAMs on pain in human studies and validate photopharmacology as an important tool to determine ideal target sites for systemic drugs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89936">Task-specific invariant representation in auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Categorical sensory representations are critical for many behaviors, including speech perception. In the auditory system, categorical information is thought to arise hierarchically, becoming increasingly prominent in higher-order cortical regions. The neural mechanisms that support this robust and flexible computation remain poorly understood. Here, we studied sound representations in the ferret primary and non-primary auditory cortex while animals engaged in a challenging sound discrimination task. Population-level decoding of simultaneously recorded single neurons revealed that task engagement caused categorical sound representations to emerge in non-primary auditory cortex. In primary auditory cortex, task engagement caused a general enhancement of sound decoding that was not specific to task-relevant categories. These findings are consistent with mixed selectivity models of neural disentanglement, in which early sensory regions build an overcomplete representation of the world and allow neurons in downstream brain regions to flexibly and selectively read out behaviorally relevant, categorical information.
