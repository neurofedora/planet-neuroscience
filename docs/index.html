In particular, studies demonstrate that plasticity in the central nucleus (CeA) is critical for the acquisition of conditioned fear. In addition, a variety of interneuron populations within the amygdala, defined by unique neurochemical markers, contribute to distinct aspects of stimulus processing and memory formation during fear conditioning.

<p>Focal epilepsy is a devastating neurological disorder that affects an
overwhelming number of patients worldwide, many of whom prove resistant to
medication. The efficacy of current innovative technologies for the treatment
of these patients has been stalled by the lack of accurate and effective
methods to fuse multimodal neuroimaging data to map anatomical targets driving
seizure dynamics. Here we propose a parsimonious model that explains how
large-scale anatomical networks and shared genetic constraints shape
inter-regional communication in focal epilepsy. In extensive ECoG recordings
acquired from a group of patients with medically refractory focal-onset
epilepsy, we find that ictal and preictal functional brain network dynamics can
be accurately predicted from features of brain anatomy and geometry, patterns
of white matter connectivity, and constraints complicit in patterns of gene
coexpression, all of which are conserved across healthy adult populations.
Moreover, we uncover evidence that markers of non-conserved architecture,
potentially driven by idiosyncratic pathology of single subjects, are most
prevalent in high frequency ictal dynamics and low frequency preictal dynamics.
Finally, we find that ictal dynamics are better predicted by white matter
features and more poorly predicted by geometry and genetic constraints than
preictal dynamics, suggesting that the functional brain network dynamics
manifest in seizures rely on - and may directly propagate along - underlying
white matter structure that is largely conserved across humans. Broadly, our
work offers insights into the generic architectural principles of the human
brain that impact seizure dynamics, and could be extended to further our
understanding, models, and predictions of subject-level pathology and response
to intervention.

<p>We consider the problem of localization of sources of brain electrical
activity from electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG)
measurements using spatial filtering techniques. We propose novel reduced-rank
activity indices based on the minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank
estimation (MV-PURE) framework. The main results of this paper establish the
key unbiasedness property of the proposed indices and their higher spatial
resolution compared with full-rank indices in challenging task of localizing
closely positioned and possibly highly correlated sources, especially in low
signal-to-noise regime. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the
practical applicability of the proposed activity indices. Simulations presented
in this paper use open-source EEG/MEG spatial filtering framework freely
available at https://github.com/IS-UMK/supFunSim.git.

<p>Existing brain network distances are often based on matrix norms. The
element-wise differences in the existing matrix norms may fail to capture
underlying topological differences. Further, matrix norms are sensitive to
outliers. A major disadvantage to element-wise distance calculations is that it
could be severely affected even by a small number of extreme edge weights. Thus
it is necessary to develop network distances that recognize topology. In this
paper, we provide a survey of bottleneck, Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distances that are adapted for brain networks, and
compare them against matrix-norm based network distances. Bottleneck and
GH-distances are often used in persistent homology. However, they were rarely
utilized to measure similarity between brain networks. KS-distance is recently
introduced to measure the similarity between networks across different
filtration values. The performance analysis was conducted using the random
network simulations with the ground truths. Using a twin imaging study, which
provides biological ground truth, we demonstrate that the KS distance has the
ability to determine heritability.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03490">Can quantum physics help solve the hard problem of consciousness? A hypothesis based on entangled spins and photons. (arXiv:1809.03490v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The hard problem of consciousness is the question how subjective experience
arises from brain matter. I suggest exploring the possibility that quantum
physics could be part of the answer. The simultaneous unity and complexity of
subjective experience is difficult to understand from a classical physics
perspective. In contrast, quantum entanglement is naturally both complex and
unified. Moreover the concept of matter is much more subtle in quantum physics
compared to classical physics, and quantum computing shows that quantum effects
can be useful for information processing. Building on recent progress in
quantum technology and neuroscience, I propose a concrete hypothesis as a basis
for further investigation, namely that subjective experience is related to the
dynamics of a complex entangled state of spins, which is continuously generated
and updated through the exchange of photons. Spins in condensed matter systems
at room or body temperature can have coherence times in the relevant range for
subjective experience (milliseconds to seconds). Photons are well suited for
distributing entanglement over macroscopic distances. Neurons emit photons,
reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria being likely sources. Opsins,
light-sensitive proteins that are plausible single-photon detectors, exist in
the brain and are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that they serve a
function. We have recently shown by detailed numerical modeling that axons can
plausibly act as photonic waveguides. The oxygen molecule, which has non-zero
electronic spin and emits photons, might serve as an interface between photons
and spins. The achievable photon rates seem to be more than sufficient to
support the bandwidth of subjective experience. The proposed hypothesis raises
many interesting experimental and theoretical questions in neuroscience,
quantum physics, evolutionary biology, psychophysics, and philosophy.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Hemodynamic signals are routinely used to noninvasively assess brain function in humans and animals. This work examined the contribution of inhibitory neuron activity on hemodynamic responses captured by changes in blood flow, volume and oxygenation in the cortex of lightly anesthetized mice. Because cortical activity is not commonly initiated by inhibitory neurons, experiments were conducted to examine the neuronal activity properties elicited by photo-stimulation. We observed comparable increases in neuronal activity evoked by forelimb and photo-stimulation; however, significantly larger increases in blood flow and volume were produced by photo-stimulation of inhibitory neurons compared with forelimb stimulation. Following blockade of glutamate and GABA-A receptors to reduce postsynaptic activity contributions, neuronal activity was reliably modulated and hemodynamic changes persisted, though slightly reduced. More importantly, photo-stimulation-evoked changes in blood flow and volume were suppressed by 75–80% with the administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, suggesting that inhibitory neurons regulate blood flow mostly via nitric oxide. Lastly, forelimb and photo-stimulation of excitatory neurons produced local decreases in blood oxygenation, while large increases were generated by photo-stimulation of inhibitory neurons. Estimates of oxygen metabolism suggest that inhibitory neuron activity has a small impact on tissue metabolic load, indicating a mismatch between the metabolic demand and blood flow regulation properties of inhibitory and excitatory neurons.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In nonhuman mammals and in particular in rodents, most granule neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) are generated during development and yet little is known about their properties compared with adult-born neurons. Although it is generally admitted that these populations are morphologically indistinguishable once mature, a detailed analysis of developmentally born neurons is lacking. Here, we used in vivo electroporation to label dentate granule cells (DGCs) generated in mouse embryos (E14.5) or in neonates (P0) and followed their morphological development up to 6 months after birth. By comparison with mature retrovirus-labeled DGCs born at weaning (P21) or young adult (P84) stages, we provide the evidence that perinatally born neurons, especially embryonically born cells, are morphologically distinct from later-born neurons and are thus easily distinguishable. In addition, our data indicate that semilunar and hilar GCs, 2 populations in ectopic location, are generated during the embryonic and the neonatal periods, respectively. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the development of the different populations of GCs in the DG and open new questions regarding their function in the brain.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Visual working memory (VWM) distinguishes between representations relevant for imminent versus future perceptual goals. We investigated how the brain sequentially prioritizes visual working memory representations that serve consecutive tasks. Observers remembered two targets for a sequence of two visual search tasks, thus making one target currently relevant, and the other prospectively relevant. We show that during the retention interval prior to the first search, lateralized parieto-occipital EEG alpha (8–14 Hz) suppression is stronger for current compared with prospective search targets. Crucially, between the first and second search task, this difference in posterior alpha lateralization reverses, reflecting the change in priority states of the two target representations. Connectivity analyses indicate that this switch in posterior alpha lateralization is driven by frontal delta/low-theta (2–6 Hz) activity. Moreover, this frontal low-frequency signal also predicts task performance after the switch. We thus obtained evidence for large-scale network interactions underlying the flexible shifting between the priority states of multiple memory representations in VWM.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Alpha oscillations are known to play a central role in the functional inhibition of visual cortices, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. One noninvasive method for modulating alpha activity experimentally is through the use of flickering visual stimuli that “entrain” visual cortices. Such alpha entrainment has been found to compromise visual perception and affect widespread cortical regions, but it remains unclear how the interference occurs and whether the widespread activity induced by alpha entrainment reflects a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the entrainment, or alternatively, a propagated interference signal that translates to impaired visual processing. Herein, we attempt to address these questions by integrating alpha entrainment into a modified Posner cueing paradigm, while measuring the underlying dynamics using magnetoencephalography. Our findings indicated that alpha entrainment is negatively related to task performance, such that as neural entrainment increases on the attended side (relative to the unattended side) accuracy decreases. Further, this attentional biasing is found to covary robustly with activity in the frontoparietal attention network. Critically, the observed negative entrainment effect on task accuracy was also fully mediated by activity in frontoparietal regions, signifying a propagation of the interfering alpha entrainment signal from bottom-up sensory to top-down regulatory networks.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>People who score higher on intelligence tests tend to have larger brains. Twin studies suggest the same genetic factors influence both brain size and intelligence. This has led to the hypothesis that genetics influence intelligence partly by contributing to the development of larger brains. We tested this hypothesis using four large imaging genetics studies (combined <span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 7965) with polygenic scores derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment, a correlate of intelligence. We conducted meta-analysis to test associations among participants’ genetics, total brain volume (i.e., brain size), and cognitive test performance. Consistent with previous findings, participants with higher polygenic scores achieved higher scores on cognitive tests, as did participants with larger brains. Participants with higher polygenic scores also had larger brains. We found some evidence that brain size partly mediated associations between participants’ education polygenic scores and their cognitive test performance. Effect sizes were larger in the population-based samples than in the convenience-based samples. Recruitment and retention of population-representative samples should be a priority for neuroscience research. Findings suggest promise for studies integrating GWAS discoveries with brain imaging to understand neurobiology linking genetics with cognitive performance.</span>

<p>by Sergi Elizalde, Ashley M. Laughney, Samuel F. Bakhoum</p>

Cancer cells frequently undergo chromosome missegregation events during mitosis, whereby the copies of a given chromosome are not distributed evenly among the two daughter cells, thus creating cells with heterogeneous karyotypes. A stochastic model tracing cellular karyotypes derived from clonal populations over hundreds of generations was recently developed and experimentally validated, and it was capable of predicting favorable karyotypes frequently observed in cancer. Here, we construct and study a Markov chain that precisely describes karyotypic evolution during clonally expanding cancer cell populations. The Markov chain allows us to directly predict the distribution of karyotypes and the expected size of the tumor after many cell divisions without resorting to computationally expensive simulations. We determine the limiting karyotype distribution of an evolving tumor population, and quantify its dependency on several key parameters including the initial karyotype of the founder cell, the rate of whole chromosome missegregation, and chromosome-specific cell viability. Using this model, we confirm the existence of an optimal rate of chromosome missegregation probabilities that maximizes karyotypic heterogeneity, while minimizing the occurrence of nullisomy. Interestingly, karyotypic heterogeneity is significantly more dependent on chromosome missegregation probabilities rather than the number of cell divisions, so that maximal heterogeneity can be reached rapidly (within a few hundred generations of cell division) at chromosome missegregation rates commonly observed in cancer cell lines. Conversely, at low missegregation rates, heterogeneity is constrained even after thousands of cell division events. This leads us to conclude that chromosome copy number heterogeneity is primarily constrained by chromosome missegregation rates and the risk for nullisomy and less so by the age of the tumor. This model enables direct integration of karyotype information into existing models of tumor evolution based on somatic mutations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wd2yu28uKWQ" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent co-morbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these co-morbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared 2 months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop co-morbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus-vs.-estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with co-morbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> People with epilepsy are at higher risk of reproductive endocrine disorders compared with the general population, but the neural mechanisms linking epilepsy and these co-morbidities are unknown. Here we report changes in the function of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, which control fertility, in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. GnRH neurons from epileptic female mice showed changes in activity dependent on estrous cycle stage and associated with severity of cycle disruption. The impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neurons in males were less severe. These findings provide novel evidence for impacts of epilepsy on GnRH neuron function, and will thus be of clinical relevance in developing new strategies to ameliorate reproductive co-morbidities and to treat the underlying seizures and epilepsy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0169-18.2018v1?rss=1">Strategic and dynamic temporal weighting for perceptual decisions in humans and macaques</a></h4>

ABSTRACT<p>Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late-weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory stimuli in decision-making tasks.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During decision-making, the weight assigned by subjects to sensory information over time is not necessarily constant. Such time-varying weighting is often interpreted as a signature of a particular decision-making model (e.g., higher weighting of early stimulus information is consistent with a bounded accumulation process). Temporal weighting may also result, however, from a strategic reweighting of the stimulus evidence itself that takes place before and/or independent of a decision-making mechanism. Here we use a psychophysical reverse correlation paradigm to both measure and manipulate temporal weighting behavior. We demonstrate that both humans and macaques adopt weighting strategies that are flexible, consistent with dynamic reweighing of the sensory stimulus.</p>

Abstract<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused in most cases by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (<i>MECP2</i>). Understanding the pathological processes impacting sensory-motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by RTT, but the underlying molecular and neuronal modifications remain unclear. We find that symptomatic male <i>Mecp2</i> knockout (KO) mice show atypically elevated parvalbumin (PV) expression in both somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices together with excessive excitatory inputs converging onto PV-expressing interneurons (INs). In accordance, high-speed voltage-sensitive dye imaging shows reduced amplitude and spatial spread of synaptically induced neuronal depolarizations in S1 of <i>Mecp2</i> KO mice. Moreover, motor learning-dependent changes of PV expression and structural synaptic plasticity typically occurring on PV+ INs in M1 are impaired in symptomatic <i>Mecp2</i> KO mice. Finally, we find similar abnormalities of PV networks plasticity in symptomatic female <i>Mecp2</i> heterozygous mice. These results indicate that in <i>Mecp2</i> mutant mice the configuration of PV+ INs network is shifted toward an atypical plasticity state in relevant cortical areas compatible with the sensory-motor dysfunctions characteristics of RTT.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Understanding the pathological processes impacting somatosensory processing and motor control represents a major challenge for clinical management of individuals affected by Rett syndrome. We found that <i>Mecp2</i> is important, starting from young age, for the correct molecular and synaptic organization of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in cortical areas responsible for sensory-motor skills. Intriguingly, even partial <i>Mecp2</i> loss produces an atypical upregulation of parvalbumin expression in these cells that correlates with the severity of motor behavioral impairments and is associated with defective cortical activity in KO mice. Because in behaviorally impaired <i>Mecp2</i> KO mice excessive activity-dependent excitatory connectivity is established with these interneurons, our study suggests that partial inhibition of parvalbumin-positive cells would be beneficial for motor impairments in Rett syndrome.</p>

However, recent progress in our molecular understanding of Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity supports the observation that these two types of plasticity share common cellular events, and are often altered together in neurological diseases. Here, we discuss the emerging concept of homeostatic synaptic plasticity as a metaplasticity mechanism with a focus on cellular signaling processes that enable a direct interaction between Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity. We also identify distinct and shared molecular players involved in these cellular processes that may be explored experimentally in future studies to test the hypothesis that homeostatic synaptic plasticity serves as a metaplasticity mechanism to integrate changes in neuronal activity and support optimal Hebbian learning.</p></div>

<p>This work presents an innovative application of the well-known concept of
cortico-muscular coherence for the classification of various motor tasks, i.e.,
grasps of different kinds of objects. Our approach can classify objects with
different weights (motor-related features) and different surface frictions
(haptics-related features) with high accuracy (over 0:8). The outcomes
presented here provide information about the synchronization existing between
the brain and the muscles during specific activities; thus, this may represent
a new effective way to perform activity recognition.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03142">Fast and Efficient Information Transmission with Burst Spikes in Deep Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:1809.03142v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>The spiking neural networks (SNNs), the 3rd generation of neural networks,
are considered as one of the most promising artificial neural networks due to
their energy-efficient computing capability. Despite their potential, the SNNs
have a limited applicability owing to difficulties in training. Recently,
conversion of a trained deep neural network (DNN) model to an SNN model has
been extensively studied as an alternative approach. The result appears to be
comparable to that of the DNN in image classification tasks. However, rate
coding, one of the techniques used in modeling the SNNs, suffers from long
latency due to its inability to transmit sufficient information to a subsequent
neuron and this could have a catastrophic effect on a deeper SNN model. Another
type of neural coding, called phase coding, also determines the amount of
information being transmitted according to a global reference oscillator, and
therefore, is inefficient in hidden layers where dynamics of neurons can
change. In this paper, we propose a deep SNN model that can transmit
information faster, and more efficiently between neurons by adopting a notion
of burst spiking. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid neural coding scheme
that uses different neural coding schemes for different types of layers. Our
experimental results for various image classification datasets, such as MNIST,
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, showed that the proposed methods can improve inference
efficiency and shorten the latency while preserving high accuracy. Lastly, we
validated the proposed methods through firing pattern analysis.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02849">Context-dependent architecture of brain state dynamics is explained by white matter connectivity and theories of network control. (arXiv:1809.02849v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>A diverse white matter network and finely tuned neuronal membrane properties
allow the brain to transition seamlessly between cognitive states. However, it
remains unclear how static structural connections guide the temporal
progression of large-scale brain activity patterns in different cogni- tive
states. Here, we deploy an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to define
brain states as time point level activity patterns from functional magnetic
resonance imaging data acquired dur- ing passive visual fixation (rest) and an
n-back working memory task. We find that brain states are composed of
interdigitated functional networks and exhibit context-dependent dynamics.
Using diffusion-weighted imaging acquired from the same subjects, we show that
structural connectivity constrains the temporal progression of brain states. We
also combine tools from network control theory with geometrically conservative
null models to demonstrate that brains are wired to sup- port states of high
activity in default mode areas, while requiring relatively low energy. Finally,
we show that brain state dynamics change throughout development and explain
working mem- ory performance. Overall, these results elucidate the structural
underpinnings of cognitively and developmentally relevant spatiotemporal brain
dynamics.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38369">Tracing a protein's folding pathway over evolutionary time using ancestral sequence reconstruction and hydrogen exchange</a></h4>

The conformations populated during protein folding have been studied for decades; yet, their evolutionary importance remains largely unexplored. Ancestral sequence reconstruction allows access to proteins across evolutionary time, and new methods such as pulsed-labeling hydrogen exchange coupled with mass spectrometry allow determination of folding intermediate structures at near amino-acid resolution. Here, we combine these techniques to monitor the folding of the ribonuclease H family along the evolutionary lineages of <i>T. thermophilus </i>and <i>E. coli</i> RNase H. All homologs and ancestral proteins studied populate a similar folding intermediate despite being separated by billions of years of evolution. Even though this conformation is conserved, the pathway leading to it has diverged over evolutionary time, and rational mutations can alter this trajectory. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary processes can affect the energy landscape to preserve or alter specific features of a protein's folding pathway.

The mitochondrion of apicomplexan parasites is critical for parasite survival, although the full complement of proteins that localize to this organelle has not been defined. Here we undertake two independent approaches to elucidate the mitochondrial proteome of the apicomplexan <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. We identify approximately 400 mitochondrial proteins, many of which lack homologs in the animals that these parasites infect, and most of which are important for parasite growth. We demonstrate that one such protein, termed <i>Tg</i>ApiCox25, is an important component of the parasite cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (COX) complex. We identify numerous other apicomplexan-specific components of COX, and conclude that apicomplexan COX, and apicomplexan mitochondria more generally, differ substantially in their protein composition from the hosts they infect. Our study highlights the diversity that exists in mitochondrial proteomes across the eukaryotic domain of life, and provides a foundation for defining unique aspects of mitochondrial biology in an important phylum of parasites.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38097">Identification of cryptic subunits from an apicomplexan ATP synthase</a></h4>

The mitochondrial ATP synthase is a macromolecular motor that uses the proton gradient to generate ATP. Proper ATP synthase function requires a stator linking the catalytic and rotary portions of the complex. However, sequence-based searches fail to identify genes encoding stator subunits in apicomplexan parasites like <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> or the related organisms that cause malaria. Here, we identify 11 previously unknown subunits from the <i>Toxoplasma</i> ATP synthase, which lack homologs outside the phylum. Modeling suggests that two of them, ICAP2 and ICAP18, are distantly related to mammalian stator subunits. Our analysis shows that both proteins form part of the ATP synthase complex. Depletion of ICAP2 leads to aberrant mitochondrial morphology, decreased oxygen consumption, and disassembly of the complex, consistent with its role as an essential component of the <i>Toxoplasma</i> ATP synthase. Our findings highlight divergent features of the central metabolic machinery in apicomplexans, which may reveal new therapeutic opportunities.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37295">Biophysical properties of single rotavirus particles account for the functions of protein shells in a multilayered virus</a></h4>

The functions performed by the concentric shells of multilayered dsRNA viruses require specific protein interactions that can be directly explored through their mechanical properties. We studied the stiffness, breaking force, critical strain and mechanical fatigue of individual Triple, Double and Single layered rotavirus (RV) particles. Our results, in combination with Finite Element simulations, demonstrate that the mechanics of the external layer provides the resistance needed to counteract the stringent conditions of extracellular media. Our experiments, in combination with electrostatic analyses, reveal a strong interaction between the two outer layers and how it is suppressed by the removal of calcium ions, a key step for transcription initiation. The intermediate layer presents weak hydrophobic interactions with the inner layer that allow the assembly and favor the conformational dynamics needed for transcription. Our work shows how the biophysical properties of the three shells are finely tuned to produce an infective RV virion.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37125">The influence of the descending pain modulatory system on infant pain-related brain activity</a></h4>

The descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) constitutes a network of widely distributed brain regions whose integrated function is essential for effective modulation of sensory input to the central nervous system and behavioural responses to pain. Animal studies demonstrate that young rodents have an immature DPMS, but comparable studies have not been conducted in human infants. In Goksan et al. (2015) we used functional MRI (fMRI) to show that pain-related brain activity in newborn infants is similar to that observed in adults. Here, we investigated whether the functional network connectivity strength across the infant DPMS influences the magnitude of this brain activity. FMRI scans were collected while mild mechanical noxious stimulation was applied to the infant’s foot. Greater pre-stimulus functional network connectivity across the DPMS was significantly associated with lower noxious-evoked brain activity (p = 0.0004, r = -0.86, n = 13), suggesting that in newborn infants the DPMS may regulate the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36428">Oligodendrocyte-encoded Kir4.1 function is required for axonal integrity</a></h4>

Glial support is critical for normal axon function and can become dysregulated in white matter (WM) disease. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of <i>KCNJ10, </i>which encodes the inward-rectifying potassium channel KIR4.1, causes seizures and progressive neurological decline. We investigated Kir4.1 functions in oligodendrocytes (OLs) during development, adulthood and after WM injury. We observed that Kir4.1 channels localized to perinodal areas and the inner myelin tongue, suggesting roles in juxta-axonal K<sup>+</sup> removal. Conditional knockout (cKO) of OL-<i>Kcnj10</i> resulted in late onset mitochondrial damage and axonal degeneration. This was accompanied by neuronal loss and neuro-axonal dysfunction in adult OL-<i>Kcnj10</i> cKO mice as shown by delayed visual evoked potentials, inner retinal thinning and progressive motor deficits. Axon pathologies in OL-<i>Kcnj10</i> cKO were exacerbated after WM injury in the spinal cord. Our findings point towards a critical role of OL-Kir4.1 for long-term maintenance of axon function and integrity during adulthood and after WM injury.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36234">Sex-dependent effects of in utero cannabinoid exposure on cortical function</a></h4>

Cannabinoids can cross the placenta, thus may interfere with fetal endocannabinoid signaling during neurodevelopment, causing long-lasting deficits. Despite increasing reports of cannabis consumption during pregnancy, the protracted consequences of prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE) remain incompletely understood. Here we report sex-specific differences in behavioral and neuronal deficits in the adult progeny of rat dams exposed to low doses of cannabinoids during gestation. In males, PCE reduced social interaction, ablated endocannabinoid long-term depression (LTD) and heightened excitability of prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons, while females were spared. Group 1 mGluR and endocannabinoid signaling regulate emotional behavior and synaptic plasticity. Notably, sex-differences following PCE included levels of mGluR1/5 and TRPV1R mRNA. Finally, positive allosteric modulation of mGlu5 and enhancement of anandamide levels restored LTD and social interaction in PCE adult males. Together, these results highlight marked sexual differences in the effects of PCE and introduce strategies for reversing detrimental effects of PCE.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35066">Bleaching causes loss of disease resistance within the threatened coral species <i>Acropora cervicornis</i></a></h4>

Determining the adaptive potential of foundation species, such as reef-building corals, is urgent as the oceans warm and coral populations decline. Theory predicts that corals may adapt to climate change via selection on standing genetic variation. Yet, corals face not only rising temperatures but also novel diseases. We studied the interaction between two major stressors affecting colonies of the threatened coral, <i>Acropora cervicornis</i>: white-band disease and high water temperature. We determined that 27% of <i>A. cervicornis</i> were disease resistant prior to a thermal anomaly. However, disease resistance was largely lost during a bleaching event because of more compromised coral hosts or increased pathogenic dose/virulence. There was no tradeoff between disease resistance and temperature tolerance; disease susceptibility was independent of <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain. The present study shows that susceptibility to temperature stress creates an increased risk in disease-associated mortality, and only rare genets may maintain or gain infectious disease resistance under high temperature. We conclude that <i>A. cervicornis</i> populations in the lower Florida Keys harbor few existing genotypes that are resistant to both warming and disease.

Locomotion circuits developed in simple animals, and circuit motifs further evolved in higher animals. To understand locomotion circuit motifs, they must be characterized in many models. The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> possesses one of the best-studied circuits for undulatory movement. Yet, for 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the cholinergic motor neurons (MNs), the AS MNs, functional information is unavailable. Ventral nerve cord (VNC) MNs coordinate undulations, in small circuits of complementary neurons innervating opposing muscles. AS MNs differ, as they innervate muscles and other MNs asymmetrically, without complementary partners. We characterized AS MNs by optogenetic, behavioral and imaging analyses. They generate asymmetric muscle activation, enabling navigation, and contribute to coordination of dorso-ventral undulation as well as anterio-posterior bending wave propagation. AS MN activity correlated with forward and backward locomotion, and they functionally connect to premotor interneurons (PINs) for both locomotion regimes. Electrical feedback from AS MNs via gap junctions may affect only backward PINs.

Clearance of mitochondria following damage is critical for neuronal homeostasis. Here, we investigate the role of Miro proteins in mitochondrial turnover by the PINK1 / Parkin mitochondrial quality control system in vitro and in vivo. We find that upon mitochondrial damage, Miro is promiscuously ubiquitinated on multiple lysine residues. Combined knockout of both Miro1 and Miro2 or block of Miro ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, lead to slowed mitophagy. In cultured neurons, Miro1 knockout also leads to delayed Parkin translocation onto damaged mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial clearance. In vivo, postnatal knockout of Miro1 in hippocampus and cortex disrupts mitophagy and leads to a dramatic age dependent upregulation of the mitofusin mitochondrial fusion machinery. Fluorescence imaging of aged neurons conditionally knocked out for Miro1 and expressing mitoDendra to label mitochondria in vivo, reveals that Mfn1 / Mfn2 upregulation leads to enlarged and hyperfused somatic mitochondria. Our results provide new insights into the role of Miro in PINK1/Parkin dependent mitophagy and further suggest that disruption of this regulation may be implicated in human neurological pathology.

Classification of neurons into specific subtypes is essential for better understanding of brain function and information transmission. Despite continuous progress, there is still no consensus regarding categorizing neuron taxonomy into proper subtypes. Current morphology-based classification approaches largely rely on the dendritic tree structure or on the general axonal projection layout. In this study, we support the use of a morphology-based classification approach, focusing on the axonal tree. We demonstrate that utilizing the geometrical parameters of axonal tree structures significantly improves neuronal classification compared to the dendritic tree classification. Furthermore, we used neuronal activity patterns to classify interneurons into subtypes as well. Simulations of the activity along ramified axonal trees indicate that the axonal branching geometry may yield diverse responses in different subtrees. The classification schemes introduced here can be utilized to robustly classify neuronal subtypes in a functionally relevant manner. Our results open the door for deducing functionality from anatomical data.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/414599v1?rss=1">Symbolic labelling in 5-month-old human infants</a></h4>

Humans naturally entertain complex representations of the world based on various symbolic systems, from natural language to mathematical or musical notation. Above and beyond mere perceptual representations, the adult human mind can recode sensory inputs into abstract symbolic representations that can be internally manipulated and projected back onto the external world. However, the ontogeny of this striking ability remains controversial: Are children progressively acquiring symbolic representations through language acquisition, or are mental representations symbolic from the very beginning, language learning consisting in mapping mental symbols onto public symbols? Using high-density electroencephalography, we show here that preverbal infants can form mental representations that feature symbolic attributes. In three experiments, a total of 150 five month-olds were exposed to triplet words characterized by their abstract syllabic structure (AAB/ABA/ABB) consistently followed by an arbitrary label. Subsequently, incongruent structure-label pairings evoked a late violation-of-expectations signal, whereas congruent pairings induced an early priming effect. Importantly, the late surprise response was recorded for incongruent pairs even when the pairing order was reversed at test (i.e. labels preceding structure). Our results indicate that first, far beyond habituation/dishabituation, preverbal infants are able to recode sensory inputs, into abstract mental representations to which arbitrary labels can be flexibly assigned. Second, we demonstrate that, beyond conditioned associations, this mapping is instantly bidirectional. These findings buttress the hypothesis of symbolic representations in preverbal infants, which may serve as a foundation for our distinctively human learning abilities.

Imagination is an internally-generated process, where one can make oneself or other people appear as protagonists of a scene. How does the brain tag the protagonist of an imagined scene, as being oneself or someone else? Crucially, neither external stimuli nor motor feedback are available during imagination to disentangle imagining oneself from imagining someone else. Here, we test the hypothesis that an internal mechanism based on the neural monitoring of heartbeats could distinguish between self and other. 23 participants imagined themselves (from a first-person perspective) or a friend (from a third-person perspective) in various scenarios, while their brain activity was recorded with magnetoencephalography and their cardiac activity was simultaneously monitored. We measured heartbeat-evoked responses, i.e. transients of neural activity occurring in response to each heartbeat, during imagination. The amplitude of heartbeat-evoked responses differed between imagining oneself and imagining a friend, in the precuneus, mid- and posterior cingulate regions bilaterally. Effect size was modulated by the general daydreaming frequency of participants but not by their interoceptive abilities. These results could not be accounted for by other characteristics of imagination (e.g., the ability to adopt the perspective, valence or arousal), nor by cardiac parameters (e.g., heart rate) or arousal levels. Heartbeat-evoked responses thus appear as a neural marker distinguishing self from other during imagination.

A major bottleneck to our understanding of the genetic and molecular foundation of life lies in the ability to assign function to a gene and, subsequently, a protein. Traditional molecular and genetic experiments can provide the most reliable forms of identification, but are generally low-throughput, making such discovery and assignment a daunting task. The bottleneck has led to an increasing role for computational approaches. The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) effort seeks to measure the performance of computational methods. In CAFA3 we performed selected screens, including an effort focused on long-term memory. We used homology and previous CAFA predictions to identify 29 key Drosophila genes, which we tested via a long-term memory screen. We identify 11 novel genes that are involved in long-term memory formation and show a high level of connectivity with previously identified learning and memory genes. Our study provides first higher-order behavioral assay and organism screen used for CAFA assessments and revealed previously uncharacterized roles of multiple genes as possible regulators of neuronal plasticity at the boundary of information acquisition and memory formation.

Social symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are typically viewed as consequences of an impaired Theory of Mind, i.e. the ability to understand others' covert mental states. Here, we test the assumption that such "mind blindness" may be due to the inability to exploit contextual knowledge about, e.g., the stakes of social interactions, to make sense of otherwise ambiguous cues (e.g., idiosyncratic responses to social competition). In this view, social cognition in ASD may simply reduce to non-social cognition, i.e. cognition that is not informed by the social context. We compared 24 adult participants with ASD to 24 neurotypic participants in a repeated dyadic competitive game against artificial agents with calibrated mentalizing sophistication. Critically, participants were framed to believe that they were competing against humans (social framing) or not (non-social framing), hence the "reverse Turing test". In contrast to control participants, the strategy of people with ASD is insensitive to the game's framing, i.e. they do not constrain their understanding of others' behaviour with the contextual knowledge about the game (cf. competitive social framing). They also outperform controls when playing against simple agents, but are outperformed by them against recursive algorithms framed as human opponents. Moreover, computational analyses of trial-by-trial choice sequences in the game show that individuals with ASD rely on a distinctive cognitive strategy with subnormal flexibility and mentalizing sophistication. These computational phenotypes yield 79% diagnosis classification accuracy and explain 62% of the severity of social symptoms in people with ASD.

Knowing how another's preferences relate to our own is a central aspect of everyday decision-making, yet how the brain performs this transformation is unclear. Here, we ask whether the putative role of the hippocampal-entorhinal system in transforming first person and extra-personal spatial cues during navigation extends to transformations in abstract decision spaces. In our functional magnetic resonance imaging study, subjects learned a stranger's preference for an everyday activity, relative to a personally known individual, and subsequently decided how the stranger's preference relates to other familiar people's preferences. Across reference frames, we observed signals in the retrosplenial cortex and hippocampal body during decisions that require precise memories for preferences. In contrast, the entorhinal cortex/subiculum exhibited reference frame-sensitive responses to the relative distance between the ratings of the stranger and the familiar choice options. Taken together, these data implicate the hippocampal-entorhinal system in the assimilation of knowledge in an abstract metric space.

It is considered that endogenous (voluntary) attention acts via top-down, and exogenous (involuntary) attention via bottom-up mechanisms, and that both affect visual areas similarly. Using an fMRI ROI-based analysis for occipital areas, we measured average fMRI activity for valid (target at cued location) and invalid (target at un-cued location) trials, for pre- or post-cueing in the endogenous and exogenous conditions independently, with same observers and task. The results show: (1) stronger effect for both types of attention in contralateral than ipsilateral regions to the attended hemifield; (2) higher fMRI activity at the valid- than invalid-cued locations; (3) increasing modulation of fMRI activity along the visual hierarchy for endogenous, but constant modulation for exogenous, pre-cueing; (4) constant modulation of endogenous along the visual area hierarchy, but no modulation for exogenous, post-cueing. Endogenous and exogenous attention distinctly modulate activity in visual areas due to their differential engagement of top-down and bottom-up processes.

A newly uncovered role for ATM protein deepens our understanding of the neurological symptoms of Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). With high energy demands, neurons of the brain, particularly Purkinje cells, require dynamic maintenance of ATP levels. ATM is the gene mutated in A-T and its deficiency compromises the activity of both the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). We show that ATP insufficiency activates ATM via reactive oxygen species. While resting ATP levels are normal, Atm-/- cells have a reduced capacity to respond to surges in energy demands. This blunted response results from impaired ATM-mediated activation of nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1). ATM phosphorylation of NRF1 at T259 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus and drives mitochondrial gene expression, allowing increased mitochondrial protein synthesis. Our findings thus identify ATM not only as a guardian of genomic integrity bu also of mitochondrial output, suggesting that alternate fuel sources may ameliorate or delay ataxic symptoms in A-T.

Visual search, looking for a target embedded among distractors, has long been used to study attention. Current theories postulate a two-stage process in which early visual areas perform feature extraction, while higher-order regions perform attentional selection. Such a model implies iterative communication between low- and high-level regions to sequentially select candidate targets in the array, focus attention on these elements, and eventually permit target recognition. This leads to two predictions: (1) high-level, attentional regions and (2) early visual regions should both be iteratively (periodically) involved during the search. Here, we used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) applied over the Frontal-Eye Field (FEF), known to be involved in attentional selection, at various delays while observers performed a difficult, attentional search task. We observed a periodic pattern of interference at 7 Hz (theta) suggesting that the FEF is periodically involved during this difficult search task. We further compared this result with two previous studies (Dugue et al., 2011; 2015a) in which a similar TMS procedure was applied over the early visual cortex (V1) while observers performed the same task. This analysis revealed, for both studies, the same pattern of interference, i.e. V1 is periodically involved during this difficult search task, at the theta frequency. Together, these converging findings confirm our predictions that difficult search is supported by the periodic involvement of both low- and high-level regions, at the theta frequency.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/414284v1?rss=1">A cortical route for face-like pattern processing in human newborns</a></h4>

Humans are endowed with an exceptional ability for detecting faces, a competence that in adults is supported by a set of face-specific cortical patches. Human newborns already shortly after birth preferentially orient to faces even when they are presented in the form of highly schematic geometrical patterns, over perceptually equivalent non-face like stimuli. The neural substrates underlying this early preference are still largely unexplored. Is the adult face specific cortical circuit already active at birth, or does its specialization develop slowly as a function of experience and/or maturation? We measured EEG responses in 1-4 days old awake, attentive human newborns to schematic face-like patterns and non-face-like control stimuli, visually presented with a slow oscillatory "peekaboo" dynamics (0.8 Hz) in a frequency-tagging design. Despite the limited duration of newborns' attention, reliable frequency-tagged responses could be estimated for each stimulus from the peak of the EEG power spectrum at the stimulation frequency. Upright face-like stimuli elicited a significantly stronger frequency-tagged response than inverted face-like controls in a large set of electrodes. Source reconstruction of the underlying cortical activity revealed the recruitment of a partially right-lateralized network comprising lateral occipito-temporal and medial parietal areas largely overlapping with the adult face-processing circuit. This result suggests that the cortical route specialized in face processing is already functional at birth.

Some scenes are more memorable than others: they cement in minds with consistencies across observers and time scales. While memory mechanisms are traditionally associated with the end stages of perception, recent behavioral studies suggest that the features driving these memorability effects are extracted early on, and in an automatic fashion. This raises the question: is the neural signal of memorability detectable during early perceptual encoding phases of visual processing? Using the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG), during a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, we traced the neural temporal signature of memorability across the brain. We found an early and prolonged memorability related signal recruiting a network of regions in both dorsal and ventral streams, detected outside of the constraints of subjective awareness. This enhanced encoding could be the key to successful storage and recognition.

Study of balance and gait deficits associated with vestibulopathy is important for improving clinical care and is critical to our understanding of the vestibular contributions to gait and balance control. Previous studies report a speed-dependency of the vestibular contributions to gait, so we examined the walking speed effects on gait variability in healthy adults and in adults with bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP). Forty four people with BVP and 12 healthy adults completed walking trials at 0.4m/s to 1.6m/s in 0.2m/s intervals on a dual belt, instrumented treadmill. Using a motion capture system and kinematic data, the means and coefficients of variation for step length, time, width and double support time were calculated. The BVP group also completed a video head impulse test and examinations of ocular and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials and dynamic visual acuity. Walking speed significantly affected all assessed parameters when considering all participants with BVP who completed the protocol (26 participants), as well as when only considering the slower speeds (except for mean step width). Step time and length variability at slower speeds and step width variability at faster speeds distinguished between the healthy and BVP group that completed the measurements, and the BVP group that partially completed the measurements. We observed for step width variability, specifically, an apparent persistent importance of vestibular function at increasing speeds. Gait variability was not associated with the clinical vestibular tests. Our results indicate that gait variability at multiple walking speeds has potential as an assessment tool for vestibular interventions.

Transsaccadic integration of visual features can operate in various frames of reference, but the corresponding neural mechanisms have not been differentiated. A recent fMRIa (adaptation) study identified two cortical regions in supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and extrastriate cortex that were sensitive to transsaccadic changes in stimulus orientation (Dunkley et al., 2016). Here, we modified this paradigm to identify the neural correlates for transsaccadic comparison of object orientations in: 1) Spatially Congruent (SC), 2) Retinally Congruent (RC) or 3) Spatially Incongruent (SI)) coordinates. Functional data were recorded from 12 human participants while they observed a grating (oriented 45 or 135 degrees) before a saccade, and then judged whether a post-saccadic grating (in SC, RC, or SI configuration) had the same or different orientation. Our analysis focused on areas that showed a significant repetition suppression (Different &gt; Same) or repetition enhancement (Same &gt; Different) BOLD responses. Several cortical areas were significantly modulated in all three conditions: premotor/motor cortex (likely related to the manual response), and posterior-middle intraparietal sulcus. In the SC condition, uniquely activated areas included left SMG and left lateral occipitotemporal gyrus (LOtG). In the RC condition, unique areas included inferior frontal gyrus and the left lateral BA 7. In the SI condition, uniquely activated areas included the frontal eye field, medial BA 7, and right LOtG. Overall, the SC results were significantly different from both RC and SI. These data suggest that different cortical networks are used to compare pre- and post-saccadic orientation information, depending on the spatial nature of the task.

Hallucinations are transmodal and transdiagnostic phenomena, occurring across sensory modalities and presenting in psychiatric, neurodegenerative, neurological, and non-clinical populations. Despite their cross-category occurrence, little empirical work has directly compared between-group neural correlates of hallucinations. We performed whole-brain voxelwise meta-analyses of hallucination status across diagnoses using AES-SDM, and conducted a comprehensive systematic review in PubMed and Web of Science until May 2018 on other structural correlates of hallucinations, including cortical thickness and gyrification. 3214 abstracts were identified. Patients with psychiatric disorders and hallucinations (eight studies) exhibited reduced gray matter (GM) in the left insula, right inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and increased in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, while patients with neurodegenerative disorders with hallucinations (eight studies) showed GM decreases in the left lingual gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus/parietal operculum, left parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, right thalamus, and right lateral occipital gyrus. Group differences between meta-analyses were formally confirmed and a jackknife sensitivity analysis established the reproducibility of results across nearly all study combinations. For other measures (28 studies), the most consistent findings associated with hallucination status were reduced cortical thickness in temporal gyri in schizophrenia and altered hippocampal volume in Parkinson's disease and dementia. Distinct patterns of neuroanatomical alteration characterize hallucination status in patients with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a plurality of anatomical signatures. This approach has implications for treatment, theoretical frameworks, and generates refutable predictions for hallucinations in other diseases and their occurrence within the general population.

Walking movements are orchestrated by the activation of a large number of muscles. The control of numerous muscles during walking is believed to be simplified by flexible activation of groups of muscles called muscle synergies. Although significant corticomuscular connectivity during walking has been reported, the level at which the cortex controls locomotor muscle activity (i.e., muscle synergy or individual muscle level) remains unclear. Here, we examined cortical involvement in muscle control during walking by brain decoding of the activation of muscle synergies and individual muscles from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using linear decoder models. First, we demonstrated that activation of locomotor muscle synergies was decoded from slow cortical waves with significant accuracy. In addition, we found that decoding accuracy for muscle synergy activation was greater than that for individual muscle activation and that decoding of individual muscle activation was based on muscle synergy-related cortical information. Taken together, these results provide indirect evidence that the cerebral cortex hierarchically controls multiple muscles through a few muscle synergies during walking. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of the cortex in muscular control during walking and could accelerate the development of effective brain-machine interfaces for people with locomotor disabilities.

Olfaction guides goal-directed behaviours including feeding. To investigate how central olfactory neural circuits control feeding behaviour in mice, we performed retrograde tracing from the lateral hypothalamus (LH), an important feeding centre. We observed a cluster of retrogradely labelled cells distributed in the posteroventral region of the olfactory peduncle. Histochemical analyses revealed that a majority of these retrogradely labelled projection neurons expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65/67), but not vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1). We named this region with GABAergic projection neurons the ventral olfactory nucleus (VON) to discriminate it from the conventional olfactory peduncle. VON neurons were less immunoreactive for DARPP-32, a striatal neuron marker, in comparison to those in the olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens, which distinguished the VON from the ventral striatum. Fluorescent labelling confirmed synaptic contacts between VON neurons and olfactory bulb projection neurons. Rabies-virus-mediated trans-synaptic labelling revealed that VON neurons received synaptic inputs from the olfactory bulb, other olfactory cortices, horizontal limb of the diagonal band, and prefrontal cortex. Collectively, these results identified novel GABAergic projection neurons in the olfactory cortex that can integrate olfactory sensory and top-down inputs and send inhibitory output to the LH, which may contribute to forming odour-guided LH-related behaviours.

Despite the hard-wired structural connectivity of neural pathways, neural circuits allow context-dependent reactions to sensory cues by triggering the desired movement. Cortico-basal-ganglia circuits seem particularly important for flexible motor control as this is impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). We analysed subthalamic nucleus (STN) spike and cortical ECoG activity from PD patients performing a visually-cued hand grip task. Fast reaction times were preceded by enhanced STN spike-to-cortical gamma phase coupling irrespective of firing rate changes, suggesting a role of gamma coupling in motor preparation. STN spike timing was offset by half a cycle when comparing ipsilateral with contralateral movements. Additionally, cortical high-frequency activity increased more steeply within each gamma cycle at the sites that showed the strongest coupling with STN spikes. Cortico-basal-ganglia gamma coupling may thus help shape neural activity to facilitate selective motor control. The observation that this effect occurs independent of changes in mean firing rate has far-reaching implications.

The network organization of the human brain varies across individuals, changes with development and aging, and differs in disease. Discovering the major dimensions along which this variability is displayed remains a central goal of both neuroscience and clinical medicine. Such efforts can be usefully framed within the context of the brain's modular network organization, which can be assessed quantitatively using powerful computational techniques and extended for the purposes of multi-scale analysis, dimensionality reduction, and biomarker generation. Though the concept of modularity and its utility in describing brain network organization is clear, principled methods for comparing multi-scale communities across individuals and time are surprisingly lacking. Here, we present a method that uses multi-layer networks to simultaneously discover the modular structure of many subjects at once. This method builds upon the well-known multi-layer modularity maximization technique, and provides a viable and principled tool for studying differences in network communities across individuals and within individuals across time. We test this method on two datasets and identify consistent patterns of inter-subject community variability, demonstrating that this variability -- which would be undetectable using past approaches -- is associated with measures of cognitive performance. In general, the multi-layer, multi-subject framework proposed here represents an advancement over current approaches by straighforwardly mapping community assignments across subjects and holds promise for future investigations of inter-subject community variation in clinical populations or as a result of task constraints.

There is convincing evidence that the deprivation of one sense can lead to adaptive neuronal changes in the spared primary sensory cortices. However, the repercussions of late-onset sensory deprivations on functionality of the remaining sensory cortices are poorly understood. Using repeated intrinsic signal imaging we investigated the effects of whisker or auditory deprivation (WD or AD, respectively) on responsiveness of the binocular primary visual cortex (V1) in fully adult mice. The binocular zone of mice is innervated by both eyes, with the contralateral eye always dominating V1 input over ipsilateral eye input, the normal ocular dominance (OD) ratio. Strikingly, we found that 3 days after WD or AD there was a transient shift of OD, which was mediated by a potentiation of V1 input through the ipsilateral eye. This cross-modal effect was accompanied by strengthening of V1 layer 4 synapses, required visual experience through the ipsilateral eye and was mediated by an increase of the excitation/inhibition ratio in V1. Finally, we demonstrate that both WD and AD induced a long-lasting improvement of visual performance. Our data provide evidence that the deprivation of a non-visual sensory modality cross-modally induces experience dependent V1 plasticity and improves visual behavior, even in adult mice.

A mutated KRAS protein is frequently observed in human cancers. Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. Here, by assessing the probabilities of occurrence of all <i>KRAS</i> G12X mutations and KRAS dynamics we show that this assumption does not hold true. Instead, our findings revealed an outstanding mutational bias. We conducted a thorough mutational analysis of <i>KRAS</i> G12X mutations and assessed to what extent the observed mutation frequencies follow a random distribution. Unique tissue-specific frequencies are displayed with specific mutations, especially with G12R, which cannot be explained by random probabilities. To clarify the underlying causes for the nonrandom probabilities, we conducted extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (170 μs) to study the differences of G12X mutations on a molecular level. The simulations revealed an allosteric hydrophobic signaling network in KRAS, and that protein dynamics is altered among the G12X mutants and as such differs from the wild-type and is mutation-specific. The shift in long-timescale conformational dynamics was confirmed with Markov state modeling. A G12X mutation was found to modify KRAS dynamics in an allosteric way, which is especially manifested in the switch regions that are responsible for the effector protein binding. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wdtS34DOZ6k" width="1" />

<p>by Fridolin Gross, Paolo Bonaiuti, Silke Hauf, Andrea Ciliberto</p>

The mitotic checkpoint (also called spindle assembly checkpoint) is a signaling pathway that ensures faithful chromosome segregation. Mitotic checkpoint proteins inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and its activator Cdc20 to prevent precocious anaphase. Checkpoint signaling leads to a complex of APC/C, Cdc20, and checkpoint proteins, in which the APC/C is inactive. In principle, this final product of the mitotic checkpoint can be obtained via different pathways, whose relevance still needs to be fully ascertained experimentally. Here, we use mathematical models to compare the implications on checkpoint response of the possible pathways leading to APC/C inhibition. We identify a previously unrecognized funneling effect for Cdc20, which favors Cdc20 incorporation into the inhibitory complex and therefore promotes checkpoint activity. Furthermore, we find that the presence or absence of one specific assembly reaction determines whether the checkpoint remains functional at elevated levels of Cdc20, which can occur in cancer cells. Our results reveal the inhibitory logics behind checkpoint activity, predict checkpoint efficiency in perturbed situations, and could inform molecular strategies to treat malignancies that exhibit Cdc20 overexpression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u46AEAiwxjk" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Promoter-based genetic recombination (<i>via</i> e.g. Cre-lox) is most useful when all cells of interest express a particular gene. The discovery that the actin-binding protein advillin is expressed in all somatic sensory neurons has been exploited repeatedly to drive DNA recombination therein, yet specificity of expression has not been well-demonstrated. Here we characterize advillin expression amongst sensory neurons, and in several other neural and non-neural tissues. We first validate an advillin antibody against advillin knockout tissue, advillin promoter-driven EGFP and advillin mRNA expression. In the dorsal root ganglion, advillin is enriched in non-peptidergic nociceptors. We also show that advillin expression, and advillin promotor-driven EGFP and Cre-recombinase expression, occurs in multiple tissues including the dorsal habenula of the epithalamus, endocrine cells of the gut, Merkel cells in the skin, and most strikingly, throughout the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric neurons) in mice, rats, and non-human primates. In the mouse pelvic ganglion, advillin immunoreactivity is most intense in pairs of small neurons, and concentrated in spine-like structures on the axon initial segment contacted by sympathetic preganglionic axons. In autonomic targets (iris and blood vessels), advillin is distributed along cholinergic parasympathetic axons and in sympathetic varicosities. Developmentally, advillin expression is absent from sympathetics at post-natal day 4, but begins to emerge by day 7, accounting for previous reports (based on embryonic expression) of advillin’s specificity to sensory neurons. These results indicate that caution is warranted in interpreting previous studies in which advillin-driven genomic editing is either constitutive or performed after post-natal day 4.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Cell-specific promoters are useful for effecting DNA recombination (e.g. via Cre-lox) for studies of lineage and gene function. Accordingly, advillin, an actin-binding protein expressed in all somatic sensory neurons, has proven valuable in manipulating gene expression therein. Whether advillin expression is <i>restricted</i> to sensory neurons, which is crucial to ascribing primary afferent-specific roles of particular genes, has not been established. Here we show that advillin is also expressed throughout the adult autonomic and enteric nervous systems, the habenula, and endocrine cells of the skin and gut. Thus, while advillin promoter activity remains useful in achieving recombination in sensory neurons (and some other cells), caution is warranted in interpreting results of experiments in which outcomes depend on multiple advillin-expressing tissues.</p>

<p>Electrons and photons offer complementary strengths for information
processing. Photons are excellent for communication, while electrons are
superior for computation and memory. Cognition requires distributed computation
to be communicated across the system for information integration. We present
reasoning from neuroscience, network theory, and device physics supporting the
conjecture that large-scale cognitive systems will benefit from electronic
devices performing synaptic, dendritic, and neuronal information processing
operating in conjunction with photonic communication. On the chip scale,
integrated dielectric waveguides enable fan-out to thousands of connections. On
the system scale, fiber and free-space optics can be employed. The largest
cognitive systems will be limited by the distance light can travel during the
period of a network oscillation. We calculate that optoelectronic networks the
area of a large data center ($10^5$\,m$^2$) will be capable of system-wide
information integration at $1$\,MHz. At frequencies of cortex-wide integration
in the human brain ($4$\,Hz, theta band), optoelectronic systems could
integrate information across the surface of the earth.

<p>Neural field models are commonly used to describe wave propagation and bump
attractors at a tissue level in the brain. Although motivated by biology, these
models are phenomenological in nature. They are built on the assumption that
the neural tissue operates in a near synchronous regime, and hence, cannot
account for changes in the underlying synchrony of patterns. It is customary to
use spiking neural network models when examining within population
synchronisation. Unfortunately, these high dimensional models are notoriously
hard to obtain insight from. In this paper, we consider a network of
$\theta$-neurons, which has recently been shown to admit an exact mean-field
description in the absence of a spatial component. We show that the inclusion
of space and a realistic synapse model leads to a reduced model that has many
of the features of a standard neural field model coupled to a further dynamical
equation that describes the evolution of network synchrony. Both Turing
instability analysis and numerical continuation software are used to explore
the existence and stability of spatio-temporal patterns in the system. In
particular, we show that this new model can support states above and beyond
those seen in a standard neural field model. These states are typified by
structures within bumps and waves showing the dynamic evolution of population
synchrony.

subjects watching color natural movies and compute deep representations of

<p>Recurrent neural networks have been extensively studied in the context of
neuroscience and machine learning due to their ability to implement complex
computations. While substantial progress in designing effective learning
algorithms has been achieved in the last years, a full understanding of trained
recurrent networks is still lacking. Specifically, the mechanisms that allow
computations to emerge from the underlying recurrent dynamics are largely
unknown. Here we focus on a simple, yet underexplored computational setup: a
feedback architecture trained to associate a stationary output to a stationary
input. By deriving an approximate mean-field description of the global network
dynamics, we show that this task admits several classes of solutions,
characterized by different stability properties. These classes of solutions
differ in the geometrical arrangement of the readout with respect to the input
vectors, defined in the high-dimensional space spanned by the network
population. We show that our theoretical approach can be used to understand how
standard training techniques implement the input-output task in finite-size
feedback networks. In particular, our approximate description captures the
local and the global stability properties of the target solution, and predicts
training performance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38888">Structural principles of SNARE complex recognition by the AAA+ protein NSF</a></h4>

The recycling of SNARE proteins following complex formation and membrane fusion is an essential process in eukaryotic trafficking. A highly conserved AAA+ protein, NSF (<i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) and an adaptor protein, SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein), disassembles the SNARE complex. We report electron-cryomicroscopy structures of the complex of NSF, αSNAP, and the full-length soluble neuronal SNARE complex (composed of syntaxin-1A, synaptobrevin-2, SNAP-25A) in the presence of ATP under non-hydrolyzing conditions at ~3.9 Å resolution. These structures reveal electrostatic interactions by which two αSNAP molecules interface with a specific surface of the SNARE complex. This interaction positions the SNAREs such that the 15 N-terminal residues of SNAP-25A are loaded into the D1 ring pore of NSF via a spiral pattern of interactions between a conserved tyrosine NSF residue and SNAP-25A backbone atoms. This loading process likely precedes ATP hydrolysis. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis then drives complete disassembly.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37563">Intrinsic cooperativity potentiates parallel cis-regulatory evolution</a></h4>

Convergent evolutionary events in independent lineages provide an opportunity to understand why evolution favors certain outcomes over others. We studied such a case where a large set of genes-those coding for the ribosomal proteins-gained <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences for a particular transcription regulator (Mcm1) in independent fungal lineages. We present evidence that these gains occurred because Mcm1 shares a mechanism of transcriptional activation with an ancestral regulator of the ribosomal protein genes, Rap1. Specifically, we show that Mcm1 and Rap1 have the inherent ability to cooperatively activate transcription through contacts with the general transcription factor TFIID. Because the two regulatory proteins share a common interaction partner, the presence of one ancestral <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequence can 'channel' random mutations into functional sites for the second regulator. At a genomic scale, this type of intrinsic cooperativity can account for a pattern of parallel evolution involving the fixation of hundreds of substitutions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37243">Peptidoglycan precursor synthesis along the sidewall of pole-growing mycobacteria</a></h4>

Rod-shaped mycobacteria expand from their poles, yet d-amino acid probes label cell wall peptidoglycan in this genus at both the poles and sidewall. We sought to clarify the metabolic fates of these probes. Monopeptide incorporation was decreased by antibiotics that block peptidoglycan synthesis or l,d-transpeptidation and in an l,d-transpeptidase mutant. Dipeptides complemented defects in d-alanine synthesis or ligation and were present in lipid-linked peptidoglycan precursors. Characterizing probe uptake pathways allowed us to localize peptidoglycan metabolism with precision: monopeptide-marked l,d-transpeptidase remodeling and dipeptide-marked synthesis were coincident with mycomembrane metabolism at the poles, septum and sidewall. Fluorescent pencillin-marked d,d-transpeptidation around the cell perimeter further suggested that the mycobacterial sidewall is a site of cell wall assembly. While polar peptidoglycan synthesis was associated with cell elongation, sidewall synthesis responded to cell wall damage. Peptidoglycan editing along the sidewall may support cell wall robustness in pole-growing mycobacteria.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37143">Decoupled maternal and zygotic genetic effects shape the evolution of development</a></h4>

Evolutionary transitions from indirect to direct development involve changes in both maternal and zygotic genetic factors, with distinctive population-genetic implications, but empirical data on the genetics of such transitions are lacking. The polychaete <i>Streblospio benedicti</i> provides an opportunity to dissect a major transition in developmental mode using forward genetics. Females in this species produce either small eggs that develop into planktonic larvae or large eggs that develop into benthic juveniles. We identify large-effect loci that act maternally to influence larval size and independent, unlinked large-effect loci that act zygotically to affect discrete aspects of larval morphology. The likely fitness of zygotic alleles depends on their maternal background, creating a positive frequency-dependence that may homogenize local populations. Developmental and population genetics interact to shape larval evolution.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a small almond-shaped subcortical structure classically known for its role in motor inhibition through the indirect pathway within the basal ganglia. Little is known about the role of the STN in mediating cognitive functions in humans. Here, we explore the role of the STN in human subjects making decisions under conditions of uncertainty using single-neuron recordings and intermittent deep brain stimulation (DBS) during a financial decision-making task. Intraoperative single-neuronal data from the STN reveals that on high-uncertainty trials, spiking activity encodes the upcoming decision within a brief (500 ms) temporal window during the choice period, prior to the manifestation of the choice. Application of intermittent DBS selectively prior to the choice period alters decisions and biases subject behavior towards conservative wagers.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36158">Glutathione de novo synthesis but not recycling process coordinates with glutamine catabolism to control redox homeostasis and directs murine T cell differentiation</a></h4>

Upon antigen stimulation, T lymphocytes undergo dramatic changes in metabolism to fulfill the bioenergetic, biosynthetic and redox demands of proliferation and differentiation. Glutathione (GSH) plays an essential role in controlling redox balance and cell fate. While GSH can be recycled from Glutathione disulfide (GSSG), the inhibition of this recycling pathway does not impact GSH content and murine T cell fate. By contrast, the inhibition of the de novo synthesis of GSH, by deleting either the catalytic (Gclc) or the modifier (Gclm) subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (Gcl), dampens intracellular GSH, increases ROS, and impact T cell differentiation. Moreover, the inhibition of GSH de novo synthesis dampened the pathological progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We further reveal that glutamine provides essential precursors for GSH biosynthesis. Our findings suggest that glutamine catabolism fuels de novo synthesis of GSH and directs the lineage choice in T cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35222">Allosteric regulators selectively prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-feedback of Ca<sub>V</sub> and Na<sub>V</sub> channels</a></h4>

Calmodulin (CaM) serves as a pervasive regulatory subunit of Ca<sub>V</sub>1, Ca<sub>V</sub>2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1 channels, exploiting a functionally-conserved carboxy-tail element to afford dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-feedback of cellular excitability in neurons and cardiomyocytes. Yet this modularity counters functional adaptability, as global changes in ambient CaM indiscriminately alter its targets. Here, we demonstrate that two structurally-unrelated proteins, SH3 and cysteine-rich domain (stac) and fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (fhf) selectively diminish Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-regulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1 families respectively. The two proteins operate on allosteric sites within upstream portions of respective channel carboxy-tails, distinct from CaM-binding interface. Generalizing this mechanism, insertion of a short RxxK binding motif into Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 carboxy-tail, confers synthetic switching of CaM regulation by Mona SH3 domain. Overall, our findings identify a general class of auxiliary proteins that modify Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling to individual targets allowing spatial and temporal orchestration of feedback, and outline strategies for engineering Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM signaling to individual targets.

A potential solution is to use the spatial layout and non-linear properties of dendrites to distinguish credit signals from other inputs.

<p>by Lia Papadopoulos, Pablo Blinder, Henrik Ronellenfitsch, Florian Klimm, Eleni Katifori, David Kleinfeld, Danielle S. Bassett</p>

Distribution networks—from vasculature to urban transportation pathways—are spatially embedded networks that must route resources efficiently in the face of pressures induced by the costs of building and maintaining network infrastructure. Such requirements are thought to constrain the topological and spatial organization of these systems, but at the same time, different kinds of distribution networks may exhibit variable architectural features within those general constraints. In this study, we use methods from network science to compare and contrast two classes of biological transport networks: mycelial fungi and vasculature from the surface of rodent brains. These systems differ in terms of their growth and transport mechanisms, as well as the environments in which they typically exist. Though both types of networks have been studied independently, the goal of this study is to quantify similarities and differences in their network designs. We begin by characterizing the structural backbone of these systems with a collection of measures that assess various kinds of network organization across topological and spatial scales, ranging from measures of loop density, to those that quantify connected pathways between different network regions, and hierarchical organization. Most importantly, we next carry out a network analysis that directly considers the spatial embedding and properties especially relevant to the function of distribution systems. We find that although both the vasculature and mycelia are highly constrained planar networks, there are clear distinctions in how they balance tradeoffs in network measures of wiring length, efficiency, and robustness. While the vasculature appears well organized for low cost, but relatively high efficiency, the mycelia tend to form more expensive but in turn more robust networks. As a whole, this work demonstrates the utility of network-based methods to identify both common features and variations in the network structure of different classes of biological transport systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7ImdF3ExyLk" width="1" />

<p>by Ahmed Abdul Quadeer, David Morales-Jimenez, Matthew R. McKay</p>

Mutational correlation patterns found in population-level sequence data for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have been demonstrated to be informative of viral fitness. Such patterns can be seen as footprints of the intrinsic functional constraints placed on viral evolution under diverse selective pressures. Here, considering multiple HIV and HCV proteins, we demonstrate that these mutational correlations encode a modular co-evolutionary structure that is tightly linked to the structural and functional properties of the respective proteins. Specifically, by introducing a robust statistical method based on sparse principal component analysis, we identify near-disjoint sets of collectively-correlated residues (sectors) having mostly a one-to-one association to largely distinct structural or functional domains. This suggests that the distinct phenotypic properties of HIV/HCV proteins often give rise to quasi-independent modes of evolution, with each mode involving a sparse and localized network of mutational interactions. Moreover, individual inferred sectors of HIV are shown to carry immunological significance, providing insight for guiding targeted vaccine strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kynmmf_mza0" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>"Good science" means answering important questions convincingly, a challenging endeavor under the best of circumstances. Our inability to replicate many biomedical studies has been the subject of numerous commentaries both in the scientific and lay press. In response, statistics has re-emerged as a necessary tool to improve the objectivity of study conclusions. However, psychological aspects of decision making introduce preconceived preferences into scientific judgment that cannot be eliminated by any statistical method. The psychology of decision making, expounded by Kahneman, Tversky, and Thayer, is well known in the field of economics, but the underlying concepts of cognitive psychology are also relevant to scientific judgments. I repeated experiments carried out on undergraduates by Kahneman and colleagues four to five decades ago, but with scientists, and obtained essentially the same results. The experiments were in the form of written reactions to scenarios, and participants were scientists at all career stages. The findings reinforce the roles that two inherent intuitions play in scientific decision making: our drive to create a coherent narrative from new data regardless of its quality or relevance and our inclination to seek patterns in data whether they exist or not. Moreover, we do not always consider how likely a result is regardless of its <i>p</i> value. Low statistical power and inattention to principles underpinning Bayesian statistics reduce experimental rigor, but mitigating skills can be learned. Overcoming our natural human tendency to make quick decisions and jump to conclusions is a deeper obstacle to doing good science; this too can be learned.</p>

Establishment of memory traces is thought to rely on long-term plasticity in excitatory glutamatergic synapses interconnecting principal cells. In addition, recent studies in the hippocampus <em>in vivo</em> indicate that reconfiguration of GABAergic inhibitory interneuron activity also occurs during long-term memory encoding. Recent experiments in anesthetized, as well as in freely moving animals, demonstrate that learning-related hippocampal activities are associated with persistent changes in GABAergic interneuron firing rates and alterations in protein expression levels regulating GABA release.</p></div>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37892">DET1-mediated degradation of a SAGA-like deubiquitination module controls H2Bub homeostasis</a></h4>

DE-ETIOLATED 1 (DET1) is an evolutionarily conserved component of the ubiquitination machinery that mediates the destabilization of key regulators of cell differentiation and proliferation in multicellular organisms. In this study, we provide evidence from Arabidopsis that DET1 is essential for the regulation of histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub) over most genes by controlling the stability of a deubiquitination module (DUBm). In contrast with yeast and metazoan DUB modules that are associated with the large SAGA complex, the Arabidopsis DUBm only comprises three proteins (hereafter named SGF11, ENY2 and UBP22) and appears to act independently as a major H2Bub deubiquitinase activity. Our study further unveils that DET1-DDB1-Associated-1 (DDA1) protein interacts with SGF11 <i>in vivo</i>, linking the DET1 complex to light-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation of the DUBm. Collectively, these findings uncover a signaling path controlling DUBm availability, potentially adjusting H2Bub turnover capacity to the cell transcriptional status.

The <i>TP53</i> tumor-suppressor gene is mutated in &gt;50% of human tumors and Li-Fraumeni patients with germ line inactivation are predisposed to developing cancer. Here, we generated <i>tp53</i> deleted zebrafish that spontaneously develop malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumors, angiosarcomas, germ cell tumors, and an aggressive Natural Killer cell-like leukemia for which no animal model has been developed. Because the tp53 deletion was generated in syngeneic zebrafish, engraftment of fluorescent-labeled tumors could be dynamically visualized over time. Importantly, engrafted tumors shared gene expression signatures with predicted cells of origin in human tissue. Finally, we showed that <i>tp5</i>3<i><sup>del/del</sup></i> enhanced invasion and metastasis in <i>kRAS<sup>G12D</sup></i>-induced embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), but did not alter the overall frequency of cancer stem cells, suggesting novel pro-metastatic roles for TP53 loss-of-function in human muscle tumors. In summary, we have developed a Li-Fraumeni zebrafish model that is amenable to large-scale transplantation and direct visualization of tumor growth in live animals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35447">Defective RNA polymerase III is negatively regulated by the SUMO-Ubiquitin-Cdc48 pathway</a></h4>

Transcription by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is an essential cellular process, and mutations in Pol III can cause neurodegenerative disease in humans. However, in contrast to Pol II transcription, which has been extensively studied, the knowledge of how Pol III is regulated is very limited. We report here that in budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Pol III is negatively regulated by the <span class="underline">S</span>mall <span class="underline">U</span>biquitin-like <span class="underline">MO</span>difier (SUMO), an essential post-translational modification pathway. Besides sumoylation, Pol III is also targeted by ubiquitylation and the Cdc48/p97 segregase; these three processes likely act in a sequential manner and eventually lead to proteasomal degradation of Pol III subunits, thereby repressing Pol III transcription. This study not only uncovered a regulatory mechanism for Pol III, but also suggests that the SUMO and ubiquitin modification pathways and the Cdc48/p97 segregase can be potential therapeutic targets for Pol III-related human diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/33676">BDNF-TrkB signaling in oxytocin neurons contributes to maternal behavior</a></h4>

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<i>Bdnf</i>) transcription is controlled by several promoters, which drive expression of multiple transcripts encoding an identical protein. We previously reported that BDNF derived from promoters I and II is highly expressed in hypothalamus and is critical for regulating aggression in male mice. Here we report that BDNF loss from these promoters causes reduced sexual receptivity and impaired maternal care in female mice, which is concomitant with decreased oxytocin (<i>Oxt)</i> expression during development. We identify a novel link between BDNF signaling, oxytocin, and maternal behavior by demonstrating that ablation of TrkB selectively in OXT neurons partially recapitulates maternal care impairments observed in BDNF-deficient females. Using translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-sequencing we define a molecular profile for OXT neurons and delineate how BDNF signaling impacts gene pathways critical for structural and functional plasticity. Our findings highlight BDNF as a modulator of sexually-dimorphic hypothalamic circuits that govern female-typical behaviors.

Precisely wired neuronal circuits process sensory information in a learning- and context-dependent manner in order to govern behavior. Simple sensory decision-making tasks in rodents are now beginning to reveal the contributions of distinct cell types and brain regions participating in the conversion of sensory information into learned goal-directed motor output. Task learning is accompanied by target-specific routing of sensory information to specific downstream cortical regions, with higher-order cortical regions such as the posterior parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus appearing to play important roles in learning- and context-dependent processing of sensory input.

<p>by Helmut Schmidt, Daniele Avitabile, Ernest Montbrió, Alex Roxin</p>

Oscillatory activity robustly correlates with task demands during many cognitive tasks. However, not only are the network mechanisms underlying the generation of these rhythms poorly understood, but it is also still unknown to what extent they may play a functional role, as opposed to being a mere epiphenomenon. Here we study the mechanisms underlying the influence of oscillatory drive on network dynamics related to cognitive processing in simple working memory (WM), and memory recall tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the frequency of oscillatory input interacts with the intrinsic dynamics in networks of recurrently coupled spiking neurons to cause changes of state: the neuronal correlates of the corresponding cognitive process. We find that slow oscillations, in the delta and theta band, are effective in activating network states associated with memory recall. On the other hand, faster oscillations, in the beta range, can serve to clear memory states by resonantly driving transient bouts of spike synchrony which destabilize the activity. We leverage a recently derived set of exact mean-field equations for networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons to systematically study the bifurcation structure in the periodically forced spiking network. Interestingly, we find that the oscillatory signals which are most effective in allowing flexible switching between network states are not smooth, pure sinusoids, but rather burst-like, with a sharp onset. We show that such periodic bursts themselves readily arise spontaneously in networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and that the burst frequency can be tuned via changes in tonic drive. Finally, we show that oscillations in the gamma range can actually stabilize WM states which otherwise would not persist.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bbt9ElVGJQM" width="1" />

<p>by Weizhong Chen, Yi Liu, Shanshan Zhu, Guoyu Chen, Jing-Dong J. Han</p>

Combinatorial effects of epigenetic modifications on transcription activity have been proposed as “histone codes”. However, it is unclear whether there also exist inter-nucleosomal communications among epigenetic modifications at single nucleosome level, and if so, what functional roles they play. Meanwhile, how clear nucleosome patterns, such as nucleosome phasing and depletion, are formed at functional regions remains an intriguing enigma. To address these questions, we developed a Bayesian network model for interactions among different histone modifications across neighboring nucleosomes, based on the framework of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). From this model, we found that robust inter-nucleosomal interactions exist around transcription start site (TSS), transcription termination sites (TTS) or around CTCF binding sites; and these inter-nucleosomal interactions are often involved in transcription regulation. In addition to these general principles, DBN also uncovered a novel specific epigenetic interaction between H2A.Z and H4K20me1 on neighboring nucleosomes, involved in nucleosome free region (NFR) and nucleosome phasing establishment or maintenance. The level of negative correlation between neighboring H2A.Z and H4K20me1 strongly correlate with the size of NFR and the strength of nucleosome phasing around TSS. Our study revealed inter-nucleosomal communications as important players in signal propagation, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dbMl2WeMTC0" width="1" />

<p>by Itamar Eliakim, Zahi Cohen, Gabor Kosa, Yossi Yovel</p>

Echolocating bats rely on active sound emission (echolocation) for mapping novel environments and navigating through them. Many theoretical frameworks have been suggested to explain how they do so, but few attempts have been made to build an actual robot that mimics their abilities. Here, we present the ‘Robat’—a fully autonomous bat-like terrestrial robot that relies on echolocation to move through a novel environment while mapping it solely based on sound. Using the echoes reflected from the environment, the Robat delineates the borders of objects it encounters, and classifies them using an artificial neural-network, thus creating a rich map of its environment. Unlike most previous attempts to apply sonar in robotics, we focus on a biological bat-like approach, which relies on a single emitter and two ears, and we apply a biological plausible signal processing approach to extract information about objects’ position and identity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZTL-tdZm6to" width="1" />

<p>Phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) reflects neurite degeneration at the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), before extracellular Aβ aggregates are histologically detectable. Here, we demonstrate that similar changes in MARCKS occur in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) pathologies in both mouse models and human patients. The increase in the level of pSer46-MARCKS began before α-synuclein aggregate formation, at a time when human α-Syn-BAC-Tg/GBA-hetero-KO mice exhibited no symptoms, and was sustained during aging, consistent with the pattern in human postmortem brains. The results strongly imply a common mechanism of pre-aggregation neurite degeneration in AD and PD/DLB pathologies.</p>

Abstract<p>Fast-rising sensory events evoke a series of functionally heterogeneous event-related potentials (ERPs). Stimulus repetition at 1 Hz is known to induce a strong habituation of the largest ERP responses, the vertex waves, which are elicited by stimuli regardless of their modality, provided that they are salient and behaviourally-relevant. In contrast, the effect of stimulus repetition on the earlier sensory components of ERPs has been less explored, and the few existing results are inconsistent. To characterize how the different ERP waves habituate over time, we recorded the responses elicited by 60 identical somatosensory stimuli (activating either non-nociceptive Aβ or nociceptive A afferents), delivered at 1 Hz to healthy human participants. We show that the well-described spatiotemporal sequence of lateralised and vertex ERP components elicited by the first stimulus of the series is largely preserved in the smaller-amplitude, habituated response elicited by the last stimuli of the series. We also found that the earlier lateralised sensory waves habituate across the 60 trials following the same decay function of the vertex waves: this decay function is characterised by a large drop at the first stimulus repetition followed by smaller decreases at subsequent repetitions. Interestingly, the same decay functions described the habituation of ERPs elicited by repeated non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli. This study provides a neurophysiological characterization of the effect of prolonged and repeated stimulation on the main components of somatosensory ERPs. It also demonstrates that both lateralised waves and vertex waves are obligatory components of ERPs elicited by non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Our results provide a functional characterization of the decay of the different ERP components when identical somatosensory (nociceptive and non-nociceptive) stimuli are repeated at 1Hz. Fast-rising stimuli elicit ERPs obligatory contributed by both early lateralised components and late vertex components, even when stimulus repetition minimizes stimulus relevance. This challenges the view that lateralised waves are not obligatorily elicited by nociceptive stimuli. Furthermore, the lateralised and vertex waves habituate to stimulus repetition following similar decay functions, which are unlikely explained in terms of fatigue or adaptation of skin receptors.</p>

<p>The statistical analysis of the collective neural activity known as
avalanches provides insight into the proper behavior of brains across many
species. In this paper we present a neural network model based on the work of
Lombardi, Herrmann, de Arcangelis et al. that captures the relevant dynamics of
neural avalanches, and we show how tuning the fraction of inhibitory neurons in
this model removes exponential cut-offs present in the distributions of
avalanche strength and duration, and transitions the power spectral density of
the network into an epileptic regime. We propose that the brain operates away
from this regime of low inhibitory fraction to protect itself from the
dominating avalanches present in these extended distributions.

<p>Vision science, particularly machine vision, has been revolutionized by
introducing large-scale image datasets and statistical learning approaches.
Yet, human neuroimaging studies of visual perception still rely on small
numbers of images (around 100) due to time-constrained experimental procedures.
To apply statistical learning approaches that integrate neuroscience, the
number of images used in neuroimaging must be significantly increased. We
present BOLD5000, a human functional MRI (fMRI) study that includes almost
5,000 distinct images depicting real-world scenes. Beyond dramatically
increasing image dataset size relative to prior fMRI studies, BOLD5000 also
accounts for image diversity, overlapping with standard computer vision
datasets by incorporating images from the Scene UNderstanding (SUN), Common
Objects in Context (COCO), and ImageNet datasets. The scale and diversity of
these image datasets, combined with a slow event-related fMRI design, enable
fine-grained exploration into the neural representation of a wide range of
visual features, categories, and semantics. Concurrently, BOLD5000 brings us
closer to realizing Marr's dream of a singular vision science - the intertwined
study of biological and computer vision.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common complication of prematurity in infants born at 23–28 weeks of gestation. Survivors exhibit impaired growth of the cerebral cortex and neurodevelopmental sequeale, but the underlying mechanism(s) are obscure. Previously, we have shown that neocortical neurogenesis continues until at least 28 gestational weeks. This renders the prematurely born infants vulnerable to impaired neurogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that neurogenesis is impaired by IVH, and that signaling through GSK3β, a critical intracellular kinase regulated by Wnt and other pathways, mediates this effect. These hypotheses were tested observationally in autopsy specimens from premature infants, and experimentally in a premature rabbit IVH model. Significantly, in premature infants with IVH, the number of neurogenic cortical progenitor cells was reduced compared with infants without IVH, indicating acutely decreased neurogenesis. This finding was corroborated in the rabbit IVH model, which further demonstrated reduction of upper layer cortical neurons after longer survival. Both the acute reduction of neurogenic progenitors, and the subsequent decrease of upper layer neurons, were rescued by treatment with AR-A014418, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β. Together, these results indicate that IVH impairs late stages of cortical neurogenesis, and suggest that treatment with GSK3β inhibitors may enhance neurodevelopment in premature infants with IVH.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study investigated how cooperative and competitive interaction modes affect the group creative performance. The participants were recruited as dyads to solve 2 problems either demanding divergent thinking (alternative uses task, AUT) or not (object characteristic task, OCT). The dyads solved 1 of the 2 problems in the cooperative mode and the other in the competitive mode. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning was used to record their neural activities in the prefrontal and right temporal–parietal junction (r-TPJ) regions. Results revealed the dyads showed higher AUT fluency, AUT originality, OCT fluency, and cooperation level in the cooperative mode than in the competitive mode. The fNIRS data revealed increased (task-baseline) interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (r-DLPFC) and r-TPJ, only for dyads in the AUT/cooperation condition. In both r-DLPFC and r-TPJ, the IBS of dyads in the AUT/cooperation condition was stronger than in the AUT/competition and OCT/cooperation. Moreover, a stronger IBS was evoked between the regions in prefrontal and posterior temporal regions in the AUT/cooperation condition, as compared with the competition mode. These findings suggest that enhanced IBS may underlie the positive effects of cooperation as compared with the competition in terms of group creativity.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Disrupted cholinergic neurotransmission plays a central role in Alzheimer’s disease, medication-induced memory impairment, and delirium. At the systems level, this suggests anticholinergic drugs may alter the activity and interplay of anatomically distributed neural networks critical for memory function. Using a network-sensitive imaging technique (functional connectivity MRI) and a double-blind, crossover design, we examined the consequences of anticholinergic drug administration on episodic memory and functional network architecture in a group of clinically normal elderly. We observed that low-dose scopolamine (0.2 mg IV) decreased episodic memory performance and selectively decreased connectivity strength in 3 of 7 cortical networks. Both memory and connectivity effects were independent of β-amyloid burden. Drug-induced connectivity changes within the Default and Salience networks, as well as reductions in the strength of anticorrelation between these 2 networks, were sufficient to fully statistically mediate the effects of scopolamine on memory performance. These results provide experimental support for the importance of the Default and Salience networks to memory performance and suggest scopolamine-induced amnesia is underpinned by disrupted connectivity within and between these 2 networks. More broadly, these results support the potential utility of fcMRI as tool examine the systems-level pharmacology of psychoactive drugs.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The ability to keep similar experiences separate in memory is critical for forming unique and lasting memories, as many events share overlapping features (e.g., birthday parties, holidays). Research on memory in young children suggests their memories often lack high-resolution details, i.e., show impoverished pattern separation (PS). Recently developed assessments of PS suitable for children allow us to relate the formation of distinct, detailed memories for the development of the hippocampus, a neural structure critical for this ability in adults. The hippocampus displays a protracted developmental profile and underlies the ability to form detailed memories. This study examined age-related differences in hippocampal subfield volumes in 4- to 8-year-old children and relations with performance on a mnemonic similarity task (MST) designed to index memory specificity. Results revealed age-moderated associations between MST performance and cornu ammonis 2-4/dentate gyrus subfields. Specifically, age-related differences in the ability to form detailed memories tracked with normative patterns of volume increases followed by reductions over this age range. That is, greater volume correlated with better performance in younger children, whereas smaller volume correlated with better performance in older children. These findings support the hypothesis that developmental differences in hippocampal circuitry contribute to age-related improvements in detailed memory formation during this period.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent evidence shows that seizures propagate primarily through supragranular cortical layers. To selectively modify these circuits, we developed a new technique using tightly focused, femtosecond infrared laser pulses to make as small as ~100 µm-wide subsurface cortical incisions surrounding an epileptic focus. We use this “laser scalpel” to produce subsurface cortical incisions selectively to supragranular layers surrounding an epileptic focus in an acute rodent seizure model. Compared with sham animals, these microtransections completely blocked seizure initiation and propagation in 1/3 of all animals. In the remaining animals, seizure frequency was reduced by 2/3 and seizure propagation reduced by 1/3. In those seizures that still propagated, it was delayed and reduced in amplitude. When the recording electrode was inside the partially isolated cube and the seizure focus was on the outside, the results were even more striking. In spite of these microtransections, somatosensory responses to tail stimulation were maintained but with reduced amplitude. Our data show that just a single enclosing wall of laser cuts limited to supragranular layers led to a significant reduction in seizure initiation and propagation with preserved cortical function. Modification of this concept may be a useful treatment for human epilepsy.</span>

Abstract
<p>Sensory adaptation is a source of experience-dependent feedback that impacts responses to environmental cues. In the mammalian main olfactory system (MOS), adaptation influences sensory coding at its earliest processing stages. Sensory adaptation in the accessory olfactory system (AOS) remains incompletely explored, leaving many aspects of the phenomenon unclear. We investigated sensory adaptation in vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) using a combination of <i>in situ</i> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and electrophysiology. Parallel studies revealed prominent short-term sensory adaptation in VSNs upon repeated stimulation with mouse urine and monomolecular bile acid ligands at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) less than 30 s. In such conditions, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and spike rates were often reduced by more than 50%, leading to dramatically reduced chemosensory sensitivity. Short-term adaptation was reversible over the course of minutes. Population Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments revealed the presence of a slower form of VSN adaptation that accumulated over dozens of stimulus presentations delivered over tens of minutes. Most VSNs showed strong adaptation, but in a substantial VSN subpopulation adaptation was diminished or absent. Investigation of same- and opposite-sex urine responses in male and female VSNs revealed that adaptation to same-sex cues occurred at ISIs up to 180 s, conditions that did not induce adaptation to opposite-sex cues. This result suggests that VSN sensory adaptation can be modulated by sensory experience. These studies comprehensively establish the presence of VSN sensory adaptation and provide a foundation for future inquiries into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this phenomenon and its impact on mammalian behavior.</p>

Abstract
<p>Previous behavioral and neuroimaging work indicates that individuals who are externally motivated to respond without racial prejudice tend not to spontaneously regulate their prejudice and prefer to focus on nonracial attributes when evaluating others. This fMRI multivariate analysis used partial least squares analysis to examine the distributed neural processing of race and a relevant but ostensibly nonracial attribute (i.e., socioeconomic status) as a function of the perceiver’s external motivation. Sixty-one white male participants (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) privately formed impressions of black and white male faces ascribed with high or low status. Across all conditions, greater external motivation was associated with reduced coactivation of brain regions believed to support emotion regulation (rostral anterior cingulate cortex), introspection (middle cingulate), and social cognition (temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex). The reduced involvement of this network irrespective of target race and status suggests that external motivation is related to the participant’s overall approach to impression formation in an interracial context. The findings highlight the importance of examining network coactivation in understanding the role of external motivation in impression formation, among other interracial social processes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/36/7912?rss=1">A Transient Developmental Window of Fast-Spiking Interneuron Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

<p>Dravet syndrome is a severe, childhood-onset epilepsy largely due to heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the gene <i>SCN1A</i>, which encodes the type 1 neuronal voltage-gated sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channel α subunit Nav1.1. Prior studies in mouse models of Dravet syndrome (<i>Scn1a</i><sup>+/–</sup> mice) indicate that, in cerebral cortex, Nav1.1 is predominantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons, in particular in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cell interneurons (PVINs). This has led to a model of Dravet syndrome pathogenesis in which Nav1.1 mutation leads to preferential dysfunction of interneurons, decreased synaptic inhibition, hyperexcitability, and epilepsy. However, such studies have been implemented at early developmental time points. Here, we performed electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices prepared from male and female <i>Scn1a</i><sup>+/–</sup> mice as well as age-matched wild-type littermate controls and found that, later in development, the excitability of PVINs had normalized. Analysis of action potential waveforms indirectly suggests a reorganization of axonal Na<sup>+</sup> channels in PVINs from <i>Scn1a</i><sup>+/–</sup> mice, a finding supported by immunohistochemical data showing elongation of the axon initial segment. Our results imply that transient impairment of action potential generation by PVINs may contribute to the initial appearance of epilepsy, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dravet syndrome is characterized by normal early development, temperature-sensitive seizures in infancy, progression to treatment-resistant epilepsy, developmental delay, autism, and sudden unexplained death due to mutation in <i>SCN1A</i> encoding the Na+ channel subunit Nav1.1. Prior work has revealed a preferential impact of Nav1.1 loss on the function of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. However, such data derive exclusively from recordings of neurons in young <i>Scn1a</i><sup>+/–</sup> mice. Here, we show that impaired action potential generation observed in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (PVINs) in <i>Scn1a</i>+/– mice during early development has normalized by postnatal day 35. This work suggests that a transient impairment of PVINs contributes to epilepsy onset, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/36/7901?rss=1">Updating Beliefs under Perceived Threat</a></h4>

<p>Humans are better at integrating desirable information into their beliefs than undesirable information. This asymmetry poses an evolutionary puzzle, as it can lead to an underestimation of risk and thus failure to take precautionary action. Here, we suggest a mechanism that can speak to this conundrum. In particular, we show that the bias vanishes in response to perceived threat in the environment. We report that an improvement in participants' tendency to incorporate bad news into their beliefs is associated with physiological arousal in response to threat indexed by galvanic skin response and self-reported anxiety. This pattern of results was observed in a controlled laboratory setting (Experiment I), where perceived threat was manipulated, and in firefighters on duty (Experiment II), where it naturally varied. Such flexibility in how individuals integrate information may enhance the likelihood of responding to warnings with caution in environments rife with threat, while maintaining a positivity bias otherwise, a strategy that can increase well-being.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human tendency to be overly optimistic has mystified scholars and lay people for decades: How could biased beliefs have been selected over unbiased beliefs? Scholars have suggested that although the optimism bias can lead to negative outcomes, including financial collapse and war, it can also facilitate health and productivity. Here, we demonstrate that a mechanism generating the optimism bias, namely asymmetric information integration, evaporates under threat. Such flexibility could result in enhanced caution in dangerous environments while supporting an optimism bias otherwise, potentially increasing well-being.</p>

<p>Inhibitory control requires precise regulation of activity and connectivity within multiple brain networks. Previous studies have typically evaluated age-related changes in regional activity or changes in interregional interactions. Instead, we test the hypothesis that activity and connectivity make distinct, complementary contributions to performance across the life span and the maintenance of successful inhibitory control systems. A representative sample of healthy human adults in a large, population-based life span cohort performed an integrated Stop-Signal (SS)/No-Go task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (<i>n</i> = 119; age range, 18–88 years). Individual differences in inhibitory control were measured in terms of the SS reaction time (SSRT), using the blocked integration method. Linear models and independent components analysis revealed that individual differences in SSRT correlated with both activity and connectivity in a distributed inhibition network, comprising prefrontal, premotor, and motor regions. Importantly, this pattern was moderated by age, such that the association between inhibitory control and connectivity, but not activity, differed with age. Multivariate statistics and out-of-sample validation tests of multifactorial functional organization identified differential roles of activity and connectivity in determining an individual's SSRT across the life span. We propose that age-related differences in adaptive cognitive control are best characterized by the joint consideration of multifocal activity and connectivity within distributed brain networks. These insights may facilitate the development of new strategies to support cognitive ability in old age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The preservation of cognitive and motor control is crucial for maintaining well being across the life span. We show that such control is determined by both activity and connectivity within distributed brain networks. In a large, population-based cohort, we used a novel whole-brain multivariate approach to estimate the functional components of inhibitory control, in terms of their activity and connectivity. Both activity and connectivity in the inhibition network changed with age. But only the association between performance and connectivity, not activity, differed with age. The results suggest that adaptive control is best characterized by the joint consideration of multifocal activity and connectivity. These insights may facilitate the development of new strategies to maintain cognitive ability across the life span in health and disease.</p>

<p>Autism is hypothesized to result in a cortical excitatory and inhibitory imbalance driven by inhibitory interneuron dysfunction, which is associated with the generation of gamma oscillations. On the other hand, impaired motor control has been widely reported in autism. However, no study has focused on the gamma oscillations during motor control in autism. In the present study, we investigated the motor-related gamma oscillations in autism using magnetoencephalography. Magnetoencephalographic signals were recorded from 14 right-handed human children with autism (5 female), aged 5–7 years, and age- and IQ-matched 15 typically developing children during a motor task using their right index finger. Consistent with previous studies, the autism group showed a significantly longer button response time and reduced amplitude of motor-evoked magnetic fields. We observed that the autism group exhibited a low peak frequency of motor-related gamma oscillations from the contralateral primary motor cortex, and these were associated with the severity of autism symptoms. The autism group showed a reduced power of motor-related gamma oscillations in the bilateral primary motor cortex. A linear discriminant analysis using the button response time and gamma oscillations showed a high classification performance (86.2% accuracy). The alterations of the gamma oscillations in autism might reflect the cortical excitatory and inhibitory imbalance. Our findings provide an important clue into the behavioral and neurophysiological alterations in autism and a potential biomarker for autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Currently, the diagnosis of autism has been based on behavioral assessments, and a crucial issue in the diagnosis of autism is to identify objective and quantifiable clinical biomarkers. A key hypothesis of the neurophysiology of autism is an excitatory and inhibitory imbalance in the brain, which is associated with the generation of gamma oscillations. On the other hand, motor deficits have also been widely reported in autism. This is the first study to demonstrate low motor performance and altered motor-related gamma oscillations in autism, reflecting a brain excitatory and inhibitory imbalance. Using these behavioral and neurophysiological parameters, we classified autism and control group with good accuracy. This work provides important information on behavioral and neurophysiological alterations in patients with autism.</p>

<p>Neuroscience research has elucidated broad relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and young children's brain structure, but there is little mechanistic knowledge about specific environmental factors that are associated with specific variation in brain structure. One environmental factor, early language exposure, predicts children's linguistic and cognitive skills and later academic achievement, but how language exposure relates to neuroanatomy is unknown. By measuring the real-world language exposure of young children (ages 4–6 years, 27 male/13 female), we confirmed the preregistered hypothesis that greater adult-child conversational experience, independent of SES and the sheer amount of adult speech, is related to stronger, more coherent white matter connectivity in the left arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi on average, and specifically near their anterior termination at Broca's area in left inferior frontal cortex. Fractional anisotropy of significant tract subregions mediated the relationship between conversational turns and children's language skills and indicated a neuroanatomical mechanism underlying the SES "language gap." <i>Post hoc</i> whole-brain analyses revealed that language exposure was not related to any other white matter tracts, indicating the specificity of this relationship. Results suggest that the development of dorsal language tracts is environmentally influenced, specifically by early, dialogic interaction. Furthermore, these findings raise the possibility that early intervention programs aiming to ameliorate disadvantages in development due to family SES may focus on increasing children's conversational exposure to capitalize on the early neural plasticity underlying cognitive development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over the last decade, cognitive neuroscience has highlighted the detrimental impact of disadvantaged backgrounds on young children's brain structure. However, to intervene effectively, we must know which proximal aspects of the environmental aspects are most strongly related to neural development. The present study finds that young children's real-world language exposure, and specifically the amount of adult-child conversation, correlates with the strength of connectivity in the left hemisphere white matter pathway connecting two canonical language regions, independent of socioeconomic status and the sheer volume of adult speech. These findings suggest that early intervention programs aiming to close the achievement gap may focus on increasing children's conversational exposure to capitalize on the early neural plasticity underlying cognitive development.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/36/7852?rss=1">Experience-Dependent Development of Feature-Selective Synchronization in the Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Early visual experience is essential for the maturation of visual functions in which the primary visual cortex plays crucial roles. The extraction of visual features based on response selectivity of individual neurons, a fundamental process in the cortex, is basically established by eye opening in rodents, suggesting that visual experience is required for the development of neural functions other than feature extraction. Here, we show that synchronized firing, which is important for visual information processing, occurs selectively in adjacent neurons sharing similar orientation or spatial frequency preferences in layers 2–4 (upper layer) of rat visual cortex. This feature-selective spike synchrony was rudimentary when the eyes opened and became prominent during the first few weeks after eye opening only in the presence of pattern vision. In contrast, synchronization in layers 5–6 (lower layer) was almost independent of orientation similarity and more weakly dependent on spatial frequency similarity compared with upper layer synchrony. Lower layer synchronization was strengthened during development after eye opening independently of visual experience as a whole. However, the feature selectivity of synchronization was regulated by visual inputs, whereas the inputs without contours were sufficient for this regulation. Therefore, we speculate that feature-selective synchronization in the upper layer may convey detailed information on visual objects to the higher-order cortex, whereas weakly feature-selective synchronization in the lower layer may covey rather rough visual information to the subcortical areas or higher-order cortex. A major role of visual experience may be to establish the specific neural circuits underlying highly feature-selective synchronization.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neuronal mechanisms underlying experience-dependent improvement of visual functions still remain unresolved. In this study, we investigated whether early visual experience contributes to the development of synchronized neural firing in the primary visual cortex, which plays important roles in visual information processing. We found that synchronized firing depends more remarkably on the similarity of preferred visual stimuli in the upper than lower layer neurons. Pattern vision during development was required for the establishment of spike synchrony in the upper but not the lower layer. These findings provide a new view regarding the role of sensory experience in the functional development of the cortex and the differences in the modes of information processing in the upper and lower cortical layers.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/36/7844?rss=1">Brain GABA Levels Are Associated with Inhibitory Control Deficits in Older Adults</a></h4>

<p>Healthy aging is accompanied by motor inhibition deficits that involve a slower process of stopping a prepotent motor response (i.e., reactive inhibition) rather than a diminished ability to anticipate stopping (i.e., proactive inhibition). Some studies suggest that efficient motor inhibition is related to GABAergic function. Since age-related alterations in the GABA system have also been reported, motor inhibition impairments might be linked to GABAergic alterations in the cortico-subcortical network that mediates motor inhibition. Thirty young human adults (mean age, 23.2 years; age range, 18–34 years; 14 men) and 29 older human adults (mean age, 67.5 years; age range, 60–74 years; 13 men) performed a stop-signal task with varying levels of stop-signal probability. GABA<sup>+</sup> levels were measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in right inferior frontal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), left sensorimotor cortex, bilateral striatum, and occipital cortex. We found that reactive inhibition was worse in older adults compared with young adults, as indicated by longer stop-signal reaction times (SSRTs). No group differences in proactive inhibition were observed as both groups slowed down their response to a similar degree with increasing stop-signal probability. The MRS results showed that tissue-corrected GABA<sup>+</sup> levels were on average lower in older as compared with young adults. Moreover, older adults with lower GABA<sup>+</sup> levels in the pre-SMA were slower at stopping (i.e., had longer SSRTs). These findings suggest a role for the GABA system in reactive inhibition deficits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inhibitory control has been shown to diminish as a consequence of aging. We investigated whether the ability to stop a prepotent motor response and the ability to prepare to stop were related to GABA levels in different regions of the network that was previously identified to mediate inhibitory control. Overall, we found lower GABA levels in older adults compared with young adults. Importantly, those older adults who were slower at stopping had less GABA in the pre-supplementary motor area, a key node of the inhibitory control network. We propose that deficits in the stop process in part depend on the integrity of the GABA system.</p>

<p>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive signaling lipid associated with a variety of chronic pain and itch disorders. S1P signaling has been linked to cutaneous pain, but its role in itch has not yet been studied. Here, we find that S1P triggers itch and pain in male mice in a concentration-dependent manner, with low levels triggering acute itch alone and high levels triggering both pain and itch. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and electrophysiological experiments revealed that S1P signals via S1P receptor 3 (S1PR3) and TRPA1 in a subset of pruriceptors and via S1PR3 and TRPV1 in a subset of heat nociceptors. Consistent with these findings, S1P-evoked itch behaviors are selectively lost in mice lacking TRPA1, whereas S1P-evoked acute pain and heat hypersensitivity are selectively lost in mice lacking TRPV1. We conclude that S1P acts via different cellular and molecular mechanisms to trigger itch and pain. Our discovery elucidates the diverse roles that S1P signaling plays in somatosensation and provides insight into how itch and pain are discriminated in the periphery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Itch and pain are major health problems with few effective treatments. Here, we show that the proinflammatory lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptor, S1P receptor 3 (S1PR3), trigger itch and pain behaviors via distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms. Our results provide a detailed understanding of the roles that S1P and S1PR3 play in somatosensation, highlighting their potential as targets for analgesics and antipruritics, and provide new insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of itch versus pain discrimination in the periphery.</p>

<p>Using ultra-high field fMRI, we explored the cortical depth-dependent stability of acoustic feature preference in human auditory cortex. We collected responses from human auditory cortex (subjects from either sex) to a large number of natural sounds at submillimeter spatial resolution, and observed that these responses were well explained by a model that assumes neuronal population tuning to frequency-specific spectrotemporal modulations. We observed a relatively stable (columnar) tuning to frequency and temporal modulations. However, spectral modulation tuning was variable throughout the cortical depth. This difference in columnar stability between feature maps could not be explained by a difference in map smoothness, as the preference along the cortical sheet varied in a similar manner for the different feature maps. Furthermore, tuning to all three features was more columnar in primary than nonprimary auditory cortex. The observed overall lack of overlapping columnar regions across acoustic feature maps suggests, especially for primary auditory cortex, a coding strategy in which across cortical depths tuning to some features is kept stable, whereas tuning to other features systematically varies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the human auditory cortex, sound aspects are processed in large-scale maps. Invasive animal studies show that an additional processing organization may be implemented orthogonal to the cortical sheet (i.e., in the columnar direction), but it is unknown whether observed organizational principles apply to the human auditory cortex. Combining ultra-high field fMRI with natural sounds, we explore the columnar organization of various sound aspects. Our results suggest that the human auditory cortex contains a modular coding strategy, where, for each module, several sound aspects act as an anchor along which computations are performed while the processing of another sound aspect undergoes a transformation. This strategy may serve to optimally represent the content of our complex acoustic natural environment.</p>

<p>In studies of human episodic memory, the phenomenon of reactivation has traditionally been observed in regions of occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) involved in visual perception. However, reactivation also occurs in lateral parietal cortex (LPC), and recent evidence suggests that stimulus-specific reactivation may be stronger in LPC than in OTC. These observations raise important questions about the nature of memory representations in LPC and their relationship to representations in OTC. Here, we report two fMRI experiments that quantified stimulus feature information (color and object category) within LPC and OTC, separately during perception and memory retrieval, in male and female human subjects. Across both experiments, we observed a clear dissociation between OTC and LPC: while feature information in OTC was relatively stronger during perception than memory, feature information in LPC was relatively stronger during memory than perception. Thus, while OTC and LPC represented common stimulus features in our experiments, they preferentially represented this information during different stages. In LPC, this bias toward mnemonic information co-occurred with stimulus-level reinstatement during memory retrieval. In Experiment 2, we considered whether mnemonic feature information in LPC was flexibly and dynamically shaped by top-down retrieval goals. Indeed, we found that dorsal LPC preferentially represented retrieved feature information that addressed the current goal. In contrast, ventral LPC represented retrieved features independent of the current goal. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the nature and significance of mnemonic representations in LPC and constitute an important bridge between putative mnemonic and control functions of parietal cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When humans remember an event from the past, patterns of sensory activity that were present during the initial event are thought to be reactivated. Here, we investigated the role of lateral parietal cortex (LPC), a high-level region of association cortex, in representing prior visual experiences. We find that LPC contained stronger information about stimulus features during memory retrieval than during perception. We also found that current task goals influenced the strength of stimulus feature information in LPC during memory. These findings suggest that, in addition to early sensory areas, high-level areas of cortex, such as LPC, represent visual information during memory retrieval, and that these areas may play a special role in flexibly aligning memories with current goals.</p>

<p>Humans can recall a large number of memories years after the initial events. Patients with amnesia often have lesions to the hippocampus, but human lesions are imprecise, making it difficult to identify the anatomy underlying memory impairments. Rodent studies enable great precision in hippocampal manipulations, but not investigation of many interleaved memories. Thus it is not known how lesions restricted to the hippocampus affect the retrieval of multiple sequentially encoded memories. Furthermore, disagreement exists as to whether hippocampal inactivations lead to temporally graded or ungraded amnesia, which could be a consequence of differences between rodent and human studies. In the current study, rhesus monkeys of both sexes received either bilateral neurotoxic hippocampal lesions or remained unoperated controls and were tested on recognition and new learning of visual object-in-place scenes. Monkeys with hippocampal lesions were significantly impaired at remembering scenes that were encoded before the lesion. We did not observe any temporal gradient effect of the lesion on memory recognition, with recent and remote memories being equally affected by the lesion. Monkeys with hippocampal lesions showed no deficits in learning new scenes. Thus, the hippocampus, like other cortical regions, may be engaged in the acquisition and storage of new memories, but the role of the damaged hippocampus can be taken over by spared hippocampal tissue or extra-hippocampal regions following a lesion. These findings illustrate the utility of experimental paradigms for studying retrograde and anterograde amnesia that make use of the capacity of nonhuman primates to rapidly acquire many distinct visual memories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recalling old memories, creating new memories, and the process by which memories transition from temporary to permanent storage all may rely on the hippocampus. Whether the hippocampus is necessary for encoding and retrieval of multiple related visual memories in primates is not known. Monkeys that learned many visual memory problems before precise lesions of the hippocampus were impaired at recalling those memories after hippocampal damage regardless of when the memories were formed, but could learn new memory problems at a normal rate. This suggests the hippocampus is normally vital for retrieval of complex visual memories regardless of their age, and also points to the importance of investigating mechanisms by which memories may be acquired in the presence of hippocampal damage.</p>

<p>Many studies highlight that human movements are highly successful yet display a surprising amount of variability from trial to trial. There is a consistent pattern of variability throughout movement: initial motor errors are corrected by the end of movement, suggesting the presence of a powerful online control process. Here, we analyze the trial-by-trial variability of goal-directed reaching in nonhuman primates (five male Rhesus monkeys) and demonstrate that they display a similar pattern of variability during reaching, including a strong negative correlation between initial and late hand motion. We then demonstrate that trial-to-trial neural variability of primary motor cortex (M1) is positively correlated with variability of future hand motion ( = ~160 ms) during reaching. Furthermore, the variability of M1 activity is also correlated with variability of past hand motion ( = ~90 ms), but in the opposite polarity (i.e., negative correlation). Partial correlation analysis demonstrated that M1 activity independently reflects the variability of both past and future hand motions. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that M1 activity is involved in online feedback control of motor actions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies highlight that primary motor cortex (M1) rapidly responds to either visual or mechanical disturbances, suggesting its involvement in online feedback control. However, these studies required external disturbances to the motor system and it is not clear whether a similar feedback process addresses internal noise/errors generated by the motor system itself. Here, we introduce a novel analysis that evaluates how variations in the activity of M1 neurons covary with variations in hand motion on a trial-to-trial basis. The analyses demonstrate that M1 activity is correlated with hand motion in both the near future and the recent past, but with opposite polarity. These results suggest that M1 is involved in online feedback motor control to address errors/noise within the motor system.</p>

<p>Recent advances in cortical prosthetics relied on intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate the cortical neural network and convey information to the brain. Here we show that activity elicited by low-current ICMS modulates induced cortical responses to a sensory stimulus in the primary auditory cortex (A1). A1 processes sensory stimuli in a stereotyped manner, encompassing two types of activity: evoked activity (phase-locked to the stimulus) and induced activity (non-phase-locked to the stimulus). Time-frequency analyses of extracellular potentials recorded from all layers and the surface of the auditory cortex of anesthetized guinea pigs of both sexes showed that ICMS during the processing of a transient acoustic stimulus differentially affected the evoked and induced response. Specifically, ICMS enhanced the long-latency-induced component, mimicking physiological gain increasing top-down feedback processes. Furthermore, the phase of the local field potential at the time of stimulation was predictive of the response amplitude for acoustic stimulation, ICMS, as well as combined acoustic and electric stimulation. Together, this was interpreted as a sign that the response to electrical stimulation was integrated into the ongoing cortical processes in contrast to substituting them. Consequently, ICMS modulated the cortical response to a sensory stimulus. We propose such targeted modulation of cortical activity (as opposed to a stimulation that substitutes the ongoing processes) as an alternative approach for cortical prostheses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is commonly used to activate a specific subset of cortical neurons, without taking into account the ongoing activity at the time of stimulation. Here, we found that a low-current ICMS pulse modulated the way the auditory cortex processed a peripheral stimulus, by supra-additively combining the response to the ICMS with the cortical processing of the peripheral stimulus. This artificial modulation mimicked natural modulations of response magnitude such as attention or expectation. In contrast to what was implied in earlier studies, this shows that the response to electrical stimulation is not substituting ongoing cortical activity but is integrated into the natural processes.</p>

<p>Alcohol withdrawal symptoms contribute to excessive alcohol drinking and relapse in alcohol-dependent individuals. Among these symptoms, alcohol withdrawal promotes hyperalgesia, but the neurological underpinnings of this phenomenon are not known. Chronic alcohol exposure alters cell signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), and the CeA is implicated in mediating alcohol dependence-related behaviors. The CeA projects to the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a region critical for descending pain modulation, and may have a role in alcohol withdrawal hyperalgesia. Here, we tested the roles of (1) CeA projections to PAG, (2) CeA melanocortin signaling, and (3) PAG μ-opioid receptor signaling in mediating thermal nociception and alcohol withdrawal hyperalgesia in male Wistar rats. Our results demonstrate that alcohol dependence reduces GABAergic signaling from CeA terminals onto PAG neurons and alters the CeA melanocortin system, that CeA-PAG projections and CeA melanocortin signaling mediate alcohol withdrawal hyperalgesia, and that μ-opioid receptors in PAG filter CeA effects on thermal nociception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hyperalgesia is commonly seen in individuals with alcohol use disorder during periods of withdrawal, but the neurological underpinnings behind this phenomenon are not completely understood. Here, we tested whether alcohol dependence exerts its influence on pain modulation via effects on the limbic system. Using behavioral, optogenetic, electrophysiological, and molecular biological approaches, we demonstrate that central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) projections to periaqueductal gray mediate thermal hyperalgesia in alcohol-dependent and alcohol-naive rats. Using pharmacological approaches, we show that melanocortin receptor-4 signaling in CeA alters alcohol withdrawal hyperalgesia, but this effect is not mediated directly at synaptic inputs onto periaqueductal gray-projecting CeA neurons. Overall, our findings support a role for limbic influence over the descending pain pathway and identify a potential therapeutic target for treating hyperalgesia in individuals with alcohol use disorder .</p>

<p>Reliable spike detection and sorting, the process of assigning each detected
spike to its originating neuron, is an essential step in the analysis of
extracellular electrical recordings from neurons. The volume and complexity of
the data from recently developed large scale, high density microelectrode
arrays and probes, which allow recording from thousands of channels
simultaneously, substantially complicate this task conceptually and
computationally. This chapter provides a summary and discussion of recently
developed methods to tackle these challenges, and discuss the important aspect
of algorithm validation, and assessment of detection and sorting quality.

<p>The brain can display self-sustained activity (SSA), which is the persistent
firing of neurons in the absence of external stimuli. This spontaneous activity
shows low neuronal firing rates and is observed in diverse in vitro and in vivo
situations. In this work, we study the influence of excitatory/inhibitory
balance, connection density, and network size on the self-sustained activity of
a neuronal network model. We build a random network of adaptive exponential
integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neuron models connected through inhibitory and
excitatory chemical synapses. The AdEx model mimics several behaviours of
biological neurons, such as spike initiation, adaptation, and bursting
patterns. In an excitation/inhibition balanced state, if the mean connection
degree (K) is fixed, the firing rate does not depend on the network size (N),
whereas for fixed N, the firing rate decreases when K increases. However, for
large K, SSA states can appear only for large N. We show the existence of SSA
states with similar behaviours to those observed in experimental recordings,
such as very low and irregular neuronal firing rates, and spike-train power
spectra with slow fluctuations, only for balanced networks of large size.

<p>Pain remains a major concern in patients suffering from metastatic cancer to
the bone and more knowledge of the condition, as well as novel treatment
avenues, are called for. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a highly conserved peptide
that appears to play a central role in nociceptive signaling in inflammatory
and neuropathic pain. However, little is known about the peptide in
cancer-induced bone pain. Here, we evaluate the role of spinal NPY in the
MRMT-1 rat model of cancer-induced bone pain. Our studies revealed an
up-regulation of NPY-immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of cancer-bearing rats
17 days after inoculation, which could be a compensatory antinociceptive
response. Consistent with this interpretation, intrathecal administration of
NPY to rats with cancer-induced bone pain caused a reduction in nociceptive
behaviors that lasted up to 150 min. This effect was diminished by both Y1
(BIBO3304) and Y2 (BIIE0246) receptor antagonists, indicating that both
receptors participate in mediating the antinociceptive effect of NPY. Y1 and Y2
receptor binding in the spinal cord was unchanged in the cancer state as
compared to sham-operated rats, consistent with the notion that increased NPY
results in a net antinociceptive effect in the MRMT-1 model. In conclusion, the
data indicate that NPY is involved in the spinal nociceptive signaling of
cancer-induced bone pain and could be a new therapeutic target for patients
with this condition.

<p>We analyze a large system of heterogeneous quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF)
neurons with time delayed, all-to-all synaptic coupling. The model is exactly
reduced to a system of firing rate equations that is exploited to investigate
the existence, stability and bifurcations of fully synchronous, partially
synchronous, and incoherent states. In conjunction with this analysis we
perform extensive numerical simulations of the original network of QIF neurons,
and determine the relation between the macroscopic and microscopic states for
partially synchronous states. The results are summarized in two phase diagrams,
for homogeneous and heterogeneous populations, which are obtained analytically
to a large extent. For excitatory coupling, the phase diagram is remarkably
similar to that of the Kuramoto model with time delays, although here the
stability boundaries extend to regions in parameter space where the neurons are
not self-sustained oscillators. In contrast, the structure of the boundaries
for inhibitory coupling is different, and already for homogeneous networks
unveils the presence of various partially synchronized states not present the
Kuramoto model: Collective chaos, quasiperiodic partial synchronization (QPS),
and a novel state which we call modulated-QPS (M-QPS). In the presence of
heterogeneity partially synchronized states remininscent to collective chaos,
QPS and M-QPS persist. In addition, the presence of heterogeneity greatly
amplifies the differences between the incoherence stability boundaries of
excitaton and inhibition. Finally, we compare our results with those of a
traditional (Wilson Cowan-type) firing rate model with time delays. The
oscillatory instabilities of the traditional firing rate model qualitatively
agree with our results only for the case of inhibitory coupling with strong
heterogeneity.

<p>The problem of detecting changes in firing patterns in neural data is
studied. The problem is formulated as a quickest change detection problem.
Important algorithms from the literature are reviewed. A new algorithmic
technique is discussed to detect deviations from learned baseline behavior. The
algorithms studied can be applied to both spike and local field potential data.
The algorithms are applied to mice spike data to verify the presence of

Wilfrid (Wil) Rall was an outstanding scientist and a unique person—warm and modest, despite being a scientific renaissance man. He is the founding father of the field of dendritic modeling and the developer of both cable theory and the compartmental modeling approach for studying dendrites and synaptic integration. He was the first to draw attention to the computational role of dendrites, to dendritic nonlinearities, and to plastic processes in dendritic spines. It is thanks to Rall’s 40 years of pioneering theoretical studies, dendrites have become the focus of worldwide research interest, culminating in the recent evidence that local dendritic processing may play a key role in behavior.

Genomic data are becoming increasingly valuable as we develop methods to utilize the information at scale and gain a greater understanding of how genetic information relates to biological function. Advances in synthetic biology and the decreased cost of sequencing are increasing the amount of privately held genomic data. As the quantity and value of private genomic data grows, so does the incentive to acquire and protect such data, which creates a need to store and process these data securely. We present an algorithm for the Secure Interrogation of Genomic DataBases (SIG-DB). The SIG-DB algorithm enables databases of genomic sequences to be searched with an encrypted query sequence without revealing the query sequence to the Database Owner or any of the database sequences to the Querier. SIG-DB is the first application of its kind to take advantage of locality-sensitive hashing and homomorphic encryption to allow generalized sequence-to-sequence comparisons of genomic data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QHFLaNOp694" width="1" />

<p>by Davide Risso, Liam Purvis, Russell B. Fletcher, Diya Das, John Ngai, Sandrine Dudoit, Elizabeth Purdom</p>

Clustering of genes and/or samples is a common task in gene expression analysis. The goals in clustering can vary, but an important scenario is that of finding biologically meaningful subtypes within the samples. This is an application that is particularly appropriate when there are large numbers of samples, as in many human disease studies. With the increasing popularity of single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), many more controlled experiments on model organisms are similarly creating large gene expression datasets with the goal of detecting previously unknown heterogeneity within cells. It is common in the detection of novel subtypes to run many clustering algorithms, as well as rely on subsampling and ensemble methods to improve robustness. We introduce a Bioconductor R package, clusterExperiment, that implements a general and flexible strategy we entitle Resampling-based Sequential Ensemble Clustering (RSEC). RSEC enables the user to easily create multiple, competing clusterings of the data based on different techniques and associated tuning parameters, including easy integration of resampling and sequential clustering, and then provides methods for consolidating the multiple clusterings into a final consensus clustering. The package is modular and allows the user to separately apply the individual components of the RSEC procedure, i.e., apply multiple clustering algorithms, create a consensus clustering or choose tuning parameters, and merge clusters. Additionally, clusterExperiment provides a variety of visualization tools for the clustering process, as well as methods for the identification of possible cluster signatures or biomarkers. The R package clusterExperiment is publicly available through the Bioconductor Project, with a detailed manual (vignette) as well as well documented help pages for each function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6VQoRLwjR-s" width="1" />

<p>by Zeynep Ertem, Dorrie Raymond, Lauren Ancel Meyers</p>

Forecasting the emergence and spread of influenza viruses is an important public health challenge. Timely and accurate estimates of influenza prevalence, particularly of severe cases requiring hospitalization, can improve control measures to reduce transmission and mortality. Here, we extend a previously published machine learning method for influenza forecasting to integrate multiple diverse data sources, including traditional surveillance data, electronic health records, internet search traffic, and social media activity. Our hierarchical framework uses multi-linear regression to combine forecasts from multiple data sources and greedy optimization with forward selection to sequentially choose the most predictive combinations of data sources. We show that the systematic integration of complementary data sources can substantially improve forecast accuracy over single data sources. When forecasting the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza-like-illness reports (ILINet) from week 48 through week 20, the optimal combination of predictors includes public health surveillance data and commercially available electronic medical records, but neither search engine nor social media data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GOZzg2Ktwrg" width="1" />

Abstract<p>"Good science" means answering important questions convincingly, a challenging endeavor under the best of circumstances. Our inability to replicate many biomedical studies has been the subject of numerous commentaries both in the scientific and lay press. In response, statistics has re-emerged as a necessary tool to improve the objectivity of study conclusions. However, psychological aspects of decision–making introduce preconceived preferences into scientific judgment that cannot be eliminated by any statistical method. The psychology of decision making, expounded by Kahneman, Tversky and Thayer, is well known in the field of economics, but the underlying concepts of cognitive psychology are also relevant to scientific judgments. I repeated experiments carried out on undergraduates by Kahneman and colleagues four to five decades ago, but with scientists, and obtained essentially the same results. The experiments were in the form of written reactions to scenarios, and participants were scientists at all career stages. The findings reinforce the roles that two inherent intuitions play in scientific decision-making: our drive to create a coherent narrative from new data regardless of its quality or relevance, and our inclination to seek patterns in data whether they exist or not. Moreover, we do not always consider how likely a result is regardless of its P-value. Low statistical power and inattention to principles underpinning Bayesian statistics reduce experimental rigor, but mitigating skills can be learned. Overcoming our natural human tendency to make quick decisions and jump to conclusions is a deeper obstacle to doing good science; this too can be learned.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Societal approaches to improving the rigor and reproducibility of preclinical biomedical science have largely been technical in nature with a renewed focus on the role of statistics in good experimental designs. By contrast, the importance of preconceived notions introduced by our very human nature has been under-appreciated for their influence on scientific judgments. Explicitly recognizing and addressing these cognitive biases, and including such strategies as carrying out a "premortem" before embarking on new experimental directions, should improve scientific judgments and thereby improve the quality of published findings, eventually boosting public confidence in science.</p>

Abstract
<p>It is often assumed that during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep the cerebral cortex homogenously shows electroencephalogram (EEG) activity highly similar to wakefulness. However, to date no studies have compared neural oscillatory activity in human REM sleep to resting wakefulness with high spatial sampling. In the current study, we evaluated high-resolution topographical changes in neural oscillatory power between both early and late naturalistic REM sleep and resting wakefulness in adult humans. All-night recordings with 256-channel high-density EEG (hd-EEG) were collected in healthy volunteers (<i>N</i> = 12). Topographic analysis revealed that, compared to wake, both the first and last cycle of REM sleep were associated with increased low-frequency oscillations in local central and occipital regions. In contrast, high-frequency activity in both α and β bands (8–20 Hz) was globally decreased during both early and late REM sleep cycles compared to wakefulness. No significant differences in topographic power in any frequency band were observed between REM sleep cycles occurring early and late in the night. We replicated these findings in an independent dataset (<i>N</i> = 33). Together, our findings show that human REM sleep shows consistent topographical changes in oscillatory power across both early and late sleep cycles compared to resting wakefulness.</p>

Abstract<p>Advances in calcium imaging have made it possible to record from an increasingly larger number of neurons simultaneously. Neuroscientists can now routinely image hundreds to thousands of individual neurons. An emerging technical challenge that parallels the advancement in imaging a large number of individual neurons is the processing of correspondingly larger datasets. One important step is the identification of individual neurons. Traditional methods rely mainly on manual or semi-manual inspection, which cannot be scaled for processing large datasets. To address this challenge, we focused on developing an automated segmentation method, which we refer to as Automated Cell Segmentation by Adaptive Thresholding (ACSAT). ACSAT works with a time-collapsed image and includes an iterative procedure that automatically calculates global and local threshold values during successive iterations based on the distribution of image pixel intensities. Thus, the algorithm is capable of handling variations in morphological details and in fluorescence intensities in different calcium imaging datasets. Within this manuscript we demonstrate the utility of ACSAT by testing it on 500 simulated datasets, two wide-field hippocampus datasets, a wide-field striatum dataset, a wide-field cell culture dataset, and a two-photon hippocampus dataset. For the simulated datasets with truth, ACSAT achieved over 80% recall and precision when the signal-to-noise ratio was no less than ~24 dB.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> ACSAT aims at automatically segmenting cells in large-scale calcium imaging datasets. It is based on adaptive thresholding at both global and local levels and iteratively identifies individual neurons in a time-collapsed image. It is designed to address a variety of datasets, potentially involving variations in cell morphology and fluorescence intensity between different datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACSAT by testing it under a variety of conditions. For the simulated datasets with truth, ACSAT achieved recall and precision rates over 80% when the signal-to-noise ratio was no less than ~24 dB. For the datasets from mouse hippocampus and striatum, ACSAT captured ~80% of human-identified ROIs and even detected some low-intensity neurons that were initially undetected by human referees.</p>

<p>In this paper, the deep learning (DL) approach is applied to a joint training
scheme for asynchronous motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The
proposed DL approach is a cascade of one-dimensional convolutional neural
networks and fully-connected neural networks (CNN-FC). The focus is mainly on
three types of brain responses: non-imagery EEG (\textit{background EEG}),
(\textit{pure imagery}) EEG, and EEG during the transitional period between
background EEG and pure imagery (\textit{transitional imagery}). The study of
transitional imagery signals should provide greater insight into real-world
scenarios. It may be inferred that pure imagery and transitional EEG are high
and low power EEG imagery, respectively. Moreover, the results from the CNN-FC
are compared to the conventional approach for motor imagery-BCI, namely the
common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and support vector machine
(SVM) for classification (CSP-SVM). Under a joint training scheme, pure and
transitional imagery are treated as the same class, while background EEG is
another class. Ten-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate whether the joint
training scheme significantly improves the performance task of classifying pure
and transitional imagery signals from background EEG. Using sparse of just a
few electrode channels ($C_{z}$, $C_{3}$ and $C_{4}$), mean accuracy reaches
71.52 % and 70.27 % for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively. On the other hand,
mean accuracy without the joint training scheme achieve only 62.68 % and 52.41
% for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively.

<p>From philosophers of ancient times to modern economists, biologists and other
researchers are engaged in revealing causal relations. The most challenging
problem is inferring the type of the causal relationship: whether it is uni- or
bi-directional or only apparent - implied by a hidden common cause only. Modern
technology provides us tools to record data from complex systems such as the
ecosystem of our planet or the human brain, but understanding their functioning
needs detection and distinction of causal relationships of the system
components without interventions. Here we present a new method, which
distinguishes and assigns probabilities to the presence of all the possible
causal relations between two or more time series from dynamical systems. The
new method is validated on synthetic datasets and applied to EEG
(electroencephalographic) data recorded in epileptic patients. Given the
universality of our method, it may find application in many fields of science.

Active intracellular transport of organelles relies on the coordinated activities of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin, ATP-dependent microtubule motor proteins. While axonemal dynein was discovered during the mid-1960s, it was not until the mid-1980s that kinesin was discovered by Ron Vale and colleagues, as reported in 1985. Their research demonstrated that the newly identified protein, isolated from both squid axoplasm and bovine brain, was independently capable of driving microtubule gliding or organelle movement.

Using new methods to functionally dissect circuits, two papers from 2015 found enhanced synaptic properties of the inputs and outputs of hippocampal adult-born neurons specifically during a critical period of their development. These studies provided a circuit-level view of unique roles for new neurons and how they cope with the ever-changing environment.

The ability of central synapses to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) still captures the imagination of scientists and has become one of the most fascinating and deeply studied questions in modern neuroscience. By the mid-1990s, however, the field was deeply ensnarled in trying to answer a passionately dichotomous question: is LTP expressed by a pre- or a postsynaptic mechanism? Experimental results that could only be seen by many as being incontrovertibly contradictory presented a perplexing conundrum.

Is an amygdala necessary to experience and perceive fear? Intriguing evidence comes from patient S.M. who lost her left and right amygdalae to disease. Initial testing suggested that S.M.’s most defining symptom was an inability to recognize fear in other people’s facial expressions. A fascinating paper by Adolphs and colleagues in 2005 examined one potential mechanism for this impairment: a failure to spontaneously attend to widened eyes, the most distinctive physical feature portrayed in symbolic fear expressions.

<p>by David G. Mets, Michael S. Brainard</p>

Studies of learning mechanisms critically depend on the ability to accurately assess learning outcomes. This assessment can be impeded by the often complex, multidimensional nature of behavior. We present a novel, automated approach to evaluating imitative learning. Conceptually, our approach estimates how much of the content present in a reference behavior is absent from the learned behavior. We validate our approach through examination of songbird vocalizations, complex learned behaviors the study of which has provided many insights into sensory-motor learning in general and vocal learning in particular. Historically, learning has been holistically assessed by human inspection or through comparison of specific song features selected by experimenters (e.g. fundamental frequency, spectral entropy). In contrast, our approach uses statistical models to broadly capture the structure of each song, and then estimates the divergence between the two models. We show that our measure of song learning (the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions corresponding to specific song data, or, Song <i>D</i><sub>KL</sub>) is well correlated with human evaluation of song learning. We then expand the analysis beyond learning and show that Song <i>D</i><sub>KL</sub> also detects the typical song deterioration that occurs following deafening. Finally, we illustrate how this measure can be extended to quantify differences in other complex behaviors such as human speech and handwriting. This approach potentially provides a framework for assessing learning across a broad range of behaviors like song that can be described as a set of discrete and repeated motor actions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YQeuwoUWgbQ" width="1" />

<p>by Athina Tzovara, Christoph W. Korn, Dominik R. Bach</p>

Learning to predict threat from environmental cues is a fundamental skill in changing environments. This aversive learning process is exemplified by Pavlovian threat conditioning. Despite a plethora of studies on the neural mechanisms supporting the formation of associations between neutral and aversive events, our computational understanding of this process is fragmented. Importantly, different computational models give rise to different and partly opposing predictions for the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning, for example expressed in the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Here, we investigate human ANS responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlovian fear conditioning. To obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses, we build on a statistical framework for psychophysiological modelling. We then consider previously proposed non-probabilistic models, a simple probabilistic model, and non-learning models, as well as different observation functions to link learning models with ANS activity. Across three experiments, and both for skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size responses (PSR), a probabilistic learning model best explains ANS responses. Notably, SCR and PSR reflect different quantities of the same model: SCR track a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PSR track expected outcome alone. In summary, by combining psychophysiological modelling with computational learning theory, we provide systematic evidence that the formation and maintenance of Pavlovian threat predictions in humans may rely on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty. This could inform theories of neural implementation of aversive learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wAb--UbEeJA" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Acetylcholine (ACh) neurons in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT) are thought to play an important role in promoting cortical activation with waking and paradoxical (or REM) sleep (PS), but have yet to be proven to do so by selective stimulation and simultaneous recording of identified ACh neurons. Here, we employed optogenetics combined with juxtacellular recording and labeling of neurons in transgenic mice expressing ChR2 in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-synthesizing neurons. We established <i>in vitro</i> then <i>in vivo</i> in anesthetized and unanesthetized, head-fixed mice that photostimulation elicited a spike with short latency in neurons which could be identified by immunohistochemical staining as ACh neurons within the laterodorsal/sublaterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT/SubLDT and PPT). Continuous light pulse stimulation during sleep evoked tonic spiking by ACh neurons that elicited a shift from irregular slow wave activity to rhythmic theta and enhanced gamma activity on the cortex without behavioral arousal. With theta frequency rhythmic light pulse stimulation, ACh neurons discharged in bursts that occurred in synchrony with evoked cortical theta. During natural sleep-wake states, they were virtually silent during slow wave sleep (SWS), discharged in bursts during PS and discharged tonically during waking (W). Yet, their bursting during PS was not rhythmic or synchronized with cortical theta, but associated with phasic whisker movements. We conclude that ACh PMT neurons promote theta and gamma cortical activity during W and PS by their tonic or phasic discharge through release of ACh onto local neurons within the PMT and/or more distant targets in the hypothalamus and thalamus.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> By selectively stimulating and recording acetylcholine (ACh) neurons in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT), we show that evoked tonic or theta rhythmic phasic firing by ACh neurons attenuates slow wave activity and stimulates theta and gamma activity on the cerebral cortex without eliciting behavioral arousal from sleep. During natural sleeping-waking, ACh neurons are virtually silent during slow wave sleep (SWS), discharge in bursts during paradoxical or REM sleep (PS) and discharge in a tonic manner during waking (W). We conclude that by tonic or burst discharge during W and PS, ACh PMT neurons promote theta with gamma activities that are known to be important for memory along with other cortical processes during these states.</p>

Abstract<p>Myelination of prefrontal circuits during adolescence is thought to lead to enhanced cognitive processing and improved behavioral control. However, while standard neuroimaging techniques commonly used in human and animal studies can measure large white matter bundles and residual conduction speed, they cannot directly measure myelination of individual axons or how fast electrical signals travel along these axons. Here we focused on a specific population of prefrontal axons to directly measure conduction velocity and myelin microstructure in developing male rats. An <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiological approach enabled us to isolate monosynaptic projections from the anterior branches of the corpus callosum (corpus callosum-forceps minor, CC<sub>FM</sub>) to the anterior cingulate subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex (Cg1) and to measure the speed and direction of action potentials propagating along these axons. We found that a large number of axons projecting from the CC<sub>FM</sub> to neurons in layer V of Cg1 are ensheathed with myelin between pre-adolescence (postnatal day 15) and mid-adolescence (postnatal day 43). This robust increase in axonal myelination is accompanied by a doubling of transmission speed. As there was no age difference in the diameter of these axons, myelin is likely the driving force behind faster transmission of electrical signals in older animals. These developmental changes in axonal microstructure and physiology may extend to other axonal populations as well, and could underlie some of the improvements in cognitive processing between childhood and adolescence.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Neural processing improves during childhood and adolescent development, but the specific factors contributing to these developmental changes are largely unknown. The present study shows that between two and six weeks of age in male rats, axons in the prefrontal cortex undergo microstructural and electrophysiological changes that speed up neural transmission. These axonal changes could contribute to some of the developmental improvements in behavioral control and cognitive abilities dependent on the prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>Excessive noise exposure damages sensory hair cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. Zebrafish are a highly tractable model that have advanced our understanding of drug-induced hair cell death, yet no comparable model exists for noise exposure research. We demonstrate the utility of zebrafish as model to increase understanding of hair cell damage from acoustic trauma and develop protective therapies. We created an acoustic trauma system using underwater cavitation to stimulate lateral line hair cells. We found that acoustic stimulation resulted in exposure time- and intensity-dependent lateral line and saccular hair cell damage that is maximal at 48–72 h post-trauma. The number of TUNEL+ lateral line hair cells increased 72 h post-exposure, whereas no increase was observed in TUNEL+ supporting cells, demonstrating that acoustic stimulation causes hair cell-specific damage. Lateral line hair cells damaged by acoustic stimulation regenerate within 3 d, consistent with prior regeneration studies utilizing ototoxic drugs. Acoustic stimulation-induced hair cell damage is attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis or caspase activation, suggesting a requirement for translation and activation of apoptotic signaling cascades. Surviving hair cells exposed to acoustic stimulation showed signs of synaptopathy, consistent with mammalian studies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this platform to identify compounds that prevent acoustic trauma by screening a small redox library for protective compounds. Our data suggest that acoustic stimulation results in lateral line hair cell damage consistent with acoustic trauma research in mammals, providing a highly tractable model for high-throughput genetic and drug discovery studies.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Fat in the diet contributes to the pleasant mouthfeel of many foods, but overconsumption may contribute to obesity. Here we analyze what properties of fat in the mouth are sensed, by analyzing the responses of neurons in the macaque insular taste cortex, and two areas to which it projects the orbitofrontal cortex where the pleasantness of fat is represented, and the amygdala. We discovered that the firing rate responses of these fat-responsive neurons are correlated with the coefficient of sliding friction (CSF) and not with viscosity which reflects food thickness. Other, not fat-sensitive, neurons encoded viscosity and not the CSF. Neuronal population analyses confirmed that fat-responsive neurons conveyed information about the CSF but not about viscosity. Conversely the viscosity-sensitive neuronal population conveyed information about viscosity but not about the CSF. This new understanding of the representation of oral fat in the cerebral cortex and amygdala opens the way for the systematic development of foods with the pleasant mouthfeel of fat, together with ideal nutritional content and has great potential to contribute to healthy eating and a healthy body weight.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Studies of classical musicians have demonstrated that expertise modulates neural responses during auditory perception. However, it remains unclear whether such expertise-dependent plasticity is modulated by the instrument that a musician plays. To examine whether the recruitment of sensorimotor regions during music perception is modulated by instrument-specific experience, we studied nonclassical musicians—beatboxers, who predominantly use their vocal apparatus to produce sound, and guitarists, who use their hands. We contrast fMRI activity in 20 beatboxers, 20 guitarists, and 20 nonmusicians as they listen to novel beatboxing and guitar pieces. All musicians show enhanced activity in sensorimotor regions (IFG, IPC, and SMA), but only when listening to the musical instrument they can play. Using independent component analysis, we find expertise-selective enhancement in sensorimotor networks, which are distinct from changes in attentional networks. These findings suggest that long-term sensorimotor experience facilitates access to the posterodorsal “how” pathway during auditory processing.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>KCC2 is the major chloride extruder in neurons. The spatiotemporal regulation of KCC2 expression orchestrates the developmental shift towards inhibitory GABAergic drive and the formation of glutamatergic synapses. Whether KCC2’s role in synapse formation is similar in different brain regions is unknown. First, we found that KCC2 subcellular localization, but not overall KCC2 expression levels, differed between cortex and hippocampus during the first postnatal week. We performed site-specific in utero electroporation of KCC2 cDNA to target either hippocampal CA1 or somatosensory cortical pyramidal neurons. We found that a premature expression of KCC2 significantly decreased spine density in CA1 neurons, while it had the opposite effect in cortical neurons. These effects were cell autonomous, because single-cell biolistic overexpression of KCC2 in hippocampal and cortical organotypic cultures also induced a reduction and an increase of dendritic spine density, respectively. In addition, we found that the effects of its premature expression on spine density were dependent on BDNF levels. Finally, we showed that the effects of KCC2 on dendritic spine were dependent on its chloride transporter function in the hippocampus, contrary to what was observed in cortex. Altogether, these results demonstrate that KCC2 regulation of dendritic spine development, and its underlying mechanisms, are brain-region specific.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Epileptic seizures are associated with increased astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, but the fine spatiotemporal kinetics of the ictal astrocyte–neuron interplay remains elusive.

On average, astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations preceded neuronal activity in CA1 by about 8 s. In subsequent bouts of epileptic seizures, astrocytes and neurons were activated simultaneously.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Critical periods of synaptic plasticity facilitate the reordering and refining of neural connections during development, allowing the definitive synaptic circuits responsible for correct adult physiology to be established. Presynaptic spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) exists in the hippocampus, which depends on the activation of NMDARs and that probably fulfills a role in synaptic refinement. This t-LTD is present until the third postnatal week in mice, disappearing in the fourth week of postnatal development. We were interested in the mechanisms underlying this maturation related loss of t-LTD and we found that at CA3–CA1 synapses, presynaptic NMDA receptors (pre-NMDARs) are tonically active between P13 and P21, mediating an increase in glutamate release during this critical period of plasticity. Conversely, at the end of this critical period (P22–P30) and coinciding with the loss of t-LTD, these pre-NMDARs are no longer tonically active. Using immunogold electron microscopy, we demonstrated the existence of pre-NMDARs at Schaffer collateral synaptic boutons, where a decrease in the number of pre-NMDARs during development coincides with the loss of both tonic pre-NMDAR activation and t-LTD. Interestingly, this t-LTD can be completely recovered by antagonizing adenosine type 1 receptors (A<sub>1</sub>R), which also recovers the tonic activation of pre-NMDARs at P22–P30. By contrast, the induction of t-LTD was prevented at P13–P21 by an agonist of A<sub>1</sub>R, as was tonic pre-NMDAR activation. Furthermore, we found that the adenosine that mediated the loss of t-LTD during the fourth week of development is supplied by astrocytes. These results provide direct evidence for the mechanism that closes the window of plasticity associated with t-LTD, revealing novel events probably involved in synaptic remodeling during development.</span>

<p>by Hyoungkyu Kim, Joon-Young Moon, George A. Mashour, UnCheol Lee</p>

Hysteresis, the discrepancy in forward and reverse pathways of state transitions, is observed during changing levels of consciousness. Identifying the underlying mechanism of hysteresis phenomena in the brain will enhance the ability to understand, monitor, and control state transitions related to consciousness. We hypothesized that hysteresis in brain networks shares the same underlying mechanism of hysteresis as other biological and non-biological networks. In particular, we hypothesized that the principle of explosive synchronization, which can mediate abrupt state transitions, would be critical to explaining hysteresis in the brain during conscious state transitions. We analyzed high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) that was acquired in healthy human volunteers during conscious state transitions induced by the general anesthetics sevoflurane or ketamine. We developed a novel method to monitor the temporal evolution of EEG networks in a parameter space, which consists of the strength and topography of EEG-based networks. Furthermore, we studied conditions of explosive synchronization in anatomically informed human brain network models. We identified hysteresis in the trajectory of functional brain networks during state transitions. The model study and empirical data analysis explained various hysteresis phenomena during the loss and recovery of consciousness in a principled way: (1) more potent anesthetics induce a larger hysteresis; (2) a larger range of EEG frequencies facilitates transitions into unconsciousness and impedes the return of consciousness; (3) hysteresis of connectivity is larger than that of EEG power; and (4) the structure and strength of functional brain networks reconfigure differently during the loss vs. recovery of consciousness. We conclude that the hysteresis phenomena observed during the loss and recovery of consciousness are generic network features. Furthermore, the state transitions are grounded in the same principle as state transitions in complex non-biological networks, especially during perturbation. These findings suggest the possibility of predicting and modulating hysteresis of conscious state transitions in large-scale brain networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aUxmACj420A" width="1" />

Isolation profoundly influences social behavior in all animals. In humans, isolation has serious effects on health and disease. <i>Drosophila</i> melanogaster is a powerful model to study small-scale, temporally-transient social behavior. However, longer-term analysis of large groups of flies is hampered by the lack of effective and reliable tools. We built a new imaging arena and improved the existing tracking algorithm to reliably follow a large number of flies simultaneously. Next, based on the automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis, we designed an algorithm to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. We observed that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. We explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that whereas behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one. These changes occurred mostly in metabolic genes, and we verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase of lipid content in isolated flies. In summary, we describe a highly reliable tracking and analysis pipeline for large groups of flies that we use to unravel the behavioral, molecular and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in <i>Drosophila</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ng-D0RyUL7g" width="1" />

<p>by Assaf Amitai, Arup K. Chakraborty, Mehran Kardar</p>

The spikes on virus surfaces bind receptors on host cells to propagate infection. High spike densities (SDs) can promote infection, but spikes are also targets of antibody-mediated immune responses. Thus, diverse evolutionary pressures can influence virus SDs. HIV’s SD is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of other viruses, a surprising feature of unknown origin. By modeling antibody evolution through affinity maturation, we find that an intermediate SD maximizes the affinity of generated antibodies. We argue that this leads most viruses to evolve high SDs. T helper cells, which are depleted during early HIV infection, play a key role in antibody evolution. We find that T helper cell depletion results in high affinity antibodies when SD is high, but not if SD is low. This special feature of HIV infection may have led to the evolution of a low SD to avoid potent immune responses early in infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dcSOF7zmBHg" width="1" />

<p>by Jay S. Coggan, Daniel Keller, Corrado Calì, Heikki Lehväslaiho, Henry Markram, Felix Schürmann, Pierre J. Magistretti</p>

The mechanism of rapid energy supply to the brain, especially to accommodate the heightened metabolic activity of excited states, is not well-understood. We explored the role of glycogen as a fuel source for neuromodulation using the noradrenergic stimulation of glia in a computational model of the neural-glial-vasculature ensemble (NGV). The detection of norepinephrine (NE) by the astrocyte and the coupled cAMP signal are rapid and largely insensitive to the distance of the locus coeruleus projection release sites from the glia, implying a diminished impact for volume transmission in high affinity receptor transduction systems. Glucosyl-conjugated units liberated from glial glycogen by NE-elicited cAMP second messenger transduction winds sequentially through the glycolytic cascade, generating robust increases in NADH and ATP before pyruvate is finally transformed into lactate. This astrocytic lactate is rapidly exported by monocarboxylate transporters to the associated neuron, demonstrating that the astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle activated by glycogenolysis is a likely fuel source for neuromodulation and enhanced neural activity. Altogether, the energy supply for both astrocytes and neurons can be supplied rapidly by glycogenolysis upon neuromodulatory stimulus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6DA81-uUvVk" width="1" />

<p>by Martin Raden, Mostafa Mahmoud Mohamed, Syed Mohsin Ali, Rolf Backofen</p>

The investigation of RNA-based regulation of cellular processes is becoming an increasingly important part of biological or medical research. For the analysis of this type of data, RNA-related prediction tools are integrated into many pipelines and workflows. In order to correctly apply and tune these programs, the user has to have a precise understanding of their limitations and concepts. Within this manuscript, we provide the mathematical foundations and extract the algorithmic ideas that are core to state-of-the-art RNA structure and RNA–RNA interaction prediction algorithms. To allow the reader to change and adapt the algorithms or to play with different inputs, we provide an open-source web interface to JavaScript implementations and visualizations of each algorithm. The conceptual, teaching-focused presentation enables a high-level survey of the approaches, while providing sufficient details for understanding important concepts. This is boosted by the simple generation and study of examples using the web interface available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/. In combination, we provide a valuable resource for teaching, learning, and understanding the discussed prediction tools and thus enable a more informed analysis of RNA-related effects.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1_pSZRr6Y0c" width="1" />

Workshops are used to explore a specific topic, to transfer knowledge, to solve identified problems, or to create something new. In funded research projects and other research endeavours, workshops are the mechanism used to gather the wider project, community, or interested people together around a particular topic. However, natural questions arise: how do we measure the impact of these workshops? Do we know whether they are meeting the goals and objectives we set for them? What indicators should we use? In response to these questions, this paper will outline rules that will improve the measurement of the impact of workshops.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gVu--tVzHZU" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The mammalian visual system has a remarkable capacity to detect differences in contrast across time, which is known as temporal contrast sensitivity (TCS). Details of the underlying neural mechanisms are rapidly emerging as a result of a series of elegant electrophysiological studies performed largely with the mouse as an experimental model. However, rigorous psychophysical methods are necessary to pair the electrophysiology with temporal visual behavior in mouse. The optomotor response is frequently used as a proxy for retinal temporal processing in rodents. However, subcortical reflexive pathways drive the optomotor response rather than cortical decision-making areas. To address this problem, we have developed an operant behavior assay that measures TCS in behaving mice. Mice were trained to perform a forced-choice visual task and were tested daily on their ability to distinguish flickering from nonflickering overhead lights. Correct responses (Hit and Correct Rejections) were rewarded. Contrast, temporal frequency, and mean illumination of the flicker were the independent variables. We validated and applied the theory of signal detection to estimate the discriminability factor (<i>d</i>{acute}), a measure of performance that is independent of response bias and motivation. The empirical contrast threshold was defined as the contrast necessary to elicit <i>d</i>{acute} = 1 and TCS as the inverse of the contrast threshold. With this approach, we established in the mouse a model of human vision that shares fundamental properties of human temporal psychophysics such as Weber adaptation in response to low temporal frequency flicker and illumination-dependent increases in critical flicker frequency as predicted by the Ferry–Porter law.</p>

<p>L-selectin, a lectin-like receptor on all leukocyte classes, functions in adhesive and signaling roles in the recruitment of myeloid cells from the blood to sites of inflammation. Here, we consider L-selectin as a determinant of neurological recovery in a murine model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Spinal cord-injured, L-selectin knock-out (KO) mice (male) showed improved long-term recovery with greater white matter sparing relative to wild-type (WT) mice and reduced oxidative stress in the injured cord at 72 h post-SCI. There was a partial and transient reduction in accumulation of neutrophils in the injured spinal cords of KOs at 24 h post-injury. To complement these findings with KO mice, we sought a pharmacologic means for lowering L-selectin levels. We found that diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), induced the shedding of L-selectin from the cell surface of myeloid subsets, specifically neutrophils and non-classical monocytes, in the blood and the injured spinal cord. Diclofenac administration to injured WT mice enhanced neurological recovery to a level comparable to that of KOs but did not improve recovery in KOs. While diclofenac treatment had no effect on myeloid cell accumulation, there was a reduction in oxidative stress at 72 h post-SCI. These findings implicate L-selectin in secondary pathogenesis beyond a role in leukocyte recruitment and raise the possibility of repurposing diclofenac for the treatment of SCI.</p>

Heisler et al. demonstrate that prion protein intracellular transport is important for the progression of prion disease. They identify a regulatory mechanism of bidirectional prion protein vesicle trafficking and propose a novel transport pathway that connects intracellular lysosomal degradation with extracellular exosome trafficking under neurodegenerative conditions.

<p>by Ilya Patrushev, Christina James-Zorn, Aldo Ciau-Uitz, Roger Patient, Michael J. Gilchrist</p>

The precise anatomical location of gene expression is an essential component of the study of gene function. For most model organisms this task is usually undertaken via visual inspection of gene expression images by interested researchers. Computational analysis of gene expression has been developed in several model organisms, notably in <i>Drosophila</i> which exhibits a uniform shape and outline in the early stages of development. Here we address the challenge of computational analysis of gene expression in <i>Xenopus</i>, where the range of developmental stages of interest encompasses a wide range of embryo size and shape. Embryos may have different orientation across images, and, in addition, embryos have a pigmented epidermis that can mask or confuse underlying gene expression. Here we report the development of a set of computational tools capable of processing large image sets with variable characteristics. These tools efficiently separate the <i>Xenopus</i> embryo from the background, separately identify both histochemically stained and naturally pigmented regions within the embryo, and can sort images from the same gene and developmental stage according to similarity of gene expression patterns without information about relative orientation. We tested these methods on a large, but highly redundant, collection of 33,289 <i>in situ</i> hybridization images, allowing us to select representative images of expression patterns at different embryo orientations. This has allowed us to put a much smaller subset of these images into the public domain in an effective manner. The ‘isimage’ module and the scripts developed are implemented in Python and freely available on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isimage/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BCC2oED3Kxg" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: December 2018</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53</p><p>Author(s): Sara Mancinelli, Simona Lodato</p><div><p>The neocortex is by far one of the most complex regions of the mammalian brain, characterized by an extraordinary diversity of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, whose coordinated development and function guarantee the execution of high-order cognitive, sensory, and motor behaviours. Decoding its heterogeneity and understanding the molecular strategies upon which the cerebral cortex is built during development have been at the core of neuroscientists’ work for decades. Here, we will focus on the current classification of neuronal types (both excitatory and inhibitory) of the neocortex in light of the insights provided by recent single-cell omic technologies, which have offered — with unprecedented resolution — an extended framework to interpret cortical diversity and its developmental origin. We will cover the impact of neuronal subtype identity on generating specific neuronal networks (neuron-to-neuron interaction), as well as their effect on the development of the non-neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex.</p></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human high-level visual cortex comprises regions specialized for the processing of distinct types of stimuli, such as objects, animals, and human actions. How does this specialization emerge? Here, we investigated the role of effector-specific visuomotor coupling experience in shaping the organization of the action observation network (AON) as a window on this question. Observed body movements are frequently coupled with corresponding motor codes, e.g., during monitoring one’s own movements and imitation, resulting in bidirectionally connected circuits between areas involved in body movements observation (e.g., of the hand) and the motor codes involved in their execution. If the organization of the AON is shaped by this effector-specific visuomotor coupling, then, it should not form for body movements that do not belong to individuals’ motor repertoire. To test this prediction, we used fMRI to investigate the spatial arrangement and functional properties of the hand and foot action observation circuits in individuals born without upper limbs. Multivoxel pattern decoding, pattern similarity, and univariate analyses revealed an intact hand AON in the individuals born without upper limbs. This suggests that the organization of the AON does not require effector-specific visuomotor coupling.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Subplate (SP) neurons exhibit spontaneous plateau depolarizations mediated by connexin hemichannels. Postnatal (P1–P6) mice show identical voltage pattern and drug-sensitivity as observed in slices from human fetal cortex; indicating that the mouse is a useful model for studying the cellular physiology of the developing neocortex. In mouse SP neurons, spontaneous plateau depolarizations were insensitive to blockers of: synaptic transmission (glutamatergic, GABAergic, or glycinergic), pannexins (probenecid), or calcium channels (mibefradil, verapamil, diltiazem); while highly sensitive to blockers of gap junctions (octanol), hemichannels (La<sup>3+</sup>, lindane, Gd<sup>3+</sup>), or glial metabolism (DLFC). Application of La<sup>3+</sup> (100 μM) does not exert its effect on electrical activity by blocking calcium channels. Intracellular application of Gd<sup>3+</sup> determined that Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive pores (putative connexin hemichannels) reside on the membrane of SP neurons. Immunostaining of cortical sections (P1–P6) detected connexins 26, and 45 in neurons, but not connexins 32 and 36. Vimentin-positive glial cells were detected in the SP zone suggesting a potential physiological interaction between SP neurons and radial glia. SP spontaneous activity was reduced by blocking glial metabolism with DFLC or by blocking purinergic receptors by PPADS. Connexin hemichannels and ATP release from vimentin-positive glial cells may underlie spontaneous plateau depolarizations in the developing mammalian cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous in vivo studies revealed robust age-related variations in structural properties of the human cerebral cortex during adolescence. Neurobiology underlying these maturational phenomena is largely unknown. Here we employ a virtual-histology approach to gain insights into processes associated with inter-regional variations in cortical microstructure and its maturation, as indexed by magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). Inter-regional variations in MTR correlate with inter-regional variations in expression of genes specific to pyramidal cells (CA1) and ependymal cells; enrichment analyses indicate involvement of these genes in dendritic growth. On the other hand, inter-regional variations in the change of MTR during adolescence correlate with inter-regional profiles of oligodendrocyte-specific gene expression. Complemented by a quantitative hypothetical model of the contribution of surfaces associated with dendritic arbor (1631 m<sup>2</sup>) and myelin (48 m<sup>2</sup>), these findings suggest that MTR signals are driven mainly by macromolecules associated with dendritic arbor while maturational changes in the MTR signal are associated with myelination.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural responses to small manipulable objects (“tools”) in high-level visual areas in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) provide an opportunity to test how anatomically remote regions modulate ventral stream processing in a domain-specific manner. Prior patient studies indicate that grasp-relevant information can be computed about objects by dorsal stream structures independently of processing in VTC. Prior functional neuroimaging studies indicate privileged functional connectivity between regions of VTC exhibiting tool preferences and regions of parietal cortex supporting object-directed action. Here we test whether lesions to parietal cortex modulate tool preferences within ventral and lateral temporal cortex. We found that lesions to the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, a region that supports hand-shaping during object grasping and manipulation, modulate tool preferences in left VTC and in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Control analyses demonstrated that neural responses to “place” stimuli in left VTC were unaffected by lesions to parietal cortex, indicating domain-specific consequences for ventral stream neural responses in the setting of parietal lesions. These findings provide causal evidence that neural specificity for “tools” in ventral and lateral temporal lobe areas may arise, in part, from online inputs to VTC from parietal areas that receive inputs via the dorsal visual pathway.</span>

The biological stress response of the body forms one of the foundations of adaptive behavior, including promoting (and impairing) different forms of memory. This response transcends stressful experiences and underlies reactions to challenges and even reinforcers such as addictive substances. Nevertheless, drug-induced stress responses are rarely incorporated into models of addiction. We propose here that drug-induced stress responses (particularly glucocorticoids) play a crucial role in addictive behavior by modulating the formation of memories for substance-use experiences.

Behavioral adaptations occur through remodeling of brain circuits, as arising, for instance, from experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Drugs of abuse and aversive stimuli, such as stress, act on the mesocorticolimbic system, dysregulating adaptive mechanisms and leading to a variety of aberrant behaviors associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Until recently, research in the field has commonly focused on experience-dependent synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. However, there is growing evidence that synaptic plasticity within inhibitory circuits is an important contributor to maladaptive behaviors.

Arousal is an important conserved behavioral state where animals show increased sensory responsiveness and locomotor hyperactivity. Chew et al. identify a neuromodulatory pathway that enables mechanosensory neurons to promote both sensory and locomotor arousal via activation of a neuroendocrine center.

Many internal organs change volume periodically. For example, the stomach accommodates ingested food and drink, the bladder stores urine, the heart fills with blood, and the lungs expand with every breath. Specialized peripheral sensory neurons function as mechanoreceptors that detect tissue stretch to infer changes in organ volume and then relay this information to the brain. Central neural circuits process this information and evoke perceptions (satiety, nausea), control physiology (breathing, heart rate), and impact behavior (feeding, micturition).

<p><b>In vivo measurement of afferent activity with axon-specific calcium imaging</b></p><p>In vivo measurement of afferent activity with axon-specific calcium imaging, Published online: 20 August 2018; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0211-4">doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0211-4</a></p>The authors introduce a variant GCaMP that is targeted to axons. Due to its strong brightness, signal-to-noise ratio, and photostability, this tool, named axon-GCaMP, enables robust Ca2+ imaging in individual axons, including in vivo in awake mice.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/QEhbDUHYJBs" width="1" />
