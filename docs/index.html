">Dissociable Spatial and Feature Tuning of Gamma and Alpha Rhythms in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual stimulation in humans reliably induces narrowband gamma (40 - 80 Hz) increases and alpha (8 - 12 Hz) suppression in EEG, but the relationship between these rhythms is not fixed. Using high-density EEG, we mapped gamma and alpha responses across a broad set of retinotopic, orientation, and motion conditions. Gamma was strongly retinotopically tuned, with linear summation of subfield responses accurately predicting full-field responses. In contrast, alpha showed little spatial tuning, substantial responses even in the absence of visual input (anticipatory suppression), and subadditive summation consistent with divisive normalization. Across most retinotopic configurations, higher gamma coincided with stronger alpha suppression, yet systematic dissociations emerged, with full-field and foveal-centered gratings evoking stronger than expected gamma relative to alpha suppression. Orientation tuning was robust for gamma but weak for alpha, with oblique gratings producing high gamma yet weak alpha suppression, reversing the usual inverse relationship. These patterns indicate that EEG gamma power primarily reflects large-scale synchronous activity that matches the global LFP observed in macaque V1, whose spatial and feature tuning properties are independent of both single-neuron selectivity and feedback-driven alpha dynamics. The results establish a mechanistic dissociation between gamma and alpha rhythms, highlighting distinct circuit origins and tuning principles for these canonical visual responses.

">Attenuated CaV1.2-BK channel protein interaction in bipolar disorder</a></h4>

              
                Bipolar disorder (BP) is a severe mental illness featured with potential cycling of depressive and manic episodes. The recurrent cycling is known to be associated with poor prognosis. Thus, it is important to decipher the pathophysiological mechanism that may possibly underlie the cycling. In our study, by using BP patient-derived neurons, we discovered the delay of time-to-peak in depolarization-associated intracellular calcium dynamics. This cellular deficit is selectively associated with the number of manic episodes in BP patients, suggesting that this deficit may participate in the mechanism of clinical cycling. We also observed an attenuated protein interaction between the calcium and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channel and the CaV1.2 L-type VGCC in BP patients. Pharmacological and molecular interventions that target CaV1.2-BK protein interaction, directly to BK channel for the amelioration of this attenuated protein interaction rescues the disease-associated intracellular calcium deficit. To test the involvement of BK channel in cycling-associated behaviors, we generated a novel animal model.

">Human eye movements track stimulus meaning</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is a capacity- and duration-limited system that enables the representation and processing of fleeting sensory phenomena. Human fMRI studies indicate that brain areas associated with oculomotor control contribute to WM, while human eye tracking studies indicate that the physical characteristics of items held in WM can be decoded from eye movements. Whether eye movements also encode the semantic attributes of remembered stimuli is unknown. Across three experiments, we demonstrate that stimulus meaning, operationalized via category membership, can be decoded from human gaze behavior (total N = 79 adults). Category decoding was driven by a mixture of eye movement parameters, could not be explained by manual response planning, and disappeared when participants attentively processed but did not categorize stimuli. These findings provide important and novel evidence demonstrating that human oculomotor behavior varies with the semantic meaning of a stimulus.

">Causal Dynamics of Social Gaze in Primate Prefrontal-Amygdala Networks Revealed by Dynamic Bayesian Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Social gaze is a fundamental channel of primate communication, shaping dynamic interactions and fostering mutual understanding. While prior studies have mapped the behavioral correlates of social gaze across the prefrontal-amygdala circuits, the causal architecture of these interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm to integrate independently recorded sessions into "super-sessions", validated using ground-truth synthetic data, enabling the reconstruction of simultaneous multi-area recordings aligned to matched gaze sequences. Applying Dynamic Bayesian Network analysis to these super-sessions, we uncover temporally structured, behavior-dependent causal interactions among the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex. When macaques were the targets of social gaze, the brain-behavior network exhibited positive temporal modulations, with the dmPFC emerging as the dominant source and the amygdala as a primary recipient of influence. When macaques directed their gaze toward their partners, the dmPFC and amygdala retained their respective roles. Prefrontal regions positively modulated one another, while the amygdala acted solely as a downstream target receiving exclusively negatively modulated prefrontal inputs. These findings reveal previously unknown directional interactions in the primate social brain and highlight distinct causal architectures underlying the bidirectional dynamics of social attention.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle activities (LA) are strongly related, and both are associated with dementia risk. We investigated the influence of SES and LA on brain atrophy and cognitive decline considering amyloid-beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 221 older adults (mean age, 67.1 ± 8.2 years) who underwent cognitive testing annually over a median follow-up period of 3.4 years. Longitudinal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was available for 181 participants. Measures of SES and LA were collected using questionnaires and combined to SES and LA scores using a latent variable approach. We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate if SES and LA are independently or interactively with Aβ and WMH load associated with decline in domains language, processing speed/attention, executive function, and episodic memory. Mediation models assessed whether these associations were explained by gray matter atrophy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SES and LA were associated with better cognitive performance at baseline, but were not associated with cognitive decline over time. In interaction with brain pathologies, higher LA reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ and WMH load on language decline, whereas higher SES reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ pathology on episodic memory decline. Individuals with low SES showed faster Aβ-related gray matter atrophy, which mediated the association between Aβ and episodic memory decline but not language decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that multiple resilience mechanisms underlie the protective effects of SES and LA on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting SES-related risk factors may be most effective when implemented early, before neurodegenerative changes begin. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tofersen is the first effective and approved therapy for superoxide dismutase 1 (<i>SOD1</i>)-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS [SOD1-ALS]). Following treatment with tofersen, neurofilament levels in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum seem to respond earlier than clinical parameters. This evidence prompted us to hypothesize that this novel treatment could provide an opportunity to identify additional biomarkers responsive to therapy in SOD1-ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated a panel of 120 neural, glial, and inflammatory markers in CSF and serum samples longitudinally collected from a total of 28 SOD1-ALS patients at baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment with tofersen, followed by validation with conventional methodology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a set of proteins, including neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, amyloid-beta 1–40 and amyloid-beta 1–42, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), whose CSF levels both differed between SOD1-ALS and the control group, and were responsive to tofersen at 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Another group of markers, including the neuropentraxin (NPTX) family members NPTX1, NPTX2 and NPTXR, did not separate untreated SOD1-ALS from controls, but was responsive to tofersen. At 12 months on tofersen the levels of neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, NPTX1, NPTX2, and NPTXR remained reduced compared with baseline, and correlated with the clinical response to tofersen. Consistent with increasing CSF pleocytosis and intrathecal immunoglobulin production, inflammatory markers were significantly increased after 12 months of treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight a complex, time-dependent differential response of CSF biomarkers to tofersen treatment, and may pave the way for developing a panel of responsive proteins to make biomarker endpoints more robust in clinical trials for SOD1-ALS and beyond.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The understanding of neurofilament light chain (NfL) presence and release in oligodendrocytes is limited. This study aims to determine the NfL expression in oligodendrocytes, investigate whether excess ɑ-synuclein (α-syn) impacts NfL expression, release, and functions in oligodendrocytes, as well as detect plasma NfL-positive oligodendrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (ODEVs) changes in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls (HCs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>NfL expression in oligodendrocytes was assessed using RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining in human and mouse brain slices, as well as flow cytometry in mouse brain single-cells. The MO3.13 oligodendrocyte cell line was used to mimic MSA pathology with α-syn overexpression or preformed fibril treatment. NfL levels were detected in cell line, brain tissues and condition media, and the differences between MSA pathology and controls were compared. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were quantified using nano-scale flow cytometry in a cohort of 101 MSA patients, 96 PD patients, and 97 HCs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both <i>NEFL</i> mRNA and NfL protein showed co-localization with typical oligodendrocyte marker anti-2,3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). A total of 58.5% of CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes co-expressed NfL. Increased α-syn load elevates NfL expression in both oligodendrocyte cell line and MSA patient brain slices. NfL overexpression inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, but did not affect α-syn-induced cell viability deficits. α-Syn promoted oligodendrocytic NfL release via extracellular vesicles. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were elevated in MSA patients compared to PD and HCs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest additional cellular roles for NfL in oligodendrocytes beyond its established function in neurons and have potential implications for the neurodegenerative pathophysiology of MSA. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Spreckels et al. study human milk oligosaccharides and milk microbiota in Lifelines NEXT families. Human milk has an individual-specific composition, which is affected by maternal genetics, lactation stage, subclinical mastitis, and different feeding practices. Specific milk components associate with early infant gut microbiota composition and, potentially, infant growth and eczema.

">Local homeostasis preserves global neural dynamics compensating for structural loss during human lifespan aging</a></h4>

              
                Aging brain undergoes a structural decline over lifespan accompanied by changes in neurotransmitter levels, leading to altered functional markers. Past studies have reported human resting state brain display a remarkable preservation of coordination among neural assemblies stemming from an underlying neurocomputational principles along aging trajectories, however, the true nature of which remains unknown. Here, we identify the computational mechanisms with which neurotransmitters, such as altered GABA and glutamate concentrations, can preserve functional integration across lifespan aging, despite structural decline. We employ multiscale, biophysically grounded modeling, constrained by the empirically derived anatomical connectome of the human brain, where the neurotransmitter concentrations can be free parameters that are algorithmically adjusted to maintain regional homeostasis and optimal working point. The two estimated neurotransmitters can maintain critical firing rates in the brain region and mimic age-associated functional connectivity patterns, consistent with empirical observations. We identified invariant GABA and reduced glutamate as the principle computational mechanism that can explain the topological variation of functional connectivity along lifespan, validated using graph-theoretic metrics. The results are subsequently replicated on three distinct datasets. Thus, the study offers an operational framework that integrates brain network dynamics at macroscopic and molecular scales, to gain insight into age-associated neural disorders.

">ATXN2 polyglutamine expansion impairs QKI-dependent alternative splicing and oligodendrocyte maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polyglutamine (polyQ) tract expansion mutations in Ataxin-2 gene (ATXN2) are associated with neurodegenerative diseases spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), while the therapeutic reduction of ATXN2 confers strong health-/lifespan extension in models of both disorders. Although the involvement of ATXN2 in peripheral lipid metabolism has been elaborated in Atxn2 knock-out mice, its impact on nervous system lipid maintenance and a potential influence on oligodendrocytes remains unexplored. Methods: We examine the nervous tissue of an authentic ATXN2 polyQ expansion mouse model in terms of (i) gross morphology of the brain and differential glial affection via immunohistochemical analyses, (ii) spinocerebellar proteome profile via label-free mass spectroscopy and (iii) alternative splicing patterns of oligodendroglial transcripts via quantitative RT-PCR. Finally, electrophysiological recording of sensory response in cerebellar Purkinje cells was performed as a phenotypic measure of demyelination. Results: We demonstrate a massive impairment in myelin maintenance due to ATXN2 polyQ expansion, affecting key oligodendroglial proteins accompanied by their splicing anomalies much earlier than disease manifestation. Oligodendroglial ATXN2 aggregates were documented for the first time in cerebellum, which sequestrated the RNA splicing factor Quaking (QKI). As an outcome of demyelination, our SCA2 model showed a significant delay in response to sensory stimuli. Conclusions: Overall, we provide pioneer evidence of oligodendroglial proteotoxicity leading to myelin maintenance defects in an authentic mouse model of SCA2. Our findings suggest that not only neuronal metabolism, but also that of oligodendroglia depends on ATXN2 and is affected during the disease course. This novel aspect of ATXN2 pathomechanism sheds light on potential new outcomes of its therapeutic manipulation, and makes it relevant also for demyelination syndromes next to SCA2 and other polyQ disorders.

">Visual dependence in postural control is increased in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Successful postural control depends on the integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs. With age, postural control degrades, leading to impaired balance and greater fall risk. Understanding how this integration changes over the lifespan is invaluable for designing more effective interventions that enable healthy postural control in older age. Earlier studies measured visual dependence using perceptual tasks or spontaneous sway comparisons across visual conditions. This study evaluates how visual dependence differs between younger and older adults within the postural control mechanism using a Central Sensorimotor Integration (CSMI) test. Eighty healthy adults (n=40, 60-87 years, n=40, 21-52 years) were exposed to small pseudorandom visual scene movements implemented in virtual reality while standing on a compliant surface. Sway responses were measured using virtual reality trackers and interpreted using an established frequency domain balance control model. Model parameters included visual weight, proportional and derivative feedback gains, time delay, and torque feedback gain. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a subgroup (n = 40) and showed excellent intra-class correlation coefficients for visual weight, proportional and derivative feedback gains (ICC = 0.89-0.96), and lower ICCs for time delay (ICC = 0.59) and torque parameters (ICC = 0.39). The main difference between age groups was visual dependence, with older adults relying 40% on vision, compared to 33% for the younger group (p = 0.042). No significant group differences were found in other model parameters. Our results provide direct evidence of an increase in visual contribution to posture control with age.

">Functional contributions of quantal and non-quantal hair cell synaptic transmission in the vestibular periphery</a></h4>

              
                Information about head motion and gravity is conveyed to the brain by vestibular nerve afferents which are subdivided by their spontaneous firing properties into regular and irregular subtypes thought to be differentially responsible for vestibulo-ocular vs vestibulo-spinal reflexes. In the vestibular periphery, afferents make glutamatergic synapses with type II hair cells (HCs) in all vertebrates. During the evolutionary transition to land, however, amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) additionally developed type I vestibular HCs in which unique calyceal afferent terminals cover the basolateral walls of one or more HCs, enabling a nonquantal (NQ) form of synaptic transmission. Most afferents receive inputs from both types of HCs, but the roles of type I vs type II HCs in generating vestibular afferent firing patterns and behaviors remains unclear. Using optogenetics in mice (both sexes), we confirm that stimulation of type II HCs drives conventional quantal glutamatergic transmission, whereas type I HC stimulation evokes nonquantal responses. In mice with disrupted glutamatergic quantal transmission, NQ transmission effectively drove afferent responses to a wide range of head movement frequencies, as assessed by both vestibular sensory evoked potentials and the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Although the distribution of afferent discharge regularity was unaffected, loss of glutamatergic transmission impaired detection of gravity as evidenced by abnormal contact righting reflex behavior. These results indicate that nonquantal glutamatergic transmission from type I HCs is sufficient to generate normal afferent firing patterns and dynamic vestibular behaviors and that glutamatergic release from type II HCs is required for the detection of gravity.

">Precision Functional Mapping of Imagined and Experienced Pain</a></h4>

              
                Imagination is a principal human capacity, enabling simulation of sensations and situations for planning, learning, and empathy. We examined neural representations of experienced and imagined pain across eight body sites using deep-phenotyping, precision functional MRI with over seven hours of scanning per participant (N = 9). Conventional mapping, pattern classification, and representational similarity analyses converged to show that both imagined and experienced pain activated nociceptive regions (e.g., dorsoposterior insula) and non-nociceptive regions (e.g., supplementary motor area). However, imagined pain did not reliably reactivate body site-selective nociceptive patterns in any region. Instead, imagined and experienced pain shared multivariate representations across widespread cortical and subcortical regions, particularly transmodal cortical areas including dorsomedial and lateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. These findings suggest that imagination generates distributed pain-like activity while preserving a neural distinction from verum pain. This distinction may explain the difficulty of vividly imagining pain and underlie its role in empathy, planning, and pain vulnerability.

">Differences in stimulus evoked electroencephalographic entropy reduction distinguishes cognitively normal Parkinson's disease participants from healthy aged-matched controls</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease best known for its defining motor symptoms. However, it is also associated with significant cognitive impairment at all stages of the disease, with many patients eventually progressing to dementia. Therefore, there exists a significant need to identify objective functional biomarkers that better predict and monitor cognitive decline. While methods that analyse either spontaneous or evoked EEG, due to increasing practical usability and ostensible objectivity, have been investigated, current approaches are limited in that the associated measures are, in the absence of a theoretical basis, purely correlative. To address this shortcoming, we propose calculating changes in evoked EEG amplitude variability, quantified using information theoretic differential entropy (DE), during a three-level passive auditory oddball task, as it is argued this will directly index functional changes in cognition. We therefore estimate changes in stimulus-evoked DE in cognitively normal PD participants (n = 25), both on and off their medication, and in healthy age-matched controls (n = 25), and find substantial stimulus (standard, target, novel) and group differences. Notably, we find the time-course of the return of post-stimulus reductions in DE (i.e., information processing) to pre-stimulus levels delayed in PD compared to healthy controls, thus mirroring the assumed bradyphrenia. The observed changes in DE, together with the corollary increases in resting alpha (8 - 13 Hz) band activity seen in PD, are explained in the context of a well-known macroscopic theory of mammalian electrocortical activity, in terms of reduced tonic thalamo-cortical drive. This method of task-evoked DE EEG amplitude variability is expected to generalise to any situation where the objective determination of cognitive function is sought.

">Variable E-field properties of dual-site tACS</a></h4>

              
                Background Dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (ds-tACS) enables the modulation of interregional functional connectivity by introducing a phase lag between the stimulating currents. However, overlapping electric fields (E-fields), particularly in closely spaced cortical targets like the primary motor cortices (M1s), may unintentionally alter E-field characteristics and confound the interpretation of functional connectivity modulation. Objective We aimed to systematically evaluate how different phase lags affect key E-field characteristics when using high-definition ds-tACS, particularly when targeting the M1s. We sought to determine which montage configuration best preserved stable E-field characteristics and investigated whether individualised montage selection could enhance control over E-field consistency. Methods We used individualised finite-element method simulations based on MRI-derived head models to quantify the effects of different phase lags on E-field characteristics. E-field magnitude, normal component, spatial distribution, directionality, and effective stimulation area were assessed for nine montages and eight phase lags. Results All E-field properties, including E-field peak magnitude, peak magnitude of the normal component, redistribution, difference to optimal directionality, and effective area of stimulation, were modulated significantly across different phase lags for all tested montages. Furthermore, we found substantial inter-individual variability in all E-field properties. Individual selection of montages improved critical properties, particularly the E-field directionality. Conclusions In contrast to common assumptions, variations in the phase lag can significantly affect key E-field properties of high-definition ds-tACS. Therefore, we recommend considering modulations of the E-field characteristics when comparing physiological or behavioural effects of ds-tACS at different phase lags. Moreover, given the high inter-individual variability, we suggest the individualisation of montages to the most relevant E-field property.

">Validity of measures of reactive balance training intensity</a></h4>

              
                Intensity is a key component of exercise prescription. However, balance training intensity is not well defined. Consequently, balance training studies often do not report exercise intensity, which hinders implementing these interventions and developing exercise guidelines. This study aimed to validate measures of reactive balance training intensity. Healthy young (n=11) and older (n=9) adults experienced moving platform balance perturbations of varying magnitudes. Candidate intensity measures were: number of reactive steps; centre of mass displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and margin of stability 100 ms post-perturbation; peak electrodermal response; and OMNI Perceived Exertion Scale and Balance Intensity Scale scores. Correlations were examined between perturbation magnitude and candidate intensity measures. We also compared candidate intensity measures between backward- and forward-fall perturbations and between age groups using generalized linear mixed models. Peak centre of mass acceleration 100 ms after the perturbation was significant positively correlated with perturbation magnitude, with no significant age-group or direction effects, suggesting that this is a valid measure of absolute perturbation intensity. Number of reactive steps, peak electrodermal response, and OMNI Perceived Exertion Scale and Balance Intensity Scale scores were significantly positively correlated with perturbation magnitude, and were significantly higher for backward-fall compared with forward fall perturbations and for older adults compared to younger adults at the same magnitude, suggesting that these are valid measures of relative perturbation intensity. These measures could be used to prescribe and report intensity of reactive balance training in future studies.

                3D surface-based computational mapping is more sensitive to localized brain alterations in neurological, developmental and psychiatric conditions than traditional gross volumetric analysis, providing fine-scale 3D maps of a wide range of surface-based features. Here we introduce a scalable toolkit for large-scale computational surface analysis, with efficient algorithms for multisite data integration, statistical harmonization, accelerated multivari-ate statistics, and visualization. We showcase the utility of the toolkit by mapping subcortical shape variations and factors that affect them across 21 international samples from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group (N=3,373).

">Sensory Inputs Drive Multi-Scale Reorganization of Cortical Dynamics for Efficient Coding</a></h4>

              
                Sensory inputs do more than activate individual neurons; they also reshape collective cortical dynamics. Using wide-field calcium imaging in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) during viewing factorial sets of shape, motion, and color stimuli, we simultaneously tracked thousands of neurons across the entire V1 and analyzed neural dynamics across thermodynamic, topological and geometric scales. While distributions of pairwise neuronal correlations remained unchanged, maximum-entropy models revealed that sensory inputs consistently lowered the network's critical temperature, signifying a selective weakening of neuronal couplings and a departure from spontaneous near-criticality. This microscale decoupling dissolved modular subnetworks, integrating previously segregated neuronal communities. Consequently, neural population activity collapsed onto a lower-dimensional manifold aligned with stimulus-defined dimensions, thereby increasing linear decoding accuracy. Further formal proofs and computational modeling demonstrated a causal chain linking sensory-driven weakening of microscale couplings to reduced mesoscale modularity and enhanced macroscale manifold capacity. Thus, our study proposes microscale neuronal couplings as a mechanistic basis for cortical networks dynamically trading off exploratory variability for representational efficiency, thus unifying criticality and efficient coding, two classical signatures of cortical computation, within a coherent multiscale framework.

">Predicting Spiking Activity from Scalp EEG</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of electroencephalography (EEG) research, the relationship between EEG and underlying spiking dynamics remains unclear. This limits our ability to infer local neural dynamics reflected in intracranial signals from EEG, a critical step to bridge electrophysiological findings across species and to develop non-invasive brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). We recorded spiking activity from a 32-channel floating microarray permanently implanted in parafoveal V1 and scalp-EEG in a male macaque monkey. While the animal fixated, the screen flickered at different temporal frequencies to induce steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). We analyzed the relationship between the V1 multi-unit spiking activity envelope (MUAe) and EEG frequency bands to predict MUAe at each time point from EEG. We extracted instantaneous spectrotemporal features of the EEG signal, including phase, amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling of its frequency bands. Although the relationship between these features and the V1 MUAe was complex and frequency-dependent, it was reliably predictive of the MUAe. Specifically, in a multivariate linear regression predicting MUAe from EEG, each EEG feature (phase, amplitude, coupling) contributed to model predictions. In addition, we found that MUAe predictions were better in shallow than deep cortical layers, and that the phase of stimulus frequency further improved MUAe predictions. Our study shows that a comprehensive account of spectrotemporal features of non-invasive EEG can inform about underlying spiking activity, which is beyond what is available when the amplitude or phase of the EEG signal is considered separately. This demonstrates the richness of the EEG signal and its complex relationship with neural spiking activity and suggests that using more comprehensive spectrotemporal signatures could improve BMI applications.

">AgRP Neuronal Suppression by Spontaneous Movement Encodes Exercise Reinforcement</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons that drive hunger-related behaviors are activated during energy deficit, encode negative valence but can be inhibited even by perception of food without digestion. Here, we show that in head-fixed mice, discrete motor actions such as spontaneous walking and conditioned licking rapidly suppress AgRP neuron activity. This suppression persisted throughout movement and terminated upon cessation, which was independent of food perception or conditioned cues. The degree of suppression was positively correlated with movement vigor. While optogenetic enhancement of AgRP neuron suppression did not initiate movement, it promoted reinforcement of concurrent walking behavior. These findings unmask that spontaneous, low intensity physical activity can reduce AgRP neuron activity reinforcing concurrent movement/exercise with implications for systemic health benefits.

">Cortical Processing for the Vestibular and Visual Input of Egomotion in Macaque Monkeys: Separate Networks with Targeted Convergence</a></h4>

              
                The integration of visual and vestibular inputs during egomotion is fundamental for both postural and navigational control. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in four macaque monkeys to investigate cortical activation in response to galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), applied through transmastoid electrodes, and egomotion-compatible (EC) optic flow patterns. Visual and vestibular stimulations activate two largely independent cortical networks: the vestibular network encompasses the insular cortex, superior parietal lobule, frontal lobe, and cingulate cortex, while optic flow primarily activated regions in the superior temporal sulcus, temporo-parietal junction, inferior parietal lobule, and restricted portions of the cingulate and frontal cortices. Despite this segregation, several areas exhibit visuo-vestibular convergence: VPS in the temporo-parietal junction, area 7 in the inferior parietal lobule, VIP and LIP in the intraparietal sulcus, MSTd in the superior temporal sulcus, CSv in the cingulate sulcus, and FEFsem in the frontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that visual and vestibular signals generated by egomotion are processed in extended and distinct cortical networks with several narrow convergence sites, consistent with the idea that multisensory integration during self-motion is achieved through selective convergence rather than general network overlap.

">A 3D Human Neuron-on-Chip Platform to Monitor Neuronal Injury Responses</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of neurological dysfunction and long-term neurodegeneration, yet the intrinsic neuronal contributions to TBI pathophysiology remain incompletely defined. Here, we present a novel Neuron-on-Chip microfluidic platform that can be used to mechanically injure mature human prefrontal cortex neurons (hPFCs) embedded in three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels, enabling the study of injury responses in pure neuronal cultures. Real-time calcium dynamics across 13 metrics of single-cell and network activity reveals biphasic injury response: an early phase (0.5-24 h) characterized by excitotoxicity, hyper-synchronized bursting, and network collapse; and a late phase (8 d) marked by sustained depolarization and structural remodeling. Secretome profiling uncovers progressive elevations in extracellular pT181 and total Tau from days 1 to 5 post-injury. Cytokine analyses identify early (24 h) elevations in IP-10, IL-10, IFN2, and NCAM, and late increases (8 d) in CXCL9 and MPO, linking neuronal activity changes to stage-specific inflammatory signaling. Immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting confirmed temporally ordered upregulation of calpain-1 and caspase-3 (days 1-3), phosphorylated Tau (AT8+, days 5-8), and neurofibrillary tangle-like Tau aggregates (NFT+, day 8). These findings establish our platform as a scalable microphysiological model for probing the dynamic cellular and molecular sequelae of neuronal response to injury, offering insights into neurodegeneration and opportunities for therapeutic discovery.

">Dual Role of Microglial TREM2 in Neuronal Degeneration and Regeneration After Axotomy</a></h4>

              
                After nerve injuries, microglia proliferate and migrate towards injured motoneurons, where they attach to the cell bodies. The significance of microglia enwrapping of axotomized motoneurons remains unclear. We found that within the same motor pools, some motoneurons degenerate while others regenerate, and each is associated with different microglia phenotypes and interactions. Microglia surrounding degenerating motoneurons form tight cell clusters (death clusters) that fully envelop the cell body and express high TREM2 and large CD68 granules, suggesting a macrophagocyte phenotype. Microglia surrounding motoneurons during the regeneration process are individualized and upregulate TREM2 and CD68; however, the CD68 granules are smaller. These microglia extend processes that scan the motoneuron surface through sweeping motions, sampling contents, and likely incorporating components through microphagocytosis. Removal of TREM2, either globally throughout development or specifically in microglia prior to nerve injuries, reduces p-SYK signaling and CD68 expression in all activated microglia, but with a sex effect: CD68 downregulation is significant in females, but not in males. Lack of TREM2 also prevents motoneuron cell body swelling (in both sexes), characteristic of the early chromatolytic reaction at the start of regeneration. This correlates with delays in muscle reinnervation. We conclude that within the same motor pools, TREM2 directs some microglia to remove degenerating motoneurons while it facilitates the regenerative phenotype of other motoneurons. The signals that direct these different microglia phenotypes over degenerating and regenerating motoneurons, as well as the mechanisms that induce degeneration in some motoneurons while most others regenerate, remain to be investigated.

">Localization of Mutant Huntingtin with HTT Exon1 P90 C-terminal Neoepitope Antibodies in Relation to Regional and Neuronal Vulnerability in Forebrain in Q175 Mice and Human Huntington's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of mutant exon 1 protein may be critical to HD pathogenesis, but the relation of this to differential regional and cellular vulnerability in HD is unknown. Objective We assessed the contribution of the accumulation of the mutant huntingtin exon 1 protein to the regional and cellular variation in HD brain pathology by determining if more vulnerable regions and neuron types were relatively enriched. Methods We performed immunolabeling using the novel monoclonal antibodies 11G2 and 1B12 against the C-terminal proline 90 (P90) neoepitope of the huntingtin exon 1 protein on forebrain of Q175 mice and human HD cases, which detect accumulation of monomeric, oligomeric and aggregates mutant exon 1 protein. Results Diffuse nuclear and aggregate immunolabeling increased in abundance in Q175 with age, with striatal projection neurons showing immunolabeling earlier than cortical neurons, and pallidal regions only showing neuropil immunolabeling. Nonetheless, some regions less affected in HD, such as hippocampus, were rich in mutant exon 1 protein as well. In humans, striatal immunolabeling was sparser than in mouse, and mainly in the neuropil, but less sparse than in striatal target areas. In human HD cortex, the P90 antibodies detected predominantly neuropil aggregates, which appeared to, in part, localize to dendrites. Conclusions Our results indicate that exon 1 mutant protein burden does appear to partly account for overall forebrain vulnerability in HD, but additional factors may contribute to vulnerability differences among forebrain regions and between specific neuron types.

                A single visual stimulus can elicit multiple concurrent representations throughout the cortex. We show that during a visual working memory task several cortical regions utilize categorical, semantic, and spatial representational formats to maintain visual stimuli in a robust fashion. We assessed the nature of orientation representations in an fMRI dataset of 40 participants performing an orientation memory task using multivariate encoding modelling. Our results show that orientation representations across the cortex form a gradient of abstraction, with more veridical representations in sensory areas and more abstract, categorical codes in anterior areas. We use cross-condition modelling to demonstrate shared neural codes between orientation and congruent verbal and location stimuli, used at different points during the trial. These findings provide evidence for a distributed account of working memory storage, where memory representations, distinct in nature and content, are present concurrently throughout the cortex.

">Corticothalamic circuit mechanisms underlying brain region and ageing variations in resting-state alpha activity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying oscillations in resting-state brain activity, which exhibit substantial spatial and age-related variations, remains a significant challenge. This study aims to characterize the contributions of neural circuits to the mechanisms governing resting-state alpha oscillations, which are crucial for various neurocognitive processes and pathologies. Using the Cam-CAN dataset, source-space MEG analyses revealed a pronounced posterior-anterior gradient in alpha frequency, alpha power, and aperiodic components, alongside notable age-related changes. Through neurophysiological modelling, we uncover strong corticothalamic interactions in occipital regions, contrasting with predominantly corticocortical interactions in frontal areas. Ageing is associated with reduced intrathalamic activity and increased corticothalamic delay in occipital regions, while fronto-central regions exhibit increased intrathalamic activity. These findings establish how different circuits shape alpha oscillations across posterior-anterior axis and age, providing a mechanistic foundation for targeted clinical interventions and offering benchmarks for future studies in patient populations.

">Cell-type-selective synaptogenesis during the development of excitatory connectivity in the mammalian neocortex</a></h4>

              
                The function of mammalian neocortex relies on the timing of axon extension and establishment of cell-type-biased patterns of excitatory synaptic connections. A subtype of excitatory neurons, layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6CThNs), ultimately exhibit a marked preference for synapsing onto parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory interneurons over more common excitatory cells in layers 6 and 4 (L6, L4). We show that the intracortical axons of L6CThNs develop in phases, elongating within L6, then pausing before extending translaminar branches into L4. Decreasing L6CThN excitability selectively enhanced axon growth in L6 but not later elaboration in L4. For both layers, we tested whether preferential synaptogenesis onto rarer PV interneurons, or promiscuous synapse formation followed by selective pruning, generated adult connectivity. We found that L6CThNs formed functional AMPA-receptor-containing synapses preferentially onto PV interneurons. Silent L6CThN synapses were not detected. Our findings show that cell-type-biased synaptogenesis underlies the formation of functional cell-type-specific excitatory connections in the neocortex.

High-resolution posture tracking of <i>C. elegans</i> has applications in genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening. While classic methods can reliably track isolated worms on uniform backgrounds, they fail when worms overlap, coil, or move in complex environments. Model-based tracking and deep learning approaches have addressed these issues to an extent, but there is still significant room for improvement in tracking crawling worms. Here we train a version of the DeepTangle algorithm developed for swimming worms using a combination of data derived from Tierpsy tracker and hand-annotated data for more difficult cases. DeepTangleCrawl (DTC) outperforms existing methods, reducing failure rates and producing more continuous, gap-free worm trajectories that are less likely to be interrupted by collisions between worms or self-intersecting postures (coils). We show that DTC enables the analysis of previously inaccessible behaviours and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in phenotypic screens, even for data that was specifically collected to be compatible with legacy trackers including low worm density and thin bacterial lawns. DTC broadens the applicability of high-throughput worm imaging to more complex behaviours that involve worm-worm interactions and more naturalistic environments including thicker bacterial lawns.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) is critical for memory formation and has been widely used to identify the neural substrate of memory traces, termed memory engram cells. Functions of IEGs have been known to be different depending on their types. However, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which different types of IEGs are selectively or concurrently involved in the formation of memory engram. To address this question, we investigated the combinative expression of c-Fos, Arc, and Npas4 proteins using immunohistochemistry following aversive and rewarding experiences across subregions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Using an automated cell detection algorithm, we found that expression patterns of c-Fos, Npas4, and Arc varied across different brain areas, with a higher increase of IEG expressing cells in the PFC and posterior BLA than in the DG. The combinative expression patterns, along with their experience-induced changes, also differed across brain areas; the co-expression of IEGs increased in the PFC and BLA following experience, whereas the increase was less pronounced in the DG and RSC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different area-to-area functional connectivity networks were extracted by different IEGs. These findings provide insights into how different IEGs and their combinations identify engram cells, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional significance of IEG-tagged memory engram cells.</p>

                Vision is crucial for effective navigation. Li et al. reveal that the dorsolateral nucleus, a higher-order thalamic area linking visual and navigational networks, encodes direction of optic flow and turning in free explorations, which contributes to spatial cognition and spatial memory.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103737">Human multiethnic radiogenomics reveals low-abundancy microRNA signature in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles for early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of pancreatic cancer</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive malignancy in humans, where early diagnosis significantly improves patient outcomes. However, effective methods for accurate and early detection remain limited. In this multiethnic study involving human subjects, we developed a liquid biopsy signature based on extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) linked to radiomics features extracted from patients’ tumor imaging. We integrated eight datasets containing clinical records, imaging data of benign and malignant pancreatic lesions, and small RNA sequencing data from plasma-derived EVs of PC patients. Radiomics features were extracted and analyzed using the limma package, with feature selection conducted via the Boruta algorithm and model construction through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression. Radiomics-related low-abundance EV miRNAs were identified via weighted gene co-expression network analysis and validated for diagnostic accuracy using 10 machine-learning algorithms. Three key EV miRNAs were found to robustly distinguish malignant from benign lesions. Subsequent molecular clustering of these miRNAs and their predicted targets identified two PC subtypes, with distinct survival profiles and therapeutic responses. Specifically, one cluster was associated with prolonged overall survival and higher predicted sensitivity to immunotherapy, while the other indicated high-risk tumors potentially amenable to targeted drug interventions. This radiogenomic EV miRNA signature in human plasma represents a promising non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of PC, with potential implications for precision treatment strategies.

                High-resolution live imaging of regeneration presents unique challenges due to the nature of the specimens (large mobile animals), the duration of the process (spanning days or weeks), and the fact that cellular resolution must be achieved without damage caused by lengthy exposures to light. Building on previous work that allowed us to image different parts of the process of leg regeneration in the crustacean <i>Parhyale hawaiensis</i>, we present here a method for live imaging that captures the entire process of leg regeneration, spanning up to 10 days, at cellular resolution. Our method includes (1) mounting and long-term live imaging of regenerating legs under conditions that yield high spatial and temporal resolution but minimise photodamage, (2) fixing and in situ staining of the regenerated legs that were imaged, to identify cell fates, and (3) computer-assisted cell tracking to determine the cell lineages and progenitors of identified cells. The method is optimised to limit light exposure while maximising tracking efficiency. Combined with appropriate cell-type-specific markers, this method may allow the description of cell lineages for every regenerated cell type in the limb.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The cortex plays a crucial role in various perceptual and cognitive functions, driven by its basic unit, the canonical cortical microcircuit. Yet, we remain short of a framework that definitively explains the structure-function relationships of this fundamental neuroanatomical motif. To better understand how physical substrates of cortical circuitry facilitate their neuronal dynamics, we employ a computational approach using recurrent neural networks and representational analyses. We examine the differences manifested by the inclusion and exclusion of biologically motivated interareal laminar connections on the computational roles of different neuronal populations in the microcircuit of hierarchically related areas throughout learning. Our findings show that the presence of feedback connections correlates with the functional modularization of cortical populations in different layers and provides the microcircuit with a natural inductive bias to differentiate expected and unexpected inputs at initialization, which we justify mathematically. Furthermore, when testing the effects of training the microcircuit and its variants with a predictive-coding-inspired strategy, we find that doing so helps better encode noisy stimuli in areas of the cortex that receive feedback, all of which combine to suggest evidence for a predictive-coding mechanism serving as an intrinsic operative logic in the cortex.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sensory processing arises from the communication between neural populations across multiple brain areas. While the widespread presence of neural response variability shared throughout a neural population limits the amount of stimulus-related information those populations can accurately represent, how this variability affects the interareal communication of sensory information is unknown. We propose a mathematical framework to understand the impact of neural population response variability on sensory information transmission. We combine linear Fisher information, a metric connecting stimulus representation and variability, with the framework of communication subspaces, which suggests that functional mappings between cortical populations are low-dimensional relative to the space of population activity patterns. From this, we partition Fisher information depending on the alignment between the population covariance and the mean tuning direction projected onto the communication subspace or its orthogonal complement. We provide mathematical and numerical analyses of our proposed decomposition of Fisher information and examine theoretical scenarios that demonstrate how to leverage communication subspaces for flexible routing and gating of stimulus information. This work will provide researchers investigating interareal communication with a theoretical lens through which to understand sensory information transmission and guide experimental design.</span>

In this regard, a recent research thread in theoretical neuroscience has focused on how recurrent neural network models and their internal dynamics enact multitask learning. To manage different tasks requires a mechanism to convey information about task identity or context into the model, which from a biological perspective may involve mechanisms of neuromodulation. In this study, we use recurrent network models to probe the distinctions between two forms of contextual modulation of neural dynamics, at the level of neuronal excitability and at the level of synaptic strength. We characterize these mechanisms in terms of their functional outcomes, focusing on their robustness to context ambiguity and, relatedly, their efficiency with respect to packing multiple tasks into finite-size networks. We also demonstrate the distinction between these mechanisms at the level of the neuronal dynamics they induce. Together, these characterizations indicate complementarity and synergy in how these mechanisms act, potentially over many timescales, toward enhancing the robustness of multitask learning.</span>

Selecting the best possible hyperparameter out of them becomes an Np-hard problem since 2N grows in N faster then any polynomial Np. Here, we introduce a layer-by-layer data-driven pruning method based on the mathematical idea aiming at a computationally scalable entropic relaxation of the pruning problem. The sparse subnetwork is found from the pretrained (full) CNN using the network entropy minimization as a sparsity constraint. This allows deploying a numerically scalable algorithm with a sublinear scaling cost.

However, the ubiquity of degeneracy in systems generated through adaptive processes complicates our understanding of the behavioral and computational strategies they employ. In this study, we investigated degeneracy in simple computational agents, known as Markov brains, trained using an artificial evolution algorithm to solve a spatial navigation task with or without associative memory. We analyzed degeneracy at three levels: behavioral, structural, and computational, with a focus on the last. Using information-theoretical concepts, Tononi et al. (1999) proposed a functional measure of degeneracy within biological networks. Here, we extended this approach to compare degeneracy across multiple networks. Using information-theoretical tools and causal analysis, we explored the computational strategies of the evolved agents and quantified their computational degeneracy. Our findings reveal a hierarchy of degenerate solutions, from varied behaviors to diverse structures and computations. Even agents with identical evolved behaviors demonstrated different underlying structures and computations. These results underscore the pervasive nature of degeneracy in neural networks, blurring the lines between the algorithmic and implementation levels in adaptive systems, and highlight the importance of advanced analytical tools to understand their complex behaviors.</span>

As recording capabilities expand to include neuronal populations across multiple brain areas, cortical layers, and cell types, interest in extending gaussian process factor models to characterize multipopulation interactions has grown. However, the cubic runtime scaling of current methods with the length of experimental trials and the number of recorded populations (groups) precludes their application to large-scale multipopulation recordings. Here, we improve this scaling from cubic to linear in both trial length and group number. We present two approximate approaches to fitting multigroup gaussian process factor models based on inducing variables and the frequency domain. Empirically, both methods achieved orders of magnitude speed-up with minimal impact on statistical performance, in simulation and on neural recordings of hundreds of neurons across three brain areas. The frequency domain approach, in particular, consistently provided the greatest runtime benefits with the fewest trade-offs in statistical performance. We further characterize the estimation biases introduced by the frequency domain approach and demonstrate effective strategies to mitigate them. This work enables a powerful class of analysis techniques to keep pace with the growing scale of multipopulation recordings, opening new avenues for exploring brain function.</span>

">Autophagy Dysfunction in iPSCs-Derived Neurons and Midbrain Organoids Carrying a SNCA Triplication</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD), characterized by a-Synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic neuronal loss, has no current cure. Autophagy is critical for a-Synuclein clearance, yet its real-time dynamics remain challenging to assess in human-relevant systems. Here, we used live-cell imaging to assess autophagy within human neuronal cultures and midbrain organoids (hMOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of PD patients carrying a triplication of the a-Synuclein gene (3xSNCA). Using the LC3-Rosella dual-fluorescent reporter, we quantified autolysosomes dynamics in real time. In 3xSNCA neuronal cultures, we detected early autophagy defects. In 3xSNCA hMOs, reduced autolysosome area, increased total and phosphorylated a-Synuclein (pS129), and decreased electrophysiological activity were observed at 50 days of differentiation (DoD). By 70 DoD, autophagy impairment became more pronounced, overlapping with dopaminergic neuron loss. These findings support the use of human iPSCs-derived models to study autophagy dysfunction in PD and demonstrate a temporal correlation between impaired autophagy, a-Synuclein pathology and neuronal degeneration.

">Inhibiting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex selectively enhances unsupervised statistical learning</a></h4>

              
                The brain must balance the automatic extraction of environmental regularities with top-down cognitive control, yet the causal neural mechanisms governing this interplay are debated. In particular, the hemispheric contributions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) remain unresolved. Here, we applied inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left, right, or bilateral DLPFC in 95 healthy adults during a probabilistic sequence learning task. We found that inhibiting the right and bilateral DLPFC significantly enhanced statistical learning compared to sham and left DLPFC stimulation. Contrary to the hypothesis that this competition is mediated by the suppression of existing knowledge, episodic memory performance was unaffected across all stimulation groups. These findings challenge a direct episodic gating mechanism and suggest the DLPFC's influence on statistical learning is hemisphere-dependent. As an alternative, we propose that right DLPFC inhibition shifts cognitive processing toward a more exploratory information-sampling strategy, a view supported by our finding of significantly greater reaction time variability in the right and bilateral stimulation groups. Together, our results provide causal evidence for a right-lateralized suppressive influence of the DLPFC on unsupervised learning and suggest its modulatory role is linked to information processing style rather than direct competition with episodic memory systems.

">Two forms of uncertainty hierarchically shape lexical predictions during natural speech processing</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension relies on contextual lexical predictions to optimize the processing of incoming words. As in other predictive paradigms, it is commonly assumed that prediction error, or surprisal, is weighted by a single summary statistic: uncertainty. Uncertainty reflects the overall unpredictability of the context and is typically quantified using Shannon entropy. However, for predictions involving many alternatives, as in speech, Shannon entropy is an ambiguous measure. We investigated alternative measures of uncertainty, namely the family of Renyi entropies, of which Shannon entropy is a special case. Using whole-brain intracranial EEG recordings in 33 epilepsy patients listening to natural, continuous speech, we show that, rather than Shannon entropy, contextual lexical uncertainty in speech is best captured by two extremes of the Renyi family. These reflect the probability of the most likely word and the spread across all plausible alternatives, which we term strength and dispersion, respectively. These representations are processed in distinct neural populations in a spatiotemporal hierarchy, with the encoding of dispersion preceding that of strength. Around each word onset, information flows between these clusters in a top-down and subsequently bottom-up sequence. Finally, they interact differentially with word surprisal during word processing. Our findings demonstrate that the brain encodes a multidimensional representation of uncertainty and reveal that multiple summary statistics may coexist in predictive processing. More broadly, this work introduces a flexible framework for characterizing the neural bases of uncertainty. It also highlights the potential mismatch between formal definitions of cognitive variables and their neural implementation.

">From one schema to another: How the prefrontal cortex responds to conflicting information</a></h4>

              
                Over time, we develop event schemas or scripts that shape our expectations about what typically happens in certain contexts. However, even after forming a memory about a certain event, we are often exposed to related information about that same event at later points in time. This additional information sometimes causes one to have to re-evaluate the interpretation of the original event. Over a two-day fNIRS experiment, participants were exposed to events that were subsequently updated with schema-congruent or schema-incongruent additional details. These schema-incongruent additional details make those events more fitting to another schema than originally was the case, meaning that participants would need to dissociate that event from the original schema and re-integrate it with another schema. The fNIRS results showed stronger PFC activity for events updated with schema-congruent compared to schema-incongruent details. When specifically looking at those events that were updated with schema-incongruent details, our results suggest that dissociating an event from the original schema and re-integrating it with another schema was accompanied by an initial PFC decrease early in the trial followed by a PFC increase later in the trial. This was a distinctly different pattern compared to trials in which participants failed to re-integrate the event with another schema, which showed delayed PFC increase with lower amplitude and no initial PFC decrease. Our results refine our understanding of mechanisms of adaptive memory updating in the face of conflicting information.

">A Core Pattern of Cerebellar and Brainstem Degeneration and Reduced Cerebrocerebellar Structural Covariance in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3): MRI Volumetrics from ENIGMA-Ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease. Here, we profile the spatial spread of atrophy across the whole brain, determine whether brain degeneration preferentially maps onto specific functional networks, and investigate the relationship between cerebellar and cerebral anatomical changes. Methods: Whole-brain grey and white matter (GM and WM) voxel-based morphometry was performed on 408 individuals with SCA3 (82 pre-ataxic) and 293 controls. The SCA3 cohort was stratified by ataxia severity to investigate disease progression, with cerebellar GM atrophy mapped onto a task-based functional atlas. Volume was correlated with disease duration and intensity. Cerebrocerebellar volumetric covariance was assessed to determine whether atrophy was coupled between infra- and supratentorial regions. Results: The pattern of atrophy is spatially consistent but progressive in magnitude across the disease course. The greatest atrophy was found in the pons, cerebellar WM, and cerebellar peduncles; correlations with disease severity and duration were also strongest in these regions. Cerebellar GM atrophy was greatest in functional regions associated with motor execution and planning, attention, and emotional processing. Sparse cerebral cortical atrophy appears only in the most severe disease subgroup, while striatal atrophy begins in the earliest stages. Reduced cerebrocerebellar structural covariance is observed in SCA3 participants versus controls. Interpretation: While cerebellar and brainstem atrophy become more severe, the pattern of atrophy remains largely consistent as SCA3 progresses. Cerebellar GM degeneration occurs in regions associated with motor, cognitive, and affective control, in line with clinical presentation. Cerebellar atrophy is not directly mirrored by cerebral changes.

">N100 as a Neural Marker of Atypical Early Auditory Encoding in Autism: Sensitivity to Pitch, Distance-Based Intensity, and Spatial Location</a></h4>

              
                Background: Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show atypical auditory perception. The N100 event-related potential (ERP) reflects early auditory encoding, predictive coding, and sensory gain. Therefore, this study examined N100 responses to speech stimuli as a neural marker of auditory processing differences in ASD. Methods: Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded using OpenBCI in 12 boys diagnosed with Level 1 ASD (requiring minimal support) and 15 typically developing (TD) peers. Participants passively listened to Romanian sentences systematically varied in pitch (normal, high, low), distance-based intensity (0.5, 1, 2 meters; 65, 59, 53 dB), and spatial presentation (binaural, left, right). N100 amplitudes and latencies were analyzed using Python and SPSS. Results: ASD group indicated significantly reduced N100 amplitudes for normal pitch stimuli (p = .030, = .175) and binaural presentation (p = .030, = .175). Marginal reductions were also observed for low pitch (p = .096, = .120), speech presented from a 0.5-meter distance (p = .058, = .147), and unilateral conditions (ps = .066.077, s = .130.142). No group differences emerged for N100 latency. These findings suggest attenuated early auditory responses in ASD to both typical and spatially complex speech cues. Conclusions: Results support predictive coding models proposing reduced sensory precision in ASD. The consistent amplitude attenuation, including near-significant findings, points to subtle but pervasive impairments in early auditory encoding. The use of ecologically valid speech stimuli and portable EEG underscores the translational potential of N100 as a biomarker for early identification and intervention in autism.

">Wide-ranging behavioral dysfunction in two mouse models of pathological human variants in the GRIK2 kainate receptor gene</a></h4>

              
                De novo variants in a subset of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) genes cause nonsyndromic neurodevelopmental disorders in individuals. Two recurrent variants in the kainate receptor (KAR) gene GRIK2 result in the gain-of-function (GoF) substitutions p.Ala657Thr and p.Thr660Lys in a critical pore-forming domain of the GluK2 subunit. Disorders in individuals with these variants manifest as intellectual disability, developmental delay, motor impairments, and, in the case of p.Thr660Lys, epilepsy. To explore their pathogenicity and phenotypic consequences in vivo, we generated knock-in mouse models harboring orthologous Grik2 mutations. Behavioral analyses revealed a range of developmental, motor, cognitive, and naturalistic behavior impairments in both lines, with T660K mice typically exhibiting more severe phenotypes, consistent with clinical observations in humans. GluK2(T660K) mice also display interictal EEG abnormalities and handling-induced seizures. These models establish the first in vivo platforms for dissecting the underlying mechanisms of NDDs caused by a GoF mutation in the GluK2 KAR subunit and represent crucial tools for therapeutic development.

                <p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial endotoxin that induces innate immune responses. The present study aimed to elucidate alterations in cerebral cortical surface morphology induced by neonatal exposure to LPS using gyrencephalic ferrets. Male ferret pups received a subcutaneous injection of LPS (500&nbsp;&micro;g/g of body weight) on Postnatal Day (P)6 and P7. Furthermore, EdU and BrdU were administered on P5 and P7, respectively, to label postproliferative and proliferating cells that were exposed to LPS in the late stage of cortical neurogenesis. On P20 when the primary sulci and gyri had formed, MRI-based morphometry revealed an anterior shift in sulcal infolding in the medial and dorsolateral cortices of LPS-exposed ferrets. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that LPS increased the density of BrdU-labeled cells and reduced their apoptosis, as indicated by cleaved caspase-3 (cCasp3) immunostaining, in the outer stratum of the lateral sulcus located on the parietal association cortex. Furthermore, cCasp3 immunostaining of EdU-labeled cells was enhanced in the presylvian and lateral sulci located in the prefrontal and parietal association cortices, respectively, but was reduced in the coronal sulcus and gyrus located on the primary motor cortex in LPS-exposed ferrets. This study is the first to elucidate the effect of bacterial components on cerebral cortical sulcogyrogenesis, which is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Such altered sulcal topology may be attributed to a region-related effect on cortical neuron apoptosis in the medial and dorsolateral cortices caused by neonatal LPS exposure.</p>

                <p>by Yusuke Suita, Hardy Bright Jr, Yuan Pu, Merih Deniz Toruner, Jordan Idehen, Nikos Tapinos, Ritambhara Singh</p>

Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in driving transcript expression and shaping the phenotypic plasticity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), contributing to tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms dynamically regulate the expression of key oncogenic and stemness-associated genes, enabling GSCs to adapt to environmental cues and evade targeted therapies. Importantly, epigenetic reprogramming allows GSCs to transition between cellular states, including therapy-resistant mesenchymal-like phenotypes, underscoring the need for epigenetic-targeting strategies to disrupt these adaptive processes. Understanding these epigenetic drivers of gene expression provides a foundation for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating GSCs and improving glioblastoma outcomes. Using machine learning (ML), we employ cross-patient prediction of transcript expression in GSCs by combining epigenetic features from various sources, including ATAC-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, RNAPII ChIP-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. We investigate different ML and deep learning (DL) models for this task and ultimately build our final pipeline using XGBoost. The model trained on one patient generalizes to other 11 patients with high performance. Notably, H3K27Ac alone from a single patient is sufficient to predict gene expression in all 11 patients. Furthermore, the distribution of H3K27Ac peaks across the genomes of all patients is remarkably similar. These findings suggest that GSCs share a common distributional pattern of enhancer activity characterized by H3K27Ac, which can be utilized to predict gene expression in GSCs across patients. In summary, while GSCs are known for their transcriptomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, we propose that they share a common epigenetic pattern of enhancer activation that defines their underlying transcriptomic expression pattern. This pattern can predict gene expression across patient samples, providing valuable insights into the biology of GSCs.

                <p>by Jeong Seok Ji, Yaejin Yun, Tomasz Maciej Stepniewski, Hye-Jin Yoon, Kyungjin Min, Ji Young Park, Chiwoon Chung, Miguel Dieguez Eceolaza, Ka Young Chung, Jana Selent, Hyung Ho Lee</p>

β-arrestins (βarrs) play a crucial role in regulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and trafficking. Canonically, interactions of βarr with the phosphorylated intracellular GPCR-tail induce a multi-step conformational transition that results in the activation of βarr. Depending on the specific interaction pattern with the receptor, βarrs adopt multiple conformational states, each tightly linked to a specific functional outcome of βarr recruitment. Despite its physiological relevance, the structural determinants of βarr activation remain poorly understood. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical and cell-based experiments, we reveal how specific interactions with a chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) promote the unbinding of the βarr2 C-tail—a crucial step in arrestin activation. Importantly, we observe that the expulsion of the C-tail is promoted by the displacement of a conserved arginine residue (Arg394) within the βarr polar core, which we dub “the arginine switch.” Our study uncovers a role for the arginine switch that, upon engagement, destabilizes the polar core as a crucial step in the CXCR7-induced βarr activation.

                <p>by Aster Q. Perkins, Erin L. Rich</p>

Economic decisions often require weighing multiple dimensions, or attributes. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to be important for computing the integrated value of an option from its attributes and comparing values to make a choice. Although OFC neurons are known to encode integrated values, evidence for value comparison has been limited. Here, we used a multi-attribute choice task for monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) to investigate how OFC neurons integrate and compare multi-attribute options. By representing attributes with separate cues and using eye tracking to measure attention, we demonstrate that OFC neurons encode the value of attended attributes independent of other attributes in the same option. Encoding was negatively weighted by the value of the matching attribute in the other option, consistent with a comparison between like attributes. These results indicate that OFC computes comparisons between attributes rather than integrated values, and does so dynamically, shifting with the focus of attention.

                <p>by Claudio Basile, Marzio Gerbella, Alfonso Gravante, Amelia Lapadula, Francesca Rodà, Luciano Simone, Leonardo Fogassi, Stefano Rozzi</p>

The lateral prefrontal cortex has been classically defined as an associative region involved in the so-called executive functions, such as guiding behavior based on abstract rules and mnemonic information. However, most neurophysiological studies on monkeys did not address the issue of whether distinct anatomical sectors of lateral prefrontal cortex play different functional roles. The main aim of this work is to study functional properties of neurons recorded from a large part of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPF) of two monkeys performing passive visual tasks and a visuo-motor task, and to map them on the anatomical areas defined on the basis of our recent parcellations. Our results show that some functional features are broadly distributed within VLPF, while others characterize specific areas. In particular, the temporal structuring of events and the general behavioral rule appear to be coded in all recorded areas, while each area differently contributes to the encoding of visual features and to the exploitation of contextual information for guiding behavior. Caudal VLPF areas, and especially caudal 12r, are characterized by a strong coding of visual information, both when passively presented or exploited for guiding behavior, while middle VLPF areas, and especially middle 46v, are rather more involved in the processing of contextual information for action organization. In this latter sector, visual stimuli/instructions appear to be encoded in a pragmatic format, that is, in terms of the associated behavioral outcome. Finally, area 45A and more anterior VLPF areas are characterized by a generally lower responsiveness to the employed tasks. Altogether, our findings indicate that caudal VLPF areas represent the first processing stage of visual input while middle VLPF areas primarily contribute to the selection and planning of contextually appropriate behaviors.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) pose a significant risk during pregnancy because of hormonal changes and increased hemodynamic stress. This study aims to assess the risk of AVM rupture during pregnancy and puerperium and to identify risk factors associated with rupture.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study included 588 women with AVMs and a history of pregnancy, enrolled from a nationwide registry in China between August 2011 and August 2021. A case-crossover design was used to compare rupture risk during pregnancy, puerperium, and non-pregnancy periods, adjusting for clinical and morphological factors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified independent risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The risk of AVM rupture was significantly higher during pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy periods (4.5% vs 1.6%; risk ratio [RR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3–4.2; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The risk was particularly elevated during the second and third trimesters. Key factors independently associated with increased rupture risk included adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy (adolescent ≤19 years or advanced ≥35 years, odds ratio [OR], 8.32; 95% CI, 2.09–28.12, <i>p</i> = 0.001), a history of AVM rupture before pregnancy (OR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.37–11.40; <i>p</i> = 0.007), diffuse nidus (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.07–5.12; <i>p</i> = 0.033), and multifetal pregnancy (OR 18.31; 95% CI, 1.14–293.27; <i>p</i> = 0.040).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pregnancy substantially increases the risk of AVM rupture, particularly during the second and third trimesters and compared to pre-first pregnancy periods. Risk factors such as adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy and multifetal pregnancy further increase the risk. These findings underscore the importance of tailored management during pregnancy for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A better understanding of factors associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and disability is needed. Given the strong link between comorbid depression and MS disease activity and disability, we aimed to determine whether the depression genetic burden, as modelled using its polygenic score, is associated with MS disease activity and disability worsening.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cohort study, we used samples from neurologist-defined adult people with MS (PwMS) followed in clinical care or during a clinical trial from existing cohorts: Canada, the United States (US), and Sweden with extensive longitudinal phenotypes. We computed the depression polygenic score (PGS) and tested its association with annualized relapse rate and worsening disability. In the US cohort, we additionally explored the time to relapse, number of enhancing lesions, and confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) worsening during the study period.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 3,420 relapsing-onset PwMS of European genetic ancestry with a median follow-up of 3 to 5 years. Meta-analyses revealed for each 1-standard deviation increase in the depression PGS, the relapse rate increased (incidence rate ratio: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.50). In the US cohort, higher depression PGS was associated with protocol-defined relapses (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.03–2.43), and time to confirmed EDSS worsening (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03–2.22) with this effect largely direct.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Meta-analyses showed a higher depression genetic burden was associated with increased MS disease activity. In the US clinical trial cohort only, we found a significant association between higher depression PGS and time to relapse and confirmed EDSS worsening. These findings may provide insights into MS disease activity and disability worsening. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>If a map-like representation in the brain originates within a distributed network of brain regions, then this network should be underpinned by white-matter pathways. To test this, we had 83 young adults learn 15 virtual environments through free exploration, followed by tests of their allocentric and non-allocentric representation of these environments. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) - based tractography was used to extract the main white matter tracts in the brain, including the inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculus, the main connections between the temporal lobe and the visual cortices, as well as the fornix, the main output pathway from the hippocampus to the cortex. Higher microstructural integrity in the inferior and middle longitudinal fasciculus and fornix, as indexed by higher FA, was associated with a more accurate scale, rotation, and translation-invariant allocentric representation of the objects' positional pattern. These findings show that properties of white matter fiber pathways that link visual cortices to the temporal lobe and the temporal lobe to other parts of the brain underpin a person's ability to form successful map-like representations.</p>

                Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) encompasses non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation, which modulate the central nervous system to probe causal links between the brain and behavior and treat disorders. Unfortunately, fixed stimulation paradigms induce variable effects due to intra- and interindividual factors. Consequently, personalized approaches to tES are increasingly used. In this review, we highlight this emerging domain of human brain stimulation, examining strategies for the personalization of stimulation parameters and their underlying rationales. Multiparameter personalization and the identification of markers indicating tES efficacy represent promising directions. Personalization is not a panacea for all the challenges of tES, but marks an essential step toward reducing the variability of this technique.

                Bukwich and Campbell et al. show that mice integrate elapsed time and reward intake, scaled by a latent patience variable, to decide when to leave virtual “patches.” Frontal cortex ramping activity matches the integration process, revealing a potential mechanism for how the brain converts dynamic evidence into value-based foraging decisions.

                Li et al. perform multi-omics comparative analyses in subterranean mammals and identify convergent genomic signatures associated with adaptation to underground life, while their gut microbiomes show no structural or functional convergence. These findings suggest that host genome convergence, rather than microbiome convergence, underlies adaptation to subterranean environments across subterranean mammals.

Through single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) and in vivo validation, the authors demonstrate that disrupting fibroblast IL-4/13 and OSM signaling synergistically reduces skin inflammation and immune recruitment.

The derivative of the linear relationship between lipolytic flux and lipid droplet surface area is called lipolytic efficiency, which is equivalent to the lipase activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100961">Molecular and mechanical signatures contributing to mouse epidermal differentiation and barrier formation</a></h4>

              
                Formation of the skin barrier requires rapid proliferation coupled with differentiation and stratification of the embryonic epidermis. Basal progenitors give rise to progeny throughout development – first to intermediate cells, a transient proliferative suprabasal cell population, and later to spinous cells. Neither the function nor the differentiation trajectory of intermediate cells has been documented. We generated transcriptomes of intermediate and spinous cells and identified specific markers that distinguish these two populations. Further, we found that intermediate cells express a subset of genes in common with granular cells of the epidermis – the terminal living cell type that helps establish the barrier. Lineage tracing revealed that most intermediate cells directly transition to granular cells without expressing markers specific to spinous cells, thus revealing a distinct lineage pathway leading to granular fate. In addition to their transcriptional similarities, intermediate and granular cells both had hallmarks of increased actomyosin contractility. We found that rather than simply lying downstream of cell fate pathways, contractility was sufficient to suppress spinous fate and promote granular gene expression. Together, these data establish the molecular and mechanical characteristics of the developing epidermis that allow this tissue to rapidly develop barrier activity.

                <i>Salmonella</i> is one of the most common foodborne pathogens, resulting in inflammatory gastroenteritis and frequently accompanied by dysbiosis. Gut commensals, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> species, have been proven to exhibit broad antibacterial activities and protect hosts against pathogenic infections. Here, <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> strain P118, screened from 290 isolates recovered from fermented yogurts and healthy piglet intestines using traditional and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>-infection screening strategies, exerts great probiotic properties. Notably, P118 and its supernatant exhibited great antibacterial activities and attenuated <i>C. elegans</i> susceptibility to <i>Salmonella</i> infection. We found that P118 protected mice against <i>Salmonella</i> lethal infections by enhancing colonization resistance, reducing pathogen invasion, alleviating intestinal pro-inflammatory response, and improving microbial dysbiosis and fecal metabolite changes. Microbiota and fecal metabolome analyses suggested P118 administration significantly decreased the relative abundances of potentially harmful microbes (e.g., <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Anaeroplasma</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>) and increased the fecal levels of tryptophan and its derivatives (indole, indole-3-acrylic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetate). Deterministic processes determined the gut microbial community assembly of P118-pretreated mice. Integrated omics further demonstrated that P118 probiotic activities in enhancing host tolerance to <i>Salmonella</i> infection were mediated by microbe-derived tryptophan/indole metabolites (e.g., indole-3-acrylic acid, indole, tryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptophan). Collective results demonstrate that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> P118 could enhance host tolerance to <i>Salmonella</i> infections via various pathways, including direct antibacterial actions, inhibiting <i>Salmonella</i> colonization and invasion, attenuating pro-inflammatory responses of intestinal macrophages, and modulating gut microbiota mediated by microbe-derived indole metabolites.

                <p>Neurite outgrowth is critically controlled by calcium influx-mediated cytoskeleton dynamics. Spastin, a AAA ATPase microtubule-severing protein, also plays an important role in neurite outgrowth. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying posttranscriptional fine-tuning spastin activity, particularly in the context of calcium signaling, remain elusive. Here, we identified that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (CaMKII&beta;) isoform acted as an upstream kinase to mediate the phosphorylation of spastin. CaMKII&beta; interacted with and phosphorylated spastin on Ser233 and Ser562 amino acids. Moreover, CaMKII&beta;-mediated phosphorylation reduced the polyubiquitination level of spastin and suppressed its proteasomal degradation. This enhanced protein stability by CaMKII&beta; increased the microtubule-severing activity of spastin and coordinately promoted the neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons. Inhibition of spastin or CaMKII&beta; impaired synaptic activity, as evidenced by reduced frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Behaviorally, treatment with spastin or CaMKII&beta; inhibitors led to deficits in short-term working memory and spatial learning, as assessed by Y-maze and Morris water maze tests in male mice, respectively. In general, this study unveils a novel mechanism whereby CaMKII&beta;-mediated phosphorylation of spastin connects extracellular calcium signaling to the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics and neurite outgrowth.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/32/e2059242025?rss=1">Age-Related Increase in Locus Ceruleus Activity and Connectivity with the Prefrontal Cortex during Ambiguity Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interpreting ambiguous environmental cues, like facial expressions, becomes increasingly challenging with age, especially as cognitive resources decline. Managing these challenges requires adaptive neural mechanisms that are essential for maintaining mental well-being. The locus ceruleus (LC), the brain's main norepinephrine source, regulates attention, arousal, and stress response. With extensive cortical connections, the LC supports adapting to cognitive demands and resolving conflicting cues from environment, particularly in later life. Previous research suggests that LC interacts with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during high-conflict tasks. However, whether LC activity and its connectivity with the PFC support emotional ambiguity processing and contributes to emotional well-being in healthy aging remains unclear. To address this gap, we used 7T-MRI to examine LC function in 75 younger (25.8 &plusmn; 4.02&nbsp;years, 35 females) and 69 older adults (71.3 &plusmn; 4.1&nbsp;years, 35 females) during facial emotion recognition task morphed with varying ambiguity: unambiguous, intermediate ambiguity, and absolute ambiguity. Behaviorally, participants had longer response times and lower confidence during the absolute-ambiguity condition, while older adults perceived ambiguous faces as happy more frequently than younger adults. Neuroimaging results revealed older adults exhibited greater LC activity and enhanced connectivity with dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) during absolute ambiguity compared with younger adults. This heightened connectivity in older adults was linked to better task-independent self-reported mental well-being questionnaires and greater emotional resilience scores derived from principal component analysis. Overall, these findings suggest that greater LC activity supports managing cognitively demanding tasks, while enhanced LC&ndash;dlPFC connectivity promotes emotional well-being, highlighting this neural pathway's role in healthy aging.</p>

                <p>Stress is a critical risk factor for the development of psychological disorders, including anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Key brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex (IL-mPFC), play crucial roles in fear regulation. Our previous research demonstrated that neuronal genomic activity of glucocorticoid receptors in the BLA during a 2&nbsp;h acute restraint stress (ARS) is essential for inducing anxiety-like behavior 10&nbsp;d later. Additionally, blocking BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during the elevated plus maze is crucial for preventing this stress-induced delayed anxiety-like behavior. Here, we utilized adult male Wistar rats to expand on these findings, revealing that a single ARS session increases the activity of BLA neurons and their projections to the IL-mPFC while decreasing the activity of IL-mPFC neurons and their projections to the BLA during fear extinction. This finding highlights the key role of the BLAIL-mPFC circuitry in fear extinction and its susceptibility to acute stress-induced changes. Notably, the delayed stress-induced fear extinction deficit and decreased IL-mPFC activity during fear extinction depend on the stress-responsive BLA neuronal ensemble and BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during contextual fear conditioning (CFC) 10&nbsp;d poststress. Our findings demonstrate the significance of BLA &beta;-adrenergic signaling during CFC, as it induces delayed stress-induced impairments in extinction and regulates IL-mPFC activity during fear extinction. Furthermore, this study indicates that the BLA is a pivotal regulator of delayed stress effects at both the circuitry and behavioral levels, thus shedding new light on the mechanisms underlying stress-related psychiatric conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/32/e2405242025?rss=1">Nicotine Withdrawal Drives Aversive Behaviors by Recruiting Inhibitory Interpeduncular Nucleus Inputs to the Laterodorsal Tegmentum in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nicotine addiction remains a major cause of disease and premature death worldwide. Nicotine modulates neural pathways that underlie both rewarding and aversive behavioral effects, but persistent activation of brain reward circuitry drives nicotine consumption despite the negative consequences. When nicotine users attempt to quit, additional neural mechanisms are recruited to generate an aversive withdrawal state, which contributes to the remarkably high relapse rate among nicotine users. The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) and its presynaptic inputs from the medial habenula are key mediators of aversive nicotine withdrawal symptoms, but the downstream neural targets mediating these effects are unknown. The aversive effects of acute exposure to high doses of nicotine require inhibitory IPN GABAergic projections to the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDTg), a key driver of reward-related dopamine signaling. Here we show that optogenetic inhibition of these IPN-&gt;LDTg projections reduces behavioral and physiological effects of nicotine withdrawal in male and female mice. Using fiber photometry, we found that nicotine withdrawal reduced reward-related signaling with decreases in both LDTg neuronal activity and nucleus accumbens dopamine release. These studies demonstrate a direct link between aversive and appetitive neural pathways that is active during nicotine withdrawal, providing novel targets for treating nicotine addiction.</p>
