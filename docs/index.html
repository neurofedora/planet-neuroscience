                <p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition in which genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to its etiology. Remarkable progress has been made in deciphering disease etiology through genetic approaches, but there is limited data about how environmental and genetic factors interact to modify penetrance, risk, and disease severity. Here, we provide insights into environmental modifiers of PD, discussing precedents from other neurological and non-neurological conditions. Based on these examples, we outline genetic and environmental factors contributing to PD and review potential environmental modifiers of penetrance and clinical variability in monogenic and idiopathic PD. We also highlight the potential challenges and propose how future studies might tackle these important questions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy treated by immune checkpoint inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Our aim was to assess the real-world effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multicenter survey compiling retrospective data from 79 PML patients, including 38 published cases and 41 unpublished cases, who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as add-on to standard of care. One-year follow-up data were analyzed to determine clinical outcomes and safety profile. Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with one-year survival.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Predisposing conditions included hematological malignancy (n=38, 48.1%), primary immunodeficiency (n=14, 17.7%), HIV/AIDS (n=12, 15.2%), inflammatory disease (n=8, 10.1%), neoplasm (n=5, 6.3%), and transplantation (n=2, 2.5%). Pembrolizumab was most commonly used (n=53, 67.1%). One-year survival was 51.9% (41/79). PML-IRIS was reported in 15/79 patients (19%). Pretreatment expression of PD1 on circulating T cells did not differ between survivors and non-survivors. Development of contrast enhancement on follow-up MRI at least once during follow-up (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.20-8.72, p=0.02) was associated with one-year survival. CSF JCV DNA load decreased significantly by one-month follow-up in survivors compared to non-survivors (p&lt;0.0001). Thirty-two adverse events occurred among 24 of 79 patients (30.4%), and led to treatment discontinuation in 7/24 patients (29.1%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this non-controlled retrospective study of patients with PML who were treated with ICI, mortality remains high. Development of inflammatory features or overt PML-IRIS was commonly observed. This study highlights that use of immune checkpoint inhibitors should be strictly personalized toward characteristics of the individual PML patient.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities in the DIAN‐TU‐001 trial of gantenerumab and solanezumab: lessons from a trial in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the characteristics of participants with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in a trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (DIAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>142 DIAD mutation carriers received either gantenerumab SC (n=52), solanezumab IV (n=50), or placebo (n=40). Participants underwent assessments with the Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®), neuropsychological testing, CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor ARIA. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses evaluated potential ARIA-related risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven participants developed ARIA-E, including 3 with mild symptoms. No ARIA-E was reported under solanezumab while gantenerumab was associated with ARIA-E compared to placebo (OR=9.1, CI[1.2, 412.3]; <i>p</i>=0.021). Under gantenerumab, <i>APOE-ɛ4</i> carriers were more likely to develop ARIA-E (OR=5.0, CI[1.0, 30.4]; <i>p</i>=0.055), as were individuals with microhemorrhage at baseline (OR=13.7, CI[1.2, 163.2]; <i>p</i>=0.039). No ARIA-E was observed at the initial 225mg/month gantenerumab dose, and most cases were observed at doses &gt;675mg. At first ARIA-E occurrence, all ARIA-E participants were amyloid-PET+, 60% were CDR&gt;0, 60% were past their estimated year to symptom onset, and 60% had also incident ARIA-H. Most ARIA-E radiologically resolved after dose adjustment and developing ARIA-E did not significantly increase odds of trial discontinuation. ARIA-E was more frequently observed in the occipital lobe (90%). ARIA-E severity was associated with age at time of ARIA-E.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In DIAD, solanezumab was not associated with ARIA. Gantenerumab dose over 225mg increased ARIA-E risk, with additional risk for individuals <i>APOE-ɛ4(+)</i> or with microhemorrhage. ARIA-E was reversible on MRI in most cases, generally asymptomatic, without additional risk for trial discontinuation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Staufen impairs autophagy in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is one of the master coordinators of cellular stress responses, regulating metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. We recently reported that Staufen1 (STAU1), a stress granule (SG) protein, was overabundant in fibroblast cell lines from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases as well as animal models, and patient tissues. STAU1 overabundance is associated with mTOR hyperactivation and links SG formation with autophagy. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of mTOR regulation by STAU1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We determined STAU1 abundance with disease- and chemical-induced cellular stressors in patient cells and animal models. We also used RNA binding assays to contextualize STAU1 interaction with <i>MTOR</i> mRNA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>STAU1 and mTOR were overabundant in BAC-<i>C9ORF72</i>, <i>ATXN2</i>
<sup>
   <i>Q127</i>
</sup>, and <i>Thy1</i>-<i>TDP-43</i> transgenic mouse models. Reducing STAU1 levels in these mice normalized mTOR levels and activity and autophagy-related marker proteins. We also saw increased STAU1 levels in HEK293 cells transfected to express C9ORF72-relevant dipeptide repeats (DPRs). Conversely, DPR accumulations were not observed in cells treated by <i>STAU1</i> RNAi. Overexpression of STAU1 in HEK293 cells increased mTOR levels through direct <i>MTOR</i> mRNA interaction, activating downstream targets and impairing autophagic flux. Targeting mTOR by rapamycin or RNAi normalized STAU1 abundance in a SCA2 cellular model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STAU1 interaction with mTOR drives its hyperactivation and inhibits autophagic flux in multiple models of neurodegeneration. Staufen, therefore, constitutes a novel target to modulate mTOR activity, autophagy, and for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

     alt="Organization of the corticotropin-releasing hormone and corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein systems in the central nervous system of the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus"/>
<p>We studied the expression of the corticortropin-releasing hormone (CRH) transcript and mature peptide in the brain and spinal cord of sea lamprey prolarvae, larvae, and adults. We also studied the expression of the CRH binding protein transcript. Our data show that a complex CRHergic system is present in a representative of the oldest extant vertebrates. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The expression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (<i>PmCRH</i>) and the CRH-binding protein (<i>PmCRHBP</i>) mRNAs was studied by in situ hybridization in the brain of prolarvae, larvae, and adults of the sea lamprey <i>Petromyzon marinus</i>. We also generated an antibody against the PmCRH mature peptide to study the distribution of PmCRH-immunoreactive cells and fibers. PmCRH immunohistochemistry was combined with antityrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, PmCRHBP in situ hybridization, or neurobiotin transport from the spinal cord. The most numerous PmCRH-expressing cells were observed in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus-paraventricular nucleus and in the superior and medial rhombencephalic reticular formation. <i>PmCRH</i> expression was more extended in adults than in larvae, and some cell populations were mainly (olfactory bulb) or only (striatum, ventral hypothalamus, prethalamus) observed in adults. The preopto-paraventricular fibers form conspicuous tracts coursing toward the neurohypophysis, but many immunoreactive fibers were also observed coursing in many other brain regions. Brain descending fibers in the spinal cord mainly come from cells located in the isthmus and in the medial rhombencephalic reticular nucleus. The distribution of <i>PmCRHBP</i>-expressing neurons was different from that of PmCRH cells, with cells mainly present in the septum, striatum, preoptic region, tuberal hypothalamus, pretectum, pineal complex, isthmus, reticular formation, and spinal cord. Again, expression in adults was more extended than in larvae. <i>PmCRH</i>- and <i>PmCRHBP</i>-expressing cells are different, excluding colocalization of these substances in the same neuron. Present findings reveal a complex CRH/CRHBP system in the brain of the oldest extant vertebrate group, the agnathans, which shows similarities but important divergences with that of mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic synapse elimination controls ocular dominance plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a representative form of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity observed in the primary visual cortex (V1). However, the cellular mechanisms and physiological roles of synapse elimination in ODP are largely unknown. Here, we show that astrocytic phagocytosis of thalamo-cortical synapses in V1 is a critical mediator of ODP. We found that astrocytes, but not microglia, start to engulf thalamo-cortical synapses within 24 hours after monocular deprivation and that astrocytic synapse elimination is highly selective for synapses from the deprived eye, as revealed by AAV1-mediated trans-synaptic anterograde tracing of synapse phagocytosis reporters. Importantly, mice without the Megf10 phagocytic receptor in astrocytes exhibit deficits in eliminating the synapses from the deprived eye, leading to the failure to reduce the number of thalamo-cortical synapses after monocular deprivation. Remarkably, Megf10-deficient animals show severe defects in monocular deprivation-induced cortical synapse remodeling and subsequent expansion of the thalamo-cortical circuitry from the nondeprived eye. Taken together, our data show that astrocytic synapse elimination through MEGF10 is one of the key components in ODP, revealing the physiological importance of astrocytic phagocytosis in experience-dependent synaptic plasticity.

                Males have finite resources to spend on reproduction. Thus, males rely on a 'time investment strategy' to maximize their reproductive success. For example, male Drosophila melanogaster extends their mating duration when surrounded by conditions enriched with rivals. Here we report a novel form of behavioral plasticity whereby male fruit flies exhibit a shortened duration of mating when they are sexually experienced; we refer to this plasticity as 'shorter-mating-duration (SMD)'. SMD is a plastic behavior and requires sexually dimorphic taste neurons. We identified several neurons in the male foreleg and midleg that express specific sugar, pheromone and mechanosensory receptors. Using a cost-benefit model and behavioral experiments, we further show that SMD behavior exhibits adaptive behavioral plasticity in male flies. Thus, our study delineates the molecular and cellular basis of the sensory inputs required for SMD; this represents a plastic interval timing behavior that could serve as a model system to study how multisensory inputs converge to modify interval timing behavior for improved adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-type specific deletions of Neuroligin 2 reveal a vital role of synaptic excitation-inhibition balance</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic excitation (E) and inhibition (I) stay relatively proportional to each other over different spatiotemporal scales, orchestrating neuronal activity in the brain. This proportionality, referred to as E-I balance, is thought to be critical for neuronal functions because its disruption was observed in many neurological disorders. However, the causal evidence demonstrating its significance is scarce. Here we show that deleting Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), a postsynaptic adhesion molecule at inhibitory synapses, from mouse glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons reduces inhibition cell-autonomously without affecting excitation, thereby disrupting E-I balance and causing lethality. In contrast, deleting Nlgn2 constitutively or simultaneously from both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons results in viable mice. A neural network model shows that reducing inhibition in either neuronal type is detrimental to network activity, but in both types partially re-establishes E-I balance and activity. Together, our results provide evidence for an essential role of E-I balance in brain functions and organism survival.

	<p>There is a close bidirectional relationship between sleep and epilepsy. Anti-seizure medications (ASM) act to reduce seizure frequency but can also impact sleep; this remains a relatively unexplored field given the importance of sleep on seizure occurrence, memory consolidation, and quality of life. We compared the effect of poly-ASM treatment on a night of sleep compared to an unmedicated night in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, where ASMs were withdrawn and later restored as part of their pre-surgical evaluation. Within-subject analysis between medicated and unmedicated nights showed ASMs increased spindle (11&amp;amp;ndash;16 Hz) power and decreased slow wave (0.1&amp;amp;ndash;2 Hz) amplitude. Spindles became less strongly coupled to slow waves in the ASM night compared to no-ASM night, with effects to both the phase and strength of coupling and correlated with slow wave reduction. These effects were not seen in age-matched controls from the same unit where ASMs were not changed between two nights. Overall, we found that ASM polytherapy not only changed specific sleep waveforms, but also the fine interplay of spindle/slow wave coupling. Since these sleep oscillations impact both seizure occurrence and memory consolidation, our findings provide evidence towards a decoupling impact of ASMs on sleep that should be considered in future studies of sleep and memory disruption in people with epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Despite numerous studies on the neurobiology of depression, the etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder remain poorly understood. A large number of animal models and tests to evaluate depressive-like behavior have been developed. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) is the most common and frequently used model of depression, and the sucrose preference test (SPT) is one of the most common tests for assessing anhedonia. However, not all laboratories can reproduce the main effects of CUMS, especially when this refers to a decrease in sucrose preference. It is also unknown how the state of anhedonia, assessed by the SPT, relates to the state of anhedonia in patients with depression. We analyzed the literature available in the PubMed database using keywords relevant to the topic of this narrative review. We hypothesize that the poor reproducibility of the CUMS model may be due to differences in sucrose consumption, which may be influenced by such factors as differences in sucrose preference concentration threshold, water and food deprivation, and differences in animals&amp;amp;rsquo; susceptibility to stress. We also believe that comparisons between animal and human states of anhedonia should be made with caution because there are many inconsistencies between the two, including in assessment methods. We also tried to offer some recommendations that should improve the reproducibility of the CUMS model and provide a framework for future research.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) was used to describe pre-senile dementia to differentiate it from senile dementia, which develops in the adult age group of more than 65 years. AD is characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaque and tau-neurofibrillary tangles (TNTs) in the brain. The neuropathological changes in AD are related to the deposition of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and progression of neuroinflammation, neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy dysfunction, and cholinergic synaptic dysfunction. Statins are one of the main cornerstone drugs for the management of cardiovascular disorders regardless of dyslipidemia status. Increasing the use of statins, mainly in the elderly groups for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, may affect their cognitive functions. Extensive and prolonged use of statins may affect cognitive functions in healthy subjects and dementia patients. Statins-induced cognitive impairments in both patients and health providers had been reported according to the post-marketing survey. This survey depends mainly on sporadic cases, and no cognitive measures were used. Evidence from prospective and observational studies gives no robust conclusion regarding the beneficial or detrimental effects of statins on cognitive functions in AD patients. Therefore, this study is a narrative review aimed with evidences to the beneficial, detrimental, and neutral effects of statins on AD.</p>

	<p>Restless sleep disorder affects children and is characterized by frequent nocturnal movements, iron deficiency, and daytime symptoms such as poor school performance or behavioral problems. Although sleep parameters have been thoroughly studied and daytime sleepiness has been previously assessed, neurocognitive and executive functions have not. In this study, we evaluated neurocognitive functions in a group of 13 children diagnosed with restless sleep disorder using the National Institute of Health Toolbox (NIH toolbox). The mean age was 10.62 (S.D. 2.785). Among them, seven were male and six were female. The fully corrected T-scores (adjusted for demographic variables: age, ethnicity, and education level) showed the lowest values for the Flanker test (selective attention) and dimensional change card sorting test (cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control), with a very large effect size vs. the corresponding expected frequencies. For all the other tests, the average scores were 50; however, individual children scored low on pattern recognition and two composite scores (fluid and total). In conclusion, these data support the fact that cognitive functions are affected in children with restless sleep disorder, especially selective attention. Clinicians must recognize sleep disorders and daytime impairment in order to promptly intervene and prevent cognitive impairments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Standardized Nonvisual Behavioral Event Is Broadcasted Homogeneously across Cortical Visual Areas without Modulating Visual Responses</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Multiple recent studies have shown that motor activity greatly impacts the activity of primary sensory areas like V1. Yet, the role of this motor related activity in sensory processing is still unclear. Here, we dissect how these behavior signals are broadcast to different layers and areas of the visual cortex. To do so, we leveraged a standardized and spontaneous behavioral fidget event in passively viewing mice. Importantly, this behavior event had no relevance to any ongoing task allowing us to compare its neuronal correlates with visually relevant behaviors (e.g., running). A large two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging database of neuronal responses uncovered four neural response types during fidgets that were consistent in their proportion and response patterns across all visual areas and layers of the visual cortex. Indeed, the layer and area identity could not be decoded above chance level based only on neuronal recordings. In contrast to running behavior, fidget evoked neural responses that were independent to visual processing. The broad availability of visually orthogonal standardized behavior signals could be a key component in how the cortex selects, learns and binds local sensory information with motor outputs. Contrary to behaviorally relevant motor outputs, irrelevant motor signals could project to separate local neural subspaces.</p>

                Data visualization is integral for exploratory data analysis and data presentation. Consequently, every programming environment suitable for data analysis needs a feature-rich visualization library. In this paper, we present Plotly.NET - a fully featured charting library for the .NET ecosystem. Plotly.NET requires little ceremony to use, provides multiple API (application programming interface) layers for both low-code and maximum customizability, and can be used in many different visualization workflows - from interactive scripting and notebooks to user interface applications. Plotly.NET brings the charting capabilities of plotly.js to the .NET ecosystem, successfully combining the flexibility of the plotly grammar with the type-safety and expressiveness of .NET.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to test e-ASPECTS software in patients with stroke. Marketed as a decision-support tool, e-ASPECTS may detect features of ischemia or hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) imaging and quantify ischemic extent using Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using CT from 9 stroke studies, we compared software with masked experts. As per indications for software use, we assessed e-ASPECTS results for patients with/without middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemia but no other cause of stroke. In an analysis outside the intended use of the software, we enriched our dataset with non-MCA ischemia, hemorrhage, and mimics to simulate a representative “front door” hospital population. With final diagnosis as the reference standard, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS for identifying stroke features (ischemia, hyperattenuated arteries, and hemorrhage) in the representative population.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 4,100 patients (51% women, median age = 78 years, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] = 10, onset to scan = 2.5 hours). Final diagnosis was ischemia (78%), hemorrhage (14%), or mimic (8%). From 3,035 CTs with expert-rated ASPECTS, most (2084/3035, 69%) e-ASPECTS results were within one point of experts. In the representative population, the diagnostic accuracy of e-ASPECTS was 71% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70–72%) for detecting ischemic features, 85% (83–86%) for hemorrhage. Software identified more false positive ischemia (12% vs 2%) and hemorrhage (14% vs &lt;1%) than experts.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>On independent testing, e-ASPECTS provided moderate agreement with experts and overcalled stroke features. Therefore, future prospective trials testing impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) software on patient care and outcome are required before widespread implementation of stroke decision-support software.

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>Transverse myelitis (TM) has recently been associated by health authorities with Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson), one of the 5 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) labeled severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. It is unknown whether a similar association exists for the other FDA or EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer/BioNTech], mRNA-1273 [Moderna], ChAdOx1nCov-19 [Oxford–AstraZeneca], and NVX-CoV2373 [Novavax]). This study aimed to evaluate the association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine class and TM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study examined individual case safety reports from VigiBase, the World Health Organization's pharmacovigilance database. We first conducted a disproportionality analysis with the information component (IC) using the reports of TM that occurred within 28 days following exposure to the FDA or EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, from December 1, 2020 (first adverse event related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) to March 27, 2022. Second, we analyzed the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated TM cases reported in VigiBase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TM was significantly associated both with the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based (n = 364; IC<sub>025</sub> = 0.62) and vector-based (n = 136; IC<sub>025</sub> = 0.52) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are authorized by the FDA or the EMA.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Findings from this observational, cross-sectional pharmacovigilance study showed that mRNA-based and vector-based FDA/EMA labeled SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be associated with TM. However, because TM remains a rare event, with a previously reported rate of 0.28 cases per 1 million vaccine doses, the risk–benefit ratio in favor of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unchallenged. Rather, this study suggests that clinicians should consider the diagnosis of TM in patients presenting with early signs of spinal cord dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

These needs have been exasperated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic and global economic crisis, with emerging research indicating short-term and long-term detrimental effects on physical and mental health due to substance misuse and addictions. Psychosocial interventions utilize psychological or social factors rather than an overreliance on biological interventions to treat the health impacts of mental illnesses such as addictions and substance use disorder. In this paper, I will discuss the associated determinants of addictions and substance for the military veteran population, as well as how the social prescribing of psychosocial interventions could be used to reaffirm participant’s identity and enhance their sense of belonging for military veterans, using a real-world example in Wales, UK.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational models reveal how chloride dynamics determine the optimal distribution of inhibitory synapses to minimise dendritic excitability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Brian Currin, Joseph Valentino Raimondo</p>

Many neurons in the mammalian central nervous system have complex dendritic arborisations and active dendritic conductances that enable these cells to perform sophisticated computations. How dendritically targeted inhibition affects local dendritic excitability is not fully understood. Here we use computational models of branched dendrites to investigate where GABAergic synapses should be placed to minimise dendritic excitability over time. To do so, we formulate a metric we term the “Inhibitory Level” (IL), which quantifies the effectiveness of synaptic inhibition for reducing the depolarising effect of nearby excitatory input. GABAergic synaptic inhibition is dependent on the reversal potential for GABAA receptors (EGABA), which is primarily set by the transmembrane chloride ion (Cl<sup>-</sup>) concentration gradient. We, therefore, investigated how variable EGABA and dynamic chloride affects dendritic inhibition. We found that the inhibitory effectiveness of dendritic GABAergic synapses combines at an encircled branch junction. The extent of this inhibitory accumulation is dependent on the number of branches and location of synapses but is independent of EGABA. This inhibitory accumulation occurs even for very distally placed inhibitory synapses when they are hyperpolarising–but not when they are shunting. When accounting for Cl<sup>-</sup> fluxes and dynamics in Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration, we observed that Cl<sup>-</sup> loading is detrimental to inhibitory effectiveness. This enabled us to determine the most inhibitory distribution of GABAergic synapses which is close to–but not at–a shared branch junction. This distribution balances a trade-off between a stronger combined <i>inhibitory influence</i> when synapses closely encircle a branch junction with the deleterious effects of increased <i>Cl</i><sup>-</sup> loading that occurs when inhibitory synapses are co-located.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An expert judgment model to predict early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas McAndrew, Nicholas G. Reich</p>

From February to May 2020, experts in the modeling of infectious disease provided quantitative predictions and estimates of trends in the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in a series of 13 surveys. Data on existing transmission patterns were sparse when the pandemic began, but experts synthesized information available to them to provide quantitative, judgment-based assessments of the current and future state of the pandemic. We aggregated expert predictions into a single “linear pool” by taking an equally weighted average of their probabilistic statements. At a time when few computational models made public estimates or predictions about the pandemic, expert judgment provided (a) falsifiable predictions of short- and long-term pandemic outcomes related to reported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, (b) estimates of latent viral transmission, and (c) counterfactual assessments of pandemic trajectories under different scenarios. The linear pool approach of aggregating expert predictions provided more consistently accurate predictions than any individual expert, although the predictive accuracy of a linear pool rarely provided the most accurate prediction. This work highlights the importance that expert linear pool could play in flexibly assessing a wide array of risks early in future emerging outbreaks, especially in settings where available data cannot yet support data-driven computational modeling

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MicrobiomeCensus estimates human population sizes from wastewater samples based on inter-individual variability in gut microbiomes</a></h4>

The metagenome embedded in urban sewage is an attractive new data source to understand urban ecology and assess human health status at scales beyond a single host. Analyzing the viral fraction of wastewater in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown the potential of wastewater as aggregated samples for early detection, prevalence monitoring, and variant identification of human diseases in large populations. However, using census-based population size instead of real-time population estimates can mislead the interpretation of data acquired from sewage, hindering assessment of representativeness, inference of prevalence, or comparisons of taxa across sites. Here, we show that taxon abundance and sub-species diversisty in gut-associated microbiomes are new feature space to utilize for human population estimation. Using a population-scale human gut microbiome sample of over 1,100 people, we found that taxon-abundance distributions of gut-associated multi-person microbiomes exhibited generalizable relationships with respect to human population size. Here and throughout this paper, the human population size is essentially the sample size from the wastewater sample. We present a new algorithm, MicrobiomeCensus, for estimating human population size from sewage samples. MicrobiomeCensus harnesses the inter-individual variability in human gut microbiomes and performs maximum likelihood estimation based on simultaneous deviation of multiple taxa’s relative abundances from their population means. MicrobiomeCensus outperformed generic algorithms in data-driven simulation benchmarks and detected population size differences in field data. New theorems are provided to justify our approach. This research provides a mathematical framework for inferring population sizes in real time from sewage samples, paving the way for more accurate ecological and public health studies utilizing the sewage metagenome.

                Background: Prevalence of heart failure has been increasing worldwide. Decreased muscle mass, poor physical activity, and reduced physical performance or muscle strength might lead to sarcopenia among heart failure patients and therefore lead to low cardiac output, and vice versa. Symptoms of depression are also common mental health problems in heart failure. However, little is known about the prevalence of depressive symptoms in heart failure patients with sarcopenia and the relationship with its. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of and relationship between sarcopenia and depressive symptoms in heart failure patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study comprised of 150 participants aged 35 years or older. Sarcopenia and no sarcopenia were classified by using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. Physical performance, muscle strength, and skeletal muscle mass were examined. Symptoms of depression were assessed through utilization of the validated Thai version of Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Results: The prevalence of sarcopenia was 18.67% and depression was 5.33% in heart failure patients. In addition, the prevalence of depression in heart failure patients with sarcopenia were 3.57%. The relationship was observed based on depression scores and New York Heart Association functional classification (r = 0.319, p<.001). Furthermore, heart failure patients with low New York Heart Association functional class had high depression scores (p<.001). However, no significant differences between depression scores and sarcopenia in heart failure patients were identified. Conclusions: Prevalence of sarcopenia in heart failure patients was 18.67% and only 5.33% exhibited depressive symptoms. Only 3.57% exhibited both depression and sarcopenia. Additionally, New York Heart Association functional classification was related to depression.

                Background: The Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) proposed by the World Health Organization recognises the importance for health systems to understand the reasons underpinning the death of a pregnant woman or her newborn as an essential first step in preventing future similar deaths. Data for the surveillance component of the MPDSR process are typically collected from health facility sources and post-mortem interviews with affected families, though it may be traumatising to them. This brief report aimed to assess the potential utility of an augmented data collection method for mapping journeys of maternal and perinatal deaths, which does not require sourcing additional information from grieving family members. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal and perinatal deaths that occurred across 24 public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria, between 1st November 2018 and 30th October 2019 was conducted. Data on their demographic, obstetric history and complication at presentation, travel to the hospital, and mode of birth were extracted from their hospital records. The extracted travel data was exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time to the hospital for the period of the day of travel were also extracted. Results: Of the 182 maternal deaths, most presented during the week (80.8%), travelled 5-10 km (30.6%) and 10-29 minutes (46.9%), and travelled to the nearest hospital to their places of residence (70.9%). Of the 442 pregnant women who had perinatal deaths, most presented during the week (78.5%), travelled <5 km (26.9%) and 10-29 minutes (38.0%). For both, the least reported travel data was the mode of travel used to care (>90.0%) and the period of the day they travelled (approximately 30.0%). Conclusion: An augmented data collection approach that includes accurate and complete travel data and closer-to-reality estimates of travel time and distance can be beneficial for MPDSR purposes.

                Antecedentes: El propósito del estudio fue identificar las asociaciones entre el riesgo para la salud mental, los intentos de suicidio y la función familiar.   Métodos: Se realizó un estudio descriptivo, correlacional y transversal en un grupo de adolescentes del último grado de secundaria para establecer la asociación entre el riesgo para la salud mental, el intento de suicidio y la funcionalidad familiar. Los instrumentos utilizados fueron el cuestionario de autoinforme, la escala de valoración del riesgo suicida y el APGAR familiar. El análisis de datos se realizó mediante el algoritmo de inteligencia artificial (agrupamiento de gower).  Resultados:Respondieron 246 adolescentes a los tres instrumentos, lo que permitió seleccionar aquellos con correlaciones de interés sensible y, a partir de ellas, un plan de intervención. Se encontró malestar psicológico en el 28%, síntomas psicóticos en el 85% y consumo problemático de alcohol en el 9%. Se identificó buen funcionamiento familiar en 34% y algún tipo de disfunción familiar en 66%. En cuanto al riesgo de suicidio, hubo un riesgo de suicidio bajo del 74 %, un riesgo medio del 24 % y un riesgo alto del 2 %. Se pudo demostrar que existe una correlación en un grupo del 15% de los encuestados.  Conclusiones: El riesgo de sufrir deterioro de la salud mental y el riesgo de suicidio, durante este período de pandemia, parece estar relacionado con la funcionalidad familiar.

                Background: Statistical methods are a cornerstone of research in clinical psychology and are used in clinical trials and reviews to determine the best available evidence. The most widespread statistical framework, frequentist statistics, is often misunderstood and misused. Even when properly applied, this framework can lead to erroneous conclusions and unnecessarily prolonged trials. The implications for clinical psychology are difficulties in interpreting best available evidence and unnecessarily costly and burdensome research. An alternative framework, Bayesian statistics, is proposed as a solution to several issues with current practice. Methods: Statistical tests of primary outcome measures were extracted from 272 studies, which were cited in 11 recent reviews in the Evidence-based updates series in the Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. The extracted tests were examined regarding relevant features and re-analyzed using Bayes Factors. Results: When statistical tests were significant, the majority (98%) of re-analyzed tests agreed with such claims. When statistical tests were nonsignificant almost half (43%) of re-analyzed tests disagreed with such claims. Equally important for clinical research, an average of 13% fewer participants per study would have been required if the studies had used Bayes Factors. Conclusions: Bayes Factors offer benefits for research in clinical psychology through intuitive interpretations, and less costly trials.

<p>The idea, methods, and main conclusions of this study. Mutual transitions between sleep stages were not necessarily the opposite of each other. Sleep stage transitions during the sleep deepening process indicated more significant changes than the sleep awakening process.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep state transitions are closely related to insomnia, drowsiness, and sleep maintenance. However, how the cortical network varies during such a transition process remains unclear. Changes in the cortical interaction during the short-term process of sleep stage transitions were investigated. In all, 40 healthy young participants underwent overnight polysomnography. The phase transfer entropy of six frequency bands was obtained from 16 electroencephalography channels to assess the strength and direction of information flow between the cortical regions. Differences in the cortical network between the first and the last 10 s in a 40-s transition period across wakefulness, N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement were, respectively, studied. Various frequency bands exhibited different patterns during the sleep stage transitions. It was found that the mutual transitions between the sleep stages were not necessarily the opposite. More significant changes were observed in the sleep deepening process than in the process of sleep awakening. During sleep stage transitions, changes in the inflow and outflow strength of various cortical regions led to regional differences, but for the entire sleep progress, such an imbalance did not intensify, and a dynamic balance was instead observed. The detailed findings of variations in cortical interactions during sleep stage transition promote understanding of sleep mechanism, sleep process, and sleep function. Additionally, it is expected to provide helpful clues for sleep improvement, like reducing the time required to fall asleep and maintaining sleep depth.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regulation of Nodal signaling propagation by receptor interactions and positive feedback</a></h4>

              
                During vertebrate embryogenesis, the germ layers are patterned by secreted Nodal signals. In the classical model, Nodals elicit signaling by binding to a complex comprising Type I/II Activin receptors (Acvr) and the co-receptor Tdgf1. However, it is currently unclear whether receptor binding can also affect the distribution of Nodals themselves through the embryo, and it is unknown which of the putative Acvr paralogs mediate Nodal signaling in zebrafish. Here, we characterize three Type I (Acvr1) and four Type II (Acvr2) homologs and show that - except for Acvr1c - all receptor-encoding transcripts are maternally deposited and present during zebrafish embryogenesis. We generated mutants and used them together with combinatorial morpholino knockdown and CRISPR F0 knockout (KO) approaches to assess compound loss-of-function phenotypes. We discovered that the Acvr2 homologs function partly redundantly and partially independently of Nodal to pattern the early zebrafish embryo, whereas the Type I receptors Acvr1b-a and Acvr1b-b redundantly act as major mediators of Nodal signaling. By combining quantitative analyses with expression manipulations, we found that feedback-regulated Type I receptors and co-receptors can directly influence the diffusion and distribution of Nodals, providing a mechanism for the spatial restriction of Nodal signaling during germ layer patterning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Wolbachia action in the sperm produces developmentally deferred chromosome segregation defects during the Drosophila mid-blastula transition</a></h4>

              
                <i>Wolbachia</i>, a vertically transmitted endosymbiont infecting many insects, spreads rapidly through uninfected populations by a mechanism known as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In CI, a paternally delivered modification of the sperm leads to chromatin defects and lethality during and after the first mitosis of embryonic development in multiple species. However, whether CI-induced defects in later stage embryos are a consequence of the first division errors or caused by independent defects remains unresolved. To address this question, we focused on ~1/3 of embryos from CI crosses in <i>Drosophila simulans</i> that develop apparently normally through the first and subsequent pre-blastoderm divisions before exhibiting mitotic errors during the mid-blastula transition and gastrulation. We performed single embryo PCR and whole genome sequencing to find a large percentage of these developed CI-derived embryos bypass the first division defect. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we find increased chromosome segregation errors in gastrulating CI-derived embryos that had avoided the first division defect. Thus, <i>Wolbachia</i> action in the sperm induces developmentally deferred defects that are not a consequence of the first division errors. Like the immediate defect, the delayed defect is rescued through crosses to infected females. These studies inform current models on the molecular and cellular basis of CI.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Consequences of PDGFR a + fibroblast reduction in adult murine hearts</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblasts produce the majority of collagen in the heart and are thought to regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Although fibrosis accompanies many cardiac pathologies and is generally deleterious, the role of fibroblasts in maintaining the basal ECM network and in fibrosis <i>in vivo</i> is poorly understood. We genetically ablated fibroblasts in mice to evaluate the impact on homeostasis of adult ECM and cardiac function after injury. Fibroblast-ablated mice demonstrated a substantive reduction in cardiac fibroblasts, but fibrillar collagen and the ECM proteome were not overtly altered when evaluated by quantitative mass spectrometry and N-terminomics. However, the distribution and quantity of collagen VI, a microfibrillar collagen that forms an open network with the basement membrane, was reduced. In fibroblast-ablated mice, cardiac function was better preserved following angiotensin II/phenylephrine (AngII/PE)-induced fibrosis and myocardial infarction (MI). Analysis of cardiomyocyte function demonstrated altered sarcomere shortening and slowed calcium decline in both uninjured and AngII/PE infused fibroblast-ablated mice. After MI, the residual resident fibroblasts responded to injury, albeit with reduced proliferation and numbers immediately after injury. These results indicate that the adult mouse heart tolerates a significant degree of fibroblast loss with potentially beneficial impact on cardiac function after injury. The cardioprotective effect of controlled fibroblast reduction may have therapeutic value in heart disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rapid, reference-free human genotype imputation with denoising autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                Genotype imputation is a foundational tool for population genetics. Standard statistical imputation approaches rely on the co-location of large whole-genome sequencing-based reference panels, powerful computing environments, and potentially sensitive genetic study data. This results in computational resource and privacy-risk barriers to access to cutting-edge imputation techniques. Moreover, the accuracy of current statistical approaches is known to degrade in regions of low and complex linkage disequilibrium. Artificial neural network-based imputation approaches may overcome these limitations by encoding complex genotype relationships in easily portable inference models. Here we demonstrate an autoencoder-based approach for genotype imputation, using a large, commonly used reference panel, and spanning the entirety of human chromosome 22. Our autoencoder-based genotype imputation strategy achieved superior imputation accuracy across the allele-frequency spectrum and across genomes of diverse ancestry, while delivering at least 4-fold faster inference run time relative to standard imputation tools.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A feed-forward pathway drives LRRK2 kinase membrane recruitment and activation</a></h4>

              
                Activating mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinson's disease and previously we showed that activated LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases (Steger et al., 2017). Moreover, Golgi-associated Rab29 can recruit LRRK2 to the surface of the Golgi and activate it there for both auto- and Rab substrate phosphorylation. Here we define the precise Rab29 binding region of the LRRK2 Armadillo domain between residues 360-450 and show that this domain, termed 'Site #1', can also bind additional LRRK2 substrates, Rab8A and Rab10. Moreover, we identify a distinct, N-terminal, higher affinity interaction interface between LRRK2 phosphorylated Rab8 and Rab10 termed 'Site #2', that can retain LRRK2 on membranes in cells to catalyze multiple, subsequent phosphorylation events. Kinase inhibitor washout experiments demonstrate that rapid recovery of kinase activity in cells depends on the ability of LRRK2 to associate with phosphorylated Rab proteins, and phosphorylated Rab8A stimulates LRRK2 phosphorylation of Rab10 in vitro. Reconstitution of purified LRRK2 recruitment onto planar lipid bilayers decorated with Rab10 protein demonstrates cooperative association of only active LRRK2 with phospho-Rab10-containing membrane surfaces. These experiments reveal a feed-forward pathway that provides spatial control and membrane activation of LRRK2 kinase activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-rapid eye movement sleep determines resilience to social stress normal</a></h4>

              
                Resilience, the ability to overcome stressful conditions, is found in most mammals and varies significantly among individuals. A lack of resilience can lead to the development of neuropsychiatric and sleep disorders, often within the same individual. Despite extensive research into the brain mechanisms causing maladaptive behavioral-responses to stress, it is not clear why some individuals exhibit resilience. To examine if sleep has a determinative role in maladaptive behavioral-response to social stress, we investigated individual variations in resilience using a social-defeat model for male mice. Our results reveal a direct, causal relationship between sleep amount and resilience-demonstrating that sleep increases after social-defeat stress only occur in resilient mice. Further, we found that within the prefrontal cortex, a regulator of maladaptive responses to stress, pre-existing differences in sleep regulation predict resilience. Overall, these results demonstrate that increased NREM sleep, mediated cortically, is an active response to social-defeat stress that plays a determinative role in promoting resilience. They also show that differences in resilience are strongly correlated with inter-individual variability in sleep regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Higher levels of narrativity lead to similar patterns of EEG activity across individuals</a></h4>

              
                The focus of cognitive and psychological approaches to narrative has not so much been on the elucidation of important aspects of narrative, but rather on using narratives as tools for the investigation of higher order cognitive processes elicited by narratives (e.g., understanding, empathy, etc.). In this study, we work toward a scalar model of narrativity, which can provide testable criteria for selecting and classifying communication forms in their level of narrativity. We investigated whether being exposed to videos with different levels of narrativity modulates shared neural responses, measured by inter-subject correlation, and engagement levels. Thirty-two participants watched video advertisements with high-level and low-level of narrativity while their neural responses were measured through electroencephalogram. Additionally, participants engagement levels were calculated based on the composite of their self-reported attention and immersion scores. Results demonstrated that both calculated inter-subject correlation and engagement scores for high-level video ads were significantly higher than those for low-level, suggesting that narrativity levels modulate inter-subject correlation and engagement. We believe that these findings are a step toward the elucidation of the viewers way of processing and understanding a given communication artifact as a function of the narrative qualities expressed by the level of narrativity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential representation of natural and manmade images in the human ventral visual stream</a></h4>

              
                The human visual cortex processes visual stimuli hierarchically. Early visual areas (V1, V2) of the ventral visual stream feed crude visual features (like orientation and edges) into later visual areas (V4, lateral occipital (Lat Occ), inferior temporal (IT)) that then encode complex visual features (like object form). Previous studies have reported a difference in fMRI responses between natural and urban landscapes in certain parts of the brain. Here we asked if this distinction in the representation of complex natural and man-made visual stimuli extends to the ventral visual stream and if state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide a map to this categorical distinction. To assess this, we used an open source fMRI data set of V1-4 and LatOcc BOLD responses to 1750 passively viewed natural and man-made grayscale images. The same images were fed into the pre-trained CORnet-S, a CNN designed to model hierarchical human visual processing layer-wise. To identify differences in representations within and between the human visual cortex and the CNN, we computed representational dissimilarity matrices. The BOLD response to the manmade and natural images shows correlation differences for the two categories, which increase across V4 and LatOcc. Such differences were also observed in the model CORnet-S for the layers V4 and IT. Our results suggest that the human visual cortex processes natural and manmade images differently starting from V4 and that this representational difference is modeled in CORnet-S. In both, categorical representation is progressively established in the later processing stages. This might indicate that the brain has perhaps developed two-distinct systems for their representations which can be directed through evolution. Further analysis may facilitate the contributory role of evolution towards this paradigm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">DHHC3 mediated Cadm4 palmitoylation regulates myelination in CNS</a></h4>

              
                Cell adhesion molecule 4 (Cadm4) plays important roles on plasma membrane (PM) to regulate myelin formation and the downregulation of Cadm4 is a prominent feature in many demyelination diseases. However, how Cadm4 maintains its level on PM has been elusive. Here, we identify that Cadm4 is palmitoylated at cysteine-347 (C347) and palmitoylation regulates the stable localization of Cadm4 on PM, as blocking palmitoylation by mutating C347 into alanine (C347A) results in the dissociation of Cadm4 from PM and targeting for degradation. Intriguingly, blocking Cadm4 palmitoylation by introducing C347A (Cadm4-KI) causes myelin abnormalities in CNS, characterized by loss of myelination, myelin infoldings and hypermyelination. Moreover, it is uncovered that Cadm4 palmitoylation is catalyzed by DHHC3, reducing Cadm4 palmitoylation by the deletion of DHHC3 renders the redistribution of Cadm4 for degrading. Consistently, the genetic deletion of DHHC3 leads to downregulated Cadm4 palmitoylation and defects in CNS myelination, virtually phenocopies that of the Cadm4-KI mice. Our findings suggest a mechanism that the stable localization of Cadm4 on PM regulated by protein palmitoylation is vital for myelination in CNS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nhlh1 and Nhlh2, a global transcriptional mechanism regulating commissural axon projection via activating Robo3</a></h4>

              
                Commissural neurons play the crucial role to connect neuronal information from both sides of the nervous system in bilaterians by projecting their axons contralaterally across the midline. These neurons are highly heterogenous in their developmental origins, neurotransmitters and neurophysiology, as many disparate neuron classes contain commissural neurons. In mammals, most commissural axons from the spinal cord to the midbrain, cross the midline via the floor plate, guided predominantly by a conserved molecular mechanism, i.e., Robo3 and DCC expressing commissural axons are guided by Netrin-1 secreted from the floor plate and ventral neural tube. So far, no common transcriptional program has been uncovered for specifying the axon laterality across the highly heterogenous commissural neurons. In this study, we identified a pair of highly-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Nhlh1 and Nhlh2, as such a transcriptional program. We found that Robo3 promoter contains multiple copies of Nhlh1/2 binding sites and forced expression of Nhlh1/2 can induce ectopic Robo3 expression and contralateral axon projection in the hindbrain and the midbrain. We then generated mutant mice deficient in both genes and found a marked reduction of Robo3 and a total lack of ventral commissures from the spinal cord to the midbrain. This is the first report of a global transcriptional mechanism that controls the laterality of all floor plate-crossing commissural axons via activating Robo3 expression. Nhlh1 and Nhlh2 should provide the key to deciphering the principle underlying the specific and balanced production of contralateral- versus ipsilateral-projection neurons from the spinal cord to the midbrain.

                Traditional approaches to EEG modelling use the methods of classical physics to reconstruct scalp potentials in terms of explicit physical models of cortical neuron ensembles. The principal difficulty is that the multiplicity of cellular processes with an intricate array of deterministic and random factors prevents creation of consistent biophysical parameter sets. An original, empirically-testable solution has been recently achieved in our previous studies by a radical departure from the deterministic equations of classical physics to the probabilistic reasoning of quantum mechanics. This crucial step relocates elementary bioelectric sources of EEG signals from the cellular to the molecular level where positively and negatively ions are considered as elementary sources of electricity. The rationale is that despite dramatic differences in cellular machineries, statistical factors governed by the rules of central limit theorem produce EEG waveforms as a statistical aggregate of the synchronized activity of multiple closely-located microscale sources. Using the formalism of nonhomogeneous birth-and-death processes (BDP) the quantum models of microscale events are deduced and linked to the dynamics of macroscale EEG waveforms. This study expands these methods with new features for comprehensive analysis of event related potentials directly from single trials, i.e. the EEG segments which are closely related in timing to cognitive events. We derive a universal model of the components of single trial ERPs both in frequency and time domains. This, for the first time, enables us to quantify all significant cognitive components in single trial ERPs, providing an alternative to the traditional method of averaging. Given P300 as an important objective marker of psychiatric disorders, a methodology which reliably discloses the component compositions of this potential, may have specific diagnostic importance. In this study, reliable identification of the P3a and P3b components from an auditory oddball paradigm provided a means of differentiating borderline personality disorder from schizophrenia.

                Cortical circuits feature both excitatory and inhibitory cells that underlie the encoding of dynamic sensory stimuli, e.g., speech, music, odors, and natural scenes. While previous studies have shown that inhibition plays an important role in shaping the neural code, little is known about how excitatory and inhibitory cells coordinate to enhance encoding of temporally dynamic stimuli. Recent experimental recordings in mouse auditory cortex (ACx) have shown that optogenetic suppression of parvalbumin (PV) neurons results in a decrease of neural discriminability between dynamic stimuli with speech envelope modulations. Here, we present a multilayer model of a cortical circuit that mechanistically explains these results. The model incorporates characteristic short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) profiles of excitatory and PV cells. Crucially, the model performance is based on populations of PV cells that separately respond to stimulus onsets and offsets. We reveal that by tuning the relative strengths of inhibition from onset- and offset-responding PV cells, the cortical network model captures the broad range of neural discriminability profiles in cortical single-unit data, with varying contributions from rapid firing rate modulations and spike timing. The model also replicates and explains the experimentally observed reduction in neural discrimination performance during optogenetic suppression of PV neurons. These results suggest that distinct populations of PV neurons enhance cortical discriminability of dynamic stimuli by encoding distinct temporal features, enhancing temporal coding, and reducing cortical noise.

                Tau aggregates are a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases and can contain RNAs and RNA binding proteins, including SRRM2 and PNN. How these resident nuclear proteins mislocalize and their influence on the prion like propagation of tau fibers remains unknown. We demonstrate that polyserine repeats in SRRM2 and PNN are necessary and sufficient for recruitment to tau aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrate tau fibers preferentially grow in association with endogenous cytoplasmic assemblies, mitotic interchromatin granules and cytoplasmic speckles, which contain SRRM2 and PNN. Polyserine undergoes self assembly in vitro and in cells, where polyserine-assemblies are sites of tau fiber propagation. Modulating the levels of polyserine containing proteins results in a corresponding change in tau aggregation. These findings define a specific protein motif, and cellular condensates, that promote tau fiber propagation. As cytoplasmic speckles form in iPSC neurons under inflammatory or hyperosmolar stress, they may promote tau fiber propagation in various neurodegenerative diseases.

                Speech comprehension is a complex process that draws on humans abilities to extract lexical information, parse syntax, and form semantic understanding. These sub-processes have traditionally been studied using separate neuroimaging experiments that attempt to isolate specific effects of interest. More recently it has become possible to study all stages of language comprehension in a single neuroimaging experiment using narrative natural language stimuli. The resulting data are richly varied at every level, enabling analyses that can probe everything from spectral representations to high-level representations of semantic meaning. We provide a dataset containing BOLD fMRI responses recorded while 8 subjects each listened to 27 complete, natural, narrative stories (~6 hours). This dataset includes pre-processed and raw MRIs, as well as hand-constructed 3D cortical surfaces for each participant. To address the challenges of analyzing naturalistic data, this dataset is accompanied by a python library containing basic code for creating voxelwise encoding models. Altogether, this dataset provides a large and novel resource for understanding speech and language processing in the human brain.

                Hypoxic ischaemic injury (HIE) in the neonatal brain has significant consequences on neurodevelopment and increases the occurrence of neurological deficits in infants. HIE is also a leading cause of neonatal seizures. Therapeutic options for the treatment of HIE are very limited. Hypoxia-ischemia directly damages brain tissue in a primary-wave of injury which activates a cascade of events triggering local and systemic inflammatory responses, driven by the innate immune system, which contribute to a significant secondary-wave of injury taking place as early as 6 hours post-hypoxia-ischaemia. Levels of the well documented inflammatory microRNA, miR-155 are elevated in rodent seizure and epilepsy models. Here, we assessed the impact of, miR-155 deletion in myeloid cells , on regulating inflammation and seizure severity in a preclinical model of neonatal hypoxia-induced seizures (Hypoxia-Sz). Wildtype miR-155 (miR-155+/+LysMCre) mice were compared to a mouse line in which miR-155 was deleted in myeloid cells (miR-155fl/fl LysMCre). We demonstrate significant upregulation of miR-155 target genes, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), arginase-2 (arg-2), ship-1 and socs-1 in miR-155fl/fl LysMCre mice compared to controls at various time points following Hypoxia-Sz. Conversely, we report decreased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1[beta]; and IL-6 and lower protein levels of IL-1[beta]; in miR-155fl/fl LysMCre mice as compared to WTs. Myeloid miR-155 deletion significantly reduced behavioural seizure severity score, reduced electrographically (EEG) measured seizure frequency and seizure burden as compared to mice to wildtypes, suggesting miR-155 regulation of seizure occurrence in this model. Behavioural tests for motor functions at 5 weeks post Hypoxia-Sz demonstrated differences between genotypes. Excitingly this work highlights that inhibition of miR-155, specifically in myeloid cells, may hold therapeutic benefit for both seizures and comorbidities associated with hypoxic brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comprehensive evaluation of harmonization on functional brain imaging for multisite data-fusion</a></h4>

              
                To embrace big-data neuroimaging, harmonization of site effect in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data fusion is a fundamental challenge. Comprehensive evaluation of potentially effective harmonization strategies, particularly with specifically collected data has been rare, especially for R-fMRI metrics. Here, we comprehensively assess harmonization strategies from multiple perspectives, including efficiency, individual identification, test-retest reliability and replicability of group-level statistical results, on widely used R-fMRI metrics across multiple datasets including data obtained from the same participants scanned at several sites. For individual identifiability (i.e., whether the same subject could be identified across R-fMRI data scanned across different sites), we found that, while most methods decreased site effects, the Subsampling Maximum-mean-distance based distribution shift correction Algorithm (SMA) outperformed linear regression models, linear mixed models, ComBat series and invariant conditional variational auto-encoder. Test-retest reliability was better for SMA and adjusted ComBat series than alternatives, while SMA was superior to the latter in replicability, both in terms of Dice coefficient and the scale of brain areas showing sex differences reproducibly observed across datasets. Moreover, we examined test-retest datasets to identify the best target site features to optimize SMA identifiability and test-retest reliability. We noted that both sample size and distribution of the target site matter and introduced a heuristic target site selection formula. In addition to providing practical guidelines, this work can inform continuing improvements and innovations in harmonizing methodologies for big R-fMRI data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An optimized workflow to generate and characterize iPSC-derived motor neuron (MN) spheroids</a></h4>

              
                Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) from the cortex, brainstem and/or the spinal cord. In an effort to understand the underlying causes of this selective degeneration, a multitude of in vitro models based on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs have been developed. Moreover, different groups have started to use advanced 3D structures, composed of MNs and other cell types to increase the physiological relevance of such in vitro models. For instance, spheroids are simple 3D models that have the potential to be generated in large numbers that can be used across different assays. In this study, we generated MN spheroids and developed a workflow to analyze them. We confirmed the expression of different MN markers as the MN spheroids differentiate, at both the transcript and protein level, as well as their capacity to display functional activity in the form of action potentials (APs) and bursts. We also identified the presence of other cell types, namely interneurons and oligodendrocytes, which share the same neural progenitor pool with MNs. In summary, we successfully developed a MN 3D model, and we optimized a workflow that can be applied to their characterization and analysis. In the future, we will apply this model and workflow to the study of MNDs by generating MN spheroids from patient-derived iPSC lines, aiming to contribute to the development of more advance and physiological in vitro disease models.

                Complement overactivation mediates microglial synapse elimination in neurological diseases like Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but how complement activity is regulated in the brain remains largely unknown. We identified that the secreted neuronal pentraxin Nptx2 binds complement C1q and thereby regulates its activity in the brain. Nptx2-deficient mice show increased complement activity and C1q-dependent microglial synapse engulfment and loss of excitatory synapses. In a neuroinflammation culture model and in aged TauP301S mice, AAV-mediated neuronal overexpression of Nptx2 was sufficient to restrain complement activity and ameliorate microglia-mediated synapse loss. Analysis of human CSF samples from a genetic FTD cohort revealed significantly reduced levels of Nptx2 and Nptx2-C1q protein complexes in symptomatic patients, which correlated with elevated C1q and activated C3. Together, these results show that Nptx2 regulates complement activity and microglial synapse elimination in the healthy and diseased brain and that diminished Nptx2 levels might exacerbate complement-mediated neurodegeneration in FTD patients.

                Understanding actions performed by others requires us to integrate different types of information about people, scenes, objects, and their interactions. What organizing dimensions does the mind use to make sense of this complex action space? To address this question, we collected intuitive similarity judgments across two large-scale sets of naturalistic videos depicting everyday actions. We used cross-validated sparse non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify the structure underlying action similarity judgments. A low-dimensional representation, consisting of nine to ten dimensions, was sufficient to accurately reconstruct human similarity judgments. The dimensions were robust to stimulus set perturbations and reproducible in a separate odd-one-out experiment. Human labels mapped these dimensions onto semantic axes relating to food, work, and home life; social axes relating to people and emotions; and one visual axis related to scene setting. While highly interpretable, these dimensions did not share a clear one-to-one correspondence with prior hypotheses of action-relevant dimensions. Together, our results reveal a low-dimensional set of robust and interpretable dimensions that organize intuitive action similarity judgments and highlight the importance of data-driven investigations of behavioral representations.

                Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common chronic, progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. The main symptom is sensory loss; the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We found that Drosophila fed a high-sugar diet, which induces diabetes-like phenotypes, exhibit impairment of noxious heat avoidance. The impairment of heat avoidance was associated with shrinkage of the leg neurons expressing the Drosophila transient receptor potential channel Painless. Using a candidate genetic screening approach, we identified proteasome modulator 9 as one of the modulators of impairment of heat avoidance. We further showed that proteasome inhibition in the glia reversed the impairment of noxious heat avoidance, and heat-shock proteins and exosome secretion in the glia mediated the effect of proteasome inhibition. Our results establish Drosophila as a useful system for exploring molecular mechanisms of diet-induced peripheral neuropathy and propose that the glial proteasome is one of the candidate therapeutic targets for DPN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Yeast NDI1 expression prevents the unfolded protein response and reconfigures metabolism to restore neuronal function in mitochondrial complex I deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in mitochondrial complex I cause mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a group of severe neurological diseases that can result in death in infancy. The mechanisms underlying complex I deficiency pathogenesis remain poorly understood, and as a result there are currently no available treatments. To better understand the causes of neuronal dysfunction in complex I deficiency, we modelled complex I deficiency in Drosophila by knocking down the mitochondrial complex I subunit ND-75 (NDUFS1) specifically in neurons. Neuronal complex I deficiency causes locomotor defects, seizures and reduced lifespan. At the cellular level, complex I deficiency leads to mitochondrial morphology defects, reduced endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) in neurons. Remarkably, we find that expression of the yeast non-proton translocating NADH dehydrogenase NDI1 in neurons, which couples NADH oxidation to transfer of electrons into the respiratory chain, reinstates endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts, prevents UPR activation and rescues the behavioural and lifespan phenotypes caused by complex I deficiency. Metabolomic analysis shows that NDI1 expression also reconfigures neuronal metabolism and implicates increased GABA levels as a contributor to the neurological manifestations of complex I deficiency. Together, these data indicate that NDI1 abrogates UPR signalling and reprogrammes metabolism to alleviate neuronal dysfunction caused by neuronal complex I deficiency.

                Fear and anxiety are brain states that evolved to mediate defensive responses to threat. While it is clear that the defense reaction includes multiple interacting behavioural, autonomic and endocrine adjustments, their integrative nature is poorly understood. In particular, threat has been associated with various cardiac changes, yet a clear consensus on their relevance for the integrated defense reaction is missing. We here define rapid microstates associated with specific behaviours and heart rate dynamics, both affected by long-lasting macrostates and reflecting context-dependent threat levels. In addition, we demonstrate that one of the most commonly used defensive behavioural responses, freezing measured by immobility, is part of an integrated cardio-behavioural microstate mediated by specific midbrain circuit elements. Our work puts forth a framework for systematic integration of cardiac and behavioural readouts that presents the basis for a better understanding of complex neural defensive states and their associated systemic functions.

                We studied the behavioral consequences of fentanyl vapor self-administration (SA) in mice with and without chronic neuropathic pain (one month after spared-nerve injury(SNI) model or sham injury). We assessed fentanyl consumption, motivation, and seeking during as well as anxiety, hyperactivity, immobility, and pain for two regimens of fentanyl SA: 1) Dose escalation, where over a 3-week period mice are exposed (daily 2-hour sessions) to escalating numbers of fentanyl puffs per active nosepoke (from 1 puff/active nosepoke for first 3 days, up to 6 puffs/active nosepoke in days 16-18). 2) Effort escalation, where over a 3-week period (daily 2-hour sessions) mice need to increase effort to acquire the same amount of fentanyl (fixed ratio 1 (FR) = 1 active nosepoke results in 1 fentanyl puff, while second and third week we use FR5 and FR10). We observe sex-, injury- and regimen- dependent differences in outcomes. Importantly the dose escalation regimen resulted in higher seeking behavior (post forced abstinence, context and cue driven nosepoking in the absence of fentanyl delivery), long lasting increased anxiety, immobility, and hyperactivity, as well as transient but full pain relief in SNI mice. Therefore, this regimen seems a better rodent model for translating outcomes to human chronic pain patients managed with opioids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deletion of Tac1 gene impact kinase phosphorylation involved in signaling pathways associated with pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain in elderly persons is often not adequately treated, and current treatments may lead to poor outcomes. Therefore, new treatment strategies need to be developed based on a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of chronic pain. Recent studies have shown that Tac1 KO mice display a significant decrease in nociceptive pain responses to moderate or intense stimuli but present no phenotypic changes following light or nonpainful stimuli. Moreover, the deletion of the Tac1 gene led to a deficit of opioid peptides, which are essential to endogenous pain control mechanisms. Thus, we investigated whether Tac1 KO mice show defective pain modulatory pathways by specifically profiling protein kinases in mice spinal cord using phosphoproteomics and bioinformatics. Protein phosphorylation is a key feature of the cellular regulatory mechanism, and phosphorylation status is related to the regulation and modulation of protein-protein binding. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that MAPK, tyrosine kinase, senescence, interleukin signaling, and TCR signaling are modulated in Tac1 KO mice. Interestingly, these processes are intimately linked with inflammatory responses leading to the release of cytokines and chemokines implicated in the interactions and communications between cells. They are key players involved in the initiation and persistence of pathologic pain. The absence of the Tac1 gene products may trigger a much wider cell response to compensate for the lack of important components of the nociceptive pain transmission system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Normative models for neuroimaging markers: Impact of model selection, sample size and evaluation criteria</a></h4>

              
                Modelling population reference curves or normative modelling is increasingly used with the advent of large neuroimaging studies. In this paper we assess the performance of fitting methods from the perspective of clinical applications and investigate the influence of the sample size. Further, we evaluate linear and nonlinear models for percentile curve estimation and highlight how the bias-variance trade-off manifests in typical neuroimaging data. We created plausible ground truth distributions of hippocampal volumes in the age range of 45 to 80 years, as an example application. Based on these distributions we repeatedly simulated samples for sizes between 50 and 50,000 data points, and for each simulated sample we fitted a range of normative models. We compared the fitted models and their variability across repetitions to the ground truth, with specific focus on the outer percentiles (1th, 5th, 10th) as these are the most clinically relevant. Our results quantify the expected decreasing trend in variance of the volume estimates with increasing sample size. However, bias in the volume estimates only decreases a modest amount, without much improvement at large sample sizes. The uncertainty of model performance is substantial for what would often be considered large samples in a neuroimaging context and rises dramatically at the ends of the age range, where fewer data points exist. Flexible models perform better across sample sizes, especially for nonlinear ground truth. Surprisingly large samples of several thousand data points are needed to accurately capture outlying percentiles across the age range for applications in research and clinical settings. Performance evaluation methods should assess both, bias and variance. Furthermore, extreme caution is needed when attempting to extrapolate beyond the age range included in the source dataset. To help with such evaluations of normative models we have made our code available to guide researchers developing or utilising normative models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">UBA52 attunes VDAC1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal death</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial homeostasis regulates energy metabolism, calcium buffering, cell function and apoptosis. The present study has been conducted to investigate the implications of ubiquitin-encoding gene UBA52 in mitochondrial physiology. Transient expression of Myc-UBA52 in neurons significantly inhibited the rotenone-induced increase in reactive oxygen species generation, nitrite level and depleted glutathione level. Mass spectrometric and co-immunoprecipitation data suggested the profound interaction of UBA52 with mitochondrial outer membrane channel protein, VDAC1 in both the wild-type and Myc-alpha-synuclein overexpressed neuronal cells and in the Parkinson disease (PD)-specific substantia nigra and striatal region of the rat brain. In vitro ubiquitylation assay revealed that UBA52 participates in the ubiquitylation of VDAC1 through E3 ligase CHIP. Myc-UBA52 overexpression in neurons further improved the mitochondrial functionality and cell viability by preventing the alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial complex-I activity, translocation of cytochrome-c and p-Nrf2 along with effect on intracellular calcium uptake, thus collectively inhibiting the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Additionally, Myc-UBA52 expression in neuronal cells offered protection against apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Altogether, our findings delineate functional association between UBA52 and mitochondrial homeostasis, providing new insights into the deterrence of dopaminergic cell death during acute PD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Mechanisms Underlying Colour Afterimages</a></h4>

              
                Negative colour afterimages are a fundamental phenomenon reflecting the adaptative mechanisms of colour processing. Despite its fundamental importance, the precise mechanisms underlying afterimages are very much controversial. What has been overlooked is that the adaptation of different mechanisms makes fundamentally different predictions about the hue and saturation of afterimages. We developed two experimental paradigms to measure the exact colours perceived in afterimages and test those predictions empirically. All results of these two different paradigms confirm that afterimages do not align with cone-opponency but instead tightly follow a well-founded, straight-forward model of cone adaptation (i.e., cone contrasts). This model implements cone adaptation according to Weber's Law, which is a direct consequence of the proportional decrement of photon catches due to cone bleaching and results in a nonlinear, multiplicative inverse function of cone excitations. This nonlinear adaptation of the three cones predicts three peaks of afterimage intensity that correspond with the three peaks of saturation and the three clusters of hue in the measurements of afterimages. Our findings establish cone-adaptation as the sole origin of negative colour afterimages. The quantitative cone-contrast model resolves apparent contradictions and provides a comprehensive, straight-forward explanation of the adaptive mechanisms underlying colour afterimages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biomechanics and neural circuits for vestibular-induced fine postural control in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Land-walking vertebrates maintain a desirable posture by finely controlling muscles. It is unclear whether fish also finely control posture in the water. Here, we showed that larval zebrafish have fine posture control. When roll-tilted, fish recovered their upright posture using a reflex behavior, which was a slight body bend near the swim bladder. The vestibular-induced body bend produces a misalignment between gravity and buoyancy, generating a moment of force that recovers the upright posture. We identified the neural circuits for the reflex, including the vestibular nucleus (tangential nucleus) through reticulospinal neurons (neurons in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus) to the spinal cord, and finally to the posterior hypaxial muscles, a special class of muscles near the swim bladder. These results suggest that fish maintain a dorsal-up posture by frequently performing the body bend reflex and demonstrate that the reticulospinal pathway plays a critical role in fine postural control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopaminergic innervation at the central nucleus of the amygdala reveals distinct topographically and functionally segregated regions</a></h4>

              
                The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is involved in the expression of fear and has been implicated in several anxiety disorders. Anatomically, it is divided in a medial (CeM), a lateral (CeL) and a capsular division (CeC). The CeA is densely innervated by dopaminergic projections that originate in the ventral periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe (vPAG/DR) and the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra compacta (VTA/SNc). However, it is unknown if DA exerts a homogenous control over the CeA or, conversely, if different parts of the CeA are regulated in a distinct manner. Here, we performed a neuroanatomical and functional analysis of the mouse CeA and revealed that dopaminergic innervations arriving from the PAG/DR and the VTA/SNc constitute distinct, non-overlapping pathways that differ in their expression of dopamine transporter. By quantifying the distribution of DAergic fibers and the origin of the innervation, we identified two regions in the CeL: a frontal region innervated by both the VTA/SNc and the vPAG/DR, and a caudal region innervated only by the vPAG/DR; and three regions in the CeC: a fronto-dorsal region innervated only by the VTA/SNc, a fronto-ventral region with sparse DAergic innervation, and a caudal region with low innervation from the vPAG/DR. In addition, we found that each region displays a unique pattern of cFos activation after the administration of cocaine, SKF 38393, quinpirole or haloperidol, demonstrating that the regions identified here are functionally distinct from each other. In summary, this analysis reveals unique properties of the DAergic pathways innervating the CeA, and distinguishes six topographically segregated and functionally distinct regions in the CeA. This unanticipated level of functional heterogeneity calls for more precise anatomical specificity in future functional studies of the CeA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glutamatergic Supramammillary Nucleus Neurons Promote Active Coping to Stress</a></h4>

              
                Threat-response neural circuits are conserved across species and have roles in normal behaviors and psychiatric diseases. Maladaptive changes in these neural circuits contribute to stress, mood, and anxiety disorders. Active coping in response to stressors is psychosocial factor associated with resilience against stress induced mood and anxiety disorders. The neural circuitry underlying active coping is poorly understood but the functioning of these circuits could be key for overcoming anxiety and related disorders. The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) has been suggested to be engaged by threat and found to have efferent connections to stress-sensitive brain regions. We identified a unique population of glutamatergic SuM neurons that project to the POA. Using retrograde adeno associated viral (AAV) and combinatorial genetic tools we delineated the extensive arborization of these cells, identifying projections to brain nodes which mediate various features of the stress and threat response including the paraventricular nucleus (PV), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the habenula (Hb). Here we report that the POA projecting subset of SuM neurons are activated by acute threatening stressors, based on fiber photometry measurements. We found that selective photoactivation of the target SuM population drives aversive and active coping behaviors. Furthermore, activation of these SuM neurons is sufficient to convert passive coping strategies to active behaviors. These findings indicate new circuit mechanisms which governs state transitions between active and passive responses to stress offering opportunities for furthering our neurobiological understanding of stress while helping to identify putative treatments for common psychiatric conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparison Between Gradients and Parcellations for Functional Connectivity Prediction of Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has been widely used to predict behavioral measures. To predict behavioral measures, there are different approaches for representing RSFC with parcellations and gradients being the two most popular approaches. There is limited comparison between parcellation and gradient approaches in the literature. Here, we compared different parcellation and gradient approaches for RSFC-based prediction of a broad range of behavioral measures in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) datasets. Among the parcellation approaches, we considered group-average "hard" parcellations (Schaefer et al., 2018), individual-specific "hard" parcellations (Kong et al., 2021a), and an individual-specific "soft" parcellation (spatial independent component analysis with dual regression; Beckmann et al., 2009). For gradient approaches, we considered the well-known principal gradients derived from diffusion embedding (Margulies et al., 2016), and the local gradient approach that detects local changes in RSFC across the cortex (Laumann et al., 2015). Across two regression algorithms (linear ridge regression and kernel ridge regression), we found that individual-specific hard-parcellation performed the best in the HCP dataset, while the principal gradients, spatial independent component analysis and group-average "hard" parcellations exhibited similar performance. On the other hand, principal gradients and all parcellation approaches performed similarly in the ABCD dataset. Across both datasets, local gradients performed the worst. Finally, we found that the principal gradient approach required at least 40 to 60 gradients in order to perform as well as parcellation approaches. While most principal gradient studies utilize a single gradient, our results suggest that incorporating higher order gradients could provide significant behaviorally relevant information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pathogenic mis-splicing of CPEB4 in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is caused by a complex interplay of polygenic risk and environmental factors, which might alter regulators of gene expression leading to pathogenic mis-expression of SCZ risk genes. The RNA binding protein family CPEB (CPEB1, CPEB2, CPEB3, CPEB4) regulates the translation of target RNAs bearing CPE sequences in their 3UTR (approximately 40% of overall genes). We previously identified CPEB4 as a key dysregulated translational regulator in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), proving that its neuronal-specific microexon (exon 4) is mis-spliced in brains of ASD probands, leading to concerted underexpression of a plethora of high confidence ASD-risk genes. The genetic and pathogenic mechanisms shared between SCZ and ASD make it plausible that mis-splicing of CPEB4 might occur also in SCZ patients, leading to downstream altered brain expression of multiple SCZ-related genes. In this study, we first analyzed Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS data and found significant enrichment of SCZ-associated genes for CPEB4-binder transcripts. We also found decreased inclusion of CPEB4 microexon in postmortem prefrontal cortex of SCZ probands. This mis-splicing is associated with decreased protein levels of SCZ-associated genes that are targets of CPEB4. Interestingly, this happens specifically in individuals with low exposure to antipsychotic medication. Finally, we show that mild overexpression of a CPEB4 transcript lacking exon 4 (CPEB4{Delta}4) in mice suffices to induce decreased protein levels of SCZ genes targeted by CPEB4; these mice are also characterized by SCZ-linked behaviors. In summary, this study identifies aberrant CPEB4 splicing and downstream mis-expression of SCZ-risk genes as a novel etiological mechanism in SCZ.

	<p>(1) Background: Exercise exerts many neuroprotective effects in diabetes-induced brain disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on brain molecular changes and cognitive and anxiety-like behaviors in rats with type 2 diabetes. (2) Methods: Twenty-eight adult male rats were divided into four groups (n = 7): control (C), exercise + control (C+EX), diabetes (DM), and diabetes + exercise (DM+EX). Diabetes was induced using a two-month high-fat diet and a single dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) in the DM and DM+EX groups. After, the C+EX and DM+EX groups performed HIIT for eight weeks (five sessions per week, running at 80&amp;amp;ndash;100% of VMax, 4&amp;amp;ndash;10 intervals) on a motorized treadmill. Then, the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) were performed to evaluate anxiety-like behaviors. The Morris water maze (MWM) and shuttle box were used to assess cognitive function. The hippocampal levels of beta-amyloid and tau protein were also assessed using Western blot. (3) Results: The hippocampal levels of beta-amyloid and tau protein were increased in the DM group, but HIIT restored these changes. While diabetes led to a significant decrease in open arm time percentage (%OAT) and open arm enters percentage (%OAE) in the EPM, indicating anxiety-like behavior, HIIT restored them. In the OFT, grooming was decreased in diabetic rats, which was restored by HIIT. No significant difference between groups was seen in the latency time in the shuttle box or for learning and memory in the MWM. (4) Conclusions: HIIT-induced hippocampal molecular changes were associated with anxiety-like behavior improvement but not cognitive function in rats with type 2 diabetes.</p>

	<p>Pimavanserin (PMV) is the first approved drug for treating hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) psychosis. Psychosis is one of the leading causes of nursing home placement in people with PD. Furthermore, hallucinations are a more frequent cause of institutionalization than motor disability or dementia related to PD. The management of PD psychosis involves antipsychotic medications. Most of the drugs in this class directly block dopamine D2 receptors, leading to significantly worsening motor symptoms in patients with PD. The most commonly used medications for managing PD psychosis are quetiapine, clozapine, and PMV. This literature review aims to study pimavanserin&amp;amp;rsquo;s history, mechanism, clinical trials, and post-marketing experience. PMV is a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist/inverse agonist. Moreover, this drug can interact with 5-HT2C receptors. We calculated some physicochemical descriptors and pharmacokinetic properties of PMV. Eight clinical trials of PMV and PD psychosis are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Only four of them have complete results already published. Meta-analytic results showed that PMV efficacy is inferior to clozapine. However, PMV has a significantly lower number of side-effects for managing psychosis in PD. Medicare database assessment revealed 35% lower mortality with PMV compared to other atypical antipsychotics. Moreover, sensitive statistical analysis demonstrated that PMV is a protective factor for the risk of falls in individuals with PD.</p>

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 183 patients with MMD undergoing 203 EC&amp;amp;ndash;IC bypass operation procedures from January 2018 to August 2020. According to whether TND and stroke occurred within 14 days after operation, univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used. Results: TND occurred in 26 cases (12.8%) of revascularization. The results of the univariate analysis showed that history of diabetes, multiple episodes of preoperative symptoms, lesions involving the posterior circulation, and high postoperative blood pressure are the risk factors of TND. Further multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that multiple episodes of preoperative symptoms (p = 0.016) and lesions involving the posterior circulation (p = 0.014) are the independent risk factors for TND. Perioperative stroke occurred in 12 cases (5.9%). The results of the univariate analysis showed that older age, history of hypertension, preoperative cerebral infarction as the main symptom, lesions involving the posterior circulation, and high perioperative blood pressure are the risk factors of perioperative stroke. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative cerebral infarction as the main symptom (p = 0.015) is an independent risk factor for perioperative stroke. The occurrence of perioperative complications was not related to the improvement of follow-up mRS (Modified Rankin Scale) score and long-term cerebral rehemorrhage. Conclusions: Clinically, patients with MMD have multiple episodes of preoperative symptoms, lesions involving the posterior circulation, and preoperative cerebral infarction and should be attached when undergoing revascularization.</p>

	<p>Background: Reversible splenial-lesion syndrome (RESLES) is a relatively rare and underrecognized clinical-imaging syndrome involving the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC). RESLES can be caused by various etiologies. Case description: An 18-year-old man with no previous history of neurological or psychiatric disorders presented to our hospital with headache, intermittent blurred vision, and limb weakness after 150 days of recreational nitrous-oxide abuse. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s serum vitamin B12 concentration was normal, and magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed isointensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) of the corpus callosum and high signal intensity on T2WI, T2FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI); thus, a diagnosis of RESLES was established. The patient received 0.5 mg of mecobalamin daily and nitrous oxide was discontinued. After 4 weeks, the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s symptoms disappeared and the imaging examination revealed normal findings. Conclusion: We report for the first time a case of headache, blurred vision, and hallucination caused by RESLES associated with nitrous-oxide abuse. In cases of headaches and hallucinations of unknown etiology, the possibility of RESLES caused by nitrous oxide abuse should be considered.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of chemotherapy on brain functional resting-state signal variability and cognitive function in older long-term survivors of breast cancer. This prospective longitudinal study enrolled women age &amp;amp;ge; 65 years of age who were breast cancer survivors after exposure to chemotherapy (CH), age-matched survivors not exposed to chemotherapy, and healthy controls. Participants completed resting-state functional brain MRI and neurocognitive testing upon enrollment (timepoint 1, TP1) and again two years later (timepoint 2, TP2). There were 20 participants in each of the three groups at TP1. The CH group showed a significant decrease in SDBOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal variability in standard deviation) in the right middle occipital gyrus (&amp;amp;Delta;SDBOLD = &amp;amp;minus;0.0018, p = 0.0085, q (pFDR) = 0.043 at MNI (42, &amp;amp;minus;76, 17)) and right middle temporal gyrus (&amp;amp;Delta;SDBOLD = &amp;amp;minus;0.0021, p = 0.0006, q (pFDR) = 0.001 at MNI (63, &amp;amp;minus;39, &amp;amp;minus;12)). There were negative correlations between the crystallized composite scores and SDBOLD values at the right inferior occipital gyrus (correlation coefficient r = &amp;amp;minus;0.84, p = 0.001, q (pFDR) = 0.016) and right middle temporal gyrus (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.88, p = 0.000, q (pFDR) = 0.017) for the CH group at TP1. SDBOLD could be a potentially useful neuroimaging marker for older long-term survivors of breast cancer with exposure to chemotherapy.</p>

	<p>Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rehabilitation effects of four common interventions (BA: body acupuncture, SA: scalp acupuncture, TA: tongue acupuncture, SLT: speech and language training) used singly or in combination with language function in patients with post-stroke aphasia (PSA). Design: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Ovid, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang from inception to 04 April 2022. Only randomized controlled trials that met the eligibility criteria were included. The risk of bias of studies included was assessed using the RoB&amp;amp;minus;2 tool. The effects of different interventions for PSA patients were analyzed and ranked according to the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) analysis. Results: A total of 69 RCTs were included, including 5097 total participants. According to the results of the SUCRA curves, TA ranked highest in improving overall efficacy (SUCRA = 86%) and oral expression score (SUCRA = 86%). BA + TA ranked highest in increasing the comprehension score (SUCRA = 74.9%). BA + SA ranked highest in improving aphasia patients&amp;amp;rsquo; repetition (SUCRA = 89.2%) and denomination scores (SUCRA = 93%). Conclusions: Results of our network meta-analysis and SUCRA ranking showed that tongue acupuncture, body acupuncture + tongue acupuncture, and body acupuncture + scalp acupuncture seem to offer better advantages than other interventions for improving the language function in PSA patients. Moreover, it is noteworthy that our results are limited to the Chinese population, since all eligible studies are from China. Future well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and more ethnic groups are required to further verify these findings.</p>

	<p>Background: Adolescent cannabis use (CU) is associated with adverse health outcomes and may be increasing in response to changing cannabis laws. Recent imaging studies have identified differences in brain activity between adult CU and controls that are more prominent in early onset users. Whether these differences are present in adolescent CU and relate to age/developmental stage, sex, or cannabis exposure is unknown. Methods: A systematic review and subsequent effect-size seed-based d mapping (SDM) meta-analysis were conducted to examine differences in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response during fMRI studies between CU and non-using typically developing (TD) youth. Supplemental analyses investigated differences in BOLD signal in CU and TD youth as a function of sex, psychiatric comorbidity, and the dose and severity of cannabis exposure. Results: From 1371 citations, 45 fMRI studies were identified for inclusion in the SDM meta-analysis. These studies compared BOLD response contrasts in 1216 CU and 1486 non-using TD participants. In primary meta-analyses stratified by cognitive paradigms, CU (compared to TD) youth showed greater activation in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) and decreased activation in the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) during executive control and social cognition/emotion processing, respectively. In meta-regression analyses and subgroup meta-analyses, sex, cannabis use disorder (CUD) severity, and psychiatric comorbidity were correlated with brain activation differences between CU and TD youth in mPFC and insular cortical regions. Activation differences in the caudate, thalamus, insula, dmPFC/dACC, and precentral and postcentral gyri varied as a function of the length of abstinence. Conclusions: Using an SDM meta-analytic approach, this report identified differences in neuronal response between CU and TD youth during executive control, emotion processing, and reward processing in cortical and subcortical brain regions that varied as a function of sex, CUD severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and length of abstinence. Whether aberrant brain function in CU youth is attributable to common predispositional factors, cannabis-induced neuroadaptive changes, or both warrants further investigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Intrasession and Intersession Reproducibility of Artificial Scotoma pRF Mapping Results at Ultra-High Fields</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with population receptive field (pRF) mapping allows for associating positions on the visual cortex to areas on the visual field. Apart from applications in healthy subjects, this method can also be used to examine dysfunctions in patients suffering from partial visual field losses. While such objective measurement of visual deficits (scotoma) is of great importance for, e.g., longitudinal studies addressing treatment effects, it requires a thorough assessment of accuracy and reproducibility of the results obtained. In this study, we quantified the reproducibility of pRF mapping results within and across sessions in case of central visual field loss in a group of 15 human subjects. We simulated scotoma by masking a central area of 2&deg; radius from stimulation to establish ground-truth conditions. This study was performed on a 7T ultra-high field MRI scanner for increased sensitivity. We found excellent intrasession and intersession reproducibility for the pRF center position (Spearman correlation coefficients for <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>: &gt;0.95; eccentricity: &gt;0.87; polar angle: &gt;0.98), but only modest reproducibility for pRF size (Spearman correlation coefficients around 0.4). We further examined the scotoma detection performance using an automated method based on a reference dataset acquired with full-field stimulation. For the 2&deg; artificial scotoma, the group-averaged scotoma sizes were estimated at between 1.92&deg; and 2.19&deg; for different sessions. We conclude that pRF mapping of visual field losses yields robust, reproducible measures of retinal function and suggest the use of pRF mapping as an objective method for monitoring visual deficits during therapeutic interventions or disease progression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sources of Variation in the Spectral Slope of the Sleep EEG</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The 1/<I>f</I> spectral slope of the electroencephalogram (EEG) estimated in the  frequency range has been proposed as an arousal marker that differentiates wake, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here, we sought to replicate and extend these findings in a large sample, providing a comprehensive characterization of how slope changes with age, sex, and its test-retest reliability as well as potential confounds that could affect the slope estimation. We used 10,255 whole-night polysomnograms (PSGs) from the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR). All preprocessing steps were performed using an open-source Luna package and the spectral slope was estimated by fitting log-log linear regression models on the absolute power from 30 to 45 Hz separately for wake, NREM, and REM stages. We confirmed that the mean spectral slope grows steeper going from wake to NREM to REM sleep. We found that the choice of mastoid referencing scheme modulated the extent to which electromyogenic, or electrocardiographic artifacts were likely to bias 30- to 45-Hz slope estimates, as well as other sources of technical, device-specific bias. Nonetheless, within individuals, slope estimates were relatively stable over time. Both cross-sectionally and longitudinal, slopes tended to become shallower with increasing age, particularly for REM sleep; males tended to show flatter slopes than females across all states. Our findings support that spectral slope can be a valuable arousal marker for both clinical and research endeavors but also underscore the importance of considering interindividual variation and multiple methodological aspects related to its estimation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Enlarged Interior Built Environment Scale Modulates High-Frequency EEG Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                <p>There is currently no robust method to evaluate how built environment design affects our emotion. Understanding emotion is significant, as it influences cognitive processes, behavior, and wellbeing, and is linked to the functioning of physiological systems. As mental health problems are becoming more prevalent, and exposure to indoor environments is increasing, it is important we develop rigorous methods to understand whether design elements in our environment affect emotion. This study examines whether the scale of interior built environments modulate neural networks involved in emotion regulation. Using a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and controlling for indoor environmental quality (IEQ), 66 adults (31 female, aged 18&ndash;55) were exposed to context-neutral enclosed indoor room scenes to understand whether built environment scale affected self-report, autonomic nervous system, and central nervous system correlates of emotion. Our results revealed enlarged scale increased electroencephalography (EEG) power in the &beta; bandwidth. Frontal midline low- and high- power were also found to increase with enlarged scale, but contrary to our hypothesis, scale did not modulate frontal midline power or lateralization in the  or &alpha; bandwidths. We did not detect an effect of scale on autonomic indicators or self-reported emotion. However, we did find increased range in skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate variability (HRV) to the built environment conditions. This study provides a rigorous empirical framework for assessing the environmental impact of a design characteristic on human emotion and suggests that measures of high-frequency oscillations may provide a useful marker of the response to built environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of intraoperative PEEP with recruitment maneuvers on the occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications during general anesthesia––protocol for Bayesian analysis of three randomized clinical trials of intraoperative ventilation [version 1; pee</a></h4>

              
                Background: Using the frequentist approach, a recent meta–analysis of three randomized clinical trials in patients undergoing intraoperative ventilation during general anesthesia for major surgery failed to show the benefit of ventilation that uses high positive end–expiratory pressure with recruitment maneuvers when compared to ventilation that uses low positive end–expiratory pressure without recruitment maneuvers. Methods: We designed a protocol for a Bayesian analysis using the pooled dataset. The multilevel Bayesian logistic model will use the individual patient data. Prior distributions will be prespecified to represent a varying level of skepticism for the effect estimate. The primary endpoint will be a composite of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) within the first seven postoperative days, which reflects the primary endpoint of the original studies. We preset a range of practical equivalence to assess the futility of the intervention with an interval of odds ratio (OR) between 0.9 and 1.1 and assess how much of the 95% of highest density interval (HDI) falls between the region of practical equivalence. Ethics and dissemination: The used data derive from approved studies that were published in recent years. The findings of this current analysis will be reported in a new manuscript, drafted by the writing committee on behalf of the three research groups. All investigators listed in the original trials will serve as collaborative authors.

                Background There is evidence that patients with COVID-19 have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than the normal population. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems and their associated factors in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospitel in Thailand. Methods Mental health problems were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 items, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. McNemar's test was used to compare the prevalence of mental health problems between day 1 and day 7. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results A total of 186 participants (68.3% female; mean age = 37.21 years (SD 13.66) were recruited. The depression, anxiety, and stress rate on day 1 of admission was 26.9%, 32.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Having mild COVID-19 symptoms was a significantly associated factor with anxiety (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.05-6.89) and stress (OR=4.53, 95%CI: 1.32-15.55). Conclusions There was a high rate of mental health problems in COVID-19 patients. Detecting and managing mental health problems should be considered standard care for COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The new educational paradigm in the COVID-19 era: Can Blackboard replace physical teaching in EFL writing classrooms? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many changes are evident in classrooms in the COVID-19 times, but the most drastic perhaps has been the scramble to find substitutes for physical classrooms, a truly solemn challenge for the foreign language learning paradigm. In the meantime, many customized learning apps came to the educationists’ rescue: Blackboard being one of them. This study endeavors to investigate the effectiveness of Blackboard as an alternative to face-to-face writing instruction during the COVID-19 crisis and in the following period of precautionary distancing and other norms. Methods: The study used the final grades of Saudi male and female EFL undergraduates across two terms and with the Blackboard and face-to-face approaches in three compulsory English writing courses, and statistical tests were conducted on them. Results: The findings showed that female students (M=83.24, Std= 10.627) significantly outperform the male students (M=73.62, Std=16.011) in the final writing test (P=. 000). Furthermore, in face-to-face teaching (M=84.34, Std=10.752) was more statistically effective than when using Blackboard (M=75.65, Std=14.545) with the Sig value scored (P=. 000). Findings also showed that third level scored higher than the second and the first in writing (83.83, 78.17, 77.89) respectively. All the differences were significant (P=. 000). Conclusion: The implications of the study have a major bearing on curriculum and pedagogy planning for the coming times which may see more comebacks of the COVID-19 variants and warrant innovative teaching-learning tools and methods.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Sudden death related to unrecognized cardiac hydatid cyst [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a common parasitic human infestation found in sheep-breeding areas. It is caused by the larvae stage of Echinococcus granulosus, and cysts develop mostly in the lungs and the liver. Cardiac involvement is unusual and silent until acute complications or a fatal outcome occurs. Herein, we report an autopsy case of a young healthy adult who died suddenly. The autopsy revealed an external bulging on the right heart ventricle outlet with a fluid-filled cystic cavity discovered on sectioning. Dissection of other organs did not reveal other cyst locations. Histological examination ascertained the diagnosis of hydatid cyst, and death was attributed to cardiac arrhythmias. Pathologists should keep in mind that hydatid cysts can develop anywhere in the body. Solitary cardiac cyst is rare and can simulate a “silent bomb”. Unfortunately, sudden death remains the frequent manner of revelation of this disease in endemic areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Circadian signatures of anterior hypothalamus in time-restricted feeding [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Meal timing resets circadian clocks in peripheral tissues, such as the liver, in seven days without affecting the phase of the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Anterior hypothalamus plays an essential role in energy metabolism, circadian rhythm, and stress response. However, it remains to be elucidated whether and how anterior hypothalamus adapts its circadian rhythms to meal timing. Methods: Here, we applied transcriptomics to profile rhythmic transcripts in the anterior hypothalamus of nocturnal female mice subjected to day- (DRF) or night (NRF)-time restricted feeding for seven days. Results: This global profiling identified 128 and 3,518 rhythmic transcripts in DRF and NRF, respectively. NRF entrained diurnal rhythms among 990 biological processes, including ‘Electron transport chain’ and ‘Hippo signaling’ that reached peak time in the late sleep and late active phase, respectively. By contrast, DRF entrained only 20 rhythmic pathways, including ‘Cellular amino acid catabolic process’, all of which were restricted to the late active phase. The rhythmic transcripts found in both DRF and NRF tissues were largely resistant to phase entrainment by meal timing, which were matched to the action of the circadian clock. Remarkably, DRF for 36 days partially reversed the circadian clock compared to NRF. Conclusions: Collectively, our work generates a useful dataset to explore anterior hypothalamic circadian biology and sheds light on potential rhythmic processes influenced by meal timing in the brain (www.circametdb.org.cn).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identification of key somatic oncogenic mutation based on a confounder-free causal inference model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yijun Liu, Ji Sun, Huiyan Sun, Yi Chang</p>

Abnormal cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are the essential events that induce cancer initiation and progression. A fundamental goal in cancer research is to develop an efficient method to detect mutational genes capable of driving cancer. Although several computational methods have been proposed to identify these key mutations, many of them focus on the association between genetic mutations and functional changes in relevant biological processes, but not their real causality. Causal effect inference provides a way to estimate the real induce effect of a certain mutation on vital biological processes of cancer initiation and progression, through addressing the confounder bias due to neutral mutations and unobserved latent variables. In this study, integrating genomic and transcriptomic data, we construct a novel causal inference model based on a deep variational autoencoder to identify key oncogenic somatic mutations. Applied to 10 cancer types, our method quantifies the causal effect of genetic mutations on cell proliferation and EMT by reducing both observed and unobserved confounding biases. The experimental results indicate that genes with higher mutation frequency do not necessarily mean they are more potent in inducing cancer and promoting cancer development. Moreover, our study fills a gap in the use of machine learning for causal inference to identify oncogenic mutations.

Detecting structures within the continuous diving behavior of marine animals is challenging, and no universal framework is available. We captured such diverse structures using chaos theory. By applying time-delay embedding to exceptionally long dive records (83 d) from the narwhal, we reconstructed the state-space portrait. Using measures of chaos, we detected a diurnal pattern and its seasonal modulation, classified data, and found how sea-ice appearance shifts time budgets. There is more near-surface rest but deeper dives at solar noon, and more intense diving during twilight and at night but to shallower depths (likely following squid); sea-ice appearance reduces rest. The introduced geometrical approach is simple to implement and potentially helpful for mapping and labeling long-term behavioral data, identifying differences between individual animals and species, and detecting perturbations.

<i>Babesia</i> is a genus of apicomplexan parasites that infect red blood cells in vertebrate hosts. Pathology occurs during rapid replication cycles in the asexual blood stage of infection. Current knowledge of <i>Babesia</i> replication cycle progression and regulation is limited and relies mostly on comparative studies with related parasites. Due to limitations in synchronizing <i>Babesia</i> parasites, fine-scale time-course transcriptomic resources are not readily available. Single-cell transcriptomics provides a powerful unbiased alternative for profiling asynchronous cell populations. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 3 <i>Babesia</i> species (<i>B</i>. <i>divergens</i>, <i>B</i>. <i>bovis</i>, and <i>B</i>. <i>bigemina</i>). We used analytical approaches and algorithms to map the replication cycle and construct pseudo-synchronized time-course gene expression profiles. We identify clusters of co-expressed genes showing “just-in-time” expression profiles, with gradually cascading peaks throughout asexual development. Moreover, clustering analysis of reconstructed gene curves reveals coordinated timing of peak expression in epigenetic markers and transcription factors. Using a regularized Gaussian graphical model, we reconstructed co-expression networks and identified conserved and species-specific nodes. Motif analysis of a co-expression interactome of AP2 transcription factors identified specific motifs previously reported to play a role in DNA replication in <i>Plasmodium</i> species. Finally, we present an interactive web application to visualize and interactively explore the datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Primary and metastatic tumors exhibit systems-level differences in dependence on mitochondrial respiratory function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Neal K. Bennett, Hiroki J. Nakaoka, Danny Laurent, Ross A. Okimoto, Yoshitaka Sei, Andrew E. Horvai, Trever G. Bivona, Johanna ten Hoeve, Thomas G. Graeber, Ken Nakamura, Jean L. Nakamura</p>

The Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis, is a hallmark feature of cancer cells grown in culture. However, the relative roles of glycolysis and respiratory metabolism in supporting in vivo tumor growth and processes such as tumor dissemination and metastatic growth remain poorly understood, particularly on a systems level. Using a CRISPRi mini-library enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal protein and respiratory chain genes in multiple human lung cancer cell lines, we analyzed in vivo metabolic requirements in xenograft tumors grown in distinct anatomic contexts. While knockdown of mitochondrial ribosomal protein and respiratory chain genes (mito-respiratory genes) has little impact on growth in vitro, tumor cells depend heavily on these genes when grown in vivo as either flank or primary orthotopic lung tumor xenografts. In contrast, respiratory function is comparatively dispensable for metastatic tumor growth. RNA-Seq and metabolomics analysis of tumor cells expressing individual sgRNAs against mito-respiratory genes indicate overexpression of glycolytic genes and increased sensitivity of glycolytic inhibition compared to control when grown in vitro, but when grown in vivo as primary tumors these cells down-regulate glycolytic mechanisms. These studies demonstrate that discrete perturbations of mitochondrial respiratory chain function impact in vivo tumor growth in a context-specific manner with differential impacts on primary and metastatic tumors.

                The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed how scientific conferences are organized, fostering virtual meetings. These online events have allowed students and researchers to overcome geographical, administrative and economic barriers to attend and organize high-quality international symposiums. Moreover, these virtual conferences have contributed to the creation of inclusive activities that strengthen scientific communities. Here, we summarize the main activities and learnings from the 1st Ecuadorian-Venezuelan Symposium of Young Bioinformatics Researchers (1SEVJIB), organized by the Ecuadorian and Venezuelan ISCB-SC Regional Student Groups (RSGs). This symposium aimed to provide an opportunity for undergraduate and postgraduate students from Ecuador, Venezuela, and other Latin American countries to share their Bioinformatics research. The 1SEVJIB was the first bi-national conference organized by two RSGs from Latin America (LatAm). This symposium was a two-day virtual meeting with five activities: 1) oral student presentations, 2) poster session, 3) keynote lectures, 4) workshop, and 5) round table. This conference promoted the scientific exchange and cooperation networks between young Bioinformatics researchers and students from Ecuador, Venezuela, and LatAm, giving them opportunities to boost their scientific careers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pharmacy practitioners’ practice, awareness and knowledge about herbal products and their potential interactions with cardiovascular drugs [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicine use is widespread among patients, as community pharmacies may provide such products. Therefore, pharmacy practitioners should be aware of potential herbal products’ adverse effects and herb-drug interactions, particularly with medications for comorbid diseases, such as cardiovascular drugs, in which pharmacy practitioners need to have good knowledge to provide patients with relevant advice to get optimal and safe therapeutic outcomes. Accordingly, the study is designed to assess the knowledge and awareness of pharmacy practitioners regarding herbal product dispensing and cardiovascular drug interaction in Jordan and view their role in patients’ counselling to set up safe and effective drug use. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jordan using an online formatted questionnaire distributed to pharmacy practitioners working in community pharmacies. Descriptive and analytical statistics were performed for the responses using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 26. Results: Out of 508 participants, 41.7% had medium knowledge of herbal products pertaining mainly to university education (68.1%); 55.1% of participants dispensed herbal products without prescriptions for obesity and weight reduction (72.8%) and gastrointestinal problems (70.9%); this is because respondents agreed that herbal remedies are safe (28.5%) and effective (38.4%). Whilst the knowledge level of respondents about herbal medicine interaction with cardiovascular medication was medium, with a mean of 1.94, as this interaction may result in potentially serious consequences, 40.7% of respondents strongly agreed to gain more knowledge about the side effects of herbal products and medicine interactions through educational courses. Conclusions: The pharmacy practitioners had medium knowledge of herbal products; however, more attention should be paid to herb-drug interactions in the pharmacy educational curriculum. Additionally, pharmacy practitioners need to refresh their knowledge by attending periodic educational courses and by using reliable resources for information about herbal products in order to provide effective and competent pharmaceutical care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">HR practices and turnover intention; the mediating role of organizational commitment in Tehran: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Employees are increasingly being recognised as a valuable source of information, especially in knowledge-based businesses. Businesses, however, suffer financial and organisational memory losses related to re-hiring and training new staff, and lost productivity and intellectual property because of employee turnover. Hence, employee turnover should be considered an essential part of human resource management. Furthermore, employees’ trust in management and human resource (HR) practices substantially impact organisational commitment (OC). Thus, anticipating employee commitment and turnover intentions is crucial, as people are the sole source for knowledge-based firms to maintain their competitive advantage. In the context of selected Tehran Renewable Energy (RE) firms, this study investigated the mediating impact of OC on the relationship between HR practices (recruitment and selection; training and development opportunities; performance appraisal and evaluation; teamwork; compensation and pay; and job security) and employee turnover intention. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in Tehran that involved 90 experts and knowledgeable employees from four of Tehran's top RE businesses. A questionnaire was distributed to collect data which was later analysed with correlation, regression and bootstrapping analyses. Results: All six dimensions of HR practices were discovered to have an indirect impact on turnover intention and a direct impact on OC. OC among employees has an indirect effect on turnover intention. It was also revealed that the training and development opportunity has the most considerable effect on OC and turnover intention. OC was not found as a mediator between HR practices and turnover intention. Conclusions: The outcomes of this study showed that both training and development opportunities; and pay and compensation structure were found to be two significant components of HR practices in the relationship with OC. RE managers should employ appropriate HR strategies, particularly in these two dimensions, to improve an individual's degree of OC and reduce turnover intention.

                Camel meat is an ethnic food consumed across the arid regions. For these medicinal and nutritional benefits, it can be a great option for sustainable meat worldwide supply. Consumers can be benefit from the subtle taste of camel meat, flavored with aromatic and medicinal herbs from the arid regions. Research on the camel meat from both an economic and technological aspects is quite recent, which explains the limited information available on this area. Nevertheless, developing new preservation techniques as well the development of various products from camel meat through optimum processing constitute an axis of fu-ture scientific research in order to valorize this product. The camel meat as an alternative source to red meats is also discussed as well as the challenges of its acceptance by consumers. In light of the enthusiasm for this meat, to which many beneficial health effects are attributed, it seemed interesting to conduct this review.

                Background: Self-medication is a non-responsible act and leads to the inappropriate use of medications, causing low effectiveness and insecurity in treatments. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between self-medication and anxiety symptoms in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in users attending a pharmacy in Los Olivos, Lima in 2021. Methods: The research method was deductive, basic and with a quantitative approach; the design used was non-experimental, descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional, and prospective. Spearman's Rho analysis was performed to validate the hypothesis. Results: 384 users were evaluated, finding 93.5% aged 18-59 years, of whom 53.4% were female, 42.7% had completed high school, 57.8% were single and 51.6% presented physical symptoms, predominantly muscular tension accompanied by pain, 60.7% presented behavioral symptoms, highlighting unusual sadness in the face of COVID-19 and 70.1% presented cognitive symptoms with greater frequency of concern about contracting COVID-19. In addition, the greater the symptoms of anxiety, the higher the self-medication increased from 9.0% to 21.1%. A similar case was evidenced in self-medication on their own initiative where the increase was from 7.5% to 33.3%; likewise, self-medication without medical prescription increased from 15.8% to 47.7%, and the consumption of anxiolytics or antidepressants increased from 0.8% to 26.3% caused by the symptoms of anxiety. Conclusion: It was determined that there is a moderate relationship between self-medication and anxiety symptoms in the context of COVID-19, in users who go to a drugstore in Los Olivos, Lima in 2021.

                Behçet’s disease (BD) is rare in children. Herein, we report a case of 12-year-old male child with a history of left superficial femoral vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary embolism, admitted for multiple thrombosis located in the inferior vena cava, right atrium and ventricle associated with multiple pulmonary artery aneurisms and fissurations concomitant to oral aphthosis, which was suggestive of BD. Despite corticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, the child had a massive hemoptysis resulting in his death. The association between intracardiac thrombosis, pulmonary aneurism and venous thrombosis should raise suspicion of angio-Behçet, which could be lethal.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Besides the well-documented ophthalmic manifestations, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is believed to be related to emotional and psychological abnormalities. Given the previous neuroimaging evidence, we hypothesized that TAO patients would have altered neurovascular coupling associated with clinical-psychiatric disturbances. This study was to investigate neurovascular coupling changes in TAO by combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was calculated from rs-fMRI, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was computed from ASL in 37 TAO patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs). Global neurovascular coupling was assessed by across-voxel CBF-ALFF correlation, and regional neurovascular coupling was evaluated by CBF/ALFF ratio. Auxiliary analyses were performed using fractional ALFF (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) as rs-fMRI measures. Compared with HCs, TAO patients showed significantly reduced global CBF-ALFF coupling. Moreover, TAO patients exhibited decreased CBF/ALFF ratio in the left lingual gyrus (LG)/fusiform gyrus (FFG), and increased CBF/ALFF ratio in the bilateral precuneus (PCu). In TAOs, CBF/ALFF ratio in the left LG/FFG was positively correlated with visual acuity, while CBF/ALFF ratio in the bilateral PCu was negatively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. The auxiliary analyses showed trends of reduced global neurovascular coupling (i.e., CBF-fALFF correlation and CBF-ReHo correlation), as well as significant altered regional neurovascular coupling (i.e., CBF/fALFF ratio and CBF/ReHo ratio) in several brain regions. These findings indicated that TAO patients had altered neurovascular coupling in the visual and higher-order cognitive cortices. The neurovascular decoupling might be a possible neuropathological mechanism of TAO.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Regional precuneus cortical hyperexcitability in Alzheimer's disease patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>neuronal excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance is a potential cause of neuronal network malfunctioning in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), contributing to cognitive dysfunction. Here, we used a novel approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to probe cortical excitability in different brain areas known to be directly involved in AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>we performed TMS-EEG recordings targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC), the left posterior parietal cortex (l-PPC) and the precuneus (PC) in a large sample of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease patients (n=65) that were compared with a group of age-matched healthy controls (n=21).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>we found that AD patients are characterized by a regional cortical hyper-excitability in the PC and, to some extent, in the frontal lobe, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked potentials. Notably, cortical excitability assessed over the l-PPC was comparable between the two groups. Furthermore, we found that the individual level of PC excitability was associated with the level of cognitive impairment, as measured with Mini-Mental State Examination, and with corticospinal fluid levels of Aβ<sub>42.</sub></p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>our data provide novel evidence that precuneus cortical hyper-excitability is a key feature of synaptic dysfunction in AD patients. The current results point to the combined approach of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography as a novel promising technique to measure hyperexcitability in patients with AD. This index could represent a useful biomarker to stage disease severity and evaluate response to novel therapies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate stroke outcomes at three, six and 12 months post-stroke overall and by ethnicity in a population-based, longitudinal study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>First-ever ischemic strokes (2014-2019, n=1,332) among Mexican American (MA) persons (n=807) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) persons (n=525) were identified from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project. Data were collected from patient or proxy interviews (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-stroke) and medical records, including functional (activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) score), neurologic (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)), cognitive (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE)) and quality of life (QOL) outcomes (Stroke-specific QOL-12). Outcome trajectories were analyzed using multivariable adjusted linear models, with generalized estimating equations to account for within-subject correlations; interactions between ethnicity and time were included to investigate ethnic differences in trajectories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age was 67 years (IQR: 58,78), 48.5% were women, and 60.6% were MA. For all outcomes, significant improvement was seen between three and six months (p&lt;0.05 for all), with stability between six and 12 months. MA persons had significantly worse outcomes compared with NHW persons at all time points (three, six, and 12 months) with the exception of NIHSS which did not differ by ethnicity at six and 12 months, and average change in outcomes did not vary significantly by ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Outcomes were at their worst at three months post-stroke, and ethnic disparities were already present suggesting the need for early assessment and strategies to improve outcomes and possibly reduce disparities.</p>

     alt="Molecular examination of the endogenous opioid system in rhesus macaque monkeys with self-injurious behavior"/>
<p>The expression of genes related to endogenous opioid signaling was examined in Rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) monkeys that self-injure compared to control monkeys, in brain regions important for behavioral and emotional regulation including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Reduced mRNA levels for the mu opioid receptor were measured in the amygdala, while reduced mRNA levels of dynorphin mRNA were observed in the hypothalamus in monkeys that self-injure compared to controls. This study confirms and extends our knowledge of endogenous opioid signaling in self-injurious behaviors.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Self-injurious behavior (SIB) can lead to serious injury and occurs in approximately 1%–4% of the adult population, with higher incidences in adolescent and institutionalized populations, as well as in children with developmental disorders such as Autism. SIB also spontaneously occurs in a low percentage of captive monkeys. Rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) monkeys are evolutionarily and physiologically similar to humans, share 93% genetic sequence similarity to humans, and have long been used as testing subjects for vaccine and clinical trials. Previous studies hypothesized that altered endogenous opioid expression occurs in the brains of individuals and animals that self-injure. We examined the regional mRNA expression of opioid signaling genes in sixteen rhesus macaques that exhibited SIB and eight sex- and age- matched controls. The brain regions examined are linked to reward reinforcement and stress adaptation including the hypothalamus, orbital frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, caudate, and the amygdala. We found decreased μ-opioid receptor (<i>OPRM1</i>) in the amygdala of monkeys with SIB, and reduced prodynorphin (<i>PDYN</i>) in the hypothalamus. Our data suggest dysfunction in the regulation of opioid peptide precursors and calls for further investigation of the endogenous opioid system in SIB.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">The brain-immune ecosystem: Implications for immunotherapy in defeating neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Recent functional and anatomical discoveries of brain-immune relationships have overturned previous beliefs regarding the brain’s immune privilege. Here, we propose that the brain and immune cells at its borders operate as an “ecosystem” to support the brain’s robustness and resilience. Modulation of this ecosystem can be harnessed in the clinic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mountain gorillas maintain strong maternal affiliative biases despite high male reproductive skew and extensive exposure to paternal kin</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary theories predict that sibling relationships will reflect a complex balance of cooperative and competitive dynamics. In most mammals, dispersal and death patterns mean that sibling relationships occur in a relatively narrow window during development, and/or only with same-sex individuals. Besides humans, one notable exception are mountain gorillas, in which non-sex biased dispersal, relatively stable group composition, and the long reproductive tenures of alpha males mean that animals routinely reside with both maternally and paternally related siblings, of the same and opposite sex, throughout their lives. Using nearly 40,000 hours of behavioral data collected over 14 years on 699 sibling and 1235 non-sibling pairs of wild mountain gorillas, we demonstrate that individuals have strong affiliative preferences for full and maternal siblings over paternal siblings or unrelated animals, consistent with an inability to discriminate paternal kin. Intriguingly, however, aggression data imply the opposite. Aggression rates were statistically indistinguishable among all types of dyads except one: in mixed-sex dyads, non-siblings engaged in substantially more aggression than siblings of any type. This pattern suggests mountain gorillas may be capable of distinguishing paternal kin, but nonetheless choose not to affiliate with them over non-kin. We observe a preference for maternal kin in a species with high reproductive skew (i.e., high relatedness certainty), even though low reproductive skew (i.e., low relatedness certainty) is believed to underlie such biases in other non-human primates. Our results call into question reasons for strong maternal kin biases when paternal kin are identifiable, familiar, and similarly likely to be long-term groupmates, and they may also suggest behavioral mismatches at play during a transitional period in mountain gorilla society.
