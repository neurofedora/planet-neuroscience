              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14683">Brain-Aware Readout Layers in GNNs: Advancing Alzheimer's early Detection and Neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory and cognitive decline, affecting millions worldwide. Diagnosing AD is challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and variable progression. This study introduces a novel brain-aware readout layer (BA readout layer) for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), designed to improve interpretability and predictive accuracy in neuroimaging for early AD diagnosis. By clustering brain regions based on functional connectivity and node embedding, this layer improves the GNN's capability to capture complex brain network characteristics. We analyzed neuroimaging data from 383 participants, including both cognitively normal and preclinical AD individuals, using T1-weighted MRI, resting-state fMRI, and FBB-PET to construct brain graphs. Our results show that GNNs with the BA readout layer significantly outperform traditional models in predicting the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) score, demonstrating higher robustness and stability. The adaptive BA readout layer also offers enhanced interpretability by highlighting task-specific brain regions critical to cognitive functions impacted by AD. These findings suggest that our approach provides a valuable tool for the early diagnosis and analysis of Alzheimer's disease.

                arXiv:2410.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cortico-spinal neural pathway is fundamental for motor control and movement execution, and in humans it is typically studied using concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings. However, current approaches for capturing high-level and contextual connectivity between these recordings have important limitations. Here, we present a novel application of statistical dependence estimators based on orthonormal decomposition of density ratios to model the relationship between cortical and muscle oscillations. Our method extends from traditional scalar-valued measures by learning eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and projection spaces of density ratios from realizations of the signal, addressing the interpretability, scalability, and local temporal dependence of cortico-muscular connectivity. We experimentally demonstrate that eigenfunctions learned from cortico-muscular connectivity can accurately classify movements and subjects. Moreover, they reveal channel and temporal dependencies that confirm the activation of specific EEG channels during movement.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14800">Unlocking the Full Potential of High-Density Surface EMG: Novel Non-Invasive High-Yield Motor Unit Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decomposition of high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) signals into motor unit discharge patterns has become a powerful tool for investigating the neural control of movement, providing insights into motor neuron recruitment and discharge behavior. However, current algorithms, while very effective under certain conditions, face significant challenges in complex scenarios, as their accuracy and motor unit yield are highly dependent on anatomical differences among individuals. This can limit the number of decomposed motor units, particularly in challenging conditions. To address this issue, we recently introduced Swarm-Contrastive Decomposition (SCD), which dynamically adjusts the separation function based on the distribution of the data and prevents convergence to the same source. Initially applied to intramuscular EMG signals, SCD is here adapted for HD-sEMG signals. We demonstrated its ability to address key challenges faced by existing methods, particularly in identifying low-amplitude motor unit action potentials and effectively handling complex decomposition scenarios, like high-interference signals. We extensively validated SCD using simulated and experimental HD-sEMG recordings and compared it with current state-of-the-art decomposition methods under varying conditions, including different excitation levels, noise intensities, force profiles, sexes, and muscle groups. The proposed method consistently outperformed existing techniques in both the quantity of decoded motor units and the precision of their firing time identification. For instance, under certain experimental conditions, SCD detected more than three times as many motor units compared to previous methods, while also significantly improving accuracy. These advancements represent a major step forward in non-invasive EMG technology for studying motor unit activity in complex scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15018">Latency correction in sparse neuronal spike trains with overlapping global events</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: In Kreuz et al., J Neurosci Methods 381, 109703 (2022) two methods were proposed that perform latency correction, i.e., optimize the spike time alignment of sparse neuronal spike trains with well defined global spiking events. The first one based on direct shifts is fast but uses only partial latency information, while the other one makes use of the full information but relies on the computationally costly simulated annealing. Both methods reach their limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not sufficiently separated or even overlap.
  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages of the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency information as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift method instead of the much slower simulated annealing.
  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance, measured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not only on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit recordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the existing approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data. Due to its low computational demands, and in contrast to simulated annealing, it can also be applied to very large datasets.
  Conclusions: The new method generalizes and improves on the original method both in terms of accuracy and speed. Importantly, it is the only method that allows to disentangle global events with overlap.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15108">The shape of the brain's connections is predictive of cognitive performance: an explainable machine learning study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of the brain's white matter connections is relatively unexplored in diffusion MRI tractography analysis. While it is known that tract shape varies in populations and across the human lifespan, it is unknown if the variability in dMRI tractography-derived shape may relate to the brain's functional variability across individuals. This work explores the potential of leveraging tractography fiber cluster shape measures to predict subject-specific cognitive performance. We implement machine learning models to predict individual cognitive performance scores. We study a large-scale database from the HCP-YA study. We apply an atlas-based fiber cluster parcellation to the dMRI tractography of each individual. We compute 15 shape, microstructure, and connectivity features for each fiber cluster. Using these features as input, we train a total of 210 models to predict 7 different NIH Toolbox cognitive performance assessments. We apply an explainable AI technique, SHAP, to assess the importance of each fiber cluster for prediction. Our results demonstrate that shape measures are predictive of individual cognitive performance. The studied shape measures, such as irregularity, diameter, total surface area, volume, and branch volume, are as effective for prediction as microstructure and connectivity measures. The overall best-performing feature is a shape feature, irregularity, which describes how different a cluster's shape is from an idealized cylinder. Further interpretation using SHAP values suggest that fiber clusters with features highly predictive of cognitive ability are widespread throughout the brain, including fiber clusters from the superficial association, deep association, cerebellar, striatal, and projection pathways. This study demonstrates the strong potential of shape descriptors to enhance the study of the brain's white matter and its relationship to cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15433">Discriminating image representations with principal distortions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image representations (artificial or biological) are often compared in terms of their global geometry; however, representations with similar global structure can have strikingly different local geometries. Here, we propose a framework for comparing a set of image representations in terms of their local geometries. We quantify the local geometry of a representation using the Fisher information matrix, a standard statistical tool for characterizing the sensitivity to local stimulus distortions, and use this as a substrate for a metric on the local geometry in the vicinity of a base image. This metric may then be used to optimally differentiate a set of models, by finding a pair of "principal distortions" that maximize the variance of the models under this metric. We use this framework to compare a set of simple models of the early visual system, identifying a novel set of image distortions that allow immediate comparison of the models by visual inspection. In a second example, we apply our method to a set of deep neural network models and reveal differences in the local geometry that arise due to architecture and training types. These examples highlight how our framework can be used to probe for informative differences in local sensitivities between complex computational models, and suggest how it could be used to compare model representations with human perception.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16123">The role of spike-timing-dependent plasticity and random inputs in neurodegenerative diseases and neuromorphic systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal oscillations are related to symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The random inputs could affect such oscillations in the brain states that translate collective activities of neurons interconnected via synaptic connections. In this paper, we study coupled effects of channels and synaptic dynamics under the stochastic influence, together with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of healthy brain cells with applications to Parkinson's disease (PD). In particular, we investigate the effects of random inputs and input correlations in a subthalamic nucleus (STN) cell membrane potential model. Our numerical results show that the random inputs strongly affect the spiking activities of the STN neuron not only in the case of healthy cells but also in the case of PD cells in the presence of DBS treatment. The STDP increases the interspike interval (ISI) regularity of spike trains of the output neurons. However, the existence of a random refractory period and random input current in the system may substantially influence an increased irregularity of spike trains of the output neurons. Furthermore, the presence of the stochastic influence together with spike-timing-dependent plasticity could increase the correlation of the neurons. These effects would potentially contribute to the management of PD symptoms.

                arXiv:2410.16136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain processes dynamic natural stimuli remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Current dynamic neural encoding models either take stimuli as input but ignore shared variability in neural responses, or they model this variability by deriving latent embeddings from neural responses or behavior while ignoring the visual input. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic model that incorporates video inputs along with stimulus-independent latent factors to capture variability in neuronal responses, predicting a joint distribution for the entire population. After training and testing our model on mouse V1 neuronal responses, we found that it outperforms video-only models in terms of log-likelihood and achieves further improvements when conditioned on responses from other neurons. Furthermore, we find that the learned latent factors strongly correlate with mouse behavior, although the model was trained without behavior data.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) vessels is critical to connecting major circulations of the brain. The topology of the vascular structure is clinical significance to evaluate the risk, severity of the neuro-vascular diseases. The CoW has two representative angiographic imaging modalities, computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). TopCow24 provided 125 paired CTA-MRA dataset for the analysis of CoW. To explore both CTA and MRA images in a unified framework to learn the inherent topology of Cow, we construct the universal dataset via independent intensity preprocess, followed by joint resampling and normarlization. Then, we utilize the topology-aware loss to enhance the topology completeness of the CoW and the discrimination between different classes. A complementary topology-aware refinement is further conducted to enhance the connectivity within the same class. Our method was evaluated on all the three tasks and two modalities, achieving competitive results. In the final test phase of TopCow24 Challenge, we achieved the second place in the CTA-Seg-Task, the third palce in the CTA-Box-Task, the first place in the CTA-Edg-Task, the second place in the MRA-Seg-Task, the third palce in the MRA-Box-Task, the second place in the MRA-Edg-Task.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17952">Multi-centre normative brain mapping of intracranial EEG lifespan patterns in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.17952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Understanding healthy human brain function is crucial to identify and map pathological tissue within it. Whilst previous studies have mapped intracranial EEG (icEEG) from non-epileptogenic brain regions, these maps do not consider the effects of age and sex. Further, most existing work on icEEG has often suffered from a small sample size due to the modality's invasive nature. Here, we substantially increase the subject sample size compared to existing literature, to create a multi-centre, normative map of brain activity which additionally considers the effects of age, sex and recording hospital.
  Methods: Using interictal icEEG recordings from n = 502 subjects originating from 15 centres, we constructed a normative map of non-pathological brain activity by regressing age and sex on relative band power in five frequency bands, whilst accounting for the hospital effect.
  Results: Recording hospital significantly impacted normative icEEG maps in all frequency bands, and age was a more influential predictor of band power than sex. The age effect varied by frequency band, but no spatial patterns were observed at the region-specific level. Certainty about regression coefficients was also frequency band specific and moderately impacted by sample size.
  Conclusion: The concept of a normative map is well-established in neuroscience research and particularly relevant to the icEEG modality, which does not allow healthy control baselines. Our key results regarding the hospital site and age effect guide future work utilising normative maps in icEEG.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07059">Differentiable Optimization of Similarity Scores Between Models and Brains</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.07059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do we know if two systems - biological or artificial - process information in a similar way? Similarity measures such as linear regression, Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), Normalized Bures Similarity (NBS), and angular Procrustes distance, are often used to quantify this similarity. However, it is currently unclear what drives high similarity scores and even what constitutes a "good" score. Here, we introduce a novel tool to investigate these questions by differentiating through similarity measures to directly maximize the score. Surprisingly, we find that high similarity scores do not guarantee encoding task-relevant information in a manner consistent with neural data; and this is particularly acute for CKA and even some variations of cross-validated and regularized linear regression. We find no consistent threshold for a good similarity score - it depends on both the measure and the dataset. In addition, synthetic datasets optimized to maximize similarity scores initially learn the highest variance principal component of the target dataset, but some methods like angular Procrustes capture lower variance dimensions much earlier than methods like CKA. To shed light on this, we mathematically derive the sensitivity of CKA, angular Procrustes, and NBS to the variance of principal component dimensions, and explain the emphasis CKA places on high variance components. Finally, by jointly optimizing multiple similarity measures, we characterize their allowable ranges and reveal that some similarity measures are more constraining than others. While current measures offer a seemingly straightforward way to quantify the similarity between neural systems, our work underscores the need for careful interpretation. We hope the tools we developed will be used by practitioners to better understand current and future similarity measures.

                arXiv:2408.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped by the brain's structural organization. However, the theoretical principles explaining how this physical architecture governs its function remain elusive. Here, we propose an algebraic quantum mechanics (AQM) framework in which the functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system defined on the underlying directed multigraph. These equilibrium states, derived from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states formalism, capture the contribution of each neuron to the overall information flow. We apply this framework to the connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, providing a detailed description of the KMS states, exploring their functional implications, and predicting functional networks based on anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, our approach reveals functional circuits predicted by the topology of the connectome and illuminates on the mechanisms linking structure to function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11459">Du-IN: Discrete units-guided mask modeling for decoding speech from Intracranial Neural signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invasive brain-computer interfaces with Electrocorticography (ECoG) have shown promise for high-performance speech decoding in medical applications, but less damaging methods like intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) remain underexplored. With rapid advances in representation learning, leveraging abundant recordings to enhance speech decoding is increasingly attractive. However, popular methods often pre-train temporal models based on brain-level tokens, overlooking that brain activities in different regions are highly desynchronized during tasks. Alternatively, they pre-train spatial-temporal models based on channel-level tokens but fail to evaluate them on challenging tasks like speech decoding, which requires intricate processing in specific language-related areas. To address this issue, we collected a well-annotated Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset targeting language-related brain networks from 12 subjects. Using this benchmark, we developed the Du-IN model, which extracts contextual embeddings based on region-level tokens through discrete codex-guided mask modeling. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 61-word classification task, surpassing all baselines. Model comparisons and ablation studies reveal that our design choices, including (i) temporal modeling based on region-level tokens by utilizing 1D depthwise convolution to fuse channels in the lateral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and (ii) self-supervision through discrete codex-guided mask modeling, significantly contribute to this performance. Overall, our approach -- inspired by neuroscience findings and capitalizing on region-level representations from specific brain regions -- is suitable for invasive brain modeling and represents a promising neuro-inspired AI approach in brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: This study introduces BrainTransformers, an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) implemented using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Our key contributions include: (1) designing SNN-compatible Transformer components such as SNNMatmul, SNNSoftmax, and SNNSiLU; (2) implementing an SNN approximation of the SiLU activation function; and (3) developing a Synapsis module to simulate synaptic plasticity. Our 3-billion parameter model, BrainTransformers-3B-Chat, demonstrates competitive performance across various benchmarks, including MMLU (63.2), BBH (54.1), ARC-C (54.3), and GSM8K (76.3), while potentially offering improved energy efficiency and biological plausibility. The model employs a three-stage training approach, including SNN-specific neuronal synaptic plasticity training. This research opens new avenues for brain-like AI systems in natural language processing and neuromorphic computing. Future work will focus on hardware optimization, developing specialized SNN fine-tuning tools, and exploring practical applications in energy-efficient computing environments.

                arXiv:2410.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of materials and the development of the economy have led to the flourishing of the logistics industry, but have also caused certain pollution. The research on GVRP (Green vehicle routing problem) for planning vehicle routes during transportation to reduce pollution is also increasingly developing. Further exploration is needed on how to integrate these research findings with real vehicles. This paper establishes an energy consumption model using real electric vehicles, fully considering the physical characteristics of each component of the vehicle. To avoid the distortion of energy consumption models affecting the results of route planning. The energy consumption model also incorporates the effects of vehicle start/stop, speed, distance, and load on energy consumption. In addition, a load first speed optimization algorithm was proposed, which selects the most suitable speed between every two delivery points while planning the route. In order to further reduce energy consumption while meeting the time window. Finally, an improved Adaptive Genetic Algorithm is used to solve for the most energy-efficient route. The experiment shows that the results of using this speed optimization algorithm are generally more energy-efficient than those without using this algorithm. The average energy consumption of constant speed delivery at different speeds is 17.16% higher than that after speed optimization. Provided a method that is closer to reality and easier for logistics companies to use. It also enriches the GVRP model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15293">Fractional-order spike-timing-dependent gradient descent for multi-layer spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accumulated detailed knowledge about the neuronal activities in human brains has brought more attention to bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs). In contrast to non-spiking deep neural networks (DNNs), SNNs can encode and transmit spatiotemporal information more efficiently by exploiting biologically realistic and low-power event-driven neuromorphic architectures. However, the supervised learning of SNNs still remains a challenge because the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of connected spiking neurons is difficult to implement and interpret in existing backpropagation learning schemes. This paper proposes a fractional-order spike-timing-dependent gradient descent (FO-STDGD) learning model by considering a derived nonlinear activation function that describes the relationship between the quasi-instantaneous firing rate and the temporal membrane potentials of nonleaky integrate-and-fire neurons. The training strategy can be generalized to any fractional orders between 0 and 2 since the FO-STDGD incorporates the fractional gradient descent method into the calculation of spike-timing-dependent loss gradients. The proposed FO-STDGD model is tested on the MNIST and DVS128 Gesture datasets and its accuracy under different network structure and fractional orders is analyzed. It can be found that the classification accuracy increases as the fractional order increases, and specifically, the case of fractional order 1.9 improves by 155% relative to the case of fractional order 1 (traditional gradient descent). In addition, our scheme demonstrates the state-of-the-art computational efficacy for the same SNN structure and training epochs.

                arXiv:2410.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the learning of new tasks causes the catastrophic forgetting of old tasks. Existing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including those using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Hebbian Learning typically update their weights linearly with experience i.e., independently of their current strength. This contrasts with biological neurons, which at intermediate strengths are very plastic, but consolidate with Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) once they reach a certain strength. We hypothesize this mechanism might help mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Sigmoidal Neuronal Adaptive Plasticity (SNAP) an artificial approximation to Long-Term Potentiation for ANNs by having the weights follow a sigmoidal growth behaviour allowing the weights to consolidate and stabilize when they reach sufficiently large or small values. We then compare SNAP to linear weight growth and exponential weight growth and see that SNAP completely prevents the forgetting of previous tasks for Hebbian Learning but not for SGD-base learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in memory technologies, devices and materials have shown great potential for integration into neuromorphic electronic systems. However, a significant gap remains between the development of these materials and the realization of large-scale, fully functional systems. One key challenge is determining which devices and materials are best suited for specific functions and how they can be paired with CMOS circuitry. To address this, we introduce TEXEL, a mixed-signal neuromorphic architecture designed to explore the integration of on-chip learning circuits and novel two- and three-terminal devices. TEXEL serves as an accessible platform to bridge the gap between CMOS-based neuromorphic computation and the latest advancements in emerging devices. In this paper, we demonstrate the readiness of TEXEL for device integration through comprehensive chip measurements and simulations. TEXEL provides a practical system for testing bio-inspired learning algorithms alongside emerging devices, establishing a tangible link between brain-inspired computation and cutting-edge device research.

                arXiv:2410.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones which can swarm and loiter in a certain area cost hundreds of dollars, but mosquitos can do the same and are essentially worthless. To control swarms of low-cost robots, researchers may end up spending countless hours brainstorming robot configurations and policies to ``organically" create behaviors which do not need expensive sensors and perception. Existing research explores the possible emergent behaviors in swarms of robots with only a binary sensor and a simple but hand-picked controller structure. Even agents in this highly limited sensing, actuation, and computational capability class can exhibit relatively complex global behaviors such as aggregation, milling, and dispersal, but finding the local interaction rules that enable more collective behaviors remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the feasibility of training spiking neural networks to find those local interaction rules that result in particular emergent behaviors. In this paper, we focus on simulating a specific milling behavior already known to be producible using very simple binary sensing and acting agents. To do this, we use evolutionary algorithms to evolve not only the parameters (the weights, biases, and delays) of a spiking neural network, but also its structure. To create a baseline, we also show an evolutionary search strategy over the parameters for the incumbent hand-picked binary controller structure. Our simulations show that spiking neural networks can be evolved in binary sensing agents to form a mill.

                arXiv:2410.14685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our proposed approach for active tracking to increase the autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using event cameras, low-energy imaging sensors that offer significant advantages in speed and dynamic range. The proposed tracking controller is designed to respond to visual feedback from the mounted event sensor, adjusting the drone movements to follow the target. To leverage the full motion capabilities of a quadrotor and the unique properties of event sensors, we propose an end-to-end deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that maps raw sensor data from event streams directly to control actions for the UAV. To learn an optimal policy under highly variable and challenging conditions, we opt for a simulation environment with domain randomization for effective transfer to real-world environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in challenging scenarios, including fast-moving targets and changing lighting conditions, which result in improved generalization capabilities.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14735">Agent Skill Acquisition for Large Language Models via CycleQD</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large language models to acquire specific skills remains a challenging endeavor. Conventional training approaches often struggle with data distribution imbalances and inadequacies in objective functions that do not align well with task-specific performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CycleQD, a novel approach that leverages the Quality Diversity framework through a cyclic adaptation of the algorithm, along with a model merging based crossover and an SVD-based mutation. In CycleQD, each task's performance metric is alternated as the quality measure while the others serve as the behavioral characteristics. This cyclic focus on individual tasks allows for concentrated effort on one task at a time, eliminating the need for data ratio tuning and simplifying the design of the objective function. Empirical results from AgentBench indicate that applying CycleQD to LLAMA3-8B-INSTRUCT based models not only enables them to surpass traditional fine-tuning methods in coding, operating systems, and database tasks, but also achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO, which potentially contains much more parameters, across these domains. Crucially, this enhanced performance is achieved while retaining robust language capabilities, as evidenced by its performance on widely adopted language benchmark tasks. We highlight the key design choices in CycleQD, detailing how these contribute to its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is general and can be applied to image segmentation models, highlighting its applicability across different domains.

                arXiv:2410.14759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks beyond the classical formulation over compact domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we derive universal approximation results for neural networks within function spaces over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, e.g., weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Furthermore, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.

                arXiv:2410.15296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) excels at learning from noisy and generalized patterns, conducting logical inferences, and providing interpretable reasoning. Comprising a 'neuro' component for feature extraction and a 'symbolic' component for decision-making, neuro-symbolic AI has yet to fully benefit from efficient hardware accelerators. Additionally, current hardware struggles to accommodate applications requiring dynamic resource allocation between these two components. To address these challenges-and mitigate the typical data-transfer bottleneck of classical Von Neumann architectures-we propose a ferroelectric charge-domain compute-in-memory (CiM) array as the foundational processing element for neuro-symbolic AI. This array seamlessly handles both the critical multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations of the 'neuro' workload and the parallel associative search operations of the 'symbolic' workload. To enable this approach, we introduce an innovative 1FeFET-1C cell, combining a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) with a capacitor. This design, overcomes the destructive sensing limitations of DRAM in CiM applications, while capable of capitalizing decades of DRAM expertise with a similar cell structure as DRAM, achieves high immunity against FeFET variation-crucial for neuro-symbolic AI-and demonstrates superior energy efficiency. The functionalities of our design have been successfully validated through SPICE simulations and prototype fabrication and testing. Our hardware platform has been benchmarked in executing typical neuro-symbolic AI reasoning tasks, showing over 2x improvement in latency and 1000x improvement in energy efficiency compared to GPU-based implementations.

                arXiv:2410.15689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), renowned for their low power consumption, brain-inspired architecture, and spatio-temporal representation capabilities, have garnered considerable attention in recent years. Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored.
  In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.

                arXiv:2410.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to solving convex optimization problems by leveraging the fact that, under certain regularity conditions, any set of primal or dual variables satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is necessary and sufficient for optimality. Similar to Theory-Trained Neural Networks (TTNNs), the parameters of the convex optimization problem are input to the neural network, and the expected outputs are the optimal primal and dual variables. A choice for the loss function in this case is a loss, which we refer to as the KKT Loss, that measures how well the network's outputs satisfy the KKT conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a linear program as an example. For this problem, we observe that minimizing the KKT Loss alone outperforms training the network with a weighted sum of the KKT Loss and a Data Loss (the mean-squared error between the ground truth optimal solutions and the network's output). Moreover, minimizing only the Data Loss yields inferior results compared to those obtained by minimizing the KKT Loss. While the approach is promising, the obtained primal and dual solutions are not sufficiently close to the ground truth optimal solutions. In the future, we aim to develop improved models to obtain solutions closer to the ground truth and extend the approach to other problem classes.

                arXiv:2410.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have scaled neural networks to unprecedented sizes, achieving remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these large-scale models on resource-constrained devices poses significant challenges due to substantial storage and computational requirements. Neural network pruning has emerged as an effective technique to mitigate these limitations by reducing model size and complexity. In this paper, we introduce an intuitive and interpretable pruning method based on activation statistics, rooted in information theory and statistical analysis. Our approach leverages the statistical properties of neuron activations to identify and remove weights with minimal contributions to neuron outputs. Specifically, we build a distribution of weight contributions across the dataset and utilize its parameters to guide the pruning process. Furthermore, we propose a Pruning-aware Training strategy that incorporates an additional regularization term to enhance the effectiveness of our pruning method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and network architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms several baseline and state-of-the-art pruning techniques.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks of varying architectures are generally paired with affine transformation at the core. However, we find dot product neurons with global influence less interpretable as compared to local influence of euclidean distance (as used in Radial Basis Function Network). In this work, we explore the generalization of dot product neurons to $l^p$-norm, metrics, and beyond. We find that metrics as transform performs similarly to affine transform when used in MultiLayer Perceptron or Convolutional Neural Network. Moreover, we explore various properties of Metrics, compare it with Affine, and present multiple cases where metrics seem to provide better interpretability. We develop an interpretable local dictionary based Neural Networks and use it to understand and reject adversarial examples.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07996">Reset It and Forget It: Relearning Last-Layer Weights Improves Continual and Transfer Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.07996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work identifies a simple pre-training mechanism that leads to representations exhibiting better continual and transfer learning. This mechanism -- the repeated resetting of weights in the last layer, which we nickname "zapping" -- was originally designed for a meta-continual-learning procedure, yet we show it is surprisingly applicable in many settings beyond both meta-learning and continual learning. In our experiments, we wish to transfer a pre-trained image classifier to a new set of classes, in a few shots. We show that our zapping procedure results in improved transfer accuracy and/or more rapid adaptation in both standard fine-tuning and continual learning settings, while being simple to implement and computationally efficient. In many cases, we achieve performance on par with state of the art meta-learning without needing the expensive higher-order gradients, by using a combination of zapping and sequential learning. An intuitive explanation for the effectiveness of this zapping procedure is that representations trained with repeated zapping learn features that are capable of rapidly adapting to newly initialized classifiers. Such an approach may be considered a computationally cheaper type of, or alternative to, meta-learning rapidly adaptable features with higher-order gradients. This adds to recent work on the usefulness of resetting neural network parameters during training, and invites further investigation of this mechanism.

Abstract: We introduce a simulation environment to facilitate research into emergent collective behaviour, with a focus on replicating the dynamics of ant colonies. By leveraging real-world data, the environment simulates a target ant trail that a controllable agent must learn to replicate, using sensory data observed by the target ant. This work aims to contribute to the neuroevolution of models for collective behaviour, focusing on evolving neural architectures that encode domain-specific behaviours in the network topology. By evolving models that can be modified and studied in a controlled environment, we can uncover the necessary conditions required for collective behaviours to emerge. We hope this environment will be useful to those studying the role of interactions in emergent behaviour within collective systems.

	<p>Background: Uremic toxins resulting from chronic kidney disease (CKD) can cause cognitive and emotional disorders, as well as cardiovascular diseases. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol are notable uremic toxins found in patients with CKD. However, few studies have investigated whether reducing uremic toxins can alleviate cognitive and emotional disorders associated with CKD. Methods: We studied the effects of AST-120, which lowers IS levels, through behavioral tests, local field potentials, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and histological experiments in a 5/6 nephrectomy CKD model. Results: We confirmed AST-120&amp;amp;rsquo;s effectiveness in CKD by measuring serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and IS levels and performing renal tissue staining. Behavioral phenotypes indicated an alleviation of cognitive and anxiety disorders following AST-120 treatment in CKD-induced rats, which was further validated through local field potentials and field excitatory postsynaptic potential recordings. Double immunofluorescence staining for aquaporin-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the hippocampus of CKD rats treated with AST-120 showed reduced coexpression. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic effects of AST-120 in lowering IS levels and improving cognitive and emotional impairments associated with CKD.</p>

                <p>In the presence of temporally organized stimuli, there is a tendency to entrain to the beat, even at the neurological level. Previous research has shown that when adults listen to rhythmic stimuli and are asked to imagine the beat, their neural responses are the same as when the beat is physically accented. The current study explores the neural processing of simple beat structures where the beat is physically accented or inferred from a previously presented physically accented beat structure in a passive listening context. We further explore the associations of these neural correlates with behavioral and self-reported measures of musicality. Fifty-seven participants completed a passive listening EEG paradigm, a behavioral rhythm discrimination task, and a self-reported musicality questionnaire. Our findings suggest that when the beat is physically accented, individuals demonstrate distinct neural responses to the beat in the beta (13&ndash;23&nbsp;Hz) and gamma (24&ndash;50&nbsp;Hz) frequency bands. We further find that the neural marker in the beta band is associated with individuals&rsquo; self-reported musical perceptual abilities. Overall, this study provides insights into the neural correlates of spontaneous beat processing and its connections with musicality.</p>

                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common focal epilepsy in adults, and people with TLE exhibit higher rates of reproductive endocrine dysfunction. Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons regulate reproductive function in mammals by regulating gonadotropin secretion from the anterior pituitary. Previous research demonstrated GnRH neuron hyperexcitability in both sexes in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE. Fast-inactivating A-type (<I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB>) and delayed rectifier K-type (<I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB>) K<sup>+</sup> currents play critical roles in modulating neuronal excitability, including in GnRH neurons. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GnRH neuron hyperexcitability is associated with reduced <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> conductances. At 2&nbsp;months after IHKA or control saline injection, when IHKA mice exhibit chronic epilepsy, we recorded GnRH neuron excitability, <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB>, and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. GnRH neurons from both IHKA male and diestrus female GnRH-GFP mice exhibited hyperexcitability compared with controls. In IHKA males, although maximum <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> current density was increased, <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> recovery from inactivation was significantly slower, consistent with a hyperexcitability phenotype. In IHKA females, however, both <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> were unchanged. Sex differences were not observed in <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> or <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> properties in controls, but IHKA mice exhibited sex effects in <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> properties. These results indicate that although the emergent phenotype of increased GnRH neuron excitability is similar in IHKA males and diestrus females, the underlying mechanisms are distinct. This study thus highlights sex-specific changes in voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents in GnRH neurons in a mouse model of TLE and suggesting potential sex differences in GnRH neuron ion channel properties.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0343-24.2024?rss=1">The Orbitofrontal Cortex Is Required for Learned Modulation of Innate Olfactory Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals have evolved innate responses to cues including social, food, and predator odors. In the natural environment, animals are faced with choices that involve balancing risk and reward where innate significance may be at odds with internal need. The ability to update the value of a cue through learning is essential for navigating changing and uncertain environments. However, the mechanisms involved in this modulation are not well defined in mammals. We have established a new olfactory assay that challenges a thirsty mouse to choose an aversive odor over an attractive odor in foraging for water, thus overriding their innate behavioral response to odor. Innately, mice prefer the attractive odor port over the aversive odor port. However, decreasing the probability of water at the attractive port leads mice to prefer the aversive port, reflecting a learned override of the innate response to the odors. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a fourth-order olfactory brain area, involved in flexible value association, with behaviorally relevant outputs throughout the limbic system. We performed optogenetic and chemogenetic silencing experiments that demonstrate the OFC is necessary for this learned modulation of innate aversion to odor. Further, we characterized odor evoked c-fos expression in learned and control mice and found significant suppression of activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septum, and central and medial amygdala. These findings reveal that the OFC is necessary for the learned override of innate behavior and may signal to limbic structures to modulate innate response to odor.</p>

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                Background Prediabetes, a reversible condition before the onset of diabetes, is a significant concern in healthcare globally. The global prediabetes epidemic has emerged and has considerably impacted health expenditures. Various risk factors play important roles in the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. Intensive lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes progression. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of prediabetes state of Medan in August 2023. Methods The sample consisted of 89 participants. This was an analytical cross-sectional study in the community that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The determination of prediabetes is based on the results of blood tests, namely, the examination of fasting blood sugar levels (FBGL), 2-hour postprandial oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C). Other examinations included lipid profiling (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Data processing was performed using SPSS via univariate and bivariate analyses (chi-square test). Results Of the 89 participants, the prevalence of prediabetes based on HbA1c, FBGL and 2-hours OGTT levels was 28.1%, 50.6%, and 28.1%, respectively. 82% of the participants were female, and 53.9% were overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI). The risk factors for prediabetes were age >64 years, female, physical inactivity, and diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg (p<0.05). Other risk factors such age <45-64 years, consumption of vegetables/fruits, BMI, HDL, LDL, trygliceride, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, achantosis nigricans, and waist-hip circumference did not associate significantly (p>0.05). Conclusion This study found that the prevalence of prediabetes was 67.4% in Medan. Age >64 years, female, physical inactivity, and diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg were the most important risk factors for prediabetes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1261/v1?src=rss">The most common neonatal presentations to the pediatric emergency department [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The first 28 days of life are considered the neonatal period, when pediatric health is most vulnerable. While crises can undoubtedly arise during this time, many ED or urgent care visits could be avoided with sufficient preventive hospital care during the newborn period and suitable follow-up with a primary care physician. The use of emergency rooms for non-urgent care could be the cause of rising healthcare costs and ineffective resource use. Purpose This study aimed to determine the presenting features, management, and disposition of neonatal attendance in the emergency department. Methods This was a retrospective observational cross-sectional study of medical records identified via the emergency department of neonatal visits (≤28 days) to King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Khobar, Saudi Arabia, over 12 months (2021–2022). The Chi-square test was performed to compare various etiologies, with a 5% significance level. Results A total of 649 neonate visited pediatric emergency department with a mean age of 15.5 ± 7.4 days and almost equal distribution of the gender. The most common presentation was upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (26.8%), followed by physiological jaundice (20.2%), and colic (14%). A total of 205 (31.6%) neonates who visited the ED showed significant laboratory findings. Seventy-nine patients (12.2%) presenting with PED were admitted to the hospital. Conclusion Healthcare systems must devise strategies to address the growing number of non-urgent visits to emergency departments in a more efficient manner, while simultaneously reallocating scarce resources to higher-acuity cases. This emphasizes the necessity of health personnel educating caregivers. It’s also critical that medical professionals understand the common ailments that affect newborns and are skilled at correctly identifying ailments that could indicate a serious pathology.

                Introduction Antiseptic and antibacterial solutions are increasingly used in the treatment of various types of wounds. The successful stabilization of wounds using a combination Sodium Hypochlorite/Hypochlorous acid (NaOCl/HOCl) or superoxidized solution (SOS) has been reported, serving as an effective solution without irritating mammal cells and without posing a carcinogenic hazard. Presently, no systematic review or meta-analysis is available that compares the effectiveness of these antiseptic solutions. The present study aims to investigate the role of NaOCl/HOCl in the treatment of wounds. Methods The systematic review with extended to network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using NaOCl/HOCl, povidone-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexamethylene biguanide, alcohol, and silver compared with normal saline. The primary outcome was wound healing. Using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), the direct and indirect comparisons were conducted with the probability of selecting the best treatment. Results A total of 507 studies were identified from PUBMED and SCOPUS databases, and 64 articles were duplicates. Among 29 studies included, 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. NaOCl/HOCl had a higher chance of wound healing 1.07-1.30 times compared with all the regimens. NaOCl/HOCl has the probability of providing the best treatment, followed by silver and octenidine with SUCRAs of 36.9, 23.1, and 21.8, respectively. Conclusions NaOCl/HOCl ranks first and proves to have the highest efficacy, followed by silver, octenidine, and PHMB for treatment.

                Hydatid disease is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus and is found globally. Although the liver and lungs are the most prevalent sites of involvement, sub-cutaneous hydatid cysts are rare especially in the primary occurrence. Sub-cutaneous hydatid cysts usually are noticed as slow growing, painless, and mobile masses beneath the overlying skin which is usually normal and are generally found on the trunk and proximal extremities. To the best of our knowledge, very few cases of primary subcutaneous hydatid cysts of the thigh have been documented. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman from a rural setting, who has a large, painless swelling on her thigh. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of a primary subcutaneous hydatid cyst, which is an atypical presentation of the disease. The entire lesion was excised surgically without any evidence of recurrence for a long period postoperatively. This case illustrates the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis and the importance of early surgical management in these cases.

                Introduction Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is the material of choice for pulp therapy. However, Ca(OH)2 has drawbacks such as toxicity, poor sealing, and tunnel defect formation. Alternative materials have been developed to provide more biocompatible materials with better dentin formation ability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of composites containing gelatin (G), chitosan (CH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and Ca(OH)2, namely G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 (Extended data) on inflammation of the dental pulp (expression of COX-2, PGP 9.5, TNF-α, and neutrophil number). Materials and methods A total of 16 Wistar rat models of acute pulp injury were prepared and divided into two groups, treatment and control, 8 with each. In the treatment group, we applied a pulp-capping material using G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. On the 1st and 3rd days, rats were sacrificed. Tissue samples from 4 rats in each group were processed for histological preparation. COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α were observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and neutrophil numbers were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Image analysis of COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α expression was performed using ImageJ software. Results The results showed a decrease in COX-2 expression, but not significantly while PGP 9.5 and TNF-α expression were significantly higher than those in the control group. Neutrophil numbers were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion The G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 composite material may have potential as an exposed pulp medicament by reducing inflammation (COX-2 expression and number of neutrophils) and increasing the regeneration factor (TNF-α expression) and nerve (PGP 9.5 expression).

                Abstract Background Moldova strives for universal health coverage (UHC) and considers health technology assessment (HTA) an important policy instrument to inform the choice of services that should be covered to progressively realize UHC. It plays a key role in determining which technologies are coved, considering various dimensions often including cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and feasibility. This paper reports on work undertaken to develop a roadmap for HTA implementation, using evidence-informed deliberative processes (EDPs) as the guiding framework. Methods Between 2020 and 2022, we undertook several activities that informed the roadmap. We conducted a needs assessment and an assessment of European HTA best practices using a combination of desk research, interviews and surveys. We then conducted a document review of six selected HTA systems, complimented by expert interviews from three neighbouring countries. Results The roadmap provided a suggested HTA process, which included instructions on how to execute the different steps of the EDP framework to enhance the legitimacy of HTA-informed decision-making. The roadmap encompasses several aspects such as how to organize stakeholder involvement, how to identify and operationalize decision criteria, and how to make the decision process transparent. Guidance was given to the country on establishing a legal framework for HTA; a communication strategy; strengthening capacity and leveraging HTA expertise. The country was also given tailored advice on the positioning of the HTA-agency, first as an entity within the Ministry of Health or the National Agency of Public Health but with the long-term vision for it to be independent of any state institution. Conclusions Despite several challenges, including a partial disruption because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development of the roadmap for HTA implementation was completed and agreed upon by the Ministry of Health in Moldova. This work has helped motivate and support the country in HTA institutionalization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-415/v2?src=rss">Knowledge of misconduct amid North-African post-graduate dental students: A cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of misconduct (KoM) level in this population is lacking. This study assessed KoM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey with 11 questions on KoM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoM. Results The mean±SD KoM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). The two groups of PGDSs with low (n=91) and acceptable or excellent (n=15) KoM levels showed comparable characteristics in terms of age, sex, discipline, post-graduate-level, experience-level, graduation-status, and survey-response modality. Conclusion This study identified a low-level of KoM among North-African PGDSs. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoM in this population.

                <p>by Lachlan Webb, Andrew JK Phillips, James A Roberts</p>

Sleep patterns in infancy and early childhood vary greatly and change rapidly during development. In adults, sleep patterns are regulated by interactions between neuronal populations in the brainstem and hypothalamus, driven by the circadian and sleep homeostatic processes. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the sleep patterns and their variations across infancy and early childhood are poorly understood. We investigated whether a well-established mathematical model for sleep regulation in adults can model infant sleep characteristics and explain the physiological basis for developmental changes. By fitting longitudinal sleep data spanning 2 to 540 days after birth, we inferred parameter trajectories across age. We found that the developmental changes in sleep patterns are consistent with a faster accumulation and faster clearance of sleep homeostatic pressure in infancy and a weaker circadian rhythm in early infancy. We also find greater sensitivity to phase-delaying effects of light in infancy and early childhood. These findings reveal fundamental mechanisms that regulate sleep in infancy and early childhood. Given the critical role of sleep in healthy neurodevelopment, this framework could be used to pinpoint pathophysiological mechanisms and identify ways to improve sleep quality in early life.

                <p>by Anika T. Löwe, Léo Touzo, Paul S. Muhle-Karbe, Andrew M. Saxe, Christopher Summerfield, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Humans sometimes have an insight that leads to a sudden and drastic performance improvement on the task they are working on. Sudden strategy adaptations are often linked to insights, considered to be a unique aspect of human cognition tied to complex processes such as creativity or meta-cognitive reasoning. Here, we take a learning perspective and ask whether insight-like behaviour can occur in simple artificial neural networks, even when the models only learn to form input-output associations through gradual gradient descent. We compared learning dynamics in humans and regularised neural networks in a perceptual decision task that included a hidden regularity to solve the task more efficiently. Our results show that only some humans discover this regularity, whose behaviour was marked by a sudden and abrupt strategy switch that reflects an aha-moment. Notably, we find that simple neural networks with a gradual learning rule and a constant learning rate closely mimicked behavioural characteristics of human insight-like switches, exhibiting delay of insight, suddenness and selective occurrence in only some networks. Analyses of network architectures and learning dynamics revealed that insight-like behaviour crucially depended on a regularised gating mechanism and noise added to gradient updates, which allowed the networks to accumulate “silent knowledge” that is initially suppressed by regularised gating. This suggests that insight-like behaviour can arise from gradual learning in simple neural networks, where it reflects the combined influences of noise, gating and regularisation. These results have potential implications for more complex systems, such as the brain, and guide the way for future insight research.

                <p>by Xubin Zheng, Dian Meng, Duo Chen, Wan-Ki Wong, Ka-Ho To, Lei Zhu, JiaFei Wu, Yining Liang, Kwong-Sak Leung, Man-Hon Wong, Lixin Cheng</p>

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by an exaggerated immune response to pathogens, leading to organ damage and high mortality rates in the intensive care unit. Although deep learning has achieved impressive performance on prediction and classification tasks in medicine, it requires large amounts of data and lacks explainability, which hinder its application to sepsis diagnosis. We introduce a deep learning framework, called scCaT, which blends the capsulating architecture with Transformer to develop a sepsis diagnostic model using single-cell RNA sequencing data and transfers it to bulk RNA data. The capsulating architecture effectively groups genes into capsules based on biological functions, which provides explainability in encoding gene expressions. The Transformer serves as a decoder to classify sepsis patients and controls. Our model achieves high accuracy with an AUROC of 0.93 on the single-cell test set and an average AUROC of 0.98 on seven bulk RNA cohorts. Additionally, the capsules can recognize different cell types and distinguish sepsis from control samples based on their biological pathways. This study presents a novel approach for learning gene modules and transferring the model to other data types, offering potential benefits in diagnosing rare diseases with limited subjects.

                <p>by David R. Quiroga-Martinez, Gemma Fernández Rubio, Leonardo Bonetti, Kriti G. Achyutuni, Athina Tzovara, Robert T. Knight, Peter Vuust</p>

Vividly imagining a song or a melody is a skill that many people accomplish with relatively little effort. However, we are only beginning to understand how the brain represents, holds, and manipulates these musical “thoughts.” Here, we decoded perceived and imagined melodies from magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain data (<i>N</i> = 71) to characterize their neural representation. We found that, during perception, auditory regions represent the sensory properties of individual sounds. In contrast, a widespread network including fronto-parietal cortex, hippocampus, basal nuclei, and sensorimotor regions hold the melody as an abstract unit during both perception and imagination. Furthermore, the mental manipulation of a melody systematically changes its neural representation, reflecting volitional control of auditory images. Our work sheds light on the nature and dynamics of auditory representations, informing future research on neural decoding of auditory imagination.

                Background Several students use hostel facilities offered by their colleges and universities while pursuing higher education. A crucial change is witnessed in their food habits during their stay at the campus, which is vastly different from their home experience. Method The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand the food choices of university students while following the qualitative research methodology and the phenomenological approach. The snowball sampling method is applied to select participants for the study. We selected twenty-six undergraduate and postgraduate students pursuing programs in technical and health science from a private university at Udupi with residence in the university campus for two to four years. Interviews with candidates were conducted online and audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results The transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to obtain themes, which were then conceptualized to develop the model based on the theory of planned behaviour. The duration of their stay on campus allowed students to gain a perspective on the food events and the food they consumed at the university dining facility (UDF) guided by factors, such as taste, price, availability of time(during academic activity), accessibility to healthy food, academic stress and lack of knowledge on nutrition. Two factors emerged from the interviews, one, there was no display in the dining facility about the nutritional value of the food served; and, second, students preferred to dine out on unhealthy food rather than at the university because food from outside the campus, even though unhealthy, was easier on the pocket. Conclusion The study provides insights into the role of UDF in serving healthy and nutritional food to students for better health and improved academic performance. This work brings to light the relationship between students’ food choices and their impact on academic performance.

                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Background The global challenge of the novel coronavirus has led to an unprecedented downturn, adversely affecting the health and mental wellbeing of communities worldwide. The objective of this study is to assess mental health and psychological distress levels within the general population of Peshawar, Pakistan amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 715 residents of Peshawar, Pakistan. The questionnaire collected data on demographics, socioeconomic status, and residential area. The Modified K10 Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to measure mental well-being. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, were calculated, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM, USA, version 22). Results A total of 715 responses were collected. The comprehensive psychological distress score was identified as 25.55, signifying moderate stress levels. Among the respondents, 53.3% were females, 46.7% had completed a bachelor’s degree, 41% were employed, 78.7% were single, 93.1% were non-smokers, and 69.4% resided in urban areas. The study revealed that both gender (p=0.001) employment status (p=0.018) were linked to a more pronounced psychological impact of the outbreak. Conclusions This study highlights age, gender, employment status, and urbanization as influential factors contributing to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak. As we face the challenges of the new normal, it is essential for policymakers to address these mental health concerns through targeted support and interventions, ensuring that mental health resources are accessible and responsive to the needs of affected populations.

                Advancements in sequencing technologies and the development of new data collection methods produce large volumes of biological data. The Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) provides a cloud-based platform for democratizing access to large-scale genomics data and analysis tools. However, utilizing the full capabilities of AnVIL can be challenging for researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise, especially for executing complex workflows. We present the AnVILWorkflow R package, which enables the convenient execution of bioinformatics workflows hosted on AnVIL directly from an R environment. AnVILWorkflow simplifies the setup of the cloud computing environment, input data formatting, workflow submission, and retrieval of results through intuitive functions. We demonstrate the utility of AnVILWorkflow for three use cases: bulk RNA-seq analysis with Salmon, metagenomics analysis with bioBakery, and digital pathology image processing with PathML. The key features of AnVILWorkflow include user-friendly browsing of available data and workflows, seamless integration of R and non-R tools within a reproducible analysis pipeline, and accessibility to scalable computing resources without direct management overhead. AnVILWorkflow lowers the barrier to utilizing AnVIL’s resources, especially for exploratory analyses or bulk processing with established workflows. This empowers a broader community of researchers to leverage the latest genomics tools and datasets using familiar R syntax. This package is distributed through the Bioconductor project (https://bioconductor.org/packages/AnVILWorkflow), and the source code is available through GitHub (https://github.com/shbrief/AnVILWorkflow).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1256/v1?src=rss">SCUBA implements a storage format-agnostic API for single-cell data access in R [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                While robust tools exist for the analysis of single-cell datasets in both Python and R, interoperability is limited, and analysis tools generally only accept one object class. Considerable programming expertise is required to integrate tools across package ecosystems into a comprehensive analysis, due to their differing languages and internal data structures. This complicates validation of results and leads to inconsistent visualizations between analysis suites. Conversion between object formats is the most common solution, but this is difficult and error-prone due to the rapid pace of development of the analysis suites and their underlying data structures. To address this, we created SCUBA (Single-Cell Unified Backend API), an R package that implements a unified data access API for all common R and Python single-cell object formats. SCUBA extends the data access approach from the widely used Seurat package to SingleCellExperiment and anndata objects. SCUBA also implements new data-specific access functions for all supported object types. Performance scales well across all SCUBA-supported formats. In addition to performance, SCUBA offers several advantages over object conversion for the visualization and further analysis of pre-processed single-cell data. First, SCUBA extracts only data required for the operation at hand, leaving the original object unmodified. This process is simpler, less error prone, and less memory intensive than object conversion, which operates on the entire dataset. Second, code written with SCUBA can use any supported object class as input, with simple and consistent syntax across object formats. This allows a single analysis script or package (like our interactive single-cell browser, scExploreR) to work seamlessly with multiple object types, reducing the complexity of the code and improving both readability and reproducibility. Adoption of SCUBA will ultimately improve collaboration and reproducible research in single-cell analysis by lowering the barriers between package ecosystems.

                Injury to the central nervous system (CNS) often results in permanent neurological impairments because axons fail to regenerate and re-establish lost synaptic contacts. By contrast, peripheral neurons can activate a pro-regenerative program and regenerate following a nerve lesion. This relies on an intricate intracellular communication system between the severed axon and the cell body. Locally activated signaling molecules are retrogradely transported to the soma to promote the epigenetic and transcriptional changes required for the injured neuron to regain growth competence. These signaling events rely heavily on intra-axonal translation and mitochondrial trafficking into the severed axon. Here, we discuss the interplay between these mechanisms and the main intrinsic barriers to axonal regeneration. We also examine the potential of manipulating these processes for driving CNS repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93855">Polysaccharide breakdown products drive degradation-dispersal cycles of foraging bacteria through changes in metabolism and motility</a></h4>

              
                Most of Earth’s biomass is composed of polysaccharides. During biomass decomposition, polysaccharides are degraded by heterotrophic bacteria as a nutrient and energy source and are thereby partly remineralized into CO<sub>2</sub>. As polysaccharides are heterogeneously distributed in nature, following the colonization and degradation of a polysaccharide hotspot the cells need to reach new polysaccharide hotspots. Even though many studies indicate that these degradation-dispersal cycles contribute to the carbon flow in marine systems, we know little about how cells alternate between polysaccharide degradation and motility, and which environmental factors trigger this behavioral switch. Here, we studied the growth of the marine bacterium <i>Vibrio cyclitrophicus</i> ZF270 on the abundant marine polysaccharide alginate, both in its soluble polymeric form as well as on its breakdown products. We used microfluidics coupled to time-lapse microscopy to analyze motility and growth of individual cells, and RNA sequencing to study associated changes in gene expression. We found that single cells grow at reduced rate on alginate until they form large groups that cooperatively break down the polymer. Exposing cell groups to digested alginate accelerates cell growth and changes the expression of genes involved in alginate degradation and catabolism, central metabolism, ribosomal biosynthesis, and transport. However, exposure to digested alginate also triggers cells to become motile and disperse from cell groups, proportionally increasing with the group size before the nutrient switch, and this is accompanied by high expression of genes involved in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. The motile cells chemotax toward polymeric but not digested alginate, likely enabling them to find new polysaccharide hotspots. Overall, our findings reveal cellular mechanisms that might also underlie bacterial degradation-dispersal cycles, which influence the remineralization of biomass in marine environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95453">Proteogenomic analysis of air-pollution-associated lung cancer reveals prevention and therapeutic opportunities</a></h4>

              
                Air pollution significantly impacts lung cancer progression, but there is a lack of a comprehensive molecular characterization of clinical samples associated with air pollution. Here, we performed a proteogenomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in 169 female never-smokers from the Xuanwei area (XWLC cohort), where coal smoke is the primary contributor to the high lung cancer incidence. Genomic mutation analysis revealed XWLC as a distinct subtype of LUAD separate from cases associated with smoking or endogenous factors. Mutational signature analysis suggested that Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is the major risk factor in XWLC. The BaP-induced mutation hotspot, EGFR-G719X, was present in 20% of XWLC which endowed XWLC with elevated MAPK pathway activations and worse outcomes compared to common <i>EGFR</i> mutations. Multi-omics clustering of XWLC identified four clinically relevant subtypes. These subgroups exhibited distinct features in biological processes, genetic alterations, metabolism demands, immune landscape, and radiomic features. Finally, <i>MAD1 and TPRN</i> were identified as novel potential therapeutic targets in XWLC. Our study provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians to explore prevention and treatment strategies for air-pollution-associated lung cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93369">Working memory gating in obesity is moderated by striatal dopaminergic gene variants</a></h4>

              
                Everyday life requires an adaptive balance between distraction-resistant maintenance of information and the flexibility to update this information when needed. These opposing mechanisms are proposed to be balanced through a working memory gating mechanism. Prior research indicates that obesity may elevate the risk of working memory deficits, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Dopaminergic alterations have emerged as a potential mediator. However, current models suggest these alterations should only shift the balance in working memory tasks, not produce overall deficits. The empirical support for this notion is currently lacking, however. To address this gap, we pooled data from three studies (N = 320) where participants performed a working memory gating task. Higher BMI was associated with overall poorer working memory, irrespective of whether there was a need to maintain or update information. However, when participants, in addition to BMI level, were categorized based on certain putative dopamine-signaling characteristics (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]; specifically, Taq1A and DARPP-32), distinct working memory gating effects emerged. These SNPs, primarily associated with striatal dopamine transmission, appear to be linked with differences in updating, specifically, among high-BMI individuals. Moreover, blood amino acid ratio, which indicates central dopamine synthesis capacity, combined with BMI shifted the balance between distractor-resistant maintenance and updating. These findings suggest that both dopamine-dependent and dopamine-independent cognitive effects exist in obesity. Understanding these effects is crucial if we aim to modify maladaptive cognitive profiles in individuals with obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88981">DGRPool, a web tool leveraging harmonized Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel phenotyping data for the study of complex traits</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of complex traits, but studying how a GWAS variant can affect a specific trait in the human population remains challenging due to environmental variability. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is in this regard an excellent model organism for studying the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation due to its simple handling, standardized growth conditions, low cost, and short lifespan. The <i>Drosophila</i> Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) in particular has been a valuable tool for studying complex traits, but proper harmonization and indexing of DGRP phenotyping data is necessary to fully capitalize on this resource. To address this, we created a web tool called <i>DGRPool</i> (<a href="https://dgrpool.epfl.ch/">dgrpool.epfl.ch</a>), which aggregates phenotyping data of 1034 phenotypes across 135 DGRP studies in a common environment. DGRPool enables users to download data and run various tools such as genome-wide (GWAS) and phenome-wide (PheWAS) association studies. As a proof-of-concept, DGRPool was used to study the longevity phenotype and uncovered both established and unexpected correlations with other phenotypes such as locomotor activity, starvation resistance, desiccation survival, and oxidative stress resistance. DGRPool has the potential to facilitate new genetic and molecular insights of complex traits in <i>Drosophila</i> and serve as a valuable, interactive tool for the scientific community.

                Membrane proteins are sorted to the plasma membrane (PM) via Golgi-dependent trafficking. However, our recent studies challenged the essentiality of Golgi in the biogenesis of specific transporters. Here, we investigate the trafficking mechanisms of membrane proteins by following the localization of the polarized R-SNARE SynA versus the non-polarized transporter UapA, synchronously co-expressed in wild-type or isogenic genetic backgrounds repressible for conventional cargo secretion. In wild-type, the two cargoes dynamically label distinct secretory compartments, highlighted by the finding that, unlike SynA, UapA does not colocalize with the late-Golgi. In line with early partitioning into distinct secretory carriers, the two cargoes collapse in distinct ERES in a <i>sec31</i><sup>ts</sup> background. Trafficking via distinct cargo-specific carriers is further supported by showing that repression of proteins essential for conventional cargo secretion does not affect UapA trafficking, while blocking SynA secretion. Overall, this work establishes the existence of distinct, cargo-dependent, trafficking mechanisms, initiating at ERES and being differently dependent on Golgi and SNARE interactions.

">Glutamine Transport via Neurotransmitter Transporter 4 (NTT4, SLC6A17) Maintains Presynaptic Glutamate Supply at Excitatory Synapses in the Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                The glutamate-glutamine cycle is thought to be the principle metabolic pathway that recycles glutamate at excitatory synapses. In this cycle, synaptically released glutamate is sequestered by astrocytes and converted to glutamine before being returned to the presynaptic terminal for conversion back into glutamate to replenish the neurotransmitter pool. While many aspects of this cycle have been extensively studied, a key component remains unknown: the nature of the transporter responsible for the presynaptic uptake of glutamine. We hypothesise that neurotransmitter transporter 4 (NTT4/SLC6A17) plays this role. Accordingly, we generated NTT4 knockout mice to assess its contribution to presynaptic glutamine transport and synaptic glutamate supply. Using biochemical tracing of [1-13C] glucose and [1,2-13C] acetate in awake mice, we observe a reduction of neuronal glutamate supply when NTT4 is absent. In addition, direct electrical recording of hippocampal mossy fibre boutons reveals a presynaptic glutamine transport current that is entirely inhibited by genetic or pharmacological elimination of NTT4. The role of NTT4 in neurotransmission was demonstrated by electrophysiological recordings in acute hippocampal slices, which reveal that NTT4 is required to maintain vesicular glutamate content and to sustain adequate levels of glutamate supply during periods of high-frequency neuronal activity. Finally, behavioural studies in mice demonstrate a deficit in trace fear conditioning; a hippocampus-dependent memory paradigm, and abnormalities in nest building, anxiety behaviour, and social preference. These results demonstrate that NTT4 is a presynaptic glutamine transporter which is a central component of the glutamate-glutamine cycle. NTT4 and hence the glutamate-glutamine cycle maintain neuronal glutamate supply for excitatory neurotransmission during high-frequency synaptic activity, and are key regulators of memory retention and normal behaviour.

                In the avian midbrain network, bottom-up spatial attention is directed by saliency-based stimulus selection. However, it remains unclear whether the isthmi pars magnocellularis (Imc), the first site in the midbrain network to represent stimulus selection, can represent stimulus salience and what is the mechanism by which the midbrain network computes salience. Here, we used two separate translational motion stimuli as the main stimulation protocols and conducted in vivo electrophysiological experiments in the pigeon's Imc. By combining bio-plausible model validation, we found two types of inhibitory surrounds of the Imc neuron receptive field, homogenous inhibitory surrounds (HIS) and non-homogenous inhibitory surrounds (non-HIS), and elucidated the mechanism by which both arise. While HIS is local and depends on stimulus feature similarity, which can be used to compute stimulus saliency, non-HIS is global and doesn't depend on stimulus feature similarity, which can be used to compute stimulus selection. Moreover, the superimposition of HIS and non-HIS modulates the neural response of Imc. The two inhibitory surrounds of Imc identified in this study more clearly elucidate the full process of achieving bottom-up stimulus selection based on saliency in the midbrain network and show that Imc is a nucleus that can represent both stimulus saliency and stimulus selection.

">Neural and behavioral reinstatement jointly reflect retrieval of narrative events</a></h4>

              
                When recalling past events, patterns of gaze position and neural activity resemble those observed during the original experience. We hypothesized that these two phenomena, known as gaze reinstatement and neural reactivation, are linked through a common process that underlies the reinstatement of past experiences during memory retrieval. Here, we tested this proposal based on the viewing and recall of a narrative movie, which we assessed through fMRI, deep learning-based gaze prediction, and language modeling of spoken recall. In line with key predictions, gaze behavior adhered to the same principles as neural activity; it was event-specific, robust across individuals, and generalized across viewing and recall. Additionally, gaze-dependent brain activity overlapped substantially across tasks. Collectively, these results suggest that retrieval engages mechanisms that direct our eyes during natural vision, reflecting common constraints within the functional organization of the nervous system. Moreover, they highlight the importance of considering behavioral and neural reinstatement together in our understanding of remembering.

">Exact Continuous Spiking Rate Inference</a></h4>

              
                Many cognitive functions involve multiple brain areas simultaneously processing, distributing, and sharing information. The wide-field imaging technique can record such brain-wide activity since it offers a unique combination of simultaneous recordings from a wide field of view at a high rate. This unique combination is achieved by using a single-photon camera, which is set to capture, from a large area, neural activity-driven light emission generated by calcium indicators. Adequately analyzing this captured data requires inferring the underlying neural activity from the recorded fluorescence, a challenging mathematical problem. The challenge arises from the calcium indicator dynamics, which distort the neural dynamics as it transforms the neural activity into light emission and from the presence of noise. The wide-field setting adds a distinctive challenge. Its wide field of view recordings at a high rate constrains the spatial resolution to be limited. As a result, each fluorescence trace captured by each camera's pixel originates from many neuron activities and not a single neuron as typical of other recording techniques. No previous, rigorously studied analytic solution exists for inferring neural activity from recorded fluorescence in the wide-field setting. Here, we phrase the inference problem arising from wide-field recordings as an optimization problem and solve it exactly. To ensure the robustness of our solution and provide a solid foundation for its application, we rigorously verify it using real data. We further suggest a novel approach for the optimization problem parameter-tuning. Beyond recovering the neural dynamics, our inference will allow future studies to retrieve accurate, correlation-based analyses of brain-wide activity.

">Systemic CGRP and PACAP-38's Effects on Motion-Induced Nausea and Balance Behaviors in C57BL/6J Mice: A Comparison</a></h4>

              
                Pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), particularly its dominant isoform PACAP-38, is implicated in migraine and represents a promising therapeutic target. We investigated if intraperitoneally delivered (IP) PACAP-38 impacts motion-induced nausea, postural sway, and imbalance in C57BL/6J wildtype mice using the motion-induced thermoregulation, center of pressure (CoP), rotarod, and balance beam assays. We also assessed CGRPs effects on these behaviors in parallel. Our findings indicate that IP PACAP-38 significantly disrupts motion-induced thermoregulation in mice, with notable blunting of tail vasodilation responses in both sexes. Additionally, PACAP-38 administration increased postural sway in female mice only and caused balance beam imbalances. Contrary to IP CGRP, IP PACAP-38 did not affect rotarod performance when mice were trained on a dowel with 1.5 cm radius. Our findings provide preclinical evidence supporting a potential role of PACAP-38 in vestibular migraine pathophysiology. Future research will explore if PACAP antagonism can protect against PACAP-38s effects on nausea and balance behaviors, relevant to treatment of vestibular migraine (VM), especially for patients unresponsive to triptans or CGRP-targeting therapies.

">Morphine-induced hyperalgesia impacts small extracellular vesicle miRNA composition and function</a></h4>

              
                Morphine and other synthetic opioids are widely prescribed to treat pain. Prolonged morphine exposure can paradoxically enhance pain sensitivity in humans and nociceptive behavior in rodents. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying opioid-induced hyperalgesia, we investigated changes in miRNA composition of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from the serum of mice after a morphine treatment paradigm that induces hyperalgesia. We observed significant differential expression of 18 miRNAs in sEVs from morphine-treated mice of both sexes compared to controls. Several of these miRNAs were bioinformatically predicted to regulate cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), a well-characterized transcription factor implicated in pain and drug addiction. We confirmed the binding and repression of Creb mRNA by miR-155 and miR-10a. We tested if serum-derived sEVs from morphine-treated mice could elicit nociceptive behavior in naive recipient mice. Intrathecal injection of 1 microgram sEVs did not significantly impact basal mechanical and thermal threshold in naive recipient mice. However, prophylactic 1 microgram sEV administration in recipient mice resulted in faster resolution of complete Freund adjuvant-induced mechanical and thermal inflammatory hypersensitivity. Other behaviors assayed following administration of these sEVs were not impacted including sEV conditioned place preference and locomotor sensitization. These results indicate that morphine regulation of serum sEV composition can contribute to analgesia and suggest a potential for sEVs to be a non-opioid therapeutic intervention strategy to treat pain.

">Wideband ratiometric measurement of tonic and phasic dopamine release in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Reward learning, cognition, and motivation are supported by changes in neurotransmitter levels across multiple timescales. Current measurement technologies for various neuromodulators (such as dopamine and serotonin) do not bridge timescales of fluctuations, limiting the ability to define the behavioral significance, regulation, and relationship between fast (phasic) and slow (tonic) dynamics. To help resolve longstanding debates about the behavioral significance of dopamine across timescales, we developed a novel quantification strategy, augmenting extensively used carbon-fiber Fast Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV). We iteratively engineered the FSCV scan sequence to rapidly modify electrode sensitivity within a sampling window and applied ratiometric analysis for wideband dopamine measurement. This allowed us to selectively eliminate artifacts unrelated to electrochemical detection (i.e., baseline drift), overcoming previous limitations that precluded wideband dopamine detection from milliseconds to hours. We extensively characterize this approach in vitro, validate performance in vivo with simultaneous microdialysis, and deploy this technique to measure wideband dopamine changes across striatal regions under pharmacological, optogenetic, and behavioral manipulations. We demonstrate that our approach can extend to additional analytes, including serotonin and pH, providing a robust platform to assess the contributions of multi-timescale neuromodulator fluctuations to cognition, learning, and motivation.

">On the analysis of functional PET (fPET)-FDG: baseline mischaracterization can introduce artifactual metabolic (de)activations</a></h4>

              
                Functional Positron Emission Tomography (fPET) with (bolus plus) constant infusion of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG), known as fPET-FDG, is a recently introduced technique in human neuroimaging, enabling the detection of dynamic glucose metabolism changes within a single scan. However, the statistical analysis of fPET-FDG data remains challenging because its signal and noise characteristics differ from both classic bolus-administration FDG PET and from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which together compose the primary sources of inspiration for analytical methods used by fPET-FDG researchers. In this study, we present an investigate of how inaccuracies in modeling baseline FDG uptake can introduce artifactual patterns to detrended TAC residuals, potentially introducing spurious (de)activations to general linear model (GLM) analyses. By combining simulations and empirical data from both constant infusion and bolus-plus-constant infusion protocols, we evaluate the effects of various baseline modeling methods, including polynomial detrending, regression against the global mean time-activity curve, and two analytical methods based on tissue compartment model kinetics. Our findings indicate that improper baseline removal can introduce statistically significant artifactual effects, although these effects characterized in this study (~2-8%) are generally smaller than those reported by previous literature employing robust sensory stimulation (~10-30%). We discuss potential strategies to mitigate this issue, including informed baseline modeling, optimized tracer administration protocols, and careful experimental design. These insights aim to enhance the reliability of fPET-FDG in capturing true metabolic dynamics in neuroimaging research.

                This study reveals a sexually dimorphic sNPF-sNPF-R circuit in the Drosophila brain that regulates energy balance behavior, specifically the shorter-mating-duration (SMD) response to sexual experience. sNPF is predominantly expressed in neurons, while sNPF-R is expressed in both neurons and glial cells, particularly astrocyte-like glia (ALG) in a subset of cells outside the mushroom body (MB) termed "Rishi cells" (RS cells). Sexual experience induces global alterations in calcium signaling and synaptic plasticity within this circuit, with sNPF-R expressing neurons and glia in RS cells playing a critical role in encoding sexual experience-related information into energy balance behavior related to mating duration. Neuronal glucose metabolism, specifically the Tret1l transporter, is essential for maintaining the high calcium levels and proper function of sNPF neurons near RS cells. This novel and intricate neuron-glia sNPF-sNPF-R network acts as critical circuits within the Drosophila brain for processing interval timing behaviors, highlighting the dynamic interplay between metabolism, neural circuits, and behavior in regulating energy balance.

                The central nervous system (CNS) can effectively control body movements despite environmental changes. While much is known about adaptation to external environmental changes, less is known about responses to internal bodily changes. This study investigates how the CNS adapts to long-term alterations in the musculoskeletal system using a tendon transfer model in non-human primates. We surgically relocated finger flexor and extensor muscles to examine how the CNS adapts its strategy for finger movement control by measuring muscle activities during grasping tasks. Two months post-surgery, the monkeys demonstrated significant recovery of grasping function despite the initial disruption. Our findings suggest a two-phase CNS adaptation process: an initial phase enabling function with the transferred muscles, followed by a later phase abolishing this enabled function and restoring a more efficient and 'good enough' control strategy resembling the original. These results highlight a multi-phase CNS adaptation process with distinct time constants in response to sudden bodily changes, offering potential insights into understanding and treating movement disorders.

                Spinal circuits for locomotion undergo maturation during early development. How intrinsic properties of individual spinal neuron populations change throughout motor maturation is not fully understood. Here we identify for the first time the presence of the persistent outward potassium current known as the M-current in primary motoneurons of larval zebrafish. We show that the M-current controls excitability of primary motoneurons and its role in excitability control changes during development such that the magnitude of the M-current in primary motoneurons transiently increases at 3 days post-fertilization. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which control over excitability of primary motoneurons in larval zebrafish is ensured, underscoring developmental changes in ion current contributions to intrinsic properties. Broadly, these data support the M-current as a conserved means to control motoneuron excitability across vertebrates.

">A body detection inversion effect revealed by a large-scale inattentional blindness experiment</a></h4>

              
                As a highly social species, humans preferentially attend to the faces and bodies of other people to efficiently recognize their identities, emotions, actions, and intentions. Previous research revealed specialized cognitive mechanisms for processing human faces and bodies. For example, upright person silhouettes are more readily found than inverted silhouettes in visual search and detection tasks. It is unclear, however, whether these findings reflect a top-down attentional bias to social stimuli or bottom-up sensitivity to visual cues signaling the presence of other people. Here, we tested whether the upright human form is preferentially detected in the absence of attention. To rule out influences of top-down attention and expectation, we conducted a large-scale single-trial inattentional blindness experiment on a diverse sample of naive participants (N=13.539). While participants were engaged in judging the length of a cross at fixation, we briefly presented an unexpected silhouette of a person or a plant next to the cross. Subsequently, we asked whether participants noticed anything other than the cross. Results showed that silhouettes of people were more often noticed than silhouettes of plants. Crucially, upright person silhouettes were also more often detected than inverted person silhouettes, despite these stimuli being identical in terms of their low-level visual features. Finally, capitalizing on the exceptionally large and diverse sample, further analyses revealed strong detection differences across age and gender. These results indicate that the visual system is tuned to the form of the upright human body, allowing for the quick detection of other people even in the absence of attention.

">A Measure of Event-Related Potentials (ERP) Indices of Motivation During Cycling</a></h4>

              
                Although motivation is a central aspect of the practice of a physical activity, it is a challenging endeavour to predict an individual's level of motivation during the activity. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of measuring motivation through brain recording methods during physical activity, with a specific focus on cycling. The experiment employed the Effort Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT), a decision-making task based on effort and reward, conducted under two conditions: one involving cycling on an ergometer at moderate intensity and the other without cycling. The P300, an event-related potential linked to motivation, was recorded using electroencephalography. A total of 20 participants were recruited to complete the EEfRT, which involved making effort-based decisions of increasing difficulty in order to receive varying levels of monetary reward. The results demonstrated that the P300 amplitude was influenced by the act of cycling, exhibiting a reduction during the cycling session. This reduction may be explained by a reallocation of cognitive resources due to the exertion of physical effort, which is consistent with the transient hypofrontality theory. In terms of behaviour, participants demonstrated a tendency to make more challenging choices when the potential rewards were higher or the probability of gaining them was lower. This pattern was observed in both the cycling and non-cycling conditions. A positive correlation was identified between P300 amplitude and the proportion of difficult choices, particularly under conditions of low reward probability. This suggests that P300 may serve as a neural marker of motivation. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using electroencephalography to monitor motivation during exercise in real-time, with potential applications in rehabilitation settings. However, further research is required to refine the design and explore the effects of different exercise types on motivation.

In addition, experimental approaches often rely on averaged activity across trials and subjects, disregarding moment-to-moment fluctuations in Theta activity, contingent on key aspects of the task. Here, we used novel oscillation detection approaches to investigate the dynamics of Theta and Alpha episodes in human subjects performing a Spatial Navigation task, resolved at single trial level. The results suggest that bouts of Theta oscillatory activity are related to task difficulty and access to previously encoded information, across different time-scales. Alpha episodes, instead, seem to anticipate successful navigational decisions and could be related to shifts in internal attention.

">The non-hallucinogenic serotonin 1B receptor is necessary for the antidepressant-like effects of psilocybin in mice</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies highlight the promising use of psychedelic therapies for psychiatric disorders, including depression. The persisting clinical effects of psychedelics such as psilocybin are commonly attributed to activation of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) based on its role in the acute hallucinatory effects. However, the active metabolite of psilocybin binds to many serotonin receptor subtypes, including the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR). Given the known role of 5-HT1BR in mediating depressive phenotypes and promoting neural plasticity, we hypothesized that it mediates the effects of psilocybin on neural activity and behavior. We first examined the acute neural response to psilocybin in mice lacking 5-HT1BR. We found that 5-HT1BR expression influenced brain-wide activity following psilocybin administration, measured by differences in the patterns of the immediate early gene c-Fos, across regions involved in emotional processing and cognitive function, including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Functionally, we demonstrated that 5-HT1BR is necessary for the acute and persisting behavioral effects of psilocybin. Although there was no effect of 5-HT1BR expression on the acute head twitch response, mice lacking 5-HT1BRs had attenuated hypolocomotor responses to psilocybin. We also measured the persisting antidepressant-like effects of psilocybin using transgenic and pharmacological 5-HT1BR loss-of-function models and found that 5-HT1B was required for the decreased anhedonia and reduced anxiety-like behavior. Finally, using a network analysis, we identified neural circuits through which 5-H1BR may modulate the response to psilocybin. Overall, our research implicates the 5-HT1BR, a non-hallucinogenic serotonin receptor, as a critical mediator of the behavioral and neural effects of psilocybin in mice.

">Cytoplasmic accumulation of a splice variant of hnRNP A2/B1 contributes to FUS-associated toxicity in a mouse model of ALS</a></h4>

              
                Genetic and experimental findings point to a crucial role of RNA dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Evidence suggests that mutations in RBPs such as FUS, a gene associated with ALS, affect the regulation of alternative splicing. We have previously shown that the overexpression of wild-type FUS in mice, a condition that induces ALS-like phenotypes, impacts the splicing of hnRNP A2/B1, a protein with key roles in RNA metabolism, suggesting that a pathological connection between FUS and hnRNP A2/B1 might promote FUS-associated toxicity. Here we report that the expression and distribution of different hnRNP A2/B1 splice variants are modified in the affected tissues of mice overexpressing wild-type FUS. Notably, degenerating motor neurons are characterized by the cytoplasmic accumulation of splice variants of hnRNP A2/B1 lacking exon 9 (hnRNP A2b/B1b). In vitro studies show that exon 9 skipping affects the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of hnRNP A2/B1, promoting its localization into stress granules (SGs), and demonstrate that cytoplasmic localization is the primary driver of hnRNP A2b recruitment into SGs and cell toxicity. Finally, boosting exon 9 skipping using splicing switching oligonucleotides exacerbates disease phenotypes in wild-type FUS mice. Altogether, these findings reveal that alterations of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of hnRNP A2/B1, driven by FUS-induced splicing changes, likely contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.

">Does Unfairness Evoke Anger or Disgust? A Quantitative Neurofunctional Dissection Based on 25 Years of Neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                Over the last decades, the traditional 'Homo economicus' model has been increasingly challenged by convergent evidence underscoring the impact of emotions on decision-making. A classic example is the perception of unfairness operationalized in the Ultimatum Game where humans readily sacrifice personal gains to punish those who violate fairness norms. While the emotional mechanism underlying costly punishments has been widely acknowledged, the distinct contributions of moral emotions (anger or disgust) remain debated, partly due to methodological limitations of the conventional experiments. Here, we capitalize on a quantitative neurofunctional dissection approach by combining recent developments in neuroimaging meta-analyses, behavioral-level, network-level, and neurochemical-level decoding and data from 3,266 participants from functional neuroimaging studies to determine the common and distinct neural representations between unfairness and the two moral emotions. Experience of unfairness engaged a widespread bilateral network encompassing insular, cingulate, and frontal regions, with dorsal striatal regions mediating the decision to reject unfair offers. Disgust engaged a defensive-avoidance circuit encompassing amygdalar, occipital, and frontal regions, while anger engaged non-overlapping systems including mid-cingulate, thalamic, and frontal regions. Unfairness and anger or disgust respectively commonly engaged the anterior and mid-insula, while the latter additionally showed common recruitment of ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Multimodal network, behavioral, and serotonergic decoding provided a more granular and convincing dissection of these results. Findings indicate a shared neuroaffective basis underlying the impact of emotions on unfairness-induced punishment behavior and suggest a common brain circuit has been evolutionarily shaped to protect individuals from personal harm and enforce societal norms.

">Neuronal TDP-43 aggregation drives changes in microglial morphology prior to immunophenotype in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are the innate immune cells of the brain with the capacity to react to damage or disease. Microglial reactions can be characterised in post-mortem tissues by assessing their pattern of protein expression, or immunophenotypes, and cell morphologies. We recently demonstrated that microglia have a phagocytic immunophenotype in early-stage ALS but transition to a dysfunctional immunophenotype by end stage, and that these states are driven by TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation in the human brain. However, it remains unclear how microglial morphologies are changed in ALS. Here we examine the relationship between microglial immunophenotypes and morphologies, and TDP-43 pathology in motor cortex tissue from people with ALS and from a TDP-43-driven ALS mouse model. Post-mortem human brain tissue from 10 control and 10 ALS cases was analysed alongside brain tissue from the bigenic NEFH-tTA/tetO-hTDP-43{triangleup}NLS (rNLS) mouse model of ALS at distinct disease stages. Sections were immunohistochemically labelled for microglial markers (HLA-DR, CD68, and Iba1) and phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43). Single-cell microglial HLA-DR, CD68, and Iba1 average intensities, and morphological features (cell body area, process number, total outgrowth, and branch number) were measured using custom image analysis pipelines. In human ALS motor cortex, we identified a significant change in microglial morphologies from ramified to hypertrophic, which was associated with increased Iba1 and CD68 levels. In the rNLS mouse motor cortex, the microglial morphological changed from ramified to hypertrophic and increased Iba1 levels occurred in parallel with pTDP-43 aggregation, prior to increases in CD68 levels. Overall, the evidence presented in this study demonstrates that microglia change their morphologies prior to immunophenotype changes. These morphological changes may prime microglia near neurons with pTDP-43 aggregation for phagocytosis, in turn triggering immunophenotype changes; first, to a phagocytic state then to a dysfunctional one.

">Modelling human social vision with cinematic stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Sociability is central for humans. Visual information ranging from low-level physical features (e.g. luminance) to semantic information (e.g. face recognition) and high-level social inference (e.g. emotional valence of social interactions) is constantly sampled for navigating the social world. Here we utilize large-scale eye tracking during natural vision for mapping how different levels of visual information guide the perception of social scenes. In three experiments, participants (N = 166) watched full-length films and short movie clips with varying social content (total duration: 193 minutes) during eye tracking. To model the association between the perceptual features and spatiotemporal eye movement parameters (gaze position, gaze synchronization, pupil size and blinking), we extracted 39 stimulus features from the movies including low-level audiovisual features (e.g. luminance, motion), presence and location of mid-level semantic categories (e.g. faces, objects) and high-level social information (e.g. body movements, pleasantness). Pupil size was modulated by luminance, scene cuts and emotional arousal while gaze position was most accurately predicted by a combination of the presence of human faces, local motion and entropy. Faces and eyes were prioritized over other semantic categories and blinking rate decreased during periods of attentional engagement. Altogether the results show that human social vision is primarily guided by low-level physical features and mid-level semantic categories, while high-level social features such as emotional arousal primarily modulate pupillary responses.

">Mu and Delta Opioid Receptors Modulate Inhibition within the Prefrontal Cortex through Dissociable Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Aberrant signaling within cortical inhibitory microcircuits has been identified as a common signature of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interneuron (IN) activity is precisely regulated by neuromodulatory systems that evoke widespread changes in synaptic transmission and principal cell output. Cortical interneurons express high levels of Mu and Delta opioid receptors (MOR and DOR), positioning opioid signaling as a critical regulator of inhibitory transmission. However, we lack a complete understanding of how MOR and DOR regulate prefrontal cortex (PFC) microcircuitry. Here, we combine whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, and viral tools to provide an extensive characterization MOR and DOR regulation of inhibitory transmission. We show that DOR activation is more effective at suppressing spontaneous inhibitory transmission in the prelimbic PFC, while MOR causes a greater acute suppression of electrically-evoked GABA release. Cell type-specific optogenetics revealed that MOR and DOR differentially regulate inhibitory transmission from parvalbumin, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing INs. Finally, we demonstrate that DOR regulates inhibitory transmission through pre- and postsynaptic modifications to IN physiology, whereas MOR function is predominantly observed in somato-dendritic or presynaptic compartments depending on cell type.

">Foamy microglia link oxylipins to disease progression in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease characterized by expanding demyelinating lesions, leading to severe and irreversible disability. The mechanisms driving lesion expansion, however, remain poorly understood. Here, using a multi-omics approach, we identified foamy microglia as primary contributors to the molecular profile of lesions and disease progression in secondary progressive MS. Lesions with foamy microglia are marked by the accumulation of cholesterol esters, bismonoacylglycerolphosphates (BMP), and oxylipins, along with high B-cell infiltration, increased levels of immunoglobulin G1, and elevated expression of Fcgamma- and complement receptors. Lesions with foamy GPNMB+-microglia display markers of enhanced phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, lysosomal dysfunction, and antigen presentation, but lack classical pro-inflammatory markers. Our data suggest that sustained phagocytosis of myelin overwhelms microglial endo-lysosomal capacity, leading to lipid droplet and oxylipin formation. This microglial phenotype may induce further recruitment of adaptive immune cells, axonal damage, drive lesion expansion and prevent remyelination. Monoacylglycerol lipase, involved in producing oxylipin precursors, was identified as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt this cycle and prevent chronic lesion expansion.

                Adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) serotypes vary in how effectively they express genes across different cell types and brain regions. Here we report a systematic comparison of the AAV serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, and the directed evolution derived AAVrg, in the inferior colliculus and cerebellum. The AAVs were identical apart from their different serotypes, each having a synapsin promotor and expressing GFP (AAV-hSyn-GFP). Identical titers and volumes were injected into the inferior colliculus and cerebellum of adult male and female mice and brains were sectioned and imaged 2 weeks later. Transduction efficacy, anterograde labeling of axonal projections, and retrograde labeling of somata, were characterized and compared across serotypes. Cell-type tropism was assessed by analyzing the morphology of the GFP-labeled neurons in the cerebellar cortex. In both the cerebellum and inferior colliculus, AAV1 expressed GFP in more cells, labeled a larger volume, and produced significantly brighter labeling than all other serotypes, indicating superior transgene expression. AAV1 labeled more Purkinje cells, unipolar brush cells, and molecular layer interneurons than the other serotypes, while AAV2 labeled a greater number of granule cells. These results provide guidelines for the use of AAVs as gene delivery tools in these regions.

                Purpose: This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of MP-004, a novel FKBP12 ligand, in the treatment of inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs). MP-004 targets FKBP12/RyR interaction, which is disrupted in several neurological disorders with underlying oxidative stress. Methods: The toxicity and efficacy of MP-004 were examined in vitro in 661W cells. Efficacy was evaluated in phototoxic and H2O2-induced damage using impedance assays, calcium imgaing and in situ PLA. In vivo, MP-004 efficacy was evaluated in the rd10 mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) by topical ocular instillation. Retinal function was assessed by electroretinography (ERG), visual acuity was measured using a water maze test, and retinal structure was analyzed morphometrically. Results: MP-004 exhibited low toxicity (LD50: 1.22 mM) and effectively protected 661W cells from phototoxicity (EC50: 30.6 nM). Under oxidative stress conditions, MP-004 preserved FKBP12.6/RyR2 interaction, partially restored endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores and prevented cell death. In vivo, MP-004 significantly preserved retinal function in rd10 mice, with ERG wave amplitude increases of up to 50% in scotopic and 71% in photopic conditions, corresponding to rod and cone functions, respectively. Additionally, MP-004 improved visual acuity for low spatial frequency patterns, and preserved retinal structure with a 23% increase in outer nuclear layer thickness, and preservation in the number of rods and cones and their segment length. Conclusions: MP-004 shows promise as a therapeutic agent for RP, preserving retinal structure and function, likely through modulation of FKBP12.6/RyR2 interaction. Further studies are needed to explore its pharmacokinetics and efficacy in other IRD models.

">Cannabidiol (CBD) potentiates physiological and behavioral markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsivity in female and male mice</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Clinical literature indicates there may be a therapeutic use of cannabidiol (CBD) for stress-related disorders. Preclinical literature remains conflicted regarding the underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms, reporting mixed effects of CBD (increased, decreased, or no effect) on anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. Preclinical data demonstrated that CBD modulates hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis gene expression; it is unknown whether CBD changes HPA axis responsivity and how this relates to altered behavior. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate whether acute or chronic CBD administration would alter physiological and behavioral measures of HPA axis responsivity in male or female mice. Methods: C57BL/6 mice of both sexes were injected with vehicle or CBD (30 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 26 days. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels were evaluated following dexamethasone suppression and adrenocorticotropin hormone stimulation tests after acute and chronic CBD exposure. After chronic CBD, mice were tested for anxiety-like behavior using an elevated plus maze (EPM) and associative fear learning and memory using a trace fear conditioning (FC) protocol. Results: Compared to vehicle, CBD induced a state of HPA axis hyperactivation, an effect which was significant in males; it also normalized anxiety-like behavior in female mice classified as having HPA axis hypofunction and primed all female mice for enhanced conditioned responding. Significant sex differences were also detected: females had greater plasma CORT levels and HPA axis responsivity than males, exhibited less EPM anxiety-like behavior, and were more responsive during FC. Conclusions: CBD potentiated physiological and behavioral markers of HPA axis function and normalized anxiety-like behavior in a sex-specific manner. This observation has implications for cannabinoid-based drug development targeting individuals with stress-related disorders involving HPA axis hypofunction pathology.

">Optical blur affects differently ON and OFF visual pathways</a></h4>

              
                The human eye has a crystalline lens that focuses retinal images at the point of fixation. Outside this fixation region, images are distorted by optical blur, which increases light scatter and reduces the spatial resolution and contrast processed by neuronal pathways. The spectacle lenses that humans use for optical correction also minify or magnify the images, affecting neuronal surround suppression in visual processing. Because light and dark stimuli are processed with ON and OFF pathways that have different spatial resolution, contrast sensitivity and surround suppression, optical blur and image magnification should affect differently the two pathways and the perception of lights and darks. Our results provide support for this prediction in cats and humans. We demonstrate that optical blur expands ON receptive fields while shrinking OFF receptive fields, as expected from the expansion of light stimuli and shrinkage of dark stimuli with light scatter. Spectacle-induced image magnification also shrinks OFF more than ON receptive fields, as expected from the stronger surround suppression in OFF than ON pathways. Optical blur also decreases the population response of OFF more than ON pathways, consistent with the different effects of light scatter on dark and light stimuli and the ON-OFF pathway differences in contrast sensitivity. Based on these results, we conclude that optical blur and image magnification reduce the receptive field sizes and cortical responses of OFF more than ON pathways, making the ON-OFF response balance a reliable signal to optimize the size and quality of the retinal image.

">From Beeps to Streets: Unveiling Sensory Input and Relevance Across Auditory Contexts</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the neural basis of sound perception in everyday life using EEG data recorded in an office-like environment over 3.5 hours. We investigated how contextual factors such as personal relevance, task complexity and stimulus properties influence auditory processing in ecologically valid settings. By systematically increasing the complexity of acoustic scenes and tasks, we analysed changes in neural responses, particularly in the N100 and P300 components. Our results show that while the P300 is a stable marker of attention in both isolated sounds and complex soundscapes, the N100 is more sensitive to task complexity and environmental factors. This highlights the importance of context in shaping auditory perception. Furthermore, our results suggest that laboratory-based findings can be partially generalised to real-world settings, although task demands significantly influence neural markers. These findings provide new opportunities to study sound perception in naturalistic settings, without sacrificing the control typically afforded by laboratory studies.

	<p>Background/Objectives: One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is the accumulation of aggregated beta-amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;) protein in the form of senile plaques within brain tissue. Senile plaques contain various post-translational modifications of A&amp;amp;beta;, including prevalent isomerization of Asp7 residue. The Asp7 isomer has been shown to exhibit increased neurotoxicity and induce amyloidogenesis in brain tissue of transgenic mice. The toxicity of A&amp;amp;beta; peptides may be partly mediated by their structure and morphology. In this respect, in this study we analyzed the structural and aggregation characteristics of the Asp7 isoform of A&amp;amp;beta;42 and compared them to those of synthetic A&amp;amp;beta;42. We also investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of these peptides, a method often used to induce AD-like symptoms in rodent models. Methods: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to compare the morphological and aggregation properties of A&amp;amp;beta;42 and Asp7 iso-A&amp;amp;beta;42. The effects of i.c.v. stereotaxic administration of the proteins were assessed via behavioral analysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) estimation in vivo using a scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module. Results: AFM measurements revealed structural differences between the two peptides, most notably in their soluble toxic oligomeric forms. The i.c.v. administration of Asp7 iso-A&amp;amp;beta;42 induced spatial memory deficits in rats and elevated oxidative stress levels in vivo, suggesting a potential of ROS in the pathogenic mechanism of the peptide. Conclusions: The findings support the further investigation of Asp7 iso-A&amp;amp;beta;42 in translational research on AD and suggest its involvement in neurodegenerative processes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Supporting the mental well-being of students through their educational journey is of vital importance. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between metacognition, personality traits, and various factors affecting mental health in a cohort of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) students. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study involved a self-administered questionnaire (distributed in October to November 2020) that gathered demographic information and included six scales measuring personality characteristics, health literacy, self-management skills, exercise habits (benefits and barriers), cognitive thinking, and cognitive deliberateness and impulsivity. Results: A cohort of 195 PT and OT students participated in the study. The findings revealed significant associations between metacognition and personality, particularly the association between low cognitive self-confidence and high emotional instability. This link suggests that students who struggle with cognitive self-confidence may also experience greater emotional instability, highlighting a need for targeted mental health support. Additionally, health literacy was negatively correlated with anxiety, while metacognition was positively correlated with perceived exercise benefits. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of individualized metacognitive approaches to support students&amp;amp;rsquo; mental well-being. Interventions should focus on strengthening cognitive self-confidence through methods such as resilience training, cognitive restructuring, and mindfulness practices to help manage emotional instability. Furthermore, promoting physical activity, particularly among female students, and incorporating gender-specific strategies could enhance mental health outcomes.</p>

">Molecular Specification of Claustro-Amygdalar and Paleocortical Neurons and Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The ventropallial excitatory neurons (ExNs) in the claustro-amygdalar complex and piriform cortex (PIR; part of paleocortex) form crucial reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), integrating cognitive and sensory information that result in adaptive behaviors. Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Our study uncovers that transcription factors SOX4, SOX11, and TFAP2D play a pivotal role in the development, identity, and PFC connectivity of these neurons. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that the absence of transcription factors SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic ExNs dramatically reduces the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum, and PIR. SOX4 and SOX11 control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing ExNs of BLC, claustrum, paleocortex including PIR, and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. While the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat behaviors, differences emerge in the manifestation of Tfap2d dosage, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and the connectivity pattern between the BLC and PFC. This underscores the significance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC-PFC connectivity and behavioral modifications reminiscent of symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial ventropallial ExNs and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Mutations of schizophrenia risk gene SETD1A dysregulate synaptic function in human neurons</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder associated with both common risk variants of small effect sizes and rare risk variants of high penetrance. Rare protein truncating variants (PTVs) in SETD1A (SET Domain Containing 1A) show a strong association with SCZ; however, it remains largely unclear how rare PTVs in SETD1A contribute to the pathophysiology of SCZ. To understand the impact of SETD1A rare PTVs in human neurons, we CRISPR/Cas9-engineered five isogenic pairs of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), with a recurrent heterozygous patient-specific PTV mutation c.4582-2delAG in two donor lines and a heterozygous frameshift mutation c.4596_4597insG (p. Leu1533fs) in three donor lines. These two mutations are predicted to cause a premature stop codon in exon 16 of SETD1A, leading to the loss of the conserved SET domain that is critical for its histone methyltransferase activity. We found that these presumably loss-of-function (LoF) mutations caused the SETD1A mRNAs to be degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), accompanied by a reduction of full-length SETD1A protein level in iPSCs. We then characterized the morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic impacts of the SETD1A+/- LoF mutations in iPSC-derived human excitatory neurons induced by NGN2. We found that the SETD1A+/- exon-16 LoF mutations altered dendrite complexity, dysregulated synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity, likely by dysregulating genes involved in synaptic function. These results provide mechanistic insights into how SETD1A+/- exon-16 patient-specific LoF mutations affect neuron phenotypes that may be relevant to the pathophysiology of SCZ.

">In-Situ Structure and Topography of AMPA Receptor Scaffolding Complexes Visualized by CryoET</a></h4>

              
                Most synapses in the brain transmit information by the presynaptic release of vesicular glutamate, driving postsynaptic depolarization through AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). The nanometer-scale topography of synaptic AMPARs regulates response amplitude by controlling the number of receptors activated by synaptic vesicle fusion. The mechanisms controlling AMPAR topography and their interactions with postsynaptic density proteins are unclear, as is the spatial relationship between AMPARs and synaptic vesicles. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography to map the molecular topography of AMPARs and visualize their in-situ structure. Clustered AMPARs form structured complexes with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins resolved by sub-tomogram averaging. Sub-synaptic topography mapping reveals the presence of AMPAR nanoclusters with exclusion zones beneath synaptic vesicles. Our molecular-resolution maps visualize the predominant information transfer path in the nervous system.

">Androgen receptor modulation of vocal circuitry in Alston's singing mouse</a></h4>

              
                Animal courtship and aggressive displays are dramatic, often sexually dimorphic behaviors that require the coordinated modulation of diverse motivational and motor circuits. In Alstons singing mice (Scotinomys teguina), a novel and elaborate advertisement vocalization is sexually dimorphic and steroid sensitive. Males sing more often than females, and on average male songs have more notes. Song is influenced by circulating androgens, but how such hormonal differences influence the diverse brain regions involved in vocal display is not understood. To characterize androgen-sensitive sites in the vocal motor pathway, we used two isoforms of pseudorabies virus (PRV) to double-label circuits ending in laryngeal and jaw muscles involved in vocalization, and co-labeled these neurons for androgen receptor (AR). Next we manipulated circulating androgens and observed the effects on AR distribution and male song. We find androgens drive coordinated changes in AR abundance across motor and motivational circuits, and both individual and group differences in song are associated with AR abundance. The results reveal how circulating androgens and the auto-regulation of androgen receptors can influence the diverse circuits necessary for elaborate advertisement displays.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The dysregulation of the hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis has been associated with various mental disorders. One of the most commonly described parameters of HPA axis functioning is the cortisol awakening response (CAR). To date, few studies have been conducted on the relationship between personality disorders and CAR. The present study aimed to compare the CAR between individuals with personality disorders and healthy controls. Moreover, the study aimed to assess the association of CAR with cognitive biases and psychopathological symptoms in people with personality disorders. Methods: A total of 43 individuals with personality disorders and 45 healthy controls were enrolled. Participants completed questionnaires measuring the severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive biases, and psychotic-like experiences. Cortisol levels were measured in four morning saliva samples: immediately after awakening, and after 15, 30, and 45 min. Results: A significantly lower CAR was found among individuals with personality disorders, even after adjustment for age, sex, and the level of education. However, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed a relatively low area under the curve (AUC = 0.362). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between the CAR and the level of external attribution bias among individuals with personality disorders. No significant associations of the CAR with psychopathological symptoms and other cognitive biases were observed. Conclusions: Findings from this study indicate that the HPA axis activity might be altered in personality disorders. However, the clinical utility of this observation needs further studies in larger samples. External attribution might be related to the HPA axis alterations in this population.</p>

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Previous studies have observed liver abnormalities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. This study aimed to investigate whether early signs of liver disease, measured by magnetic resonance imaging-derived iron-corrected T1-mapping (cT1), are risk factors for developing ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>cT1 and proton density fat fraction were measured and automatically analyzed using LiverMultiScan® software. The Fibrosis-4 index was calculated using an established formula based on age and blood markers. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the relationship between liver disease, liver biomarkers, and incident ALS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In a cohort of 533,707 individuals from UK Biobank, 24 ALS cases were identified among 28,328 participants with liver disease during the follow-up period. Among a total of 33,959 individuals with complete liver imaging data, 15 incident ALS cases were observed during a median follow-up period of 5.6 years. Individuals with liver disease had a higher risk of developing ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.35 (95% CI 4.47–12.09; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). An increase in cT1 was also associated with a higher risk of ALS. After adjusting for age, sex, Townsend deprivation index, smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, body mass index, proton density fat fraction, Fibrosis-4, and metabolic syndrome, an increase in cT1 remained significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 1.79–5.55) per 1-SD increase. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these robust results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Liver disease activity, indicated by cT1, increases the risk of developing ALS, independent of metabolic syndrome, liver fat, or fibrosis. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Changes in nuclear morphology, alterations to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), including loss, aggregation, and dysfunction of nucleoporins (Nups), and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) abnormalities have become hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous RNA sequencing data utilizing knockdown of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) identified enrichment for pathways and changes in RNAs related to nuclear morphology and showed differential expression of key nuclear targets. This suggests that dysfunction of hnRNP A1, which is observed in neurodegenerative diseases, may contribute to abnormalities in nuclear morphology, NPC, and NCT. Methods: We performed knockdown of hnRNP A1 in Neuro-2A cells, a neuronal cell line, to examine nuclear morphology, NPC, and NCT. Results: First, we examined nuclear morphology using Lamin B, wherein we observed increased nuclear envelope abnormalities in cells with hnRNP A1 knockdown as compared to control. To quantify changes in Lamin B, we designed and validated an automated computer-based model, which quantitatively confirmed our observations. Next, we investigated the impact of hnRNP A1 knockdown on components of the NPC and NCT. In line with the previous literature, we found changes in Nups, including altered distribution and reduced protein expression, as well as disrupted NCT. Finally, we validated our findings in multiple sclerosis (MS) brains, a disease with a significant neurodegenerative component caused by hnRNP A1 dysfunction, where neuronal nuclear envelope alterations were significantly increased as compared to controls. Conclusions: Together, these data implicate hnRNP A1 as an important contributor to nuclear morphology, Nup expression and distribution, and NCT and suggest that hnRNP A1 dysfunction may lead to defects in these processes in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cranioplasty (CP) is the main surgical procedure aiming to repair a morphological defect in the skull. It has been shown that early CP is useful for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to achieve functional recovery, whereas few studies have investigated the clinical effects of ultra-late CP on TBI outcomes. Methods: Here, we describe the clinical course over 2 years of a TBI patient who underwent CP 19 months after fronto-parietal decompressive craniectomy (DC) of a limited size. Results: We found that after ultra-late CP, a meaningful functional recovery (cognitive and motor), with emergence from a minimally conscious state and recovery of functional communication, was revealed. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings contribute to the actual debate on the timing of CP for this neurosurgical procedure&amp;amp;rsquo;s therapeutic success, as early CP has already been shown.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Internet addiction (IA) and related behaviors, such as Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and social media addiction (SMA), have gained increasing research attention. Studies show gender differences, with males more likely to develop gaming-related addictions and females more prone to social media and phubbing behaviors. This study aimed to explore gender differences in Internet addiction and related behaviors in a Spanish sample, with the goal of identifying predictors and gender-specific patterns of IA. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 585 participants (265 male, 320 female) aged 18 to 35 years (M = 22.11, SD = 3.08). Data were collected using standardized questionnaires to assess IA, IGD, SMA, phubbing, Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), emotional dysregulation, personality traits, and prosociality. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify gender-specific predictors of IA. Results: Males exhibited significantly higher scores for IA and IGD, while females showed higher scores for SMA and the &amp;amp;ldquo;phone obsession&amp;amp;rdquo; dimension of phubbing. No significant gender differences were found in the &amp;amp;ldquo;communication disturbance&amp;amp;rdquo; dimension of phubbing or in FoMO. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between IA and psychological as well as technological variables. Gender-specific predictors of IA included social media engagement and emotional regulation for females, while gaming behaviors and communication patterns were more relevant for males. Conclusions: These findings highlight gender differences in IA, suggesting that tailored interventions should address unique online behaviors and emotional regulation challenges in males and females. Future research should refine gender-specific patterns to develop more effective, targeted prevention and treatment strategies.</p>

                Background Spin-offs play a significant role in organizational development strategies, particularly in Islamic banking, by fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and Shariah-compliant management practices. Indonesia stands as a pioneer in implementing the dual banking system and has established a spin-off policy to foster the growth of Islamic banking. This study investigates whether the spin-off decision has a significant impact on financing risk in Indonesian Islamic banks. Methods Financing risk is measured by the non-performing financing ratio, while the spin-off decision is represented by a dummy variable equal to 1 for the post-spin-off period and 0 for the pre-spin-off period. This study utilizes data from semi-annual reports of 35 Indonesian Islamic banks and analyzes it using a dynamic panel model with the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Results The findings reveal that spin-offs significantly reduce financing risk, thereby enhancing the financial resilience and boosting investor appeal. Notably, this implies that Islamic banks operating as Islamic windows exhibit a higher level of financing risk compared to fully-fledged Islamic banks. Furthermore, a noteworthy pattern emerges that spin-off Islamic banks with substantial assets demonstrate greater risk in comparison to their counterparts with more modest assets. System GMM also confirmed the result. Conclusions Islamic banks can significantly reduce their financing risks by establishing independent Islamic banks, or spin-offs. Unlike Islamic windows, which are typically integrated within conventional banks and face higher risk levels, standalone Islamic banks offer greater flexibility and control over their operations.

                Background Physical activity plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of older adults, positively influencing various aspects of their quality of life. This study aims to explore the relationship between physical activity and body segments, as well as the risk indices of non-communicable chronic diseases in healthy elderly individuals. Methods The analyzed variables include weekly physical activity, the Postural Correction Index (PCI), measured using the system developed by Portland State University (PSU), and predictors of non-communicable chronic diseases assessed through body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio. Results The results reveal a moderate positive relationship between physical activity and the PCI (r=0.45; p≤0.05), with significant correlations in specific components of the PCI, such as thoracic depression (r=0.51; p<0.01), anteroposterior shoulder alignment (r=0.51; p<0.01), and upper back (r=0.53; p<0.001). Conclusions It is concluded that physical activity has a significant positive impact on the posture of older adults, particularly in the trunk, contributing 40% to the improvement of PCI components. The PCI values obtained, exceeding 82.67 in men and 84.67 in women according to the PSU evaluation, underscore the effectiveness of physical activity in postural correction and the prevention of issues associated with chronic diseases.

                <p>by Ted Moskovitz, Kevin J. Miller, Maneesh Sahani, Matthew M. Botvinick</p>

Dual-process theories play a central role in both psychology and neuroscience, figuring prominently in domains ranging from executive control to reward-based learning to judgment and decision making. In each of these domains, two mechanisms appear to operate concurrently, one relatively high in computational complexity, the other relatively simple. Why is neural information processing organized in this way? We propose an answer to this question based on the notion of compression. The key insight is that dual-process structure can enhance adaptive behavior by allowing an agent to minimize the description length of its own behavior. We apply a single model based on this observation to findings from research on executive control, reward-based learning, and judgment and decision making, showing that seemingly diverse dual-process phenomena can be understood as domain-specific consequences of a single underlying set of computational principles.

The <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) pathogen, the causative agent of the airborne infection tuberculosis (TB), harbors a number of mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) transporters. These membrane proteins can be separated into 2 distinct subclasses, where they perform important functional roles, and thus, are considered potential drug targets to combat TB. Previously, we reported both X-ray and cryo-EM structures of the MmpL3 transporter, providing high-resolution structural information for this subclass of the MmpL proteins. Currently, there is no structural information available for the subclass associated with MmpL4 and MmpL5, transporters that play a critical role in iron homeostasis of the bacterium. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the <i>M</i>. <i>smegmatis</i> MmpL4 and MmpL5 transporters to resolutions of 2.95 Å and 3.00 Å, respectively. These structures allow us to propose a plausible pathway for siderophore translocation via these 2 transporters, an essential step for iron acquisition that enables the survival and replication of the mycobacterium.

Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins can engage in complex interactions to detect pathogens and execute a robust immune response via downstream helper NLRs. However, the biochemical mechanisms of helper NLR activation by upstream sensor NLRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the coiled-coil helper NLR NRC2 from <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> accumulates in vivo as a homodimer that converts into a higher-order oligomer upon activation by its upstream virus disease resistance protein Rx. The cryo-EM structure of NbNRC2 in its resting state revealed intermolecular interactions that mediate homodimer formation and contribute to immune receptor autoinhibition. These dimerization interfaces have diverged between paralogous NRC proteins to insulate critical network nodes and enable redundant immune pathways, possibly to minimise undesired cross-activation and evade pathogen suppression of immunity. Our results expand the molecular mechanisms of NLR activation pointing to transition from homodimers to higher-order oligomeric resistosomes.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Clemastine has emerged as a promising therapy for the restoration of neurologic function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, clemastine and other agents with prodifferentiative effects on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in rodent models have underperformed in clinical trials. We hypothesized that the preclinical studies showed more robust effects because of the abundance of OPCs in rodent models. To better examine the therapeutic potential of clemastine, we examined its effect on demyelinated white matter lesions in rabbits, which exhibit progenitor densities and limited remyelination more closely matching those found in tissues from patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used lysolecithin to induce demyelination in white matter of New Zealand rabbits and then administered oral clemastine (10mg/kg/day) for various periods before assessing the OPC and oligodendrocyte (OL) populations in these lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Daily administration of clemastine for the full study period (56 days) increased oligodendrogenesis in white matter lesions. However, shorter durations of treatment failed to increase overall OL density despite enhancing OPC-to-OL differentiation. This effect was due to exhaustion of the OPC pool, as the differentiating progenitors were not replaced because of reduced OPC proliferation. Notably, delayed administration of clemastine led to an accumulation of activated OPCs expressing markers of senescence.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although capable of driving OL differentiation, clemastine treatment in rabbits hampered progenitor pool replenishment, induced senescence, and promoted conversion of microglia/macrophages to a proinflammatory phenotype. Whether these effects would also occur in humans or with other prodifferentiative therapies should be studied further, but our data suggest the need to carefully consider progenitor dynamics in the treatment of MS.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the advances in treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS), unremitting neurodegeneration continues to drive disability and disease progression. Smoldering/slowly expanding lesions (SELs) and dysfunction of the RNA binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) are pathologic hallmarks of MS cortex and intricately tied to disability and neurodegeneration, respectively. We hypothesized that neuronal hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and is exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (nucleocytoplasmic mislocalization of hnRNP A1) was examined in healthy control and MS brains using immunohistochemistry. MS cases were stratified by severity of hnRNP A1 pathology to examine the link between RBP dysfunction, demyelination, and neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that smoldering/SELs were only present within a subset of MS tissues characterized by elevated neuronal hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup>) in adjacent cortical gray matter. In contrast to healthy controls and MS with low hnRNP A1 pathology (MS-A1<sup>
   <i>low</i>
</sup>), MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> showed elevated markers of neurodegeneration, including neuronal loss and injury, brain atrophy, axonal loss, and axon degeneration. Additionally, we discovered a subpopulation of morphologically intact neurons lacking expression of NeuN, a neuron-specific RBP, in cortical projection neurons in MS-A1<sup>
   <i>high</i>
</sup> cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>hnRNP A1 dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration and may be exacerbated by smoldering/SELs in progressive MS. The discovery of NeuN-negative neurons suggests that some cortical neurons may only be injured and not lost. By characterizing RBP pathology in MS cortex, this study has important implications for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, the substrate of disability and disease progression.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23631?af=R">Differential role of NMDA receptors in hippocampal‐dependent spatial memory and plasticity in juvenile male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early life, or juvenility, stands out as the most pivotal phase in neurodevelopment due to its profound impact over the long-term cognition. During this period, significant changes are made in the brain's connections both within and between different areas, particularly in tandem with the development of more intricate behaviors. The hippocampus is among the brain regions that undergo significant postnatal remodeling, including dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, the formation of complex spines and neuron proliferation. Given the crucial role of the hippocampus in spatial memory processing, it has been observed that spatial memory abilities continue to develop as the hippocampus matures, particularly before puberty. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<span class="smallCaps">d</span>-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor channel is crucial for the induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation in both rodents and humans. Although extensive evidence shows the role of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity, the studies addressing the role of NMDAr in spatial memory of juveniles are sparse and mostly limited to adult males. In the present study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of systemic NMDAr blockade by the MK-801 on spatial memory (novel object location memory, OLM) and hippocampal plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of both male and female juvenile rats. Our results show the sex-dimorphic role of NMDAr in spatial memory and plasticity during juvenility, as systemic NMDAr blockade impairs the OLM and LTP in juvenile males without an effect on juvenile females. Taken together, our results demonstrate that spatial memory and hippocampal plasticity are NMDAr-dependent in juvenile males and NMDAr-independent in juvenile females. These sex-specific differences in the mechanisms of spatial memory and plasticity may imply gender-specific treatment for spatial memory disorders even in children.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23633?af=R">Estrogens dynamically regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult female rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition. How they influence the maturation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, however, is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on the maturation timeline of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized (a model of surgical menopause) young adult Sprague–Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17β-estradiol, estrone or vehicle. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused 1, 2, or 3 weeks after BrdU injection and daily hormone treatment. Brains were sectioned and processed for various markers including: sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), antigen kiel 67 (Ki67), doublecortin (DCX), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN). Immunofluorescent labeling or co-labelling of BrdU with Sox2 (progenitor cells), Sox2/GFAP (neural progenitor cells), Ki67 (cell proliferation), DCX (immature neurons), NeuN (mature neurons) was used to examine the trajectory and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estrogens had early (1 week of exposure) effects on different stages of neurogenesis (neural progenitor cells, cell proliferation and early maturation of new cells into neurons) but these effects were less pronounced after prolonged treatment. Estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced cell proliferation after 1 week but not after longer exposure to either estrogen. Both estrogens increased the density of immature neurons (BrdU/DCX-ir) after 1 week of exposure compared to vehicle treatment but this increased density was not sustained over longer durations of treatments to estrogens, suggesting that the enhancing effects of estrogens on neurogenesis were short-lived. Longer duration post-ovariectomy, without treatments with either of the estrogens, was associated with reduced neural progenitor cells in the DG. These results demonstrate that estrogens modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis differently in the short term, but may lose their ability to influence neurogenesis after long-term exposure. These findings have potential implications for treatments involving estrogens after surgical menopause.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in <i>Fmr1 KO</i> whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and <i>Fmr1 KO</i> mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during <i>Fmr1</i>-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the <i>Fmr1-</i>KO hippocampus formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23632?af=R">Spatial memory encoding is associated with the anterior and posterior hippocampus: An fMRI activation likelihood estimation meta‐analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that differential processing occurs along the longitudinal (anterior–posterior) axis of the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that spatial memory (during both encoding and retrieval) is associated with the posterior hippocampus. An alternative hypothesis is that memory encoding (either spatial or nonspatial) is associated with the anterior hippocampus and memory retrieval is associated with the posterior hippocampus. Of importance, during spatial memory encoding, the spatial–posterior hypothesis predicts posterior hippocampal involvement, whereas the encoding–retrieval hypothesis predicts anterior hippocampal involvement. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted a coordinate-based fMRI activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 26 studies (with a total of 435 participants) that reported hippocampal activity during spatial memory encoding and/or spatial memory retrieval. Both spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced extensive activity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus as well as the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the parahippocampal cortex. Critically, the contrast of spatial memory encoding and spatial memory retrieval produced activations in both the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus. That spatial memory encoding produced activity in both the anterior and posterior hippocampus can be taken to reject strict forms of the spatial–posterior hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of spatial memory produce activity in the posterior hippocampus, and the encoding–retrieval hypothesis, which stipulates that all forms of encoding versus retrieval produce activity in only the anterior hippocampus. Our results indicate that spatial memory encoding can involve the anterior hippocampus and the posterior hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23635?af=R">Time cells in the retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a key component of the brain's memory systems, with anatomical connections to the hippocampus, anterior thalamus, and entorhinal cortex. This circuit has been implicated in episodic memory and many of these structures have been shown to encode temporal information, which is critical for episodic memory. For example, hippocampal time cells reliably fire during specific segments of time during a delay period. Although RSC lesions are known to disrupt temporal memory, time cells have not been observed there. In this study, we reanalyzed archival RSC neuronal firing data during the intertrial delay period from two previous experiments involving different behavioral tasks, a blocked alternation task and a cued T-maze task. For the blocked alternation task, rats were required to approach the east or west arm of a plus maze for reward during different blocks of trials. Because the reward locations were not cued, the rat had to remember the goal location for each trial. In the cued T-maze task, the reward location was explicitly cued with a light and the rats simply had to approach the light for reward, so there was no requirement to hold a memory during the intertrial delay. Time cells were prevalent in the blocked alternation task, and most time cells clearly differentiated the east and west trials. We also found that RSC neurons could exhibit off-response time fields, periods of reliably inhibited firing. Time cells were also observed in the cued T-maze, but they were less prevalent and they did not differentiate left and right trials as well as in the blocked alternation task, suggesting that RSC time cells are sensitive to the memory demands of the task. These results suggest that temporal coding is a prominent feature of RSC firing patterns, consistent with an RSC role in episodic memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23637?af=R">Curved multiplanar reformatting allows the accurate histological delineation of hippocampal subfields</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfields perform specific roles in normal cognitive functioning and have distinct vulnerabilities in neurological disorders. However, measurement of subfields with MRI is technically difficult in the head and tail of the hippocampus. Recent studies have utilized curved multiplanar reconstruction (CMPR) to improve subfield visualization in the head and tail, but this method has not yet been applied to histological data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We utilized BigBrain data, an open-source database of serially sectioned histological data for our analyses. The left hippocampus was segmented according to histological criteria by two raters in order to evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability of histology-based segmentation throughout the long axis. Segmentation according to our previous protocol for the hippocampal body was then compared to these histological measurements to evaluate for histological validity. Agreement between segmentations was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intra-rater reliability (DSCs) of histological segmentation was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8599), CA2 (0.7586), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8907), SLM (0.9123), subiculum (0.8149). Similarly, inter-rater reliability analysis demonstrated excellent agreement (DSCs) for all subfield locations: CA1 (0.8203), CA2 (0.7253), CA3/CA4/DG (0.8439), SLM (0.8700), subiculum (0.7794). Finally, histological accuracy (DSCs) for our previous protocol was excellent for all subfields: CA1 (0.8821), CA2 (0.8810), CA3/CA4/DG (0.9802), SLM (0.9879), subiculum (0.8774). When subfields in the hippocampus head, body, and tail were analyzed independently, DSCs also showed excellent agreement.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>CMPR allows reliable subfield segmentation based on histological criteria throughout the hippocampal head, body, and tail. Our previous protocol for the hippocampal body can be applied to provide histologically valid subfield measurements throughout the entire hippocampal long axis.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite bilateral hippocampal damage dating to the perinatal or early childhood period and severely impaired episodic memory, patients with developmental amnesia continue to exhibit well-developed semantic memory across the developmental trajectory. Detailed information on the extent and focality of brain damage in these patients is needed to hypothesize about the neural substrate that supports their remarkable capacity for encoding and retrieval of semantic memory. In particular, we need to assess whether the residual hippocampal tissue is involved in this preservation, or whether the surrounding cortical areas reorganize to rescue aspects of these critical cognitive memory processes after early injury. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, automatic (FreeSurfer) and manual segmentation to characterize structural changes in the brain of an exceptionally large cohort of 23 patients with developmental amnesia in comparison with 32 control subjects. Both the VBM and the FreeSurfer analyses revealed severe structural alterations in the hippocampus and thalamus of patients with developmental amnesia. Milder damage was found in the amygdala, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Manual segmentation demonstrated differences in the degree of atrophy of the hippocampal subregions in patients. The level of atrophy in CA-DG subregions and subicular complex was more than 40%, while the atrophy of the uncus was moderate (−24%). Anatomo-functional correlations were observed between the volumes of residual hippocampal subregions in patients and selective aspects of their cognitive performance, viz, intelligence, working memory, and verbal and visuospatial recall. Our findings suggest that in patients with developmental amnesia, cognitive processing is compromised as a function of the extent of atrophy in hippocampal subregions. More severe hippocampal damage may be more likely to promote structural and/or functional reorganization in areas connected to the hippocampus. In this hypothesis, different levels of hippocampal function may be rescued following this variable reorganization. Our findings document not only the extent, but also the limits of circuit reorganization occurring in the young brain after early bilateral hippocampal damage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23639?af=R">A combined DTI‐fMRI approach for optimizing the delineation of posteromedial versus anterolateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the entorhinal cortex (EC), attempts have been made to identify the human homologue regions of the medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subregions using either functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, there are still discrepancies between entorhinal subdivisions depending on the choice of connectivity seed regions and the imaging modality used. While DTI can be used to follow the white matter tracts of the brain, fMRI can identify functionally connected brain regions. In this study, we used both DTI and resting-state fMRI in 103 healthy adults to investigate both structural and functional connectivity between the EC and associated cortical brain regions. Differential connectivity with these regions was then used to predict the locations of the human homologues of MEC and LEC. Our results from combining DTI and fMRI support a subdivision into posteromedial (pmEC) and anterolateral (alEC) EC and reveal a confined border between the pmEC and alEC. Furthermore, the EC subregions obtained by either imaging modality showed similar distinct whole-brain connectivity profiles. Optimizing the delineation of the human homologues of MEC and LEC with a combined, cross-validated DTI-fMRI approach allows to define a likely border between the two subdivisions and has implications for both cognitive and translational neuroscience research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23636?af=R">Hippocampal storage and recall of neocortical “What”–“Where” representations</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A key question for understanding the function of the hippocampus in memory is how information is recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. This was investigated in a neuronal network model of the hippocampal system in which “What” and “Where” neuronal firing rate vectors were applied to separate neocortical modules, which then activated entorhinal cortex “What” and “Where” modules, then the dentate gyrus, then CA3, then CA1, then the entorhinal cortex, and then the backprojections to the neocortex. A rate model showed that the whole system could be trained to recall “Where” in the neocortex from “What” applied as a retrieval cue to the neocortex, and could in principle be trained up towards the theoretical capacity determined largely by the number of synapses onto any one neuron divided by the sparseness of the representation. The trained synaptic weights were then imported into an integrate-and-fire simulation of the same architecture, which showed that the time from presenting a retrieval cue to a neocortex module to recall the whole memory in the neocortex is approximately 100 ms. This is sufficiently fast for the backprojection synapses to be trained onto the still active neocortical neurons during storage of the episodic memory, and this is needed for recall to operate correctly to the neocortex. These simulations also showed that the long loop neocortex–hippocampus–neocortex that operates continuously in time may contribute to complete recall in the neocortex; but that this positive feedback long loop makes the whole dynamical system inherently liable to a pathological increase in neuronal activity. Important factors that contributed to stability included increased inhibition in CA3 and CA1 to keep the firing rates low; and temporal adaptation of the neuronal firing and of active synapses, which are proposed to make an important contribution to stabilizing runaway excitation in cortical circuits in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1249/v1?src=rss">Can indoor plants reduce formaldehyde levels in the anatomy dissection hall? A study to evaluate the practicality of using plants in reducing formaldehyde levels [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Formaldehyde a commonly used embalming fluid for the preservation of cadavers, produces numerous short and long-term side effects on the students and staff working with it. Indoor plants have been shown to reduce atmospheric formaldehyde levels. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air to levels deemed safe by WHO standards Methods The study was conducted in the storage room of the Anatomical dissection hall. 7 potted plants of one variety were kept in the storage room for 14 days and the Formaldehyde reading was measured using a VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) monitor. Then the same was done with no plant. This cycle was repeated 2 more times, with two different plant species. The three spieces of plants used for this study were as follows: Dracaena trifasciata, Epipremnum aureum, Spathiphyllum. Results The results were analysed and compared and it was determined that the effect of having a plant present versus having no plant present on the Formaldehyde concentration in the air was inconclusive as Dracaena trifasciata failed to reject the null hypothesis altogether (p-value>0.05), while Epipremnum aureum and Spathiphyllum rejected the null hypothesis (p-value<0.05), however they both had a weak positive correlation with formaldehyde concentration. Conclusion The efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air needs to be further explored and validated since all the prior studies conducted were in controlled environment and should be done in a real time scenario for its practical and beneficial uses.

                Background Antimicrobial resistance is increasing at an alarming rate. The use of antibiotics without a prescription by a patient or other family members and their inappropriate storage have caused serious health issues as it would lead to antibiotic resistance and exposure to the risk of harmful adverse effects unnecessarily. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the current behaviour of antibiotic usage, storage, re-usage and misuse among the residents of Saudi Arabia. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. Our target study population was the residents of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected by an online questionnaire and analysed by SPSS. Results A total of 738 participants answered the online questionnaire from all ages, genders, nationalities, and socioeconomic backgrounds residing in different regions across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 76.42% knew that an antibiotic is a chemical substance used to treat infections. The participants were questioned about when they started using antibiotics, to which 95.66% (n=706) responded after consulting a physician, 3.25% (n=24) said when they felt ill for any reason, and 1.08% (n=8) replied after first attempting herbal medicine. A total of 147 participants admitted that they store excess pills of antibiotics after being prescribed for an infection and reuse them later on for symptoms like sore throat and fever. Conclusions The results indicated that nearly half of the participants used leftover antibiotics. Participants having children in their homes significantly reuse antibiotics. However, one-third of the participants didn’t complete the antibiotics course. A large portion of the population, regardless of age, level of education, or professional background, have continued to store leftover antibiotics after an infection treatment and reuse them once they think they need them for new symptoms. This advice further revises the current measures to fill those gaps and reduce this habit.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94970">Population clustering of structural brain aging and its association with brain development</a></h4>

              
                Structural brain aging has demonstrated strong inter-individual heterogeneity and mirroring patterns with brain development. However, due to the lack of large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies, most of the existing research focused on the cross-sectional changes of brain aging. In this investigation, we present a data-driven approach that incorporate both cross-sectional changes and longitudinal trajectories of structural brain aging and identified two brain aging patterns among 37,013 healthy participants from UK Biobank. Participants with accelerated brain aging also demonstrated accelerated biological aging, cognitive decline and increased genetic susceptibilities to major neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, by integrating longitudinal neuroimaging studies from a multi-center adolescent cohort, we validated the ‘last in, first out’ mirroring hypothesis and identified brain regions with manifested mirroring patterns between brain aging and brain development. Genomic analyses revealed risk loci and genes contributing to accelerated brain aging and delayed brain development, providing molecular basis for elucidating the biological mechanisms underlying brain aging and related disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90859">Direct observation of the neural computations underlying a single decision</a></h4>

              
                Neurobiological investigations of perceptual decision-making have furnished the first glimpse of a flexible cognitive process at the level of single neurons. Neurons in the parietal and prefrontal cortex are thought to represent the accumulation of noisy evidence, acquired over time, leading to a decision. Neural recordings averaged over many decisions have provided support for the deterministic rise in activity to a termination bound. Critically, it is the unobserved stochastic component that is thought to confer variability in both choice and decision time. Here, we elucidate this drift-diffusion signal on individual decisions. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex of monkeys while they made decisions about the direction of random dot motion. We show that a single scalar quantity, derived from the weighted sum of the population activity, represents a combination of deterministic drift and stochastic diffusion. Moreover, we provide direct support for the hypothesis that this drift-diffusion signal approximates the quantity responsible for the variability in choice and reaction times. The population-derived signals rely on a small subset of neurons with response fields that overlap the choice targets. These neurons represent the integral of noisy evidence. Another subset of direction-selective neurons with response fields that overlap the motion stimulus appear to represent the integrand. This parsimonious architecture would escape detection by state-space analyses, absent a clear hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93312">Integrative study of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction in a murine pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia model</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common pancreatic cancer, is a deadly cancer, often diagnosed late and resistant to current therapies. PDAC patients are frequently affected by cachexia characterized by muscle mass and strength loss (sarcopenia) contributing to patient frailty and poor therapeutic response. This study assesses the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial remodeling in the cachectic skeletal muscle, through an integrative exploration combining functional, morphological, and omics-based evaluation of gastrocnemius muscle from KIC genetically engineered mice developing autochthonous pancreatic tumor and cachexia. Cachectic PDAC KIC mice exhibit severe sarcopenia with loss of muscle mass and strength associated with reduced muscle fiber’s size and induction of protein degradation processes. Mitochondria in PDAC atrophied muscles show reduced respiratory capacities and structural alterations, associated with deregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dynamics pathways. Beyond the metabolic pathways known to be altered in sarcopenic muscle (carbohydrates, proteins, and redox), lipid and nucleic acid metabolisms are also affected. Although the number of mitochondria per cell is not altered, mitochondrial mass shows a twofold decrease and the mitochondrial DNA threefold, suggesting a defect in mitochondrial genome homeostasis. In conclusion, this work provides a framework to guide toward the most relevant targets in the clinic to limit PDAC-induced cachexia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95402">A neurotransmitter atlas of C. elegans males and hermaphrodites</a></h4>

              
                Mapping neurotransmitter identities to neurons is key to understanding information flow in a nervous system. It also provides valuable entry points for studying the development and plasticity of neuronal identity features. In the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nervous system, neurotransmitter identities have been largely assigned by expression pattern analysis of neurotransmitter pathway genes that encode neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or transporters. However, many of these assignments have relied on multicopy reporter transgenes that may lack relevant <i>cis</i>-regulatory information and therefore may not provide an accurate picture of neurotransmitter usage. We analyzed the expression patterns of 16 CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in reporter strains for all main types of neurotransmitters in <i>C. elegans</i> (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine) in both the hermaphrodite and the male. Our analysis reveals novel sites of expression of these neurotransmitter systems within both neurons and glia, as well as non-neural cells, most notably in gonadal cells. The resulting expression atlas defines neurons that may be exclusively neuropeptidergic, substantially expands the repertoire of neurons capable of co-transmitting multiple neurotransmitters, and identifies novel sites of monoaminergic neurotransmitter uptake. Furthermore, we also observed unusual co-expression patterns of monoaminergic synthesis pathway genes, suggesting the existence of novel monoaminergic transmitters. Our analysis results in what constitutes the most extensive whole-animal-wide map of neurotransmitter usage to date, paving the way for a better understanding of neuronal communication and neuronal identity specification in <i>C. elegans</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90349">Trans regulation of an odorant binding protein by a proto-Y chromosome affects male courtship in house fly</a></h4>

              
                The male-limited inheritance of Y chromosomes favors alleles that increase male fitness, often at the expense of female fitness. Determining the mechanisms underlying these sexually antagonistic effects is challenging because it can require studying Y-linked alleles while they still segregate as polymorphisms. We used a Y chromosome polymorphism in the house fly, <i>Musca domestica</i>, to address this challenge. Two male determining Y chromosomes (Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup>) segregate as stable polymorphisms in natural populations, and they differentially affect multiple traits, including male courtship performance. We identified differentially expressed genes encoding odorant binding proteins (in the <i>Obp56h</i> family) as candidate agents for the courtship differences. Through network analysis and allele-specific expression measurements, we identified multiple genes on the house fly III<sup>M</sup> chromosome that could serve as <i>trans</i> regulators of <i>Obp56h</i> gene expression. One of those genes is homologous to <i>Drosophila melanogaster CG2120</i>, which encodes a transcription factor that binds near <i>Obp56h</i>. Upregulation of <i>CG2120</i> in <i>D. melanogaster</i> nervous tissues reduces copulation latency, consistent with this transcription factor acting as a negative regulator of <i>Obp56h</i> expression. The transcription factor gene, which we name <i>speed date</i>, demonstrates a molecular mechanism by which a Y-linked gene can evolve male-beneficial effects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93981">Intrinsic dynamics of randomly clustered networks generate place fields and preplay of novel environments</a></h4>

              
                During both sleep and awake immobility, hippocampal place cells reactivate time-compressed versions of sequences representing recently experienced trajectories in a phenomenon known as replay. Intriguingly, spontaneous sequences can also correspond to forthcoming trajectories in novel environments experienced later, in a phenomenon known as preplay. Here, we present a model showing that sequences of spikes correlated with the place fields underlying spatial trajectories in both previously experienced and future novel environments can arise spontaneously in neural circuits with random, clustered connectivity rather than pre-configured spatial maps. Moreover, the realistic place fields themselves arise in the circuit from minimal, landmark-based inputs. We find that preplay quality depends on the network’s balance of cluster isolation and overlap, with optimal preplay occurring in small-world regimes of high clustering yet short path lengths. We validate the results of our model by applying the same place field and preplay analyses to previously published rat hippocampal place cell data. Our results show that clustered recurrent connectivity can generate spontaneous preplay and immediate replay of novel environments. These findings support a framework whereby novel sensory experiences become associated with preexisting “pluripotent” internal neural activity patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96459">Transcriptomic profiling of Schlemm’s canal cells reveals a lymphatic-biased identity and three major cell states</a></h4>

              
                Schlemm’s canal (SC) is central in intraocular pressure regulation but requires much characterization. It has distinct inner and outer walls, each composed of Schlemm’s canal endothelial cells (SECs) with different morphologies and functions. Recent transcriptomic studies of the anterior segment added important knowledge, but were limited in power by SEC numbers or did not focus on SC. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of SC biology, we performed bulk RNA sequencing on C57BL/6 J SC, blood vessel, and lymphatic endothelial cells from limbal tissue (~4,500 SECs). We also analyzed mouse limbal tissues by single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (C57BL/6 J and 129/Sj strains), successfully sequencing 903 individual SECs. Together, these datasets confirm that SC has molecular characteristics of both blood and lymphatic endothelia with a lymphatic phenotype predominating. SECs are enriched in pathways that regulate cell-cell junction formation pointing to the importance of junctions in determining SC fluid permeability. Importantly, and for the first time, our analyses characterize three molecular classes of SECs, molecularly distinguishing inner wall from outer wall SECs and discovering two inner wall cell states that likely result from local environmental differences. Further, and based on ligand and receptor expression patterns, we document key interactions between SECs and cells of the adjacent trabecular meshwork (TM) drainage tissue. Also, we present cell type expression for a collection of human glaucoma genes. These data provide a new molecular foundation that will enable the functional dissection of key homeostatic processes mediated by SECs as well as the development of new glaucoma therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94520">The ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate ameliorates neurodevelopmental deficits in the GABAergic system of daf-18/PTEN Caenorhabditis elegans mutants</a></h4>

              
                A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature in various types of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in <i>Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN)</i>, the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether <i>PTEN</i> deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neuromuscular system, where both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) inputs regulate muscle activity, we found that <i>daf-18</i>/<i>PTEN</i> mutations impact GABAergic (but not cholinergic) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in <i>daf-18/PTEN</i> mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. Ketogenic diets (KGDs) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. However, the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive. We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in <i>daf-18/PTEN</i> mutants. Our study provides valuable insights into the link between <i>PTEN</i> mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs.

	<p>(1) Background. Neurofeedback has been used in sports since the 1990s, frequently showing positive outcomes in enhancing athletic performance. This systematic review provides an updated analysis of neurofeedback training in sports, evaluating reaction time, cognitive performance, and emotional regulation to address literature gaps and suggest future research directions. (2) Methods. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases for articles published from January 2016 to April 2023. The search included only original articles written in English, resulting in 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. (3) Results. The reviewed studies cover a wide range of sports, including golf, basketball, swimming, rifle shooting, football, volleyball, athletics, judo, ice hockey, triathlon, handball, fencing, taekwondo, and darts. They involved athletes of varying experience levels (beginners, professionals, and experts) and utilized neurofeedback training targeting different frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta, and SMR), either individually or in mixed protocols. Findings show improvements in sports and cognitive performance, emotional regulation, and anxiety management. (4) Conclusions. This systematic review supports the effectiveness of neurofeedback in enhancing sports and cognitive performance across various disciplines and experience levels. Notable improvements were observed in technical skills, physical performance parameters, scoring, attention, concentration, reaction time, short-term and working memory, self-regulation, and cognitive anxiety. Future research should standardize protocols, include more diverse samples, and explore long-term effects to further validate these findings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Figurative language is a central tool for enriching spoken and written languages, and it is important for building social relationships. Difficulties in figurative language understanding may impair social adjustment. Some studies have found more gaps in the understanding of irony and idioms among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to those of their peers with typical development (TD). To date, no studies have examined the relationship between the ability to understand social situations (as a separate ability) and the ability to understand irony and idioms. The present study examined the roles of theory of mind (ToM) and social situation understanding in the comprehension of idioms and ironic criticism. Methods: The current study included 58 participants aged 8&amp;amp;ndash;11, including 28 children with high-functioning ASD and 30 children with TD matched by age, gender, and nonverbal intelligence. All the participants completed a ToM questionnaire that assesses their understanding of others&amp;amp;rsquo; intentions, as well as a questionnaire pertaining to their comprehension of social situations, ironic criticism, and idioms. Results: TD children outperformed the autistic children in idiom and irony understanding, as well as in ToM and social situation understanding. Understanding social situations and ToM contributed to idiom and irony understanding, with ToM ability uniquely contributing to irony (but not to idiom) understanding. Path analysis revealed that social cognitive abilities mediated the link between group affiliation and vocabulary, affecting figurative language comprehension. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that social cognition skills influence the ability to understand ironic criticism and idioms, mediating the association between vocabulary and figurative language comprehension.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To provide a basis for further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes-associated mild cognitive impairment (DCI) using two bioinformatics methods to screen key genes involved in the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and type 2 diabetes. Methods: RNA sequencing data of MCI and normal cognition groups, as well as expression profile and sample information data of clinical characteristic data of GSE63060, which contains 160 MCI samples and 104 normal samples, were downloaded from the GEO database. Hub genes were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Protein&amp;amp;ndash;protein interaction (PPI) analysis, combined with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, was used to verify the genes. Moreover, RNA sequencing and clinical characteristic data for GSE166502 of 13 type 2 diabetes samples and 13 normal controls were downloaded from the GEO database, and the correlation between the screened genes and type 2 diabetes was verified by difference and ROC curve analyses. In addition, we collected clinical biopsies to validate the results. Results: Based on WGCNA, 10 modules were integrated, and six were correlated with MCI. Six hub genes associated with MCI (TOMM7, SNRPG, COX7C, UQCRQ, RPL31, and RPS24) were identified using the LASSO algorithm. The ROC curve was screened by integrating the GEO database, and revealed COX7C, SNRPG, TOMM7, and RPS24 as key genes in the progression of type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: COX7C, SNRPG, TOMM7, and RPS24 are involved in MCI and type 2 diabetes progression. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms of these four genes in the development of type 2 diabetes-associated MCI should be studied.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Co-occurring mental health conditions affect autistic individuals at high rates, impacting their well-being and quality of life. Mental health conditions are often appropriate treatment targets that can improve the lives of autistic individuals. Because of this, there is growing interest in predictors of mental health and behavioral outcomes. Given the rapidly evolving evidence base and growing literature using longitudinal cohorts, it is unclear which predictors of symptoms of anxiety and depression are consistent, and which are not. Additionally, it is difficult to deduce which predictors of mental health symptoms at a given time also predict change over time. This can be partially due to the different statistical approaches that are implemented, including trajectory vs. non-trajectory methodologies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate how non-trajectory and trajectory analyses inform our knowledge of how symptoms of anxiety and depression change over time. Additionally, we aimed to identify important predictors of change and later anxiety and depressive symptoms in autistic individuals. Results: There is variability in symptoms of anxiety and depression in autistic individuals. Adaptive skills arose as significant predictors of change and of later symptoms of both anxiety and depression. Peer relationships in school age seem to be particularly important in predicting later symptoms of depression. Conclusions: This review provides evidence that there are different trajectories and different patterns of mental health symptoms over the lifespan, providing further evidence that autism is a developmental condition that changes over time in different ways for different people. Implications and future directions are further discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1246/v1?src=rss">Effects of aquatic and dry land physiotherapy on the functional capacity in individuals with and without parkinson's disease: a protocol study followed by a randomized clinical trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), particularly those with the rigid-akinetic with postural instability (RA) subtype, often experience motor symptoms that impair functionality and postural control. Physiotherapy interventions, including both dry land and aquatic therapies, can help manage PD treatment. This study aimed to develop and assess the effects of two exercise protocols emphasizing the extensor musculature of the vertebral column (dry land and shallow water) on functional capacity in individuals with and without RA-type PD. Methods The study utilized a protocol study followed by a randomized clinical trial, with the registry number NCT04863118, involving ten RA-type PD (intervention group) and ten individuals without PD (reference group). Participants underwent exercise protocols of varying intensity levels, and their pre and post-intervention functional capacity were evaluated using standardized tests. The applicability and safety of these protocols were assessed through a self-perception questionnaire. Results Significant improvements were observed in functional capacity parameters following both dry land and aquatic physiotherapy interventions among PD individuals, including increased repetitions in the Sit-to-Stand test and reduced completion time in the Timed Up and Go test. Similar positive outcomes were observed in individuals without PD, indicating the efficacy of these interventions irrespective of PD status. Conclusion A single session of physiotherapy, whether on dry land or in shallow water, focusing on the extensor musculature of the vertebral column, enhances functional capacity in PD and non-PD individuals alike. Furthermore, the protocols demonstrated safety, comfort, and acceptability, promoting treatment adherence and future recommendations. These findings support the implementation of these protocols in clinical practice, aiding therapists in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes while ensuring individual safety.

                Abstract Background Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant global health threat, with increasing prevalence worldwide, including in Indonesia. Despite the public health impact, comprehensive data on the burden of CRE in Indonesia remains fragmented. This protocol outlines a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to estimate the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia, summarize trends over time, and identify key resistance mechanisms. Methods We will conduct a systematic search across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and local Indonesian databases, for studies reporting the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia from 2008 to 2024. Eligibility criteria include observational studies (cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control) and surveillance reports. Data extraction will focus on CRE prevalence, bacterial species, sample types, resistance mechanisms, and study settings (hospital vs. community). Quality assessment of studies will be performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis will be conducted using a random-effects model to estimate pooled prevalence, and subgroup analysis will explore variations by geographical region, period, and healthcare setting. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive overview of CRE prevalence in Indonesia, contributing to an improved understanding of the national burden and resistance patterns. The findings will guide public health policies and inform antimicrobial stewardship efforts in Indonesia. Registration PROSPERO CRD42024580177

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0192-24.2024?rss=1">Distinct Roles of Medial Prefrontal Cortex Subregions in the Consolidation and Recall of Remote Spatial Memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is a common belief that memories, over time, become progressively independent of the hippocampus and are gradually stored in cortical areas. This view is mainly based on evidence showing that prefrontal cortex (PFC) manipulations impair the retrieval of remote memories, while hippocampal inhibition does not. More controversial is whether activity in the medial PFC is required immediately after learning to initiate consolidation. Another question concerns functional differences among PFC subregions in forming and storing remote memories. To address these issues, we directly contrasted the effects of loss-of-function manipulations of the anterior cingulate cortex (aCC) and the ventromedial PFC, which includes the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices, before testing and immediately after training on the ability of CD1 mice to recall the hidden platform location in the Morris water maze. We injected an AAV carrying the hM4Di receptor into the PL&ndash;IL or aCC. Interestingly, pretest administrations of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 3&nbsp;mg/kg) revealed that the aCC, but not the PL&ndash;IL, was necessary to recall remote spatial information. Furthermore, systemic post-training administration of CNO impaired memory recall at remote, but not recent, time points in both groups. These findings revealed a functional dissociation between the two prefrontal areas, demonstrating that both the PL&ndash;IL and the aCC are involved in early consolidation of remote spatial memories, but only the aCC is engaged in their recall.</p>

                <p>The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway is vital in neural progenitor cell proliferation, specification, and differentiation. The BMP signaling antagonist Gremlin 2 (Grem2) is the most potent natural inhibitor of BMP expressed in the adult brain; however its function remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we have analyzed mice lacking Grem2 via homologous recombination (<I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I>). Histological analysis of brain sections revealed significant scattering of CA3 pyramidal cells within the dentate hilus in the hippocampus of <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice. Furthermore, the number of proliferating neural stem cells and neuroblasts was significantly decreased in the subgranular zone of <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice compared with that of wild-type (WT) controls. Due to the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in neurological disorders, we tested mice on a battery of neurobehavioral tests. <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice exhibited increased anxiety on the elevated zero maze in response to acute and chronic stress. Specifically, male <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice showed increased anxiogenesis following chronic stress, and this was correlated with higher levels of BMP signaling and decreased proliferation in the dentate gyrus. Additionally, when chemically challenged with kainic acid, <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice displayed a higher susceptibility to and increased severity of seizures compared with WTs. Together, our data indicate that Grem2 regulates BMP signaling and is vital in maintaining homeostasis in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and structure. Furthermore, the lack of Grem2 contributes to the development and progression of neurogenesis-related disorders such as anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                Salivary gland cancers (SGC) are rare neoplasms that exhibit a wide array of histological heterogeneities. Most patients presenting with SGCs are asymptomatic, as they are typically slow-growing and localized. Primary surgical resection is the cornerstone treatment for SGCs and radiotherapy is performed in selected cases. There is no consensus on concrete standard post-operative guidelines. Patients are followed-up for years, however an agreed duration of follow-up is less elucidated in the literature present on the subject. Distant metastases are the primary cause of treatment failure. Post-operative diagnostic evidence of disease recurrence or distant metastases is heavily guided by radiological examinations. Patients with SGCs have better outcomes with a well-structured and lengthy follow-up plan. This review aims to suggest an appropriate follow-up duration and radiological modalities used post-operatively for SGC patients.

                Abstract Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through customization process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of customizing their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-191/v3?src=rss">Clinical rationale for dietary lutein supplementation in long COVID and mRNA vaccine injury syndromes [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Lutein, a plant-derived xanthophyl-carotenoid, is an exceptional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituent found in food. High dietary intake of lutein is beneficial against eye disease, improves cardiometabolic health, protects from neurodegenerative diseases, and is beneficial for liver, kidney, and respiratory health. Lutein protects against oxidative and nitrosative stress, both of which play a major role in long COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Lutein is an important natural agent for therapeutic use against oxidative and nitrosative stress in chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. It can also potentially inhibit spike protein-induced inflammation. Rich dietary supplementation of lutein, naturally derived in non-biodegradable Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), can most optimally be used against oxidative and nitrosative stress during post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Due to its high oleic acid (OA) content, EVOO supports optimal absorption of dietary lutein. The main molecular pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces pathology, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated B cells (NF-κB) and activated protein (AP)-1, can be suppressed by lutein. Synergy with other natural compounds for spike protein detoxification is likely.

                Long-read sequencing technologies have transformed the field of epigenetics by enabling direct, single-base resolution detection of DNA modifications, such as methylation. This produces novel opportunities for studying the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation, imprinting, and disease. However, the unique characteristics of long-read data, including the modBAM format and extended read lengths, necessitate the development of specialised software tools for effective analysis. The NanoMethViz package provides a suite of tools for loading in long-read methylation data, visualising data at various data resolutions. It can convert the data for use with other Bioconductor software such as bsseq, DSS, dmrseq and edgeR to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In this workflow article, we demonstrate the process of converting modBAM files into formats suitable for comprehensive downstream analysis. We leverage NanoMethViz to conduct an exploratory analysis, visually summarizing differences between samples, examining aggregate methylation profiles across gene and CpG islands, and investigating methylation patterns within specific regions at the single-read level. Additionally, we illustrate the use of dmrseq for identifying DMRs and show how to integrate these findings into gene-level visualization plots. Our analysis is applied to a triplicate dataset of haplotyped long-read methylation data from mouse neural stem cells, allowing us to visualize and compare the characteristics of the parental alleles on chromosome 7. By applying DMR analysis, we recover DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualise the methylation patterns of these genes summarised at single-read resolution. Through DMR analysis, we identify DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualize their methylation patterns at single-read resolution. This streamlined workflow is adaptable to common experimental designs and offers flexibility in the choice of upstream data sources and downstream statistical analysis tools.

                <p>by Natchapon Srinak, Porntip Chiewchankaset, Saowalak Kalapanulak, Pornpan Panichnumsin, Treenut Saithong</p>

The efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking. Here, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model (mmGEM) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB). Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates (OLRs) increased, along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs (L-OLRs) and adaptation to high OLRs (H-OLRs). The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide (S) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria and can be classified into two different lifecycles. Virulent phages (or lytic phages) have a lytic cycle that can lyse the bacteria host after their infection. Temperate phages (or lysogenic phages) can integrate their phage genomes into bacterial chromosomes and replicate with bacterial hosts via the lysogenic cycle. Identifying phage lifecycles is a crucial step in developing suitable applications for phages. Compared to the complicated traditional biological experiments, several tools have been designed for predicting phage lifecycle using different algorithms, such as random forest (RF), linear support-vector classifier (SVC), and convolutional neural network (CNN). In this study, we developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based tool—DeepPL—for predicting phage lifecycles via nucleotide sequences. The test results showed that our DeepPL had an accuracy of 94.65% with a sensitivity of 92.24% and a specificity of 95.91%. Moreover, DeepPL had 100% accuracy in lifecycle prediction on the phages we isolated and biologically verified previously in the lab. Additionally, a mock phage community metagenomic dataset was used to test the potential usage of DeepPL in viral metagenomic research. DeepPL displayed a 100% accuracy for individual phage complete genomes and high accuracies ranging from 71.14% to 100% on phage contigs produced by various next-generation sequencing technologies. Overall, our study indicates that DeepPL has a reliable performance on phage lifecycle prediction using the most fundamental nucleotide sequences and can be applied to future phage and metagenomic research.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease influenced by well-established environmental exposures (most notably, cigarette smoking) and incompletely defined genetic factors. The chromosome 4q region harbors multiple genetic risk loci for COPD, including signals near <i>HHIP</i>, <i>FAM13A</i>, <i>GSTCD</i>, <i>TET2</i>, and <i>BTC</i>. Leveraging RNA-Seq data from lung tissue in COPD cases and controls, we estimated the co-expression network for genes in the 4q region bounded by <i>HHIP</i> and <i>BTC</i> (~70MB), through partial correlations informed by protein-protein interactions. We identified several co-expressed gene pairs based on partial correlations, including <i>NPNT-HHIP</i>, <i>BTC</i>-<i>NPNT</i> and <i>FAM13A</i>-<i>TET2</i>, which were replicated in independent lung tissue cohorts. Upon clustering the co-expression network, we observed that four genes previously associated to COPD: <i>BTC</i>, <i>HHIP</i>, <i>NPNT</i> and <i>PPM1K</i> appeared in the same network community. Finally, we discovered a sub-network of genes differentially co-expressed between COPD vs controls (including <i>FAM13A</i>, <i>PPA2</i>, <i>PPM1K</i> and <i>TET2)</i>. Many of these genes were previously implicated in cell-based knock-out experiments, including the knocking out of <i>SPP1</i> which belongs to the same genomic region and could be a potential local key regulatory gene. These analyses identify chromosome 4q as a region enriched for COPD genetic susceptibility and differential co-expression.

Neurocristopathies such as CHARGE syndrome result from aberrant neural crest development. A large proportion of CHARGE cases are attributed to pathogenic variants in the gene encoding CHD7, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7, which remodels chromatin. While the role for CHD7 in neural crest development is well documented, how this factor is specifically up-regulated in neural crest cells is not understood. Here, we use epigenomic profiling of chick and human neural crest to identify a cohort of enhancers regulating <i>Chd7</i> expression in neural crest cells and other tissues. We functionally validate upstream transcription factor binding at candidate enhancers, revealing novel epistatic relationships between neural crest master regulators and Chd7, showing tissue-specific regulation of a globally acting chromatin remodeller. Furthermore, we find conserved enhancer features in human embryonic epigenomic data and validate the activity of the human equivalent <i>CHD7</i> enhancers in the chick embryo. Our findings embed <i>Chd7</i> in the neural crest gene regulatory network and offer potentially clinically relevant elements for interpreting CHARGE syndrome cases without causative allocation.

                Introduction Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease affecting quality of life and causing pruritus. The factors influencing itch and its impact on the quality of life in Thai psoriasis patients are unknown. We aimed to identify these factors and their effect on quality of life. Methods In this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, we included patients with psoriasis who received treatment at Chulabhorn Hospital in Thailand from January 2019 to July 2021. Interviewer is the non-dermatologist practician. The patient’s information was collected, including demographic data, Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS) score, factors affecting itch, and score on the Thai version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). We performed descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results Of 100 participants, most (99%) experienced itching, with a moderate degree of pruritus (mean Itch NRS score 6.5 ± 2.6) and a moderate effect on quality of life (mean DLQI score 9.4 ± 6.2). Factors associated with itch aggravation were dry skin (p-value = 0.003) and heat and humidity (p-value = 0.042). The results of binary logistic regression revealed that factors associated with moderate-to-extremely large DLQI scores were itch intensity (no-to-mild vs. moderate-to-severe itch: odds ratio [OR] = 13.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.72–65.32, p < 0.001; and adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 31.17; 95% CI = 4.55–213.36; p < 0.001. Conclusions Our findings revealed that the quality of life among patients with psoriasis is their greatest concern. Eliminating the itch intensity that affects their quality of life is crucial but remains challenging in Thailand.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1241/v1?src=rss">Determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in university students and support staff in Pakistan: A machine learning and statistical analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the availability of a vaccine to combat COVID-19 disease, vaccine hesitancy is still a major concern, notably in countries with developing healthcare systems such as Pakistan. Hence, this study considered the rationale for vaccine hesitancy in Pakistani university students and support staff, and the impact of gender, age, and education on vaccination hesitancy. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with randomly selected university students and supportive staff. An anonymous questionnaire collected data covering socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination status, current beliefs, and past vaccination history. Responses were assessed using descriptive analysis (p-value estimation and correlation/regression) and machine learning models applied to classify individuals based on their acceptance or vaccine hesitancy behavior and then used to predict the important variables associated with vaccine hesitancy. Results The survey of 847 participants revealed that 43% were vaccinated and 57% were vaccine hesitant; of which 37%, 38%, and 25% had safety and efficacy concerns, were afraid of side effects, or exhibited other complacency behavior regarding vaccination, respectively. Non-university educated people were significantly more hesitant than university-educated people (p = 0.033). Vaccine refusal was significantly higher in students than in supportive staff (p = 0.01). Correlation analysis revealed a strong association between key independent variables (the fear of side effects, mistrusted information, and low perceived disease risk without vaccination) and vaccine acceptance (dependent variable), as revealed by linear regression and a Structure Model Equation. Machine learning classified vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-acceptant individuals with commutative accuracy of 96% and 97%, respectively, using random forest and logistic regression. Logistic regression identified five predictors for vaccine hesitancy: low perceived disease risk without vaccination, mistrusted information, the fear of side effects, occupation, and education. Conclusion Education campaigns that cover the safety, efficacy, and importance of vaccination are needed to increase vaccination take-up to protect from COVID-19 disease.

     alt="A Neuropeptide Signaling Network That Regulates Developmental Timing and Systemic Growth in Drosophila"/>
<p>Anatomical as well as genetic analyses were performed to elucidate the role of neurons that produce neuropeptides called Hugin peptides in the larval central nervous system of the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Results suggest that Hugin peptides regulate developmental timing and body size via neurons that produce prothoracicotropic hormone.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals sense chemical cues such as nutritious and noxious stimuli through the chemosensory system and adapt their behavior, physiology, and developmental schedule to the environment. In the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system, chemosensory interneurons that produce neuropeptides called Hugin (Hug) peptides receive signals from gustatory receptor neurons and regulate feeding behavior. Because Hug neurons project their axons to the higher brain region within the protocerebrum where dendrites of multiple neurons producing developmentally important neuropeptides are extended, it has been postulated that Hug neurons regulate development through the neuroendocrine system. In this study, we show that Hug neurons interact with a subset of protocerebrum neurons that produce prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and regulate the onset of metamorphosis and systemic growth. Loss of the <i>hug</i> gene and silencing of Hug neurons caused a delay in larval-to-prepupal transition and an increase in final body size. Furthermore, deletion of Hug receptor-encoding genes also caused developmental delay and body size increase, and the phenotype was restored by expressing Hug receptors in PTTH-producing neurons. These results indicate that Hug neurons regulate developmental timing and body size via PTTH-producing neurons. This study provides a basis for understanding how chemosensation is converted into neuroendocrine signaling to control insect growth and development.</p>
