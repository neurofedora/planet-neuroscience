Germ-line specification is essential for sexual reproduction.

STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and regulates gene expression to promote cancer cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and migration. In diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), activation of STAT3 and its kinase JAK1 is caused by autocrine production of IL-6 and IL-10 in the activated B cell–like subtype (ABC)....<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/nF6et82mg0M" width="1" />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu<br />  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini<br /> The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng<br /> Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Francesco   Petrelli, Paola   Bezzi<br /> Astrocytes, the largest glial population in human and murine brains, are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity. During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Le   Xiao, Peter   Scheiffele<br /> The view of cerebellar functions has been extended from controlling sensorimotor processes to processing ‘contextual’ information and generating predictions for a diverse range of behaviors. These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Carla EM   Golden, Joseph D   Buxbaum, Silvia   De Rubeis<br /> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are caused by a wide range of genetic mutations, a significant fraction of which reside in genes important for synaptic function. Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Yishi   Jin, Yingchuan B   Qi<br /> The ability of neurons to modify or remodel their synaptic connectivity is critical for the function of neural circuitry throughout the life of an animal. Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell<br /> When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. <br /><br />

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Elena   Marcello, Monica   Di Luca, Fabrizio   Gardoni<br /> In the last decade several synaptonuclear protein messengers including Jacob, CRTC1, AIDA-1, ProSaP2/Shank3 and RNF10 have been identified and characterized as key players for modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. <br /><br />

<p>A large body of compelling evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that
embodiment - the agent's physical setup, including its shape, materials,
sensors and actuators - is constitutive for any form of cognition and as a
consequence, models of cognition need to be embodied. In contrast to methods
from empirical sciences to study cognition, robots can be freely manipulated
and virtually all key variables of their embodiment and control programs can be
systematically varied. As such, they provide an extremely powerful tool of
investigation. We present a robotic bottom-up or developmental approach,
focusing on three stages: (a) low-level behaviors like walking and reflexes,
(b) learning regularities in sensorimotor spaces, and (c) human-like cognition.
We also show that robotic based research is not only a productive path to
deepening our understanding of cognition, but that robots can strongly benefit
from human-like cognition in order to become more autonomous, robust,
resilient, and safe.

<p>Time series measured from real spatially extended systems are generally
noisy, complex and display statistical properties that evolve continuously over
time. Here, we present a method that combines wavelet analysis and
non-stationary surrogates to detect spatial coherent patterns in non-
stationary multivariate time-series. In contrast with classical methods, the
surrogate data used here are realisations of a non-stationary linear stochastic
process, preserving both the amplitude and time-frequency distributions of
original data. These surrogate data are used in combination with an extension
of the wavelet coherence to multivariate signals to detect short-lived coherent
spatial patterns. We evaluate this framework on synthetic and real-world time
series, and we show that it can provide useful insights into the time-resolved
structure of spatially extended systems.

<p>The formation of pattern in biological systems may be modeled by a set of
reaction-diffusion equations. A diffusion-type coupling operator biologically
significant in neuroscience is a difference of Gaussian functions (Mexican Hat
operator) used as a spatial-convolution kernel. We are interested in the
difference among behaviors of \emph{stochastic} neural field equations, namely
space-time stochastic differential-integral equations, and similar
deterministic ones. We explore, quantitatively, how the parameters of our model
that measure the shape of the coupling kernel, coupling strength, and aspects
of the spatially-smoothed space-time noise, control the pattern in the
resulting evolving random field. We find that a spatial pattern that is damped
in time in a deterministic system may be sustained and amplified by
stochasticity, most strikingly at an optimal spatio-temporal noise level. In
addition, we find that spatially-smoothed noise alone causes pattern formation
even without spatial coupling.

<p>Executive function emerges late in development and displays different
developmental trends in males and females. Sex differences in executive
function in youth have been linked to vulnerability to psychopathology as well
as to behaviors that impinge on health. Yet, the neurobiological basis of these
differences is not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that sex
differences in executive function in youth stem from sex differences in the
controllability of structural brain networks as they rewire over development.
Combining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we
characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks
estimated from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample
of 882 youth aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these
networks by estimating average and modal controllability, two statistics that
probe the ease with which brain areas can drive the network towards easy-
versus difficult-to-reach states. We find that females have higher modal
controllability in frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions while males have
higher average controllability in frontal and subcortical regions. Furthermore,
average controllability values in the medial frontal cortex and subcortex, both
higher in males, are negatively related to executive function. Finally, we find
that average controllability predicts sex-dependent individual differences in
activation during an n-back working memory task. Taken together, our findings
support the notion that sex differences in the controllability of structural
brain networks can partially explain sex differences in executive function.
Controllability of structural brain networks also predicts features of
task-relevant activation, suggesting the potential for controllability to
represent context-specific constraints on network state more generally.

<p>Finding actions that satisfy the constraints imposed by both external inputs
and internal representations is central to decision making. We demonstrate that
some important classes of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can be solved
by networks composed of homogeneous cooperative-competitive modules that have
connectivity similar to motifs observed in the superficial layers of neocortex.
The winner-take-all modules are sparsely coupled by programming neurons that
embed the constraints onto the otherwise homogeneous modular computational
substrate. We show rules that embed any instance of the CSPs planar four-color
graph coloring, maximum independent set, and Sudoku on this substrate, and
provide mathematical proofs that guarantee these graph coloring problems will
convergence to a solution. The network is composed of non-saturating linear
threshold neurons. Their lack of right saturation allows the overall network to
explore the problem space driven through the unstable dynamics generated by
recurrent excitation. The direction of exploration is steered by the constraint
neurons. While many problems can be solved using only linear inhibitory
constraints, network performance on hard problems benefits significantly when
these negative constraints are implemented by non-linear multiplicative
inhibition. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of instability
rather than stability in network computation, and also offer insight into the

<p>Brain Electroencephalography (EEG) classification is widely applied to
analyze cerebral diseases in recent years. Unfortunately, invalid/noisy EEGs
degrade the diagnosis performance and most previously developed methods ignore
the necessity of EEG selection for classification. To this end, this paper
proposes a novel maximum weight clique-based EEG selection approach, named
mwcEEGs, to map EEG selection to searching maximum similarity-weighted cliques
from an improved Fr\'{e}chet distance-weighted undirected EEG graph
simultaneously considering edge weights and vertex weights. Our mwcEEGs
improves the classification performance by selecting intra-clique pairwise
similar and inter-clique discriminative EEGs with similarity threshold
$\delta$. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm effectiveness compared
with the state-of-the-art time series selection algorithms on real-world EEG
datasets.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248583v1?rss=1">Finding decodable information that is read out in behaviour</a></h4>

Multivariate decoding methods applied to neuroimaging data have become the standard in cognitive neuroscience for unravelling statistical dependencies between brain activation patterns and experimental conditions. The current challenge is to demonstrate that information decoded as such by the experimenter is in fact used by the brain itself to guide behaviour. Here we demonstrate a promising approach to do so in the context of neural activation during object perception and categorisation behaviour. We first localised decodable information about visual objects in the human brain using a spatially-unbiased multivariate decoding analysis. We then related brain activation patterns to behaviour using a machine-learning based extension of signal detection theory. We show that while there is decodable information about visual category throughout the visual brain, only a subset of those representations predicted categorisation behaviour, located mainly in anterior ventral temporal cortex. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of neuroimaging studies, highlight the importance of relating decoding results to behaviour, and suggest a suitable methodology towards this aim.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248518v1?rss=1">Predicting age from cortical structure across the lifespan</a></h4>

Despite inter-individual differences in cortical structure, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated a large degree of population-level consistency in age-related differences in brain morphology. The present study assessed how accurately an individual's age could be predicted by estimates of cortical morphology, comparing a variety of structural measures, including thickness, gyrification, and fractal dimensionality. Structural measures were calculated across up to seven different parcellation approaches, ranging from 1 region to 1000 regions. The age-prediction framework was trained using morphological measures obtained from T1-weighted MRI volumes collected from multiple sites, yielding a training dataset of 1056 healthy adults, aged 18-97. Age predictions were calculated using a machine-learning approach that incorporated non-linear differences over the lifespan. In two independent, held-out test samples, age predictions had a median error of 6-7 years. Age predictions were best when using a combination of cortical metrics, both thickness and fractal dimensionality. Overall, the results reveal that age-related differences in brain structure are systematic enough to enable reliable age prediction based on metrics of cortical morphology.

Treatment of medically intractable focal epilepsy (MIFE) by surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is often effective provided the EZ can be reliably identified. Even with the use of invasive recordings, the clinical differentiation between the EZ and normal brain areas can be quite challenging, mainly in patients without MRI detectable lesions. Consequently, despite relatively large brain regions being removed, surgical success rates barely reach 60-65%. Such variable and unfavorable outcomes associated with high morbidity rates are often caused by imprecise and/or inaccurate EZ localization. We developed a localization algorithm that uses network-based data analytics to process invasive EEG recordings. This network algorithm analyzes the centrality signatures of every contact electrode within the recording network and characterizes contacts into susceptible EZ based on the centrality trends over time. The algorithm was tested in a retrospective study that included 42 patients from four epilepsy centers. Our algorithm had higher agreement with EZ regions identified by clinicians for patients with successful surgical outcomes and less agreement for patients with failed outcomes. These findings suggest that network analytics and a network systems perspective of epilepsy may be useful in assisting clinicians in more accurately localizing the EZ.

Methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (Mbd2) binds methylated DNA and was shown to play an important role in cancer and immunity but its role in brain function is mostly unknown. Here we show that MBD2 deficiency in mice results in deficits in cognitive, social and emotional functions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) revealed that Mbd2 binds to regulatory DNA regions of neuronal genes in the hippocampus. Loss of Mbd2 alters the expression of hundreds of genes with a robust down-regulation of neuronal gene pathways. Genes down-regulated by loss of Mbd2 are highly enriched for ortholog ASD risk genes Further, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis found an altered DNA methylation pattern in regulatory DNA regions of neuronal specific genes in Mbd2 deficient mice. Taken together, our data suggest Mbd2 regulates hippocampal DNA methylation landscape to control neuronal gene expression and behavior.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246710v1?rss=1">Non-linear transfer characteristics of stimulation and recording hardware account for spurious low-frequency artifacts during amplitude modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS)</a></h4>

Background: Amplitude modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS) has been recently proposed as a possible solution to overcome the pronounced stimulation artifact encountered when recording brain activity during tACS. In theory, AM-tACS does not entail power at its modulating frequency, thus avoiding the problem of spectral overlap between brain signal of interest and stimulation artifact. However, the current study demonstrates how weak non-linear transfer characteristics inherent in stimulation and recording hardware can reintroduce spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency. Method: The input-output transfer functions (TFs) of different stimulation setups were measured. The setups included basic recordings of signal-generator and stimulator outputs as well as M/EEG phantom measurements. 6th-degree polynomial regression models were fitted to model the input-output TFs of each setup. The resulting TF models were applied to digitally generated AM-tACS signals to predict the location of spurious artifacts in the spectrum. Results: All four setups measured for the study exhibited low-frequency artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics when recording AM-tACS. Fitted TF models showed non-linear contributions significantly different from zero (all p &lt; .05) and successfully predicted the frequency of artifacts observed in AM-signal recordings. Conclusions: Our results suggest that even weak non-linearities of stimulation and recording hardware can lead to spurious artifacts at the modulation frequency and its harmonics. Thus, findings emphasize the need for more linear stimulation devices for AM-tACS and careful analysis procedures taking into account these low-frequency artifacts.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245530v1?rss=1">Analysis of functional connectivity and oscillatory power using DICS: from raw MEG data to group-level statistics in Python</a></h4>

Communication between brain regions is thought to be facilitated by the synchronization of oscillatory activity. Hence, large-scale functional networks within the brain may be estimated by measuring synchronicity between regions. Neurophysiological recordings, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), provide a direct measure of oscillatory neural activity with millisecond temporal resolution. In this paper, we describe a full data analysis pipeline for functional connectivity analysis based on dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) of MEG data. DICS is a beamforming technique in the frequency-domain that allows the study of the cortical sources of oscillatory activity and synchronization between brain regions. All the analysis steps, starting from the raw MEG data up to publication-ready group-level statistics and visualization, are discussed in depth, including methodological considerations, rules of thumb and tradeoffs. We start by computing cross-spectral density (CSD) matrices using a wavelet approach in several frequency bands (alpha, theta, beta, gamma). We then provide a way to create comparable source spaces across subjects and discuss the cortical mapping of spectral power. For connectivity analysis, we present a canonical computation of coherence that facilitates a stable estimation of all-to-all connectivity. Finally, we use group-level statistics to limit the network to cortical regions for which significant differences between experimental conditions are detected and produce vertex- and parcel-level visualizations of the different brain networks. Code examples using the MNE-Python package are provided at each step, guiding the reader through a complete analysis of the freely available openfMRI ds000117 "familiar vs. unfamiliar vs. scrambled faces" dataset. The goal is to educate both novice and experienced data analysts with the "tricks of the trade" necessary to successfully perform this type of analysis on their own data.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03984">A Brain-Inspired Trust Management Model to Assure Security in a Cloud based IoT Framework for Neuroscience Applications. (arXiv:1801.03984v1 [cs.CR])</a></h4>

<p>Rapid popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing permits
neuroscientists to collect multilevel and multichannel brain data to better
understand brain functions, diagnose diseases, and devise treatments. To ensure
secure and reliable data communication between end-to-end (E2E) devices
supported by current IoT and cloud infrastructure, trust management is needed
at the IoT and user ends. This paper introduces a Neuro-Fuzzy based
Brain-inspired trust management model (TMM) to secure IoT devices and relay
nodes, and to ensure data reliability. The proposed TMM utilizes node
behavioral trust and data trust estimated using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
System and weighted-additive methods respectively to assess the nodes
trustworthiness. In contrast to the existing fuzzy based TMMs, the NS2
simulation results confirm the robustness and accuracy of the proposed TMM in
identifying malicious nodes in the communication network. With the growing
usage of cloud based IoT frameworks in Neuroscience research, integrating the
proposed TMM into the existing infrastructure will assure secure and reliable
data communication among the E2E devices.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248385v1?rss=1">Sampling Neuron Morphologies</a></h4>

The intricate morphology of neurons has fascinated since the dawn of neuroscience, and yet, it is hard to synthesize them. Current algorithms typically define a growth process with parameters that allow matching aspects of the morphologies. However, such algorithmic growth processes are far simpler than the biological ones. What is needed is an algorithm that, given a database of morphologies, produces more of those. Here, we introduce a generator for neuron morphologies that is based on a statistical sampling process. Our Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method starts with a trivial neuron and iteratively perturbs the morphology bringing the features close to those of the database. By quantifying the statistics of the generated neurons, we find that it outperforms growth-based models for many features. Good generative models for neuron morphologies promise to be important both for neural simulations and for morphology reconstructions from imaging data.

Measurements of response time (RT) has long been used to infer neural processes underlying various cognitive functions such as working memory, attention, and decision making. However, it is currently unknown if RT is also informative about various stages of value-based choice, particularly how reward values are constructed. To investigate this, we analyzed the pattern of RT during a set of multi-dimensional learning and decision-making tasks that can prompt subjects to adopt different learning strategies. In our experiments, subjects could use reward feedback to directly learn reward values associated with alternative choice options (object-based learning). Alternatively, they could learn reward values of options' features (e.g. color, shape) and combine these values to estimate reward values for individual options (feature-based learning). We found that RT was slower when the difference between subjects' estimates of reward probabilities for the two alternative objects on a given trial was smaller, and when the preceding trial was not rewarded. More importantly, RT reflected the learning strategy adopted by the subject on a trial-by-trial basis, indicating an overall faster construction of reward value and/or value comparison during object-based learning. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the pattern of RT can be used to infer how reward values are learned and constructed during complex value-based learning and decision making.

Emotional experiences are typically remembered with a greater sense of recollection than neutral experiences, but memory benefits for emotional items do not typically extend to their source contexts. Item and source memory have been attributed to different subregions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL), but it is unclear how emotional item recollection fits into existing models of MTL function and, in particular, what is the role of the hippocampus. To address these issues, we used high-resolution fMRI to examine MTL contributions to successful emotional item and context encoding. The results showed that emotional items were recollected more often than neutral items. Whereas amygdala and PRC activity supported the recollection advantage for emotional items, hippocampal and PHC activity predicted subsequent source memory for both types of items, reflecting a double dissociation between anterior and posterior MTL regions. We next tested whether amygdala activity during encoding modulated the relationship between MTL activity and subsequent memory outcomes. The amygdala and PRC played complementary roles in supporting subsequent item recollection, in that lower amygdala activity was associated with more memory dependence on PRC. In contrast, the amygdala and hippocampus played synergistic roles in supporting subsequent source memory, in that higher amygdala activity amplified the relation of hippocampal activity to subsequent source memory. The results suggest that emotion-related enhancements in item recollection are supported by an amygdala-perirhinal pathway, which is separable from the hippocampal pathway that binds items to their source context.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248286v1?rss=1">Sex chromosome trisomies are not associated with atypical lateralisation for language</a></h4>

Aim: Individuals with a sex chromosome trisomy (SCT) have disproportionate problems with language compared to nonverbal skills. This may result from disruption to the typical left hemisphere bias for language processing. We tested the hypothesis that SCTs would be associated with reduced left lateralisation for language. Method: In a cross-sectional design, language laterality was measured during an animation description task using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTCD). Data were available for 75 children with an SCT (26 47,XXX girls, 25 47,XXY boys, and 24 47,XYY boys; mean age was 11;4 years, SD = 3;10 years), and 132 comparison children with typical karyotypes (69 boys; mean age was 9;1 years, SD = 1;7 years). Results: Lateralisation for language did not differ between the SCT and comparison groups, either in mean laterality index or relative frequency of each laterality category (left, bilateral and right). There were no differences when splitting the SCT group by trisomy. Handedness also showed no group effects. Interpretation: Our data provide no evidence for disrupted lateralisation for language in SCTs. The brain basis of the cognitive phenotype in SCTs is unlikely to be a failure of the left hemisphere to specialise for language, as previously suggested.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248252v1?rss=1">Quantifying the performance of MEG source reconstruction using resting state data</a></h4>

Resting state networks measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) form transiently stable spatio-temporal patterns in the subsecond range, and therefore fluctuate more rapidly than previously appreciated. These states populate and interact across the whole brain, are simple to record, and possess the same dynamic structure of task related changes. They therefore provide a generic, heterogeneous, and plentiful functional substrate against which to test different MEG recording and reconstruction approaches. Here we validate a non-invasive method for quantifying the resolution of different inversion assumptions under different recording regimes (with and without head-casts) based on resting state MEG. Spatio-temporally partitioning of data into self-similar periods confirmed a rich and rapidly dynamic temporal structure with a small number of regularly reoccurring states. To test the anatomical precision that could be resolved through these transient states we then inverted these data onto libraries of systematically distorted, subject specific, cortical meshes and compared the quality of the fit using Cross Validation and a Free Energy metric. This revealed which inversion scheme was able to best support the least distorted (most accurate) anatomical models. Both datasets showed an increase in model fit as anatomical models moved towards the true cortical surface. In the head-cast MEG data, the Empirical Bayesian Beamformer (EBB) algorithm showed the best mean anatomical discrimination (3.7 mm) compared with Minimum Norm / LORETA (6.0 mm) and Multiple Sparse priors (9.4 mm). This pattern was replicated in the second (conventional dataset) although with a marginally poorer prediction of the missing (cross-validated) data. Our findings suggest that the abundant resting state data now commonly available could be used to refine and validate MEG source reconstruction methods or recording paradigms.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/248120v1?rss=1">Improved cortical boundary registration for locally distorted fMRI scans</a></h4>

With continuing advances in MRI techniques and the emergence of higher static field strengths, submillimetre spatial resolution is now possible in human functional imaging experiments. This has opened up the way for more specific types of analysis, for example investigation of the cortical layers of the brain. With this increased specificity, it is important to correct for the geometrical distortions that are inherent to echo planar imaging (EPI). Inconveniently, higher field strength also increases these distortions. The resulting displacements can easily amount to several millimetres and as such pose a serious problem for laminar analysis. We here present a method, Recursive Boundary Registration (RBR), that corrects distortions between an anatomical and an EPI volume. By recursively applying Boundary Based Registration (BBR) on progressively smaller subregions of the brain we generate an accurate whole-brain registration, based on the grey-white matter contrast. Explicit care is taken that the deformation does not break the topology of the cortical surface, which is an important requirement for several of the most common subsequent steps in laminar analysis. We show that RBR obtains submillimetre accuracy with respect to a manually distorted gold standard, and apply it to a set of human in vivo scans to show a clear increase in spacial specificity. RBR further automates the process of non-linear distortion correction. This is an important step towards routine human laminar fMRI. We provide the code for the RBR algorithm, as well as a variety of functions to better investigate registration performance in a public GitHub repository, https://github.com/TimVanMourik/OpenFmriAnalysis, under the GPL 3.0 license.

Non-linear complexity of the EEG signal can be used to detect abnormal brain function relating to behavioral deficits. Here, we compare the effects of experimental stroke on EEG complexity using Lempel-Ziv complexity analysis (LZC) and multiscale entropy analysis (SampEn). EEG was recorded in bilateral motor cortex at baseline and during a 30-day recovery period after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Motor function was assessed using a single pellet reaching task. Stroke caused an acute drop in both LZC and SampEn in the ipsilesional hemisphere in wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep, as well as reduced pellet reaching success. SampEn reductions persisted for at least 10 days post-stroke, whereas LZC had returned to baseline levels by day 4. EEG complexity in the contralesional hemisphere and in sham-operated animals were unaffected. If EEG complexity reflects post-stroke brain function, post-stroke asymmetry could be used to predict behavioral recovery. In rats, acute LZC asymmetry was significantly correlated with the amount of motor function recovery by post-stroke day 31, but SampEn asymmetry was not. EEG LZC may thus be a useful tool for predicting functional recovery after stroke. MSE could be effective in identifying cortical dysfunction, but does not reflect behavioral outcomes.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/247890v1?rss=1">A pupillary index of susceptibility to decision biases</a></h4>

Under what conditions do humans systematically deviate from rational decision making? Here we show that pupillary indices of low neural gain are associated with strong and consistent biases across six different extensively-studied decision making tasks, whereas indices of high gain are associated with weak or absent biases. Lower susceptibility to biases, however, comes at the cost of indecisiveness, or alternatively, prolonged deliberation time. We explain the association between low gain and strong biases as reflecting a broader information integration process that gives greater weight to weak biasing influences. The findings underscore the role of pupil-linked brain states in the generation of decision making biases.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/247825v1?rss=1">Control of non-homeostatic feeding in sated mice using associative learning of contextual food cues</a></h4>

Feeding is a complex motivated behavior controlled by a distributed neural network that processes sensory information to generate adaptive behavioral responses. Accordingly, studies using appetitive Pavlovian conditioning confirm that environmental cues that are associated with food availability can induce feeding even in satiated subjects. However, in mice, appetitive conditioning generally requires intensive training and thus can impede molecular studies that often require large numbers of animals. To address this, we developed and validated a simple and rapid context-induced feeding (ctx-IF) task in which cues associated with food availability can later lead to increased food consumption in sated mice. We show that the associated increase in food consumption is driven largely by positive reinforcement and that spaced training is more effective than massed training. Ctx-IF can be completed in ~1 week and provides an opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms and circuitry underlying non-homeostatic eating. We have used this paradigm to map brain regions that are activated during Ctx-IF and found that the insular cortex, and other regions, are activated following exposure to cues denoting the availability of food. Finally, we show that inhibition of the insular cortex using GABA agonists impairs performance of the task. Our findings provide a novel assay in mice for defining the functional neuroanatomy of appetitive conditioning and identify specific brain regions that are activated during the development of learned behaviors that impact food consumption.

<div class="section" id="ana25118-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Alexander disease is a fatal leukodystrophy caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in astrocytes of the central nervous system. A key feature of pathogenesis is overexpression and accumulation of GFAP, with formation of characteristic cytoplasmic aggregates known as Rosenthal fibers. Here we investigate whether suppressing GFAP with antisense oligonucleotides could provide a therapeutic strategy for treating Alexander disease.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25118-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>In this study, we use GFAP mutant mouse models of Alexander disease to test the efficacy of antisense suppression and evaluate the effects on molecular and cellular phenotypes and non–cell-autonomous toxicity. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target the murine <em>Gfap</em> transcript, and screened using primary mouse cortical cultures. Lead oligonucleotides were then tested for their ability to reduce GFAP transcripts and protein, first in wild-type mice with normal levels of GFAP, and then in adult mutant mice with established pathology and elevated levels of GFAP.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25118-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Nearly complete and long-lasting elimination of GFAP occurred in brain and spinal cord following single bolus intracerebroventricular injections, with a striking reversal of Rosenthal fibers and downstream markers of microglial and other stress-related responses. GFAP protein was also cleared from cerebrospinal fluid, demonstrating its potential utility as a biomarker in future clinical applications. Finally, treatment led to improved body condition and rescue of hippocampal neurogenesis.</p></div></div>

During EAE, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells, as well as microglia, shifted from expression of proinflammatory markers to expression of noninflammatory markers immediately prior to clinical remissions.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/247585v1?rss=1">Aberrant calcium signaling in astrocytes inhibits neuronal excitability in a human Down syndrome stem cell model</a></h4>

Down syndrome (DS) is a devastating genetic disorder causing severe cognitive impairment. The staggering array of effects associated with an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21) complicates mechanistic understanding of DS pathophysiology. We developed an in vitro system to examine the interplay of neurons and astrocytes in a fully recapitulated HSA21 trisomy model differentiated from DS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). By combining calcium imaging with genetic approaches, we utilized this system to investigate the functional defects of DS astroglia and their effects on neuronal excitability. We found that, compared with control isogenic astroglia, DS astroglia exhibited more frequent spontaneous calcium fluctuations, which reduced the excitability of co-cultured neurons. DS astrocytes exerted this effect on both DS and healthy neurons. Neuronal activity could be rescued by abolishing astrocytic spontaneous calcium activity either chemically by blocking adenosine-mediated astrocyte-neuron signaling or genetically by knockdown of inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptors or S100{beta}, a calcium binding protein coded on HSA21. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which DS alters the function of astrocytes, which subsequently disturbs neuronal excitability. Furthermore, our study establishes an all optical neurophysiological platform for studying human neuron astrocyte interactions associated with neurological disorders.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/247213v1?rss=1">Two distinct proprioceptive representations of voluntary movements in primate spinal neurons</a></h4>

When willingly setting our body in motion, we simultaneously know where and how our limbs are moving. While this indicates that proprioceptive information is readily represented in the neurons of the central nervous system, it is still unclear how. We recorded the activity of spinal neurons with direct projections from muscle spindle afferents in four monkeys, while they performed simple wrist movements. Against the assumption that these spinal neurons act as a simple relay of afferent input, we found the majority (56%) of neurons had firing patterns incongruent with a simple representation of spindle activity, and the minority had congruent patterns. Two groups of neurons showed distinct intrinsic characteristics (spike width, base firing rate and firing irregularity), and distinct control of their input-output gain. These results are the first demonstration that proprioceptive representation is achieved by the coordinated activity of distinct groups of neurons during volitional movement.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Grey matter (GM) atrophy occurs in all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes. We investigated whether there is a spatiotemporal pattern of GM atrophy that is associated with faster disability accumulation in MS.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We analysed 3,604 brain high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans from 1,417 participants: 1,214 MS patients (253 clinically-isolated syndrome[CIS], 708 relapsing-remitting[RRMS], 128 secondary-progressive[SPMS], 125 primary-progressive[PPMS]), over an average follow-up of 2.41 years (standard deviation[SD]=1.97), and 203 healthy controls (HCs) [average follow-up=1.83 year, SD=1.77], attending 7 European centres. Disability was assessed with the Expanded-Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed-models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: SPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio=0.73, 95% CIs 0.65, 0.82; <em>p</em>&lt;0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (-1.45%), PPMS (-1.66%), and RRMS (-1.34%) than CIS (-0.88%) and HCs (-0.94%)[<em>p</em>&lt;0.01]. The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (-0.76%), CIS (-0.75%), and HCs (-0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.24-%) was faster than CIS (-0.63%) and HCs (-0.23%) (all p values &lt;0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta=0.04, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: This large multi-centre and longitudinal study shows that DGM volume loss drives disability accumulation in MS, and that temporal cortical GM shows accelerated atrophy in SPMS than RRMS. The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic epilepsy syndrome defined by seizures and progressive neurological disabilities, including cognitive impairments, anxiety and depression. Here, human TLE specimens were investigated focusing on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) Complex 1 (mTORC1) and Complex 2 (mTORC2) activities in the brain, as both pathways may represent unique targets for treatment.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Surgically resected hippocampal and temporal lobe samples from therapy-resistant TLE patients were analyzed by Western blotting to quantify the expression of established mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity markers and upstream or downstream signaling pathways involving the two complexes. Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to assess hippocampal and neocortical structural abnormalities and cell-specific expression of individual biomarkers. Samples from patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II served as positive controls.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: We found significantly increased expression of phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), phospho-S6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-Akt (Ser473) in TLE samples compared to controls, consistent with activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Our work identified the PI3K and Ras/ERK signaling pathways as potential mTORC1 and mTORC2 upstream activators. In addition, we found that overactive mTORC2 signaling was accompanied by induction of two Akt-dependent pro-survival pathways, as evidenced by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of FoxO3a (Ser253) and GSK-β (Ser9).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Our data demonstrate that mTOR signaling is significantly dysregulated in human TLE, offering new targets for pharmacologic interventions. Specifically, clinically available drugs that suppress mTORC1 without compromising mTOR2 signaling, such as rapamycin and its analogs, may represent a new group of antiepileptogenic agents in TLE patients.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome involving multiple molecular pathways. The development of biomarkers for use in therapeutic trials is a priority. We sought to use a high-throughput proteomic method to identify novel biomarkers in individual cerebrospinal fluid samples.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with label-free quantification was used to identify cerebrospinal fluid proteins using samples from a well-characterised longitudinal cohort comprising patients with ALS (n=43), the upper motor neuron variant primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, n=6), cross-sectional healthy (n=20) and disease controls (Parkinsons's n=20, ALS mimic disorders n=12).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Three macrophage-derived chitinases showed increased abundance in ALS: chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) and chitinase-3-like protein 2 (CHI3L2). Elevated CHI3L1 was common to ALS and PLS, whereas CHIT1 and CHI3L2 levels differed. Chitinase levels correlated with disease progression rate (CHIT1 r=0.56, p&lt;0.001; CHI3L1 r=0.31, p=0.028; CHI3L2 r=0.29, p=0.044). CHIT1, CHI3L1 and CHI3L2 levels correlated with phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH; r=0.62, p&lt;0.001; r=0.49, p&lt;0.001; r=0.41, p&lt;0.001). CHI3L1 levels, but not CHIT1 or CHI3L2, increased over time in those with low initial levels (gradient=0.005 log abundance units/month, p=0.001). High CHIT1 was associated with shortened survival (HR 2.84, p=0.009). Inclusion of pNFH in survival models left only an association of pNFH and survival (HR 1.26, p=0.019).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been consistently implicated through various experimental paradigms. These results support a key role for macrophage activity in ALS pathogenesis, offering novel target engagement and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for neuroinflammation-focused ALS therapy.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Restoring the circulation is the primary goal in emergency treatment of cerebral ischemia. However, better understanding of how the brain responds to energy depletion could inform the time available for resuscitation until irreversible damage and advance development of interventions that prolong this span. Experimentally, injury to central neurons begins only with anoxic depolarization. This potentially reversible, spreading wave typically starts 2-5 min after the onset of severe ischemia, marking the onset of a toxic intraneuronal change that eventually results in irreversible injury.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: To investigate this in the human brain, we performed recordings with either subdural electrode strips (n=4) or intraparenchymal electrode arrays (n=5) in patients with devastating brain injury that resulted in activation of a Do Not Resuscitate-Comfort Care order followed by terminal extubation.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies produced a decline in brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen (p<sub>ti</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and circulatory arrest. Silencing of spontaneous electrical activity developed simultaneously across regional electrode arrays in eight patients. This silencing, termed ‘nonspreading depression', developed during the steep falling phase of p<sub>ti</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (intraparenchymal sensor, n=6) at 11 (7, 14) mmHg. Terminal spreading depolarizations started to propagate between electrodes 3.9 (2.6, 6.3) min after onset of the final drop in perfusion and 13 to 266s after nonspreading depression. In one patient, terminal spreading depolarization induced the initial electrocerebral silence in a spreading depression pattern; circulatory arrest developed thereafter.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: These results provide fundamental insight into the neurobiology of dying and have important implications for survivable cerebral ischemic insults. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

A population of descending neurons connect the brain and thoracic motor center, playing a critical role in controlling behavior. We examined the anatomical organization of descending neurons (DNs) in the brain of the silkmoth Bombyx mori. Moth pheromone orientation is a good model to investigate the neuronal mechanisms of olfactory behavior. Based on mass staining and single-cell staining, we evaluated the anatomical organization of neurite distribution by DNs in the brain. Dense innervation was observed in the posterior ventral part of the brain, called the posterior slope (PS). We examined the morphology of DNs innervating the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), which is assumed to be important for moth olfactory behavior. We observed that the LAL DNs also innervate the PS, suggesting the integration of signals from the LAL and PS. We also identified a set of DNs innervating the PS, but not the LAL. These DNs were sensitive to sex pheromones, suggesting a role of the PS in motor control for pheromone orientation. The organization of descending pathways for pheromone orientation is discussed.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/229856v3?rss=1">Behavior variability of a conditional gene knockout mouse as a measure of subtle phenotypic trait expression. The case of mouse brain executive function distortion [Revised]</a></h4>

Task learning relies on brain executive function (EF), the construct of controlling and coordinating behavior under the everlasting flow of environmental changes. We have previously shown, that a complete knockout of a vertebrate brain-specific pair of gene paralogs (Ntng1/2) distorts the mouse EF, making behavior less predictable (more variable) via the affected working memory and attention. In the current study, conditionally targeting either serotonin transporter (5-HTT) or Emx1-expressing neurons, we show that the cell type-specific ablation of Ntng1 within the excitatory circuits of either cortex or thalamus does not have a profound impact on the EF but rather affects its certain modalities, i.e. impulsivity and/or selective attention, modulated by cognitive demand. Several mice of both conditional genotypes simultaneously occupy either top or bottom parameter-specific behavioral ranks, indicative of a subject-unique antagonistic either proficit or deficit of function within the same behavior. Employing genotype-attributable behavior variability as a phenotypic trait, we deduce, that Ntng1-parsed excitatory pathways contribute but do not fully reconstitute the attention-impulsivity phenotypes, associated with the mouse EF deficit. However, complete knockdown of Ntng1/2, and associated with it behavior variability, explains the deficit of executive function and task learning.

Protein-protein interactions are the cornerstone of numerous biological processes. Although an increasing number of protein complex structures have been determined using experimental methods, relatively fewer studies have been performed to determine the assembly order of complexes. In addition to the insights into the molecular mechanisms of biological function provided by the structure of a complex, knowing the assembly order is important for understanding the process of complex formation. Assembly order is also practically useful for constructing subcomplexes as a step toward solving the entire complex experimentally, designing artificial protein complexes, and developing drugs that interrupt a critical step in the complex assembly. There are several experimental methods for determining the assembly order of complexes; however, these techniques are resource-intensive. Here, we present a computational method that predicts the assembly order of protein complexes by building the complex structure. The method, named Path-LzerD, uses a multimeric protein docking algorithm that assembles a protein complex structure from individual subunit structures and predicts assembly order by observing the simulated assembly process of the complex. Benchmarked on a dataset of complexes with experimental evidence of assembly order, Path-LZerD was successful in predicting the assembly pathway for the majority of the cases. Moreover, when compared with a simple approach that infers the assembly path from the buried surface area of subunits in the native complex, Path-LZerD has the strong advantage that it can be used for cases where the complex structure is not known. The path prediction accuracy decreased when starting from unbound monomers, particularly for larger complexes of five or more subunits, for which only a part of the assembly path was correctly identified. As the first method of its kind, Path-LZerD opens a new area of computational protein structure modeling and will be an indispensable approach for studying protein complexes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mNJcOk2YMNo" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hpnuF0uxAAo/article">A direct interaction of cholesterol with the dopamine transporter prevents its out-to-inward transition</a></h4>

Monoamine transporters (MATs) carry out neurotransmitter reuptake from the synaptic cleft, a key step in neurotransmission, which is targeted in the treatment of neurological disorders. Cholesterol (CHOL), a major component of the synaptic plasma membrane, has been shown to exhibit a modulatory effect on MATs. Recent crystal structures of the dopamine transporter (DAT) revealed the presence of two conserved CHOL-like molecules, suggesting a functional protein-CHOL direct interaction. Here, we present extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of DAT in an outward-facing conformation. In the absence of bound CHOL, DAT undergoes structural changes reflecting early events of dopamine transport: transition to an inward-facing conformation. In contrast, in the presence of bound CHOL, these conformational changes are inhibited, seemingly by an immobilization of the intracellular interface of TM1a and TM5 by CHOL. We also provide evidence, from coarse grain MD simulations that the CHOL sites observed in the DAT crystal structures are preserved in all human transporters (dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine), suggesting that our findings might extend to the entire family.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hpnuF0uxAAo" width="1" />

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objectives</b>. In multiple sclerosis (MS), MRI is a sensitive tool for detecting white matter lesions, but its diagnostic specificity is still suboptimal; ambiguous cases are frequent in clinical practice. Detection of perivenular lesions in the brain (the “central vein sign”) improves the pathological specificity of MS diagnosis, but comprehensive evaluation of this MRI biomarker in MS-mimicking inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, such as CNS inflammatory vasculopathies, is missing. In a multicenter study, we assessed the frequency of perivenular lesions in MS <em>vs</em>. systemic autoimmune diseases with CNS involvement and primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods.</b> In 31 patients with inflammatory CNS vasculopathies and 52 with relapsing-remitting MS, 3D-T2*-weighted and T2-FLAIR images were obtained during a single MRI acquisition after gadolinium injection. For each lesion, the “central vein sign” was evaluated according to consensus guidelines. For each patient, lesion count, volume, and brain location, as well as fulfillment of dissemination in space MRI criteria, were assessed.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results.</b> MS showed higher frequency of perivenular lesions (median 88%) than did inflammatory CNS vasculopathies (14%), without overlap between groups or differences between 3T and 1.5T MRI. Among inflammatory vasculopathies, Behçet disease showed the highest median frequency of perivenular lesions (34%), followed by PACNS (14%), antiphospholipid syndromes (12%), Sjögren's syndrome (11%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (0%). When a threshold of 50% perivenular lesions was applied, CVS discriminated MS from inflammatory vasculopathies with diagnostic accuracy of 100%.</p></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>OBJECTIVE</b>: Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital non-dystrophic myopathies and is characterized by muscle weakness, often from birth. Mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> are a frequent cause of NM (i.e. NEM3). <em>ACTA1</em> encodes alpha-actin 1, the main constituent of the sarcomeric thin filament. The mechanisms by which mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> contribute to muscle weakness in NEM3 are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that sarcomeric dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness in NEM3 patients.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>METHODS</b>: To test this hypothesis, we performed contractility measurements in individual muscle fibers and myofibrils obtained from muscle biopsies of fourteen NEM3 patients with different <em>ACTA1</em> mutations. To identify the structural basis for impaired contractility, low angle x-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy were applied.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>RESULTS</b>: Our findings reveal that muscle fibers of NEM3 patients display a reduced maximal force generating capacity, which is caused by dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in the majority of patients, as revealed by contractility measurements in myofibrils. Low angle x-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy indicate that dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in NEM3 patients involves a lower number of myosin heads binding to actin during muscle activation. This lower number is not the result of reduced thin filament length. Interestingly, the calcium sensitivity of force is unaffected in some patients, but decreased in others.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>INTERPRETATION</b>: Thus, dysfunctional sarcomere contractility is an important contributor to muscle weakness in the majority of NEM3 patients, information which is crucial for patient stratification in future clinical trials.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Objective</span>: Thalamic volume is a candidate MRI-based marker associated with neurodegeneration to hasten development of neuroprotective treatments. Our objective is to describe the longitudinal evolution of thalamic atrophy in MS and normal aging, and to estimate sample sizes for study design.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Methods</span>: 601 subjects (2632 MRI scans) were analyzed. 520 subjects with relapse-onset MS [CIS(90); RR(392); SP(38)] underwent annual standardized 3T MRI scans for an average of 4.1 years, including a 1mm<sup>3</sup> 3D T1-weighted sequence (3DT1; 2485 MRI scans). 81 healthy controls (HC) were scanned longitudinally on the same scanner using the same protocol (147 MRI scans). 3DT1s were processed using FreeSurfer's longitudinal pipeline after lesion inpainting. Rates of normalized thalamic volume loss in MS and HC were compared in linear mixed effects models. Simulation-based sample size calculations were performed incorporating the rate of atrophy in HC.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Results</span>: Thalamic volume declined significantly faster in MS subjects compared to HC, with an estimated decline of -0.71% per year (95% CI -0.77%, -0.64%) in MS subjects and -0.28% per year (95% CI -0.58%, 0.02%) in HC (p-value for difference=0.007). The rate of decline was consistent throughout the MS disease duration and across MS clinical subtypes. 80 or 100 subjects per arm (α=0.1 or 0.05, respectively) would be needed to detect the ‘maximal effect size' with 80% power in a 24-month study.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><span class="underlined ">Interpretation</span>: Thalamic atrophy occurs early and consistently throughout MS. Preliminary sample size calculations appear feasible, adding to its appeal as an MRI marker associated with neurodegeneration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<p>The quest for a scientific description of consciousness has given rise to new
theoretical and empirical paradigms for the investigation of phenomenological
contents as well as clinical disorders of consciousness. An outstanding
challenge in the field is to develop measures that uniquely quantify global
brain states tied to consciousness. In particular, information-theoretic
complexity measures such as integrated information have recently been proposed
as measures of conscious awareness. This suggests a new framework to
quantitatively classify states of consciousness. However, it has proven
increasingly difficult to apply these complexity measures to realistic brain
networks. In part, this is due to high computational costs incurred when
implementing these measures on realistically large network dimensions.
Nonetheless, complexity measures for quantifying states of consciousness are
important for assisting clinical diagnosis and therapy. This article is meant
to serve as a lookup table of measures of consciousness, with particular
emphasis on clinical applicability of these measures. We consider both,
principle-based complexity measures as well as empirical measures tested on
patients. We address challenges facing these measures with regard to realistic
brain networks, and where necessary, suggest possible resolutions.

<p>Electrophysiological observation plays a major role in epilepsy evaluation.
However, human interpretation of brain signals is subjective and prone to
misdiagnosis. Automating this process, especially seizure detection relying on
scalp-based Electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, has been the
focus of research over recent decades. Nevertheless, its numerous challenges
have inhibited a definitive solution. Inspired by recent advances in deep
learning, we propose a new classification approach for EEG time series based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) via the use of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
networks. The proposed deep network effectively learns and models
discriminative temporal patterns from EEG sequential data. Especially, the
features are automatically discovered from the raw EEG data without any
pre-processing step, eliminating humans from laborious feature design task. We
also show that, in the epilepsy scenario, simple architectures can achieve
competitive performance. Using simple architectures significantly benefits in
the practical scenario considering their low computation complexity and reduced
requirement for large training datasets. Using a public dataset, a multi-fold
cross-validation scheme exhibited an average validation accuracy of 95.54\% and
an average AUC of 0.9582 of the ROC curve among all sets defined in the
experiment. This work reinforces the benefits of deep learning to be further
attended in clinical applications and neuroscientific research.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primary cilium in neural stem cells plays distinct roles in different stages during cortical development. Ciliary dysfunctions in human (i.e., ciliopathy) cause developmental defects in multiple organs, including brain developmental delays, which lead to intellectual disabilities and cognitive deficits. However, effective treatment to this devastating developmental disorder is still lacking. Here, we first investigated the effects of ciliopathy on neural stem cells by knocking down Kif3a, a kinesin II motor required for ciliogenesis, in the neurogenic stage of cortical development by in utero electroporation of mouse embryos. Brains electroporated with Kif3a shRNA showed defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, delays in neural stem cell cycle progression, and failures in interkinetic nuclear migration. Interestingly, introduction of Gli1 and Gli2 both can restore the cell cycle progression by elevating cyclin D1 in neural stem cells. Remarkably, enforced Gli2 expression, but not Gli1, partially restored the ability of Kif3a-knockdown neurons to differentiate and move from the germinal ventricular zone to the cortical plate. Moreover, Cyclin D1 knockdown abolished Gli2’s rescue effect. These findings suggest Gli2 may rescue neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and migration through Cyclin D1 pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for human ciliopathy syndromes through modulating the progression of neural stem cell cycle.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sensory gating is a neurophysiological process whereby the response to a second stimulus in a pair of identical stimuli is attenuated, and it is thought to reflect the capacity of the CNS to preserve neural resources for behaviorally relevant stimuli. Such gating is observed across multiple sensory modalities and is modulated by age, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. In this study, we examined somatosensory gating in 68 healthy adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and advanced oscillatory and time-domain analysis methods. MEG data underwent source reconstruction and peak voxel time series data were extracted to evaluate the dynamics of somatosensory gating, and the impact of spontaneous neural activity immediately preceding the stimulation. We found that gating declined with increasing age and that older adults had significantly reduced gating relative to younger adults, suggesting impaired local inhibitory function. Most importantly, older adults had significantly elevated spontaneous activity preceding the stimulation, and this effect fully mediated the impact of aging on sensory gating. In conclusion, gating in the somatosensory system declines with advancing age and this effect is directly tied to increased spontaneous neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortices, which is likely secondary to age-related declines in local GABA inhibitory function.</span>

However, the functional roles of subdivisions within the human insula are still not well understood. In the present study, we used intracranial electroencephalography and electrical cortical stimulation to investigate the causal roles of subdivisions of the insula in auditory emotion perception in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in this brain region. The posterior and the anterior subdivisions of the human insula, identified based on structural and functional analyses, showed distinct response properties to auditory emotional stimuli. The posterior insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl’s gyrus, whereas the anterior insula (AI) responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli in a similar way as observed in the amygdala. Furthermore, the degree of the differentiation between various emotion types increased from the posterior to the AI. Our findings suggest different roles played by the two regions of the human insula and a transformation from sensory to affective representations in auditory modality along the posterior-to-anterior axis in the human insula.</span>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/247460v1?rss=1">Focused learning promotes continual task performance in humans</a></h4>

Humans can learn to perform multiple tasks in succession over the lifespan ("continual" learning), whereas current machine learning systems fail. Here, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms that permit successful continual learning in humans. Unlike neural networks, humans that were trained on temporally autocorrelated task objectives (focussed training) learned to perform new tasks more effectively, and performed better on a later test involving randomly interleaved tasks. Analysis of error patterns suggested that focussed learning permitted the formation of factorised task representations that were protected from mutual interference. Furthermore, individuals with a strong prior tendency to represent the task space in a factorised manner enjoyed greater benefit of focussed over interleaved training. Building artificial agents that learn to factorise tasks appropriately may be a promising route to solving continual task performance in machine learning.

<p>by Cristina Izquierdo, José C. Gómez-Tamayo, Jean-Christophe Nebel, Leonardo Pardo, Angel Gonzalez</p>

Pungent chemical compounds originating from decaying tissue are strong drivers of animal behavior. Two of the best-characterized death smell components are putrescine (PUT) and cadaverine (CAD), foul-smelling molecules produced by decarboxylation of amino acids during decomposition. These volatile polyamines act as ‘necromones’, triggering avoidance or attractive responses, which are fundamental for the survival of a wide range of species. The few studies that have attempted to identify the cognate receptors for these molecules have suggested the involvement of the seven-helix trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), localized in the olfactory epithelium. However, very little is known about the precise chemosensory receptors that sense these compounds in the majority of organisms and the molecular basis of their interactions. In this work, we have used computational strategies to characterize the binding between PUT and CAD with the TAAR6 and TAAR8 human receptors. Sequence analysis, homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics studies suggest a tandem of negatively charged aspartates in the binding pocket of these receptors which are likely to be involved in the recognition of these small biogenic diamines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACfXAu-7iOM" width="1" />

The development of tracking methods for automatically quantifying individual behavior and social interactions in animal groups has open up new perspectives for building quantitative and predictive models of collective behavior. In this work, we combine extensive data analyses with a modeling approach to measure, disentangle, and reconstruct the actual functional form of interactions involved in the coordination of swimming in Rummy-nose tetra (<i>Hemigrammus rhodostomus</i>). This species of fish performs burst-and-coast swimming behavior that consists of sudden heading changes combined with brief accelerations followed by quasi-passive, straight decelerations. We quantify the spontaneous stochastic behavior of a fish and the interactions that govern wall avoidance and the reaction to a neighboring fish, the latter by exploiting general symmetry constraints for the interactions. In contrast with previous experimental works, we find that both attraction and alignment behaviors control the reaction of fish to a neighbor. We then exploit these results to build a model of spontaneous burst-and-coast swimming and interactions of fish, with all parameters being estimated or directly measured from experiments. This model quantitatively reproduces the key features of the motion and spatial distributions observed in experiments with a single fish and with two fish. This demonstrates the power of our method that exploits large amounts of data for disentangling and fully characterizing the interactions that govern collective behaviors in animals groups.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FrGkfbLqiNY" width="1" />

<p>by Andreas Madlung</p>

Applied bioinformatics skills are becoming ever more indispensable for biologists, yet incorporation of these skills into the undergraduate biology curriculum is lagging behind, in part due to a lack of instructors willing and able to teach basic bioinformatics in classes that don’t specifically focus on quantitative skill development, such as statistics or computer sciences. To help undergraduate course instructors who themselves did not learn bioinformatics as part of their own education and are hesitant to plunge into teaching big data analysis, a module was developed that is written in plain-enough language, using publicly available computing tools and data, to allow novice instructors to teach next-generation sequence analysis to upper-level undergraduate students. To determine if the module allowed students to develop a better understanding of and appreciation for applied bioinformatics, various tools were developed and employed to assess the impact of the module. This article describes both the module and its assessment. Students found the activity valuable for their education and, in focus group discussions, emphasized that they saw a need for more and earlier instruction of big data analysis as part of the undergraduate biology curriculum.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EoH1CnNvgc" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: To assess the diagnostic value of extended sleep duration on a controlled 32-hour bed-rest protocol in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: 116 patients with high suspicion of IH (37 clear-cut-IH according to multiple sleep latency test criteria and 79 probable-IH), 32 with hypersomnolence associated with a comorbid disorder (non-IH) and 21 controls underwent a polysomnography, modified-sleep latency tests and a 32-h bed-rest protocol. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to find optimal total sleep time (TST) cut-off values on various periods that discriminate patients to controls.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: TST was longer in patients with clear-cut-IH than other groups (probable-IH, non-IH and controls) and in patients with probable-IH than non-IH and controls. TST cut-off best discriminating clear-cut-IH and controls was 19h for the 32-h recording (sensitivity 91.9%, specificity 85.7%) and 12h (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24h. The 19-h cut-off displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between IH and non-IH patients. Patients with IH above the 19h cut-off were overweight, had more sleep inertia and higher TST on all periods compared to patients below 19h, while no differences were found for the 12h cut-off. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and TST during 32-h recording in IH patients.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation: In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cut-off best discriminating patients to controls was 19h over 32-h that allows a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes. Sleepier patients on MSLT were also the more severe in terms of extended sleep. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: To use a cluster analysis of [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 tau-PET data to determine how subjects with Alzheimer's disease vary in the relative involvement of the entorhinal cortex and neocortex, and determine whether relative involvement of these two regions can help explain variability in age and clinical phenotype in Alzheimer's disease.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>METHODS: We calculated [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 uptake in entorhinal cortex and neocortex in 62 amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease patients (39 typical and 23 atypical presentation). Tau-PET values were normalized to the cerebellum to create SUVRs. Tau-PET SUVRs were log-transformed and clustered blinded to clinical information into three groups using K-median cluster analysis. Demographics, clinical phenotype, cognitive performance, and apolipoprotein e4 frequency were compared across clusters.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified a cluster with low entorhinal and cortical uptake (E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Lo</sup>), one with low entorhinal but high cortical uptake (E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup>), and one with high cortical and entorhinal uptake (E<sup>Hi</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup>). Clinical phenotype differed across clusters, with typical AD most commonly observed in the E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Lo</sup> and E<sup>Hi</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> clusters, and atypical AD most commonly observed in the E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> cluster. The E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Lo</sup> cluster had an older age at PET and onset than the other clusters. The apolipoprotein e4 frequency was lower in the E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> cluster. The E<sup>Hi</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> cluster had the worst memory impairment, while the E<sup>Lo</sup>/C<sup>Hi</sup> cluster had the worst impairment in non-memory domains.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates considerable variability in [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake in AD, but shows that a straight-forward clustering based on entorhinal and cortical uptake maps well onto age and clinical presentation in AD.

<p>Disorders of consciousness are a heterogeneous mixture of different diseases
or injuries. Although some indicators and models have been proposed for
prognostication, any single method when used alone carries a high risk of false
prediction. This study aimed to investigate whether a multivariable paradigm
that combined resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical
characteristics could predict the outcome at an individual level and identify
the patient who would later recover consciousness. Three datasets comprising a
total of 112 patients with disorders of consciousness from two medical centers
in China were involved in the study. Of the three datasets, one was used as the
training dataset to establish a prediction model, and the other two were used
only for validation. Combining the features extracted from the resting state
functional magnetic resonance imaging and three clinical characteristics, i.e.
etiology, incidence age and duration of unconsciousness, we built a regression
model to predict the prognosis of the patients at the individual level. Each
patient was then classified based on whether or not they were expected to
recover consciousness. The classification accuracy was assessed by comparing
these results with the actual outcome during at least 12 months follow-up. The
model discriminated between patients who would later recover consciousness and
those who would not with an accuracy of around 90%. Notably, our method could
accurately identify the patients who were initially diagnosed as being in a
vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome but subsequently recovered
consciousness. The presented model was also able to identify the prognostic
importance of different predictors, including brain functions and clinical
characteristics. We therefore suggest that this novel multivariable prognostic
model is accurate, robust, and interpretable.

<p>by Jiafan Zhu, Dingqiao Wen, Yun Yu, Heidi M. Meudt, Luay Nakhleh</p>

Phylogenetic networks are rooted, directed, acyclic graphs that model reticulate evolutionary histories. Recently, statistical methods were devised for inferring such networks from either gene tree estimates or the sequence alignments of multiple unlinked loci. Bi-allelic markers, most notably single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), provide a powerful source of genome-wide data. In a recent paper, a method called SNAPP was introduced for statistical inference of species trees from unlinked bi-allelic markers. The generative process assumed by the method combined both a model of evolution for the bi-allelic markers, as well as the multispecies coalescent. A novel component of the method was a polynomial-time algorithm for exact computation of the likelihood of a fixed species tree via integration over all possible gene trees for a given marker. Here we report on a method for Bayesian inference of phylogenetic networks from bi-allelic markers. Our method significantly extends the algorithm for exact computation of phylogenetic network likelihood via integration over all possible gene trees. Unlike the case of species trees, the algorithm is no longer polynomial-time on all instances of phylogenetic networks. Furthermore, the method utilizes a reversible-jump MCMC technique to sample the posterior of phylogenetic networks given bi-allelic marker data. Our method has a very good performance in terms of accuracy and robustness as we demonstrate on simulated data, as well as a data set of multiple New Zealand species of the plant genus <i>Ourisia</i> (Plantaginaceae). We implemented the method in the publicly available, open-source PhyloNet software package.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7jukor-zhbs" width="1" />

<p>The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is expressed both presynaptically and postsynaptically during neuromuscular junction formation. Genetic deletion in mice of all three isoforms (180, 140, and 120 kDa), or just the 180 isoform, suggested that different isoforms played distinct roles in synaptic maturation. Here we characterized in mice of either sex the earliest adhesive contacts between the growth cones of motoneurons and myotubes and their subsequent maturation into functional synapses in cocultures of motoneurons and myotubes, which expressed their normal complement of NCAM isoforms, or were lacking all isoforms either presynaptically or postsynaptically. Growth cone contact with +/+ mouse myotubes resulted in immediate adhesive contacts and the rapid downregulation of growth cone motility. When contacting NCAM<sup>–/–</sup> myotubes, growth cones touched and retracted/collapsed multiple times and failed to form stable contacts, even after 10 h. Exogenous expression in myotubes of either the 180 or 140 isoform, but not the 120 kDa isoform, rescued the rapid formation of stable contacts, the accumulation of presynaptic and postsynaptic molecules, and functional transmission. When NCAM was absent only in motoneurons, growth cones did not retract upon myotube contact, but, since their motility was not downregulated, they grew off the ends of the myotubes, failing to form synapses. The agrin receptor Lrp4 was strongly downregulated in NCAM-negative myotubes, and motoneuron growth cones did not make stable contacts with Lrp4-negative myotubes. These studies have identified novel roles for presynaptic and postsynaptic NCAM in mediating early cell–cell interactions required for synapse formation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although many molecular signals needed to form the functionally effective neuromuscular synapses required for normal movement have been described, the earliest signals that let motoneuron growth cones make stable adhesive contacts with myotubes and cease motility are not well understood. Using dynamic imaging of motoneuron–myotube cocultures, we show that NCAM is required on both the growth cone and myotube and that different NCAM isoforms mediate initial adhesion and the downregulation of growth cone motility. The agrin receptor Lrp4 was also essential for initial adhesive contacts and was downregulated on NCAM<sup>–/–</sup> myotubes. Our identification of novel roles for NCAM and Lrp4 and possible interactions between them in transforming motile growth cones into stable contacts opens interesting new avenues for exploration.</p>

<p>Cocaine abuse disrupts dopamine system function, and reduces cocaine inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT), which results in tolerance. Although tolerance is a hallmark of cocaine addiction and a DSM-V criterion for substance abuse disorders, the molecular adaptations producing tolerance are unknown, and testing the impact of DAT changes on drug taking behaviors has proven difficult. In regard to treatment, amphetamine has shown efficacy in reducing cocaine intake; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been explored. The goals of this study were twofold; we sought to (1) identify the molecular mechanisms by which cocaine exposure produces tolerance and (2) determine whether amphetamine-induced reductions in cocaine intake are connected to these mechanisms. Using cocaine self-administration and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in male rats, we show that low-dose, continuous amphetamine treatment, during self-administration or abstinence, completely reversed cocaine tolerance. Amphetamine treatment also reversed escalated cocaine intake and decreased motivation to obtain cocaine as measured in a behavioral economics task, thereby linking tolerance to multiple facets of cocaine use. Finally, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we found that cocaine tolerance is associated with the formation of DAT-DAT complexes, and that amphetamine disperses these complexes. In addition to extending our basic understanding of DATs and their role in cocaine reinforcement, we serendipitously identified a novel therapeutic target: DAT oligomer complexes. We show that dispersion of oligomers is concomitant with reduced cocaine intake, and propose that pharmacotherapeutics aimed at these complexes may have potential for cocaine addiction treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tolerance to cocaine's subjective effects is a cardinal symptom of cocaine addiction and a DSM-V criterion for substance abuse disorders. However, elucidating the molecular adaptions that produce tolerance and determining its behavioral impact have proven difficult. Using cocaine self-administration in rats, we link tolerance to cocaine effects at the dopamine transporter (DAT) with aberrant cocaine-taking behaviors. Further, tolerance was associated with multi-DAT complexes, which formed after cocaine exposure. Treatment with amphetamine deconstructed DAT complexes, reversed tolerance, and decreased cocaine seeking. These data describe the behavioral consequence of cocaine tolerance, provide a putative mechanism for its development, and suggest that compounds that disperse DAT complexes may be efficacious treatments for cocaine addiction.</p>

<p>Zinc is a transition metal that has a long history of use as an anti-inflammatory agent. It also soothes pain sensations in a number of animal models. However, the effects and mechanisms of zinc on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy remain unknown. Here we show that locally injected zinc markedly reduces neuropathic pain in male and female mice induced by paclitaxel, a chemotherapy drug, in a TRPV1-dependent manner. Extracellularly applied zinc also inhibits the function of TRPV1 expressed in HEK293 cells and mouse DRG neurons, which requires the presence of zinc-permeable TRPA1 to mediate entry of zinc into the cytoplasm. Moreover, TRPA1 is required for zinc-induced inhibition of TRPV1-mediated acute nociception. Unexpectedly, zinc transporters, but not TRPA1, are required for zinc-induced inhibition of TRPV1-dependent chronic neuropathic pain produced by paclitaxel. Together, our study demonstrates a novel mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of zinc on paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain that relies on the function of TRPV1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a major limiting factor affecting the chemotherapy patients. There is no effective treatment available currently. We demonstrate that zinc prevents paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity via inhibiting the TRPV1 channel, which is involved in the sensitization of peripheral nociceptors in chemotherapy. Zinc transporters in DRG neurons are required for the entry of zinc into the intracellular side, where it inhibits TRPV1. Our study provides insight into the mechanism underlying the pain-soothing effect of zinc and suggests that zinc could be developed to therapeutics for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/465?rss=1">Brainstem Pain-Control Circuitry Connectivity in Chronic Neuropathic Pain</a></h4>

<p>Preclinical investigations have suggested that altered functioning of brainstem pain-modulation circuits may be crucial for the maintenance of some chronic pain conditions. While some human psychophysical studies show that patients with chronic pain display altered pain-modulation efficacy, it remains unknown whether brainstem pain-modulation circuits are altered in individuals with chronic pain. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether, in humans, chronic pain following nerve injury is associated with altered ongoing functioning of the brainstem descending modulation systems. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that male and female patients with chronic neuropathic orofacial pain show increased functional connectivity between the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and other brainstem pain-modulatory regions, including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and locus ceruleus (LC). We also identified an increase in RVM functional connectivity with the region that receives orofacial nociceptor afferents, the spinal trigeminal nucleus. In addition, the vlPAG and LC displayed increased functional connectivity strengths with higher brain regions, including the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and anterior cingulate cortex, in individuals with chronic pain. These data reveal that chronic pain is associated with altered ongoing functioning within the endogenous pain-modulation network. These changes may underlie enhanced descending facilitation of processing at the primary synapse, resulting in increased nociceptive transmission to higher brain centers. Further, our findings show that higher brain regions interact with the brainstem modulation system differently in chronic pain, possibly reflecting top–down engagement of the circuitry alongside altered reward processing in pain conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Experimental animal models and human psychophysical studies suggest that altered functioning of brainstem pain-modulation systems contributes to the maintenance of chronic pain. However, the function of this circuitry has not yet been explored in humans with chronic pain. In this study, we report that individuals with orofacial neuropathic pain show altered functional connectivity between regions within the brainstem pain-modulation network. We suggest that these changes reflect largely central mechanisms that feed back onto the primary nociceptive synapse and enhance the transfer of noxious information to higher brain regions, thus contributing to the constant perception of pain. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of neuropathic pain is imperative for the development of more efficacious therapies.</p>

<p>Immune-related events in the periphery can remotely affect brain function, contributing to neurodegenerative processes and cognitive decline. In mice, peripheral surgery induces a systemic inflammatory response associated with changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and transient cognitive decline, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we investigated the effect of peripheral surgery on neuronal-glial function within hippocampal neuronal circuits of relevance to cognitive processing in male mice at 6, 24, and 72 h postsurgery. At 6 h we detect the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the hippocampus, followed up by alterations in the mRNA and protein expression of astrocytic and neuronal proteins necessary for optimal energy supply to the brain and for the reuptake and recycling of glutamate in the synapse. Similarly, at 24 h postsurgery the mRNA expression of structural proteins (GFAP and AQP4) was compromised. At this time point, functional analysis in astrocytes revealed a decrease in resting calcium signaling. Examination of neuronal activity by whole-cell patch-clamp shows elevated levels of glutamatergic transmission and changes in AMPA receptor subunit composition at 72 h postsurgery. Finally, lactate, an essential energy substrate produced by astrocytes and critical for memory formation, decreases at 6 and 72 h after surgery. Based on temporal parallels with our previous studies, we propose that the previously reported cognitive decline observed at 72 h postsurgery in mice might be the consequence of temporal hippocampal metabolic, structural, and functional changes in astrocytes that lead to a disruption of the neuroglial metabolic coupling and consequently to a neuronal dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A growing body of evidence suggests that surgical trauma launches a systemic inflammatory response that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. Understanding the mechanisms by which immune-related events in the periphery can influence brain processes is essential for the development of therapies to prevent or treat postoperative cognitive dysfunction and other forms of cognitive decline related to immune-to-brain communication, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Here we describe the temporal orchestration of a series of metabolic, structural, and functional changes after aseptic trauma in mice related to astrocytes and later in neurons that emphasize the role of astrocytes as key intermediaries between peripheral immune events, neuronal processing, and potentially cognition.</p>

<p>Early-life obesity predisposes to obesity in adulthood, a condition with broad medical implications including sleep disorders, which can exacerbate metabolic disturbances and disrupt cognitive and affective behaviors. In this study, we examined the long-term impact of transient peripubertal diet-induced obesity (ppDIO, induced between 4 and 10 weeks of age) on sleep–wake behavior in male mice. EEG and EMG recordings revealed that ppDIO increases sleep during the active phase but reduces resting-phase sleep quality. This impaired sleep phenotype persisted for up to 1 year, although animals were returned to a non-obesiogenic diet from postnatal week 11 onwards. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the ppDIO-induced alterations in sleep, we focused on the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Mice exposed to ppDIO did not show altered mRNA expression levels of orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone, two peptides that are important for sleep–wake behavior and food intake. Conversely, the LH of ppDIO-exposed mice had reduced contents of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), a neurotransmitter involved in both sleep–wake and satiety regulation. Interestingly, an acute peripheral injection of the satiety-signaling peptide YY 3–36 increased 5-HT turnover in the LH and ameliorated the ppDIO-induced sleep disturbances, suggesting the therapeutic potential of this peptide. These findings provide new insights into how sleep–wake behavior is programmed during early life and how peripheral and central signals are integrated to coordinate sleep.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adult physiology and behavior are strongly influenced by dynamic reorganization of the brain during puberty. The present work shows that obesity during puberty leads to persistently dysregulated patterns of sleep and wakefulness by blunting serotonergic signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. It also shows that pharmacological mimicry of satiety with peptide YY<sub>3–36</sub> can reverse this neurochemical imbalance and acutely restore sleep composition. These findings add insight into how innate behaviors such as feeding and sleep are integrated and suggest a novel mechanism through which diet-induced obesity during puberty imposes its long-lasting effects on sleep–wake behavior.</p>

<p>While cholinergic receptor activation has long been known to dramatically enhance the excitability of cortical neurons, the cellular mechanisms responsible for this effect are not well understood. We used intracellular recordings in rat (both sexes) neocortical brain slices to assess the ionic mechanisms supporting persistent firing modes triggered by depolarizing stimuli following cholinergic receptor activation. We found multiple lines of evidence suggesting that a component of the underlying hyperexcitability associated with persistent firing reflects a reduction in the standing (leak) K<sup>+</sup> current mediated by Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (ERG) channels. Three chemically diverse ERG channel blockers (terfenadine, ErgToxin-1, and E-4031) abolished persistent firing and the underlying increase in input resistance in deep pyramidal cells in temporal and prefrontal association neocortex. Calcium accumulation during triggering stimuli appears to attenuate ERG currents, leading to membrane potential depolarization and increased input resistance, two critical elements generating persistent firing. Our results also suggest that ERG current normally governs cortical neuron responses to depolarizing stimuli by opposing prolonged discharges and by enhancing the poststimulus repolarization. The broad expression of ERG channels and the ability of ERG blocks to abolish persistent firing evoked by both synaptic and intracellular step stimuli suggest that modulation of ERG channels may underlie many forms of persistent activity observed <i>in vivo</i>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Persistent activity, where spiking continues beyond the triggering stimulus, is a common phenomenon observed in many types of neurons. Identifying the mechanism underlying this elementary process of memory is a step forward in understanding higher cognitive function including short-term memory. Our results suggest that a reduction in the currents normally mediated by Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (ERG) K<sup>+</sup> channels contributes to persistent firing in neocortical pyramidal cells. ERG currents have been previously studied primarily in the heart; relatively little is known about ERG function in the brain, although mutations in ERG channels have recently been linked to schizophrenia. The present study is among the first to describe its role in neocortex in relation to biophysical correlates of memory function.</p>

<p>In human scalp EEG recordings, both sustained potentials and alpha-band oscillations are present during the delay period of working memory tasks and may therefore reflect the representation of information in working memory. However, these signals may instead reflect support mechanisms rather than the actual contents of memory. In particular, alpha-band oscillations have been tightly tied to spatial attention and may not reflect location-independent memory representations per se. To determine how sustained and oscillating EEG signals are related to attention and working memory, we attempted to decode which of 16 orientations was being held in working memory by human observers (both women and men). We found that sustained EEG activity could be used to decode the remembered orientation of a stimulus, even when the orientation of the stimulus varied independently of its location. Alpha-band oscillations also carried clear information about the location of the stimulus, but they provided little or no information about orientation independently of location. Thus, sustained potentials contain information about the object properties being maintained in working memory, consistent with previous evidence of a tight link between these potentials and working memory capacity. In contrast, alpha-band oscillations primarily carry location information, consistent with their link to spatial attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Working memory plays a key role in cognition, and working memory is impaired in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Previous research has suggested that human scalp EEG recordings contain signals that reflect the neural representation of information in working memory. However, to conclude that a neural signal actually represents the object being remembered, it is necessary to show that the signal contains fine-grained information about that object. Here, we show that sustained voltages in human EEG recordings contain fine-grained information about the orientation of an object being held in memory, consistent with a memory storage signal.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/398?rss=1">Inverted Encoding Models of Human Population Response Conflate Noise and Neural Tuning Width</a></h4>

<p>Channel-encoding models offer the ability to bridge different scales of neuronal measurement by interpreting population responses, typically measured with BOLD imaging in humans, as linear sums of groups of neurons (channels) tuned for visual stimulus properties. Inverting these models to form predicted channel responses from population measurements in humans seemingly offers the potential to infer neuronal tuning properties. Here, we test the ability to make inferences about neural tuning width from inverted encoding models. We examined contrast invariance of orientation selectivity in human V1 (both sexes) and found that inverting the encoding model resulted in channel response functions that became broader with lower contrast, thus apparently violating contrast invariance. Simulations showed that this broadening could be explained by contrast-invariant single-unit tuning with the measured decrease in response amplitude at lower contrast. The decrease in response lowers the signal-to-noise ratio of population responses that results in poorer population representation of orientation. Simulations further showed that increasing signal to noise makes channel response functions less sensitive to underlying neural tuning width, and in the limit of zero noise will reconstruct the channel function assumed by the model regardless of the bandwidth of single units. We conclude that our data are consistent with contrast-invariant orientation tuning in human V1. More generally, our results demonstrate that population selectivity measures obtained by encoding models can deviate substantially from the behavior of single units because they conflate neural tuning width and noise and are therefore better used to estimate the uncertainty of decoded stimulus properties.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is widely recognized that perceptual experience arises from large populations of neurons, rather than a few single units. Yet, much theory and experiment have examined links between single units and perception. Encoding models offer a way to bridge this gap by explicitly interpreting population activity as the aggregate response of many single neurons with known tuning properties. Here we use this approach to examine contrast-invariant orientation tuning of human V1. We show with experiment and modeling that due to lower signal to noise, contrast-invariant orientation tuning of single units manifests in population response functions that broaden at lower contrast, rather than remain contrast-invariant. These results highlight the need for explicit quantitative modeling when making a reverse inference from population response profiles to single-unit responses.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/379?rss=1">A Critical Role for Dopamine D5 Receptors in Pain Chronicity in Male Mice</a></h4>

<p>Dopaminergic modulation of spinal cord plasticity has long been recognized, but circuits affected by this system and the precise receptor subtypes involved in this modulation have not been defined. Dopaminergic modulation from the A11 nucleus of the hypothalamus contributes to plasticity in a model of chronic pain called hyperalgesic priming. Here we tested the hypothesis that the key receptor subtype mediating this effect is the D5 receptor (D5R). We find that a spinally directed lesion of dopaminergic neurons reverses hyperalgesic priming in both sexes and that a D1/D5 antagonist transiently inhibits neuropathic pain. We used mice lacking D5Rs (<i>DRD5KO</i> mice) to show that carrageenan, interleukin 6, as well as BDNF-induced hyperalgesia and priming are reduced specifically in male mice. These male <i>DRD5KO</i> mice also show reduced formalin pain responses and decreased heat pain. To characterize the subtypes of dorsal horn neurons engaged by dopamine signaling in the hyperalgesic priming model, we used c-fos labeling. We find that a mixed D1/D5 agonist given spinally to primed mice activates a subset of neurons in lamina III and IV of the dorsal horn that coexpress PAX2, a transcription factor for GABAergic interneurons. In line with this, we show that gabazine, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, is antihyperalgesic in primed mice exposed to spinal administration of a D1/D5 agonist. Therefore, the D5R, in males, and the D1R, in females, exert a powerful influence over spinal cord circuitry in pathological pain likely via modulation of deep dorsal horn GABAergic neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pain is the most prominent reason why people seek medical attention, and chronic pain incidence worldwide has been estimated to be as high as 33%. This study provides new insight into how descending dopamine controls pathological pain states. Our work demonstrates that dopaminergic spinal projections are necessary for the maintenance of a chronic pain state in both sexes; however, D5 receptors seem to play a critical role in males whereas females rely more heavily on D1 receptors, an effect that could be explained by sexual dimorphisms in receptor expression levels. Collectively, our work provides new insights into how the dopaminergic system interacts with spinal circuits to promote pain plasticity.</p>

<p><i>UBE3A</i> gene copy number variation and the resulting overexpression of the protein E6AP is directly linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the underlying cellular and molecular neurobiology remains less clear. Here we report the role of ASD-related increased dosage of Ube3A/E6AP in dendritic arborization during brain development. We show that increased E6AP expression in primary cultured neurons leads to a reduction in dendritic branch number and length. The E6AP-dependent remodeling of dendritic arborization results from retraction of dendrites by thinning and fragmentation at the tips of dendrite branches, leading to shortening or removal of dendrites. This remodeling effect is mediated by the ubiquitination and degradation of XIAP (X-linked inhibitors of aptosis protein) by E6AP, which leads to activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of microtubules. <i>In vivo</i>, male and female <i>Ube3A</i> 2X ASD mice show decreased XIAP levels, increased caspase-3 activation, and elevated levels of tubulin cleavage. Consistently, dendritic branching and spine density are reduced in cortical neurons of <i>Ube3A</i> 2X ASD mice. In revealing an important role for Ube3A/E6AP in ASD-related developmental alteration in dendritic arborization and synapse formation, our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of Ube3A/E6AP-dependent ASD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Copy number variation of the <i>UBE3A</i> gene and aberrant overexpression of the gene product E6AP protein is a common cause of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). During brain development, dendritic growth and remodeling play crucial roles in neuronal connectivity and information integration. We found that in primary neurons and in Ube3A transgenic autism mouse brain, overexpression of E6AP leads to significant loss of dendritic arborization. This effect is mediated by the ubiquitination of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of aptosis protein) by E6AP, subsequent activation of caspases, and the eventual cleavage of microtubules, leading to local degeneration and retraction at the tips of dendritic branches. These findings demonstrate dysregulation in neuronal structural stability as a major cellular neuropathology in ASD.</p>

<p>The pulvinar nucleus is a large thalamic structure involved in the integration of visual and motor signals. The pulvinar forms extensive connections with striate and extrastriate cortical areas, but the impact of these connections on cortical circuits has not previously been directly tested. Using a variety of anatomical, optogenetic, and <i>in vitro</i> physiological techniques in male and female mice, we show that pulvinocortical terminals are densely distributed in the extrastriate cortex where they form synaptic connections with spines and small-diameter dendrites. Optogenetic activation of these synapses <i>in vitro</i> evoked large excitatory postsynaptic responses in the majority of pyramidal cells, spiny stellate cells, and interneurons within the extrastriate cortex. However, specificity in pulvinar targeting was revealed when recordings were targeted to projection neuron subtypes. The neurons most responsive to pulvinar input were those that project to the striatum and amygdala (76% responsive) or V1 (55%), whereas neurons that project to the superior colliculus were rarely responsive (6%). Because the pulvinar also projects directly to the striatum and amygdala, these results establish the pulvinar nucleus as a hub linking the visual cortex with subcortical regions involved in the initiation and control of movement. We suggest that these circuits may be particularly important for coordinating body movements and visual perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found that the pulvinar nucleus can strongly influence extrastriate cortical circuits and exerts a particularly strong impact on the activity of extrastriate neurons that project to the striatum and amygdala. Our results suggest that the conventional hierarchical view of visual cortical processing may not apply to the mouse visual cortex. Instead, our results establish the pulvinar nucleus as a hub linking the visual cortex with subcortical regions involved in the initiation and control of movement, and predict that the execution of visually guided movements relies on this network.</p>

<p>Neurons in avian nucleus laminaris (NL) are binaural coincidence detectors for sound localization and are characterized by striking structural variations in dendrites and axon initial segment (AIS) according to their acoustic tuning [characteristic frequency (CF)]. T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CaT) channels regulate synaptic integration and firing behavior at these neuronal structures. However, whether or how CaT channels contribute to the signal processing in NL neurons is not known. In this study, we addressed this issue with whole-cell recording and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in brain slices of posthatch chicks of both sexes. We found that the CaT current was prominent in low-CF neurons, whereas it was almost absent in higher-CF neurons. In addition, a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient occurred at the dendrites and the AIS of low-CF neurons, indicating a localization of CaT channels at these structures in the neurons. Because low-CF neurons have long dendrites, dendritic CaT channels may compensate for the attenuation of EPSPs at dendrites. Furthermore, the short distance of AIS from the soma may accelerate activation of axonal CaT current in the neurons and help EPSPs reach spike threshold. Indeed, the CaT current was activated by EPSPs and augmented the synaptic response and spike generation of the neurons. Notably, the CaT current was inactivated during repetitive inputs, and these augmenting effects predominated at the initial phase of synaptic activity. These results suggested that dendritic and axonal CaT channels increase the sensitivity to sound at its onset, which may expand the dynamic range for binaural computation in low-CF NL neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons in nucleus laminaris are binaural coincidence detectors for sound localization. We report that T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CaT) current was prominent at dendrites and the axonal trigger zone in neurons tuned to low-frequency sound. Because these neurons have long dendrites and a closer trigger zone compared with those tuned to higher-frequency sound, the CaT current augmented EPSPs at dendrites and accelerated spike triggers in the neurons, implying a strategic arrangement of the current within the nucleus. This effect was limited to the onset of repetitive inputs due to progressive inactivation of CaT current. The results suggested that the CaT current increases the sensitivity to sound at its onset, which may expand the dynamic range for binaural computation of low-frequency sound.</p>

<p>Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug with only incompletely understood mechanisms of action. Previous work, using models of acute nociceptive pain, indicated that analgesia by acetaminophen involves an indirect activation of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors by the acetaminophen metabolite and endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor AM 404. However, the contribution of the cannabinoid system to antihyperalgesia against inflammatory pain, the main indication of acetaminophen, and the precise site of the relevant CB<sub>1</sub> receptors have remained elusive. Here, we analyzed acetaminophen analgesia in mice of either sex with inflammatory pain and found that acetaminophen exerted a dose-dependent antihyperalgesic action, which was mimicked by intrathecally injected AM 404. Both compounds lost their antihyperalgesic activity in <i>CB</i><sub><i>1</i></sub><sup>–/–</sup> mice, confirming the involvement of the cannabinoid system. Consistent with a mechanism downstream of proinflammatory prostaglandin formation, acetaminophen also reversed hyperalgesia induced by intrathecal prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>. To distinguish between a peripheral/spinal and a supraspinal action, we administered acetaminophen and AM 404 to <i>hoxB8-CB</i><sub><i>1</i></sub><sup>–/–</sup> mice, which lack CB<sub>1</sub> receptors from the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord. These mice exhibited unchanged antihyperalgesia indicating a supraspinal site of action. Accordingly, local injection of the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist rimonabant into the rostral ventromedial medulla blocked acetaminophen-induced antihyperalgesia, while local rostral ventromedial medulla injection of AM 404 reduced hyperalgesia in wild-type mice but not in <i>CB</i><sub><i>1</i></sub><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Our results indicate that the cannabinoid system contributes not only to acetaminophen analgesia against acute pain but also against inflammatory pain, and suggest that the relevant CB<sub>1</sub> receptors reside in the rostral ventromedial medulla.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetaminophen is a widely used analgesic drug with multiple but only incompletely understood mechanisms of action, including a facilitation of endogenous cannabinoid signaling via one of its metabolites. Our present data indicate that enhanced cannabinoid signaling is also responsible for the analgesic effects of acetaminophen against inflammatory pain. Local injections of the acetaminophen metabolite AM 404 and of cannabinoid receptor antagonists as well as data from tissue-specific CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-deficient mice suggest the rostral ventromedial medulla as an important site of the cannabinoid-mediated analgesia by acetaminophen.</p>

<p>We studied, in male Sprague Dawley rats, the role of the cognate hyaluronan receptor, CD44 signaling in the antihyperalgesia induced by high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWH). Low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMWH) acts at both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors to induce mechanical hyperalgesia that is prevented by intrathecal oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to CD44 mRNA, which also prevents hyperalgesia induced by a CD44 receptor agonist, A6. Ongoing LMWH and A6 hyperalgesia are reversed by HMWH. HMWH also reverses the hyperalgesia induced by diverse pronociceptive mediators, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, epinephrine, TNFα, and interleukin-6, and the neuropathic pain induced by the cancer chemotherapy paclitaxel. Although CD44 antisense has no effect on the hyperalgesia induced by inflammatory mediators or paclitaxel, it eliminates the antihyperalgesic effect of HMWH. HMWH also reverses the hyperalgesia induced by activation of intracellular second messengers, PKA and PKC<sub></sub>, indicating that HMWH-induced antihyperalgesia, although dependent on CD44, is mediated by an intracellular signaling pathway rather than as a competitive receptor antagonist. Sensitization of cultured small-diameter DRG neurons by prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> is also prevented and reversed by HMWH. These results demonstrate the central role of CD44 signaling in HMWH-induced antihyperalgesia, and establish it as a therapeutic target against inflammatory and neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We demonstrate that hyaluronan (HA) with different molecular weights produces opposing nociceptive effects. While low molecular weight HA increases sensitivity to mechanical stimulation, high molecular weight HA reduces sensitization, attenuating inflammatory and neuropathic hyperalgesia. Both pronociceptive and antinociceptive effects of HA are mediated by activation of signaling pathways downstream CD44, the cognate HA receptor, in nociceptors. These results contribute to our understanding of the role of the extracellular matrix in pain, and indicate CD44 as a potential therapeutic target to alleviate inflammatory and neuropathic pain.</p>

<p>Proper organization and dynamics of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton are essential for growth cone behaviors during axon growth and guidance. The MT-associated protein tau is known to mediate actin/MT interactions in cell-free systems but the role of tau in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics in living neurons is unknown. We used cultures of cortical neurons from postnatal day (P)0–P2 golden Syrian hamsters (<i>Mesocricetus auratus</i>) of either sex to study the role of tau in the organization and dynamics of the axonal growth cone cytoskeleton. Here, using super resolution microscopy of fixed growth cones, we found that tau colocalizes with MTs and actin filaments and is also located at the interface between actin filament bundles and dynamic MTs in filopodia, suggesting that tau links these two cytoskeletons. Live cell imaging in concert with shRNA tau knockdown revealed that reducing tau expression disrupts MT bundling in the growth cone central domain, misdirects trajectories of MTs in the transition region and prevents single dynamic MTs from extending into growth cone filopodia along actin filament bundles. Rescue experiments with human tau expression restored MT bundling, MT penetration into the growth cone periphery and close MT apposition to actin filaments in filopodia. Importantly, we found that tau knockdown reduced axon outgrowth and growth cone turning in Wnt5a gradients, likely due to disorganized MTs that failed to extend into the peripheral domain and enter filopodia. These results suggest an important role for tau in regulating cytoskeletal organization and dynamics during growth cone behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Growth cones are the motile tips of growing axons whose guidance behaviors require interaction of the dynamic actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules in neurons and in cell-free systems regulates actin–microtubule interaction. Here, using super resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, and tau knockdown, we show for the first time in living axonal growth cones that tau is important for microtubule bundling and microtubule exploration of the actin-rich growth cone periphery. Importantly tau knockdown reduced axon outgrowth and growth cone turning, due to disorganized microtubules that fail to enter filopodia and co-align with actin filaments. Understanding normal tau functions will be important for identifying mechanisms of tau in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/278?rss=1">The Role of Cysteine String Protein {alpha} Phosphorylation at Serine 10 and 34 by Protein Kinase C{gamma} for Presynaptic Maintenance</a></h4>

<p>Protein kinase C (PKC) knock-out (KO) animals exhibit symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), including dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra. However, the PKC substrates responsible for the survival of dopaminergic neurons <i>in vivo</i> have not yet been elucidated. Previously, we found 10 potent substrates in the striatum of PKC-KO mice. Here, we focused on cysteine string protein α (CSPα), a protein from the heat shock protein (HSP) 40 cochaperone families localized on synaptic vesicles. We found that in cultured cells, PKC phosphorylates CSPα at serine (Ser) 10 and Ser34. Additionally, apoptosis was found to have been enhanced by the overexpression of a phosphorylation-null mutant of CSPα, CSPα(S10A/S34A). Compared with wild-type (WT) CSPα, the CSPα(S10A/S34A) mutant had a weaker interaction with HSP70. However, in sharp contrast, a phosphomimetic CSPα(S10D/S34D) mutant, compared with WT CSPα, had a stronger interaction with HSP70. In addition, total levels of synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP) 25, a main downstream target of the HSC70/HSP70 chaperone complex, were found to have decreased by the CSPα(S10A/S34A) mutant through increased ubiquitination of SNAP25 in PC12 cells. In the striatum of 2-year-old male PKC-KO mice, decreased phosphorylation levels of CSPα and decreased SNAP25 protein levels were observed. These findings indicate the phosphorylation of CSPα by PKC may protect the presynaptic terminal from neurodegeneration. The PKC–CSPα–HSC70/HSP70–SNAP25 axis, because of its role in protecting the presynaptic terminal, may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cysteine string protein α (CSPα) is a protein belonging to the heat shock protein (HSP) 40 cochaperone families localized on synaptic vesicles, which maintain the presynaptic terminal. However, the function of CSPα phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) for neuronal cell survival remains unclear. The experiments presented here demonstrate that PKC phosphorylates CSPα at serine (Ser) 10 and Ser34. CSPα phosphorylation at Ser10 and Ser34 by PKC protects the presynaptic terminal by promoting HSP70 chaperone activity. This report suggests that CSPα phosphorylation, because of its role in modulating HSP70 chaperone activity, may be a target for the treatment of neurodegeneration.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/2/263?rss=1">Behavioral, Modeling, and Electrophysiological Evidence for Supramodality in Human Metacognition</a></h4>

<p>Human metacognition, or the capacity to introspect on one's own mental states, has been mostly characterized through confidence reports in visual tasks. A pressing question is to what extent results from visual studies generalize to other domains. Answering this question allows determining whether metacognition operates through shared, supramodal mechanisms or through idiosyncratic, modality-specific mechanisms. Here, we report three new lines of evidence for decisional and postdecisional mechanisms arguing for the supramodality of metacognition. First, metacognitive efficiency correlated among auditory, tactile, visual, and audiovisual tasks. Second, confidence in an audiovisual task was best modeled using supramodal formats based on integrated representations of auditory and visual signals. Third, confidence in correct responses involved similar electrophysiological markers for visual and audiovisual tasks that are associated with motor preparation preceding the perceptual judgment. We conclude that the supramodality of metacognition relies on supramodal confidence estimates and decisional signals that are shared across sensory modalities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Metacognitive monitoring is the capacity to access, report, and regulate one's own mental states. In perception, this allows rating our confidence in what we have seen, heard, or touched. Although metacognitive monitoring can operate on different cognitive domains, we ignore whether it involves a single supramodal mechanism common to multiple cognitive domains or modality-specific mechanisms idiosyncratic to each domain. Here, we bring evidence in favor of the supramodality hypothesis by showing that participants with high metacognitive performance in one modality are likely to perform well in other modalities. Based on computational modeling and electrophysiology, we propose that supramodality can be explained by the existence of supramodal confidence estimates and by the influence of decisional cues on confidence estimates.</p>

<div class="section" id="ana25121-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Dystonia is a movement disorder that has been associated with impaired motor learning and sequence recognition. However, despite evidence that patients with dystonia have a reduced sense of agency, it is unclear whether dystonia is specifically associated with impaired recognition of a movement sequence. We have shown previously that performance consistency in the temporal and kinematic domains predicts awareness of underlying motor patterns in a finger-tapping task. Since movements in dystonia are characterized by high variability, we predicted that subjects with dystonia would have decreased motor sequence awareness.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25121-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>Subjects with dystonia (n = 20) and healthy control adults (n = 30) performed finger-tapping sequences with a common motor pattern and changing stimulus-to-response mappings.

<p>On image data, data augmentation is becoming less relevant due to the large
amount of available training data and regularization techniques. Common
approaches are moving windows (cropping), scaling, affine distortions, random
noise, and elastic deformations. For electroencephalographic data, the lack of
sufficient training data is still a major issue. We suggest and evaluate
different approaches to generate augmented data using temporal and
spatial/rotational distortions. Our results on the perception of rare stimuli
(P300 data) and movement prediction (MRCP data) show that these approaches are
feasible and can significantly increase the performance of signal processing
chains for brain-computer interfaces by 1% to 6%.

<p>We do not yet understand how the vertebrate visual system provides for
recognition of ob- jects. Countless experiments have been performed to examine
the contribution of cues such as color, texture, and shadowing, but the most
important cues are the con- tours of the outer boundary. Most objects that we
can name can be identified as a silhouette, or equally well as a line drawing
of the boundary. This has long been ap- preciated, so it is somewhat surprising
that after more than a century of experimental research, we have not yet
established how our visual system encodes this shape in- formation.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02645">Personalizing deep learning models for automatic sleep staging. (arXiv:1801.02645v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Despite continued advancement in machine learning algorithms and increasing
availability of large data sets, there is still no universally acceptable
solution for automatic sleep staging of human sleep recordings. One reason is
that a skilled neurophysiologist scoring brain recordings of a sleeping person
implicitly adapts his/her staging to the individual characteristics present in
the brain recordings. Trying to incorporate this adaptation step in an
automatic scoring algorithm, we introduce in this paper a method for
personalizing a general sleep scoring model. Starting from a general
convolutional neural network architecture, we allow the model to learn
individual characteristics of the first night of sleep in order to quantify
sleep stages of the second night. While the original neural network allows to
sleep stage on a public database with a state of the art accuracy,
personalizing the model further increases performance (on the order of two
percentage points on average, but more for difficult subjects). This
improvement is particularly present in subjects where the original algorithm
did not perform well (typically subjects with accuracy less than $80\%$).
Looking deeper, we find that optimal classification can be achieved when broad
knowledge of sleep staging in general (at least 20 separate nights) is combined
with subject-specific knowledge. We hypothesize that this method will be very
valuable for improving scoring of lower quality sleep recordings, such as those
from wearable devices.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>GABAergic interneurons are notorious for their heterogeneity, despite constituting a small fraction of the neuronal population in the neocortex. Classification of interneurons is crucial for understanding their widespread cortical functions as they provide a complex and dynamic network, balancing excitation and inhibition. Here, we investigated different types of non-fast-spiking (nFS) interneurons in Layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with biocytin-filling. Based on a quantitative analysis on a combination of morphological and electrophysiological parameters, we identified 5 distinct types of L4 nFS interneurons: 1) <span style="font-style: italic;">trans-columnar projecting interneurons,</span>2) <span style="font-style: italic;">locally projecting non-Martinotti-like interneurons,</span> 3) <span style="font-style: italic;">supra-granular projecting Martinotti-like interneurons,</span>4) <span style="font-style: italic;">intra-columnar projecting VIP-like interneurons</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>5) <span style="font-style: italic;">locally projecting neurogliaform-like interneurons.</span> Trans-columnar projecting interneurons are one of the most striking interneuron types, which have not been described so far in Layer 4. They feature extensive axonal collateralization not only in their home barrel but also in adjacent barrels. Furthermore, we identified that most of the L4 nFS interneurons express somatostatin, while few are positive for the transcription factor Prox1. The morphological and electrophysiological characterization of different L4 nFS interneuron types presented here provides insights into their synaptic connectivity and functional role in cortical information processing.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In 2004, two landmark studies described the discovery of brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography) signals that increase with the number of items held in visual working memory (WM). These studies claimed that the signals leveled off (plateaued) once the number of memoranda reached the capacity of WM, as estimated by the prevailing model of the time. However, alternative models were not considered, and changing concepts of WM in the more than a decade since these studies were published necessitate a re-evaluation of their findings; newer models that provide the most accurate account of behavioral data do not incorporate a fixed limit on the number of items stored. Furthermore, an important claim made about the original studies, that signals plateau at each individual’s estimated capacity, has never been tested. Here, we pit the plateau model of signal strength against an alternative, saturation model, a biophysically plausible account in which signals increase continuously without plateau. We show that the saturation model provides a better description of the original data, challenging the assumption that imaging results provide evidence for a fixed item limit in WM.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Binocular disparity information is an important source of 3D perception. Neurons sensitive to binocular disparity are found in almost all major visual areas in nonhuman primates. In area V4, disparity processes are suggested for the purposes of 3D-shape representation and fine disparity perception. However, whether neurons in V4 are sensitive to disparity-defined edges used in shape representation is not clear. Additionally, a functional organization for disparity edges has not been demonstrated so far. With intrinsic signal optical imaging, we studied functional organization for disparity edges in the monkey visual areas V1, V2, and V4. We found that there is an orientation map in V4 activated by edges purely defined by binocular disparity. This map is consistent with the orientation map obtained with regular luminance-defined edges, indicating a cue-invariant edge representation in this area. In contrast, such a map is much weaker in V2 and totally absent in V1. These findings reveal a hierarchical processing of 3D shape along the ventral pathway and the important role that V4 plays in shape-from-disparity detection.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the past decade, several studies have investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on episodic memory abilities. However, the specific conditions under which tDCS affects memory remain largely unclear. Here, we report data from 4 experiments aimed at investigating the effects of anodal tDCS over the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) on verbal episodic memory. We evaluated tDCS-induced effects as a function of time of administration, nature of the memory encoding task, and age of the participants. A robust enhancement of memory performance was only found when anodal tDCS was delivered during intentional memorization. This enhancement was evident in young and older adults. tDCS applied during incidental memorization or during retrieval did not induce any modulation of memory performance, and memory was unaffected by offline administration before encoding or retrieval. These results show that the modulation of episodic memory functions by anodal tDCS over the left VLPFC is dependent upon the time of administration and the nature of the memory task. The findings may help profile the optimal stimulation protocols for neurorehabilitation interventions on individuals with memory decline.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The inferior temporal cortex (ITC) contains neurons selective to multiple levels of visual categories. However, the mechanisms by which these neurons collectively construct hierarchical category percepts remain unclear. By comparing decoding accuracy with simultaneously acquired electrocorticogram (ECoG), local field potentials (LFPs), and multi-unit activity in the macaque ITC, we show that low-frequency LFPs/ECoG in the early evoked visual response phase contain sufficient coarse category (e.g., face) information, which is homogeneous and enhanced by spatial summation of up to several millimeters. Late-induced high-frequency LFPs additionally carry spike-coupled finer category (e.g., species, view, and identity of the face) information, which is heterogeneous and reduced by spatial summation. Face-encoding neural activity forms a cluster in similar cortical locations regardless of whether it is defined by early evoked low-frequency signals or late-induced high-gamma signals. By contrast, facial subcategory-encoding activity is distributed, not confined to the face cluster, and dynamically increases its heterogeneity from the early evoked to late-induced phases. These findings support a view that, in contrast to the homogeneous and static coarse category-encoding neural cluster, finer category-encoding clusters are heterogeneously distributed even outside their parent category cluster and dynamically increase heterogeneity along with the local cortical processing in the ITC.</span>

Depressed individuals typically show poor memory for positive events, potentiated memory for negative events, and impaired recollection. These phenomena are clinically important but poorly understood. Compelling links between stress and depression suggest promising candidate mechanisms. Stress can suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibit dopamine neurons, and sensitize the amygdala. We argue that these phenomena may impair pattern separation, disrupt the encoding of positive experiences, and bias retrieval toward negative events, respectively, thus recapitulating core aspects of memory disruption in depression.

Unlike in most pathogens, multiple-strain (polygenomic) infections of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> are frequently composed of genetic siblings. These genetic siblings are the result of sexual reproduction and can coinfect the same host when cotransmitted by the same mosquito. The degree with which coinfecting strains are related varies among infections and populations. Because sexual recombination occurs within the mosquito, the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could depend on transmission dynamics, but little is actually known of the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. Part of the uncertainty stems from an incomplete understanding of how within-host and within-vector dynamics affect cotransmission. Cotransmission is difficult to examine experimentally but can be explored using a computational model. We developed a malaria transmission model that simulates sexual reproduction in order to understand what determines the relatedness of cotransmitted strains. This study highlights how the relatedness of cotransmitted strains depends on both within-host and within-vector dynamics including the complexity of infection. We also used our transmission model to analyze the genetic relatedness of polygenomic infections following a series of multiple transmission events and examined the effects of superinfection. Understanding the factors that influence the relatedness of cotransmitted strains could lead to a better understanding of the population-genetic correlates of transmission and therefore be important for public health.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DIdV_Uzv1uY" width="1" />

<p>The human brain is a large-scale network which function depends on dynamic
interactions between spatially-distributed regions. In the rapidly-evolving
field of network neuroscience, two yet unresolved challenges are potential
breakthroughs. First, functional brain networks should be estimated from
noninvasive and easy to use neuroimaging techniques. Second, the time/space
resolution of these techniques should be high enough to assess the dynamics of
identified networks. Emerging evidence suggests that Electroencephalography
(EEG) source connectivity method may offer solutions to both issues provided
that scalp EEG signals are appropriately processed. Therefore, the performance
of EEG source connectivity method strongly depends on signal processing (SP)
that involves various methods such as preprocessing techniques, inverse
solutions, statistical couplings between signals and network science. The main
objective of this tutorial-like review is to provide an overview on EEG source
connectivity. We describe the major contributions that the SP community brought
to this research field. We emphasize the methodological issues that need to be
carefully addressed to obtain relevant results and we stress the current
limitations that need further investigation. We also report results obtained in
concrete applications, in both normal and pathological brain states. Future
directions in term of signal processing methods and applications are eventually
provided

<p>Interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be complicated by
obfuscating artifacts. Artifact detection plays an important role in the
observation and analysis of EEG signals. Spatial information contained in the
placement of the electrodes can be exploited to accurately detect artifacts.
However, when fewer electrodes are used, less spatial information is available,
making it harder to detect artifacts. In this study, we investigate the
performance of a deep learning algorithm, CNN-LSTM, on several channel
configurations. Each configuration was designed to minimize the amount of
spatial information lost compared to a standard 22-channel EEG. Systems using a
reduced number of channels ranging from 8 to 20 achieved sensitivities between
33% and 37% with false alarms in the range of [38, 50] per 24 hours. False
alarms increased dramatically (e.g., over 300 per 24 hours) when the number of
channels was further reduced. Baseline performance of a system that used all 22
channels was 39% sensitivity with 23 false alarms. Since the 22-channel system
was the only system that included referential channels, the rapid increase in
the false alarm rate as the number of channels was reduced underscores the
importance of retaining referential channels for artifact reduction. This
cautionary result is important because one of the biggest differences between
various types of EEGs administered is the type of referential channel used.

<p>Hyperplane codes are a class of convex codes that arise as the output of a
one layer feed-forward neural network. Here we establish several natural
properties of non-degenerate hyperplane codes, in terms of the polar complex of
the code, a simplicial complex associated to any combinatorial code. We prove
that the polar complex of a non-degenerate hyperplane code is shellable and
show that all currently known properties of the hyperplane codes follow from
the shellability of the appropriate polar complex.

<p>Neural network (connectionist) models are designed to encode image features
and provide the building blocks for object and shape recognition. These models
generally call for: a) initial diffuse connections from one neuron population
to another, and b) training to bring about a functional change in those
connections so that one or more high-tier neurons will selectively respond to a
specific shape stimulus. Advanced models provide for translation, size, and
rotation invariance. The present discourse notes that recent work on human
perceptual skills has demonstrated immediate encoding of unknown shapes that
were seen only once. Further, the perceptual mechanism provided for
translation, size, and rotation invariance. This finding represents a challenge
to connectionist models that require many training trials to achieve
recognition and invariance.

<p>The behavior of many complex systems is determined by a core of densely
interconnected units. While many methods are available to identify the core of
a network when connections between nodes are all of the same type, a principled
approach to define the core when multiple types of connectivity are allowed is
still lacking. Here we introduce a general framework to define and extract the
core-periphery structure of multi-layer networks by explicitly taking into
account the connectivity of the nodes at each layer. We show how our method
works on synthetic networks with different size, density, and overlap between
the cores at the different layers. We then apply the method to multiplex brain
networks whose layers encode information both on the anatomical and the
functional connectivity among regions of the human cortex. Results confirm the
presence of the main known hubs, but also suggest the existence of novel brain
core regions that have been discarded by previous analysis which focused
exclusively on the structural layer. Our work is a step forward in the
identification of the core of the human connectome, and contributes to shed
light to a fundamental question in modern neuroscience.

<p>by Zixuan Cang, Lin Mu, Guo-Wei Wei</p>

This work introduces a number of algebraic topology approaches, including multi-component persistent homology, multi-level persistent homology, and electrostatic persistence for the representation, characterization, and description of small molecules and biomolecular complexes. In contrast to the conventional persistent homology, multi-component persistent homology retains critical chemical and biological information during the topological simplification of biomolecular geometric complexity. Multi-level persistent homology enables a tailored topological description of inter- and/or intra-molecular interactions of interest. Electrostatic persistence incorporates partial charge information into topological invariants. These topological methods are paired with Wasserstein distance to characterize similarities between molecules and are further integrated with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors, ensemble of trees, and deep convolutional neural networks, to manifest their descriptive and predictive powers for protein-ligand binding analysis and virtual screening of small molecules. Extensive numerical experiments involving more than 4,414 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBBind database (a non-redundant collection of PDBBind refined sets 2007, 2013, 2015, and 2016) and 128,374 ligand-target and decoy-target pairs in the DUD database are performed to test respectively the scoring power and the discriminatory power of the proposed topological learning strategies. It is demonstrated that the present topological learning outperforms other existing methods in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction and ligand-decoy discrimination.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hyJPg5SR-GY" width="1" />

<p>by Lajos Vágó, Balázs B. Ujfalussy</p>

The neuronal code arising from the coordinated activity of grid cells in the rodent entorhinal cortex can uniquely represent space across a large range of distances, but the precise conditions for optimal coding capacity are known only for environments with finite size. Here we consider a coding scheme that is suitable for unbounded environments, and present a novel, number theoretic approach to derive the grid parameters that maximise the coding range in the presence of noise. We derive an analytic upper bound on the coding range and provide examples for grid scales that achieve this bound and hence are optimal for encoding in unbounded environments. We show that in the absence of neuronal noise, the capacity of the system is extremely sensitive to the choice of the grid periods. However, when the accuracy of the representation is limited by neuronal noise, the capacity quickly becomes more robust against the choice of grid scales as the number of modules increases. Importantly, we found that the capacity of the system is near optimal even for random scale choices already for a realistic number of grid modules. Our study demonstrates that robust and efficient coding can be achieved without parameter tuning in the case of grid cell representation and provides a solid theoretical explanation for the large diversity of the grid scales observed in experimental studies. Moreover, we suggest that having multiple grid modules in the entorhinal cortex is not only required for the exponentially large coding capacity, but is also a prerequisite for the robustness of the system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IHOSyQSZuSI" width="1" />

<p>by Mathias Engel, James Longden, Jesper Ferkinghoff-Borg, Xavier Robin, Gaye Sağınç, Rune Linding</p>

Cell migration is a central biological process that requires fine coordination of molecular events in time and space. A deregulation of the migratory phenotype is also associated with pathological conditions including cancer where cell motility has a causal role in tumor spreading and metastasis formation. Thus cell migration is of critical and strategic importance across the complex disease spectrum as well as for the basic understanding of cell phenotype. Experimental studies of the migration of cells in monolayers are often conducted with ‘wound healing’ assays. Analysis of these assays has traditionally relied on how the wound area changes over time. However this method does not take into account the shape of the wound. Given the many options for creating a wound healing assay and the fact that wound shape invariably changes as cells migrate this is a significant flaw. Here we present a novel software package for analyzing concerted cell velocity in wound healing assays. Our method encompasses a wound detection algorithm based on cell confluency thresholding and employs a Bayesian approach in order to estimate concerted cell velocity with an associated likelihood. We have applied this method to study the effect of siRNA knockdown on the migration of a breast cancer cell line and demonstrate that cell velocity can track wound healing independently of wound shape and provides a more robust quantification with significantly higher signal to noise ratios than conventional analyses of wound area. The software presented here will enable other researchers in any field of cell biology to quantitatively analyze and track live cell migratory processes and is therefore expected to have a significant impact on the study of cell migration, including cancer relevant processes.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/3BwWexls06A/article">Cardinal features of involuntary force variability can arise from the closed-loop control of viscoelastic afferented muscles</a></h4>

<p>by Akira Nagamori, Christopher M. Laine, Francisco J. Valero-Cuevas</p>

Involuntary force variability below 15 Hz arises from, and is influenced by, many factors including descending neural drive, proprioceptive feedback, and mechanical properties of muscles and tendons. However, their potential interactions that give rise to the well-structured spectrum of involuntary force variability are not well understood due to a lack of experimental techniques. Here, we investigated the generation, modulation, and interactions among different sources of force variability using a physiologically-grounded closed-loop simulation of an afferented muscle model. The closed-loop simulation included a musculotendon model, muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organ (GTO), and a tracking controller which enabled target-guided force tracking. We demonstrate that closed-loop control of an afferented musculotendon suffices to replicate and explain surprisingly many cardinal features of involuntary force variability. Specifically, we present 1) a potential origin of low-frequency force variability associated with co-modulation of motor unit firing rates (i.e.,‘common drive’), 2) an in-depth characterization of how proprioceptive feedback pathways suffice to generate 5-12 Hz physiological tremor, and 3) evidence that modulation of those feedback pathways (i.e., presynaptic inhibition of Ia and Ib afferents, and spindle sensitivity via fusimotor drive) influence the full spectrum of force variability. These results highlight the previously underestimated importance of closed-loop neuromechanical interactions in explaining involuntary force variability during voluntary ‘isometric’ force control. Furthermore, these results provide the basis for a unifying theory that relates spinal circuitry to various manifestations of altered involuntary force variability in fatigue, aging and neurological disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3BwWexls06A" width="1" />

<p>Maximum Entropy models can be inferred from large data-sets to uncover how
local interactions can generate collective dynamics. Here, we employ such
methods to investigate the characteristics of neurons recorded by
multielectrode arrays in the cortex of human and monkey throughout states of
wakefulness and sleep. Taking advantage of the separation of cells into
excitatory and inhibitory types, we construct a model including this biological
feature. By comparing the performances of Maximum Entropy models at predicting
neural activity in wakefulness and deep sleep, we identify the dominant
interactions between neurons in each brain state. We find that during
wakefulness, dominant functional interactions are pairwise while during sleep,
interactions are population-wide. In particular, inhibitory cells are shown to
be strongly tuned to the inhibitory population. This shows that Maximum Entropy
models can be useful to analyze data-sets with excitatory and inhibitory cells,
and can reveal the role of inhibitory cells in organizing coherent dynamics in
cerebral cortex.

<p>A major challenge in sensory neuroscience is to understand how complex
stimuli are collectively encoded by neural circuits. In particular, the role of
correlations between output neurons is still unclear. Here we introduce a
general strategy to equip an arbitrary model of stimulus encoding by single
neurons with a network of couplings between output neurons. We develop a method
for inferring both the parameters of the encoding model and the couplings
between neurons from simultaneously recorded retinal ganglion cells. The
inference method fits the couplings to accurately account for noise
correlations, without affecting the performance in predicting the mean
response. We demonstrate that the inferred couplings are independent of the
stimulus used for learning, and can be used to predict the correlated activity
in response to more complex stimuli. The model offers a powerful and precise
tool for assessing the impact of noise correlations on the encoding of sensory
information.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Axons in the mature mammalian central nervous system have only a limited capacity to grow/regenerate after injury, and spontaneous recovery of motor functions is therefore not greatly expected in spinal cord injury (SCI). To promote functional recovery after SCI, it is critical that corticospinal tract (CST) fibers reconnect properly with target spinal neurons through enhanced axonal growth/regeneration. Here, we applied antibody treatment against repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) to a monkey model of SCI. We found that inhibition of upregulated RGMa around the lesioned site in the cervical cord resulted in recovery from impaired manual dexterity by accentuated penetration of CST fibers into laminae VII and IX, where spinal interneurons and motoneurons are located, respectively. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation following intracortical microstimulation revealed that the contralesional, but not the ipsilesional, primary motor cortex was crucially involved in functional recovery at a late stage in our SCI model. The present data indicate that treatment with the neutralizing antibody against RGMa after SCI is a potential target for achieving restored manual dexterity in primates.</span>

<p>by Zhewei Zhang, Zhenbo Cheng, Zhongqiao Lin, Chechang Nie, Tianming Yang</p>

Reinforcement learning has been widely used in explaining animal behavior. In reinforcement learning, the agent learns the value of the states in the task, collectively constituting the task state space, and uses the knowledge to choose actions and acquire desired outcomes. It has been proposed that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encodes the task state space during reinforcement learning. However, it is not well understood how the OFC acquires and stores task state information. Here, we propose a neural network model based on reservoir computing. Reservoir networks exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic activity patterns that are suitable to encode task states. The information can be extracted by a linear readout trained with reinforcement learning. We demonstrate how the network acquires and stores task structures. The network exhibits reinforcement learning behavior and its aspects resemble experimental findings of the OFC. Our study provides a theoretical explanation of how the OFC may contribute to reinforcement learning and a new approach to understanding the neural mechanism underlying reinforcement learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AUMovToj5Zo" width="1" />

Several antimalarial drugs exist, but differences between life cycle stages among malaria species pose challenges for developing more effective therapies. To understand the diversity among stages and species, we reconstructed genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolism for five life cycle stages and five species of <i>Plasmodium</i> spanning the blood, transmission, and mosquito stages. The stage-specific models of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> uncovered stage-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism and predicted potential targets that could affect several life cycle stages. The species-specific models further highlight differences between experimental animal models and the human-infecting species. Comparisons between human- and rodent-infecting species revealed differences in thiamine (vitamin B1), choline, and pantothenate (vitamin B5) metabolism. Thus, we show that genome-scale analysis of multiple stages and species of <i>Plasmodium</i> can prioritize potential drug targets that could be both anti-malarials and transmission blocking agents, in addition to guiding translation from non-human experimental disease models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WBx_sY5m_rA" width="1" />

Sweeney et al. show that the diversity of spinal inhibitory interneurons, defined by combinatorial transcription factor expression, differs along the body axis in correspondence with limb and thoracic motor output. Hox genes, not motor neurons, specify segmental differences in inhibitory interneuron identity.

Neural plasticity, the ability of neurons to change their cellular properties in response to past experiences, underpins memory. Hawk et al. show that in C. elegans a single-cell logic system can both represent sensory stimuli and guide memory-based behavioral preference.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: We aimed to characterize the association between pretreatment lesional volume measured on diffusion-weighted images and functional outcome, and estimate the impact on thrombectomy efficacy for ischemic stroke with anterior proximal intracranial arterial occlusion.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: Anterior circulation ischemic stroke patients who had pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging in the THRACE study were included. Lesional volume was semi-automatically segmented. Logistic regression was applied to model clinical outcome as a function of lesional volume. Outcomes included functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-2), degree of disability (ordinal mRS 0-6), and mortality at 3 months.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Of 298 included patients, with median lesional volume 17.2 mL (interquartile range [IQR] 9.2-51.8) and median mRS 2 (IQR 1-4), 51.0% achieved functional independence. Increased lesional volume was an independent predictor for a lower probability of functional independence (odds ratio [OR] 0.90 [95% CI 0.81-0.99] per 10 mL, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001), a less favorable degree of disability (common OR [cOR] 0.86 [95% CI 0.81-0.90] per 10 mL, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001), and a higher mortality rate (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.08-1.37] per 10 mL, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001). For additional thrombectomy, the number of patients needed to treat to achieve functional independence in 1 patient increased with lesional volume (10 for a volume of 80 mL; 15 for 135 mL). No significant treatment-by-dichotomized volume interaction for functional independence and mortality was observed.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation: Pretreatment lesional volume is an independent predictor for functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke with proximal intracranial occlusion. The clinical benefit of adding mechanical thrombectomy to thrombolysis decreased with the increase of lesional volume. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

In this issue of Neuron, Helfrich et al.

The key driver of Alzheimer’s pathophysiology remains controversial. Frere and Slutsky describe the integrated homeostasis network, composed of firing, genome, proteome, calcium, energy, and immune modules, that enables functional stability of neural circuits. The authors propose that firing homeostasis failure triggers a vicious cycle that dysregulates the whole homeostatic network, driving Alzheimer’s degeneration.

<p>by Shayna Stein, Rui Zhao, Hiroshi Haeno, Igor Vivanco, Franziska Michor</p>

Human primary glioblastomas (GBM) often harbor mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Treatment of EGFR-mutant GBM cell lines with the EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib can effectively induce cell death in these models. However, EGFR inhibitors have shown little efficacy in the clinic, partly because of inappropriate dosing. Here, we developed a computational approach to model the <i>in vitro</i> cellular dynamics of the EGFR-mutant cell line SF268 in response to different lapatinib concentrations and dosing schedules. We then used this approach to identify an effective treatment strategy within the clinical toxicity limits of lapatinib, and developed a partial differential equation modeling approach to study the <i>in vivo</i> GBM treatment response by taking into account the heterogeneous and diffusive nature of the disease. Despite the inability of lapatinib to induce tumor regressions with a continuous daily schedule, our modeling approach consistently predicts that continuous dosing remains the best clinically feasible strategy for slowing down tumor growth and lowering overall tumor burden, compared to pulsatile schedules currently known to be tolerated, even when considering drug resistance, reduced lapatinib tumor concentrations due to the blood brain barrier, and the phenotypic switch from proliferative to migratory cell phenotypes that occurs in hypoxic microenvironments. Our mathematical modeling and statistical analysis platform provides a rational method for comparing treatment schedules in search for optimal dosing strategies for glioblastoma and other cancer types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9ffKwWuBqlk" width="1" />

Gene expression is orchestrated by distinct regulatory regions to ensure a wide variety of cell types and functions. A challenge is to identify which regulatory regions are active, what are their associated features and how they work together in each cell type. Several approaches have tackled this problem by modeling gene expression based on epigenetic marks, with the ultimate goal of identifying driving regions and associated genomic variations that are clinically relevant in particular in precision medicine. However, these models rely on experimental data, which are limited to specific samples (even often to cell lines) and cannot be generated for all regulators and all patients. In addition, we show here that, although these approaches are accurate in predicting gene expression, inference of TF combinations from this type of models is not straightforward. Furthermore these methods are not designed to capture regulation instructions present at the sequence level, before the binding of regulators or the opening of the chromatin. Here, we probe sequence-level instructions for gene expression and develop a method to explain mRNA levels based solely on nucleotide features. Our method positions nucleotide composition as a critical component of gene expression. Moreover, our approach, able to rank regulatory regions according to their contribution, unveils a strong influence of the gene body sequence, in particular introns. We further provide evidence that the contribution of nucleotide content can be linked to co-regulations associated with genome 3D architecture and to associations of genes within topologically associated domains.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/isBV1L_-p0A" width="1" />

<p>by Igor Marín de Mas, Esther Aguilar, Erika Zodda, Cristina Balcells, Silvia Marin, Guido Dallmann, Timothy M. Thomson, Balázs Papp, Marta Cascante</p>

Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition promotes intra-tumoral heterogeneity, by enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and promoting drug resistance. We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model, PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential, while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. We suggest that this metabolic reprogramming endows PC-3/M cells with augmented energy metabolism for fast proliferation and PC-3/S cells with increased eicosanoid production impacting angiogenesis, cell adhesion and invasion. PC-3/S metabolism also promotes the accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid, a long-chain fatty acid with antiproliferative effects. The potential therapeutic significance of our model was supported by a differential sensitivity of PC-3/M cells to etomoxir, an inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid transport to the mitochondria.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1miMpMwymts" width="1" />

Integrating data from multiple regulatory layers across cancer types could elucidate additional mechanisms of oncogenesis. Using antibody-based protein profiling of 736 cancer cell lines, along with matching transcriptomic data, we show that pan-cancer bimodality in the amounts of mRNA, protein, and protein phosphorylation reveals mechanisms related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Based on the bimodal expression of E-cadherin, we define an EMT signature consisting of 239 genes, many of which were not previously associated with EMT. By querying gene expression signatures collected from cancer cell lines after small-molecule perturbations, we identify enrichment for histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as inducers of EMT, and kinase inhibitors as mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) promoters. Causal modeling of protein-based signaling identifies putative drivers of EMT. In conclusion, integrative analysis of pan-cancer proteomic and transcriptomic data reveals key regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic transformation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8JHO-bLweh0" width="1" />

Proteome balance is safeguarded by the proteostasis network (PN), an intricately regulated network of conserved processes that evolved to maintain native function of the diverse ensemble of protein species, ensuring cellular and organismal health. Proteostasis imbalances and collapse are implicated in a spectrum of human diseases, from neurodegeneration to cancer. The characteristics of PN disease alterations however have not been assessed in a systematic way. Since the chaperome is among the central components of the PN, we focused on the chaperome in our study by utilizing a curated functional ontology of the human chaperome that we connect in a high-confidence physical protein-protein interaction network. Challenged by the lack of a systems-level understanding of proteostasis alterations in the heterogeneous spectrum of human cancers, we assessed gene expression across more than 10,000 patient biopsies covering 22 solid cancers. We derived a novel customized Meta-PCA dimension reduction approach yielding M-scores as quantitative indicators of disease expression changes to condense the complexity of cancer transcriptomics datasets into quantitative functional network topographies. We confirm upregulation of the HSP90 family and also highlight HSP60s, Prefoldins, HSP100s, ER- and mitochondria-specific chaperones as pan-cancer enriched. Our analysis also reveals a surprisingly consistent strong downregulation of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and we stratify two cancer groups based on the preferential upregulation of ATP-dependent chaperones. Strikingly, our analyses highlight similarities between stem cell and cancer proteostasis, and diametrically opposed chaperome deregulation between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. We developed a web-based Proteostasis Profiler tool (Pro<sup>2</sup>) enabling intuitive analysis and visual exploration of proteostasis disease alterations using gene expression data. Our study showcases a comprehensive profiling of chaperome shifts in human cancers and sets the stage for a systematic global analysis of PN alterations across the human diseasome towards novel hypotheses for therapeutic network re-adjustment in proteostasis disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Fr0tWafT6PQ" width="1" />

In patient-derived midbrain dopamine neurons, glycosphingolipid reduction restored physiological α-synuclein conformers and diminished pathology.

Statistically optimal perceptual inference behavior is obtained by multiplicatively combining priors and likelihoods. Here Laquitaine and Gardner find evidence for a human inference strategy that approximates Bayesian optimality by a switching heuristic that forgoes combining priors and evidence.

Zhang et al. revealed a previously unrecognized central auditory pathway, which is involved in processing aversive acoustic signals and contributes to auditory fear conditioning. It opens a window to reconsider the overall strategy for auditory information processing in the brain.

Synaptic plasticity – the directed modulation of synaptic connections by specific activity histories or physiological signals – is believed to be a major mechanism for the modification of neuronal network function. This belief, however, has a ‘flip side’: the supposition that synapses do not change spontaneously in manners unrelated to such signals. Contrary to this supposition, recent studies reveal that synapses do change spontaneously, and to a fairly large extent. Here we review experimental results on spontaneous synaptic remodeling, its relative contributions to total synaptic remodeling, its statistical characteristics, and its physiological importance.

Persistent pain, which is poorly treated and estimated to afflict one third of the world’s population, is largely mediated by the sensitization of nociceptive neurons. This sensitization involves de novo gene expression to support biochemical and structural changes required to maintain amplified pain signaling that frequently persists even after injury to tissue resolves. While transcription-dependent changes in gene expression are important, recent work demonstrates that activity-dependent regulation of mRNA translation is key to controlling the cellular proteome and the development and maintenance of persistent pain.
