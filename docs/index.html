              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26804">EARS-UDE: Evaluating Auditory Response in Sensory Overload with Universal Differential Equations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.26804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory sensory overload affects 50-70% of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), yet existing approaches, such as mechanistic models (Hodgkin Huxley type, Wilson Cowan, excitation inhibition balance), clinical tools (EEG/MEG, Sensory Profile scales), and ML methods (Neural ODEs, predictive coding), either assume fixed parameters or lack interpretability, missing autism heterogeneity. We present a Scientific Machine Learning approach using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to model sensory adaptation dynamics in autism. Our framework combines ordinary differential equations grounded in biophysics with neural networks to capture both mechanistic understanding and individual variability. We demonstrate that UDEs achieve a 90.8% improvement over pure Neural ODEs while using 73.5% fewer parameters. The model successfully recovers physiological parameters within the 2% error and provides a quantitative risk assessment for sensory overload, predicting 17.2% risk for pulse stimuli with specific temporal patterns. This framework establishes foundations for personalized, evidence-based interventions in autism, with direct applications to wearable technology and clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26955">Neurons as Detectors of Coherent Sets in Sensory Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.26955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model sensory streams as observations from high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems and conceptualize sensory neurons as self-supervised learners of compact representations of such dynamics. From prior experience, neurons learn coherent sets-regions of stimulus state space whose trajectories evolve cohesively over finite times-and assign membership indices to new stimuli. Coherent sets are identified via spectral clustering of the stochastic Koopman operator (SKO), where the sign pattern of a subdominant singular function partitions the state space into minimally coupled regions. For multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, this singular function reduces to a linear projection onto the dominant singular vector of the whitened state-transition matrix. Encoding this singular vector as a receptive field enables neurons to compute membership indices via the projection sign in a biologically plausible manner. Each neuron detects either a predictive coherent set (stimuli with common futures) or a retrospective coherent set (stimuli with common pasts), suggesting a functional dichotomy among neurons. Since neurons lack access to explicit dynamical equations, the requisite singular vectors must be estimated directly from data, for example, via past-future canonical correlation analysis on lag-vector representations-an approach that naturally extends to nonlinear dynamics. This framework provides a novel account of neuronal temporal filtering, the ubiquity of rectification in neural responses, and known functional dichotomies. Coherent-set clustering thus emerges as a fundamental computation underlying sensory processing and transferable to bio-inspired artificial systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27366">A Sensing Whole Brain Zebrafish Foundation Model for Neuron Dynamics and Behavior</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.27366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural dynamics underlie behaviors from memory to sleep, yet identifying mechanisms for higher-order phenomena (e.g., social interaction) is experimentally challenging. Existing whole-brain models often fail to scale to single-neuron resolution, omit behavioral readouts, or rely on PCA/conv pipelines that miss long-range, non-linear interactions. We introduce a sparse-attention whole-brain foundation model (SBM) for larval zebrafish that forecasts neuron spike probabilities conditioned on sensory stimuli and links brain state to behavior. SBM factorizes attention across neurons and along time, enabling whole-brain scale and interpretability. On a held-out subject, it achieves mean absolute error <0.02 with calibrated predictions and stable autoregressive rollouts. Coupled to a permutation-invariant behavior head, SBM enables gradient-based synthesis of neural patterns that elicit target behaviors. This framework supports rapid, behavior-grounded exploration of complex neural phenomena.

                arXiv:2501.04139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To better understand anomalous contrast mechanisms that allow flicker-fused stimuli to be visible even when they provide the same average luminance as background. Method: Stimulus flicker was used to elicit differential activation of ON and OFF retinal channels at frequencies above the flicker-fusion threshold. Providing balanced light energy to ON and OFF channels will normally cause the stimulus to vanish into the background. Results: We used ultra-brief bright pulses, combined with ultra-long dark pulses, to elicit "anomalous contrast" that rendered the stimulus visible, even though it had the same average luminance as the background. The duration and intensity of flicker components were varied to gain insight into the conditions that would elicit this effect. Conclusions: Anomalous contrast displays violated the Talbot-Plateau law, but in doing so, provided an adaptive way to register and signal contours that matched background luminance. These findings contribute additional details about this visual adaptation, and we discuss how the retinal circuitry provides for stimulus visibility.

                arXiv:2510.25998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's "consciousness-first" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness, temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27379">Spiking Neural Networks: The Future of Brain-Inspired Computing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.27379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent the latest generation of neural computation, offering a brain-inspired alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals, SNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more energy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional performance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike count, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient descent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), are examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs closely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the 20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve competitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation windows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike counts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making them optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the suitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive applications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems. While promising, challenges persist in hardware standardization and scalable training. This study concludes that SNNs, with further refinement, are poised to propel the next phase of neuromorphic computing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27434">Exploiting heterogeneous delays for efficient computation in low-bit neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.27434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks rely on learning synaptic weights. However, this overlooks other neural parameters that can also be learned and may be utilized by the brain. One such parameter is the delay: the brain exhibits complex temporal dynamics with heterogeneous delays, where signals are transmitted asynchronously between neurons. It has been theorized that this delay heterogeneity, rather than a cost to be minimized, can be exploited in embodied contexts where task-relevant information naturally sits contextually in the time domain. We test this hypothesis by training spiking neural networks to modify not only their weights but also their delays at different levels of precision. We find that delay heterogeneity enables state-of-the-art performance on temporally complex neuromorphic problems and can be achieved even when weights are extremely imprecise (1.58-bit ternary precision: just positive, negative, or absent). By enabling high performance with extremely low-precision weights, delay heterogeneity allows memory-efficient solutions that maintain state-of-the-art accuracy even when weights are compressed over an order of magnitude more aggressively than typically studied weight-only networks. We show how delays and time-constants adaptively trade-off, and reveal through ablation that task performance depends on task-appropriate delay distributions, with temporally-complex tasks requiring longer delays. Our results suggest temporal heterogeneity is an important principle for efficient computation, particularly when task-relevant information is temporal - as in the physical world - with implications for embodied intelligent systems and neuromorphic hardware.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15983">W-PCA Based Gradient-Free Proxy for Efficient Search of Lightweight Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to the development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies: the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer. Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27037">Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.27037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model (ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly outperform existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis, which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively. Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87 at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82 percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: As a unifying concept in economics, game theory, and operations research, even in the Robotics and AI field, the utility is used to evaluate the level of individual needs, preferences, and interests. Especially for decision-making and learning in multi-agent/robot systems (MAS/MRS), a suitable utility model can guide agents in choosing reasonable strategies to achieve their current needs and learning to cooperate and organize their behaviors, optimizing the system's utility, building stable and reliable relationships, and guaranteeing each group member's sustainable development, similar to the human society. Although these systems' complex, large-scale, and long-term behaviors are strongly determined by the fundamental characteristics of the underlying relationships, there has been less discussion on the theoretical aspects of mechanisms and the fields of applications in Robotics and AI. This paper introduces a utility-orient needs paradigm to describe and evaluate inter and outer relationships among agents' interactions. Then, we survey existing literature in relevant fields to support it and propose several promising research directions along with some open problems deemed necessary for further investigations.

                arXiv:2506.15121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.

                arXiv:2508.05433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive success in control tasks. However, its policies, represented as opaque neural networks, are often difficult for humans to understand, verify, and debug, which undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for programmatic control policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as programmatic policy generators, combining them with evolutionary search to automate policy generation. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and guide targeted improvements, thereby enhancing policy discovery efficiency and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results demonstrate that MLES achieves performance comparable to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two standard control tasks while providing transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This approach also overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various tasks, showing promise as a new paradigm for developing transparent and verifiable control policies.

     alt="Adult Striatal Neurogenesis—A Comparative Approach Between Pigeons, Mice, Macaques, and Human"/>
<p>Striatal adult neurogenesis is an understudied field. Here, we add new quantitative data showing that pigeons provide high levels of adult neurogenesis in the striatum compared to mice. Besides, we show that macaque and human differ in their potential to produce adult-born neurons at least in the caudate nucleus.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adult neurogenesis describes the formation of new neurons in the adult brain, a process that is fundamental to related functions, particularly in the hippocampus. Although studies reported adult striatal neurogenesis in humans, the phenomenon is still understudied in those regions. Thus, to gain a deeper understanding in different species, the expression of neurogenic markers was quantitatively analyzed in striatal subregions of pigeons and mice. Further, in macaques and human a detailed analysis of the subventricular zone (SVZ) was performed and the human caudate nucleus was qualitatively examined. The results show higher neuronal plasticity in striatal subregions of pigeons compared to mice, as reflected by higher numbers of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)+, BrdU+/Doublecortin+, Doublecortin+, and BrdU+/Neuronal nuclei marker+ cells. Analysis of BrdU+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ signals indicated further higher gliogenesis/potential stem cell division in pigeons. As newborn striatal neurons may arise from stem cell niches in the SVZ, active proliferation was analyzed with (sex determining region Y)-box 2, GFAP, and Ki-67 in macaques and humans. Specific subdivisions of the SVZ were identified, with GFAP and Ki-67 differentially distributed. Additionally, signs of persistent neuronal plasticity were observed with Doublecortin+ cells in the human caudate nucleus but not in the macaque. The higher levels of striatal adult neurogenesis in pigeons and perspectives of useful methods may encourage the use of birds to investigate the functional role of this phenomenon and may facilitate our understanding of neuronal plasticity even in the human striatum in the future.</p>

">Structural changes in autism reflect atypical brain network organization and phenotypical heterogeneity: a hybrid deep network approach</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by heterogeneity in social and emotional responses, language, and behavior. Assessments such as the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) can quantify this variability but understanding underlying mechanisms and identifying distinct and shared atypical organization and function of brain networks remains a challenge. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to analyze imaging data. However, the relationship between structural brain changes observed in structural MRI (sMRI), the affected brain functional networks inferred from these structural changes, and their connection to ASD phenotypes and scores still requires systematic investigation. In this study, we ensembled 3D CNNs with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods to conduct a comprehensive analysis of macrostructural changes in ASD. We found consistently dominant involvement of (a) the left hemisphere, (b) the frontal and temporal lobe, and (c) the default mode, salience, and language networks in ASD. Our findings highlighted brain network similarities and differences between high and low severity ASD and showed that typically developed brains fall at the low-severity end of the high-to-low severity spectrum of ASD. Our systematic AI approach utilized the phenotypic heterogeneity and spectral nature of ASD to uncover significant structural changes across brain regions and functional networks, correlating the structural, functional, and phenotypical heterogeneity of individuals with ASD. This enabled us to identify known and novel global and local brain region and network changes in ASD in relation to phenotypes and clinical scores that can guide diagnostic subtyping.

">Modelling Predictive Coding in the Primary Visual Cortex (V1): Layer 2/3 Circuits for Prediction Error Computation through Compartmentalized Spiking Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Cortical Layer 2/3 has been consistently implicated as the locus of prediction-error signalling in hierarchical models of cortical sensory processing. However, the circuit mechanisms that generate biologically plausible prediction-error (PE) signals remain elusive. A spiking network model is presented here in which two-compartment excitatory pyramidal neurons interact with three inhibitory subtypes: parvalbumin-expressing (PV), somatostatin-expressing (SOM), and vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons,to compute sign-specific prediction errors (positive and negative PEs). Feedforward input targets the soma, whereas top-down feedback reaches the distal apical dendrite, enabling a local somato-dendritic comparison. A PE emerges whenever the balance between excitation and inhibition is selectively disrupted within one compartment, recruiting either positive-error (PE+) or negative-error (PE-) subpopulations of pyramidal neurons. Unlike prior learning-dependent, rate-based accounts, this fixed-weight spiking circuit shows that bidirectional PE signals (PE+ and PE) can arise online from compartment-specific balance without any synaptic weight updates. The model reproduces key experimental observations, including sparse mismatch responses, compartment-specific inhibition, and VIP-mediated disinhibition. Across four canonical sensory-prediction configurations, the circuit maintains a tight balance during matched input and generates bidirectional PE signals only under mismatch. By routing sensory drive from Layer 4 into Layer 2/3 and allowing the resulting PE activity to project toward deeper feedback generators, the model situates Layer 2/3 as a dedicated, feature-specific mismatch detector within a hierarchical inference network. These results provide a mechanistic bridge from dendritic computation to laminar predictive coding, demonstrating how realistic spiking dynamics can implement fast, sign-specific PE signaling without learning.

">Striatal Pathways for Action Counting and Steering</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for coordinating voluntary movements, yet their precise contribution remains a subject of debate. Using a novel operant counting task, we trained mice to perform a specific number of lever presses to obtain a reward, enabling quantification of continuous kinematics, discrete actions, and action sequences. Optogenetic manipulations of direct pathway (dSPN) and indirect pathway (iSPN) striatal projection neurons exert bidirectional and dissociable influences on both movement steering and action count progression: activation of dSPNs extends press sequences as if resetting an internal accumulator, whereas activation of iSPNs prematurely terminates them, mimicking completion of the count. In vivo calcium imaging reveals distinct yet intermixed populations of dSPNs and iSPNs representing either lever approach or count progression, with ramping activity patterns consistent with accumulation and discharge dynamics. Importantly, the difference between dSPN and iSPN population activity scales with proximity to both spatial and count-based goals, unifying discrete and continuous control within a push/pull model. These findings establish the BG as a central circuit for integrating kinematic and sequential representations to monitor and steer progress toward behavioral goals.

">KIF5A binds RNA to orchestrate synaptic mRNA localization and stress granules in ALS</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal health depends on the precise transport and local translation of mRNAs to maintain synaptic function across highly polarized cellular architecture. While kinesin motor proteins are known to mediate mRNA transport, the specificity and direct involvement of individual kinesins as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that KIF5A, a neuron-specific kinesin implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), functions as an RBP. We show that KIF5A directly binds mRNAs encoding synaptic ribosomal proteins and is required for their synaptic localization and for maintaining normal synaptic composition and function. Additionally, we show ALS-linked KIF5A mutations confer gain-of-function properties, enhancing mRNA binding, increasing synaptic ribosomal protein accumulation, inducing neuronal hyperexcitability, and impairing stress responses. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mutant KIF5A disrupts synaptic homeostasis. Our work positions a kinesin motor protein as an RBP with critical roles in mRNA transport, local translation, and stress response.

">Tuned to explore: Increased phasic responses to auditory targets and novelty in children regardless of induced tonic arousal</a></h4>

              
                The ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring distractions is critical during childhood, as it supports learning, social interaction, and adaptation to changing environments. This attentional balance is thought to depend in part on arousal regulation, mediated by the activity of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Moderate levels of arousal are typically associated with optimal cognitive performance. However, the interaction between arousal and attention remains poorly understood in humans, especially during development. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally modulating tonic arousal, the baseline level of physiological alertness, affects attentional processing in children (N = 44, aged 6-8) and adults (N = 46, aged 18-35). Participants performed an active auditory three-stimulus (standard, novel, target) oddball task, designed to assess selective attention to target tones and distraction by novel sounds. Prior to each task block, tonic arousal was manipulated using music or videos varying in arousing content. Physiological responses were recorded continuously (skin conductance, pupil dilation, heart rate) to index both tonic arousal and transient, phasic changes in arousal triggered by task events. While tonic arousal modulation was successful, as confirmed by skin conductance levels, Bayesian analyses provided evidence for no effect of this modulation on subsequent attentional processing. Importantly, children generally exhibited stronger phasic arousal responses, particularly to task-irrelevant novel sounds, reflecting less mature regulation of attention and arousal. These findings show developmental differences in physiological responses to unexpected environmental stimuli and provide physiological evidence of increased distractibility during childhood.

">Deletion of Cacna1c (CaV1.2) in D1-expressing cells elicits divergent sex-specific effects on aversive and spatial memories</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine signaling is critical for cognitive and emotional regulation and is implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. One downstream effector of dopamine is the L-type calcium channel CaV1.2, encoded by the risk gene CACNA1C. Genome-wide association studies have consistently linked CACNA1C single nucleotide polymorphisms to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related conditions. We previously showed that homozygous deletion of Cacna1c in dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-expressing cells enhances remote (30 days post-training) contextual fear memory in male mice. Here, we extend these findings by examining sex- and gene dosage-specific behavioral consequences of Cacna1c loss in D1 cells. We find that D1-Cacna1c deletion produces a sex- and gene dosage-dependent effect on fear memory. In males, homozygous loss of D1-Cacna1c heightens remote contextual fear at 30-days post-training, replicating prior findings, whereas partial loss had no effect. Cue-associated fear memory remained unaffected across genotypes. In contrast, females exhibited heightened contextual fear with both heterozygous and homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss at 24-hrs, 7-days, and 30-days post-training, indicating increased sensitivity to contextual aversive learning. Cue-associated fear memory was higher at 24-hrs but normalized at later time points in females. In the Water Y-maze, males with heterozygous or homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss showed impaired spatial memory at 7-days post-training, whereas females were unaffected. D1-Cacna1c deletion reduced locomotor activity selectively in females during the initial 5-mins of a 60-min session, with no genotype effects in males. Social interaction and anxiety-like behavior were unchanged across groups. Together, these findings highlight the interplay between dopamine receptor signaling and calcium channel function in shaping sex-dependent aspects of memory.

">Senescent astrocytic deposits drive cognitive decline by disrupting tripartite synapse in the aging brain</a></h4>

              
                Brain aging involves synapse decline, with astrocytes playing a key role in synapse homeostasis. However, the impact of astrocyte senescence on synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline remains unclear. Here, we identified a hallmark of aging astrocytes Senescent Astrocytic Deposits (SAD) observed at aged rodents, macaques, and human hippocampal astrocytic processes that is associated with tripartite synapse dysfunction and memory decline. Laser capture microdissection-coupled mass spectrometry (LCM-MS), spatial transcriptome analysis and 3D electron microscopy revealed that SAD are abnormal protein deposits at the processes of ApoE-high expression astrocyte subtype and associated with dysfunctional tripartite synapses. Using a transgenic mouse (Nrbf2 knockout) with accelerated SAD formation as a tool for genetic manipulation, we clearly demonstrated that age-dependent defect of phagocytosis at maturation stage in astrocytic drives SAD accumulation, synaptic injury and cognitive deficits. Collectively, our findings establish SAD as a mechanistic link between astrocyte senescence and synaptic damage, underscoring the critical role of astrocytic phagocytic function in preserving synaptic homeostasis and cognitive function during aging.

">Rapid generation of ventral A9-like dopaminergic neurons from patterned iPSCs</a></h4>

              
                In vitro modelling of highly vulnerable nigral dopaminergic (DA) neuronal subtypes in Parkinson's disease (PD), is necessary for studying disease mechanisms. Here, we optimized a new approach by expressing the pioneer neurogenic transcription factor, Achaete-scute-like 1 (Ascl1), implicated in determining dopaminergic fate. Sequential small-molecule patterning of iPSCs into early floor plate mesencephalic progenitors, followed by inducible Ascl1 expression, rapidly differentiates midbrain DA neurons. Immunocytochemistry and transcriptomic analysis of these patterned Ascl1-driven DA neurons (PA-DANs) confirmed midbrain-lineage specificity. Importantly, we found an enrichment of DA subpopulations that corresponded to the adult human ventral SOX6-positive A9 DA subtypes vulnerable in PD. Furthermore, we combined these ventral A9-like PA-DANs with human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes and microglia in defined ratios to generate mature 3D A9-like assembled organoids that display characteristic spontaneous neuronal activity and electrical propagation along the axon. Our method efficiently generates a mature and functional A9-like DA neuronal platform to study PD.

">Oligodendrocytes support functional development of subcortical premotor neurons and navigation</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce are required for proper balance behaviors in adult vertebrates. If, when, and how they shape the functional development of vestibular (balance) circuits and associated behaviors is unclear. We first adopted a pharmacological approach to investigate the contribution of oligodendrocytes across early development of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Disruption of oligodendrogenesis reduces the number of oligodendrocytes near vestibular neurons across development, but only impacts vertical navigation -- a behavior requiring vestibular function -- in older larvae. Correspondingly, we found that midbrain premotor neurons in the vertical navigation circuit only decreased their responses to tilts at later ages. In contrast, we found that the vestibulo-ocular reflex was unaffected by drug treatment, and that body-tilt responses in the underlying hindbrain vestibular neurons and their target extraocular motor neurons were unchanged. Targeted photoablation of oligodendrocytes in the anterior hindbrain replicated our pharmacological findings, selectively disrupting vertical navigation in older animals. By dissociating where and when developmentally-disrupted oligodendrogenesis impacts neuronal function and behavior, our work takes a major step towards understanding how oligodendrocytes enable the maturation of sensorimotor behaviors.

">A semantotopic map in human hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a central role in encoding abstract conceptual and semantic information. However, little is known about the topography of that encoding. We leveraged the rare opportunity to examine neural responses densely along a small portion of the human hippocampus, specifically, the mediolateral axis of the anterior body. We collected responses to passive language listening using Neuropixels probes in three anesthetized patients during clinically indicated neurosurgical procedures. We computed semantic tuning functions for each recording site by regressing threshold crossing events and single unit responses against semantic embeddings from GPT-2, Word2Vec, and SBERT. We find that tuning functions of more distant recording sites are more dissimilar, supporting the hypothesis semantotopic organization. Multiple semantic features showed systematic changes along that axis, including animacy, concreteness, and familiarity; notably, effects were individual-specific. Surprisingly, we also found a small but significant increase in semantic similarity as a function of distance between recording sites, on a shorter spatial scale, suggesting a modest periodic organization. Together, these results demonstrate the presence of a multiscale functional organization of semantics in the hippocampus.

">Task-optimized models of sensory uncertainty reproduce human confidence judgments</a></h4>

              
                Sensory input is often ambiguous, leading to uncertain interpretations of the external world. Estimates of perceptual uncertainty might be useful in guiding behavior, but it remains unclear whether humans explicitly represent uncertainty in naturalistic settings, and whether any such representations are normatively correct. Progress has been hindered by the absence of stimulus-computable models that estimate uncertainty. We developed a class of task-optimized models that generate probability distributions over perceptual estimates. To assess whether human uncertainty representations align with the model's, we compared human confidence judgments, which might indirectly reflect uncertainty representations, to confidence judgments extracted from the model's uncertainty. In both sound localization and pitch perception, human confidence varied systematically, being lower for stimuli that produced more variable estimates across trials. Human confidence tracked model confidence across conditions, suggesting that human uncertainty representations accurately reflect the actual uncertainty of perceptual estimation. The modeling framework is extensible to other perceptual domains.

">From perception to valence: a pair of interneurons that assign positive valence to sweet sensation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Assigning valence, appeal or aversion, to gustatory stimuli and relaying it to higher-order brain regions to guide flexible behaviors is crucial to survival. Yet the neural circuit that transforms gustatory input into motivationally relevant signals remains poorly defined in any model system. In Drosophila melanogaster, substantial progress has been made in mapping the sensorimotor pathway for feeding and the architecture of the dopaminergic reinforcement system. However, where and how valence is first assigned to a taste has long been a mystery. Here, we identified a pair of subesophageal zone interneurons in Drosophila, termed Fox, that impart positive valence to sweet taste and convey this signal to the mushroom body, the fly's associative learning center. We show that Fox neuron activity is necessary and sufficient to drive appetitive behaviors and can override a tastant's intrinsic valence without impairing taste quality discrimination. Furthermore, Fox neurons transmit the positive valence to specific dopaminergic neurons that mediate appetitive memory formation. Our findings reveal a circuit mechanism that transforms sweet sensation into a reinforcing signal to support learned sugar responses. The Fox neurons exhibit a convergent-divergent "hourglass" circuit motif, acting as a bottleneck for valence assignment and distributing motivational signals to higher-order centers. This architecture confers both robustness and flexibility in reward processing: an organizational principle that may generalize across species.

">Neonatal brain volumes and birth characteristics predict behavioural outcomes in toddlerhood</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early brain structure and birth factors (e.g., sex, birth weight, gestational age at birth) are understood as critical to shaping lifelong developmental and psychopathological outcomes. Methods: Using data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, we examined whether neonatal brain volumes and birth factors predict developmental and socioemotional outcomes in toddlerhood. Structural MRI scans were acquired from 391 infants at birth (193 females, 198 males; mean age = 8 days), with follow-up behavioural assessments conducted in toddlerhood (mean age = 18 months). Results: Results demonstrated that larger neonatal brain volumes were associated with lower autistic traits and higher cognitive, language and motor outcomes. A higher gestational age and weight at birth were associated with higher scores on various of these outcomes - an effect that was partially mediated by larger brain volumes at birth. Females showed higher language scores compared to males, though this effect was suppressed rather than mediated by neonatal brain volumes. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate how birth factors interactively shape early developmental and neuropsychiatric outcomes.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In biparental species, repeated exposure to infants can induce parental behavior in virgin males and females. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity resulting from experience with infants. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures, regulate neuroplasticity during development and adulthood. We examined the impact of pup exposure on PNN expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial amygdala (MeA), and medial preoptic area (MPOA) in male and female California mice (<i>Peromyscus californicus</i>), a biparental rodent. We stained brain sections with the lectin <i>Wisteria floribunda agglutinin</i> (WFA) to examine WFA-positive PNN expression in adult virgins exposed to pups one, two, or three times and new parents. Controls were tested with a pup-sized object. Pup exposure altered WFA+ PNN density in the mPFC and MeA, but not MPOA, of males. Virgin males exposed to pups twice exhibited reduced WFA+ PNN density in the mPFC compared to virgin males exposed to pups only once. Pup-exposed fathers had lower WFA+ PNN density in the MeA than virgin males exposed to pups once. In contrast, pup exposure did not alter WFA+ PNN density in females. Additionally, WFA PNN density in the mPFC was higher in males than females. PNNs preferentially associated with GABAergic cells in the mPFC of males, whereas in the MeA, PNNs associated with a similar percentage of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. Our results suggest that dynamic changes in PNN expression occur with repeated exposure to pups in male California mice and might contribute to the onset of paternal behavior.</p>

">Is poor dose selection undermining the translational validity of antidepressant research involving animal models?</a></h4>

              
                Background: Behavioural studies in animal models represent a critical component of psychiatric drug development. Positive results in animal studies have identified novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder (MDD) but efficacy in humans has largely not been borne out in clinical trials. A possible reason for this failed translation is inappropriate dose selection and the engagement of mechanisms not directly relevant to antidepressant effects in patients. Methods: We first used PubMed to identify preclinical rodent studies in two assays used to assess antidepressants; the conventional forced swim test, (FST) and more recently developed affective bias test, (ABT). Dose ranges were extracted, as well as information about subjects, timing and route of administration, and justification and efficacy of dose(s). Dose ranges were compared against calculated animal equivalent doses. Results: The median FST dose across all antidepressants was 10mg/kg, with median doses for each drug exceeding the relevant animal equivalent dose by 1.5-25x. In contrast, effective doses in the ABT showed closer alignment to those used clinically. In the second study, 232 ketamine and 202 fluoxetine papers involving MDD-related research in rodents were reviewed. The median dose was 10mg/kg for both drugs, exceeding animal equivalent doses by 1.6-3.2x and 3.2-6.5x for ketamine and fluoxetine, respectively. Conclusions: The results indicate pervasive use of antidepressant doses in conventional models of MDD that may not correspond with doses used in clinical practice. We discuss the implications of using doses which exceed therapeutic levels and the potential to engage receptors and underlying mechanisms which are not relevant to clinical effects.

">Individual-level contextual alignment and aperiodic slope reveal improved comprehension of unexpected language</a></h4>

              
                In everyday language use, individuals are required to comprehend complex, continuous and often unexpected linguistic inputs to effectively communicate with others. Evidence from other domains of processing such as memory and learning suggest that individuals these unexpected inputs can often be remembered or learnt just as well as predictable inputs in follow up testing. However, language comprehension research often focuses on how individuals process these stimuli rather than how the information which is gathered can be used at a later time. It is proposed that, in line with memory and learning, individuals can utilise unexpected language inputs to support a deeper understanding of the information which is being communicated. Further, this will be related to the interaction between an individual's alignment to local context and inter-individual differences in information processing, such as aperiodic slope. The present study uses an alignment metric which measures the relationship between individual level N400 amplitudes (a neurophysiological metric of predictability) and surprisal (a text-collection-based metric of predictability), where higher alignment suggests the individual has a stronger preexisting schema. A steeper aperiodic slope has been suggested to reflect greater adaptation of predictive models in response to prediction errors; therefore, it is hypothesised that depth of language comprehension will be modulated by both alignment and aperiodic slope. To explore this, 30 participants (23F, 1 not reported; mean age: 22.2 years [SD:4.4]) listened to 12 short stories (3 genres, audio-visual presentation) while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Comprehension was tested via 6 multiple choice questions per story. An additional combined analysis, including a reanalysis of 40 audio-modality participants, provided evidence across both modalities that comprehension was improved for more surprising stories. Further, when considering inter-individual differences, the relationship between predictability and comprehension was shown to be modulated by both alignment and aperiodic activity. Comprehension of unexpected stories (as measured by N400 amplitudes) was improved only for lower aligned, steeper aperiodic slope individuals. This finding is considered a reflection of complementary processing strategies which are weighted towards incoming stimuli, increasing the likelihood of model updating and therefore resulting in improved comprehension of unexpected stories.

">Alzheimer's Disease-Related Mutations in APP Influence Colorectal Tumor Formation in a Sex-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                Cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are major age-associated diseases. Numerous studies have indicated common mechanisms and biological interactions between these conditions. Furthermore, epidemiological data demonstrate negative correlations between several cancers and AD. Despite this, few studies have explored their mutual influence on pathological outcomes. We utilized a human APP mutant knock-in AD mouse model to investigate how familial mutations influence colorectal cancer development. Using a colitis-associated colorectal cancer model, APP mutations promoted colon tumor formation in male mice but inhibited it in female mice. Correspondingly, inflammatory changes were reduced in the colons of female mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression, particularly in the enrichment of neuronal marker, steroid hormone, and immune cell signaling pathways. Additionally, distinct macrophage subtypes and neuronal profiles were observed in the colons of male and female APP mutant mice. These findings provide the first elucidation of the sex-dependent effects of APP mutations on colon cancer formation.

                Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) offer a minimally invasive window into systemic biology and immune dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed quantitative proteomic profiling of PBMCs from male and female AD patients and controls to assess sex differences. AD was associated with proteomic remodeling, with complement activation, coagulation, and neuronal signaling enriched in males, whereas females showed increased steroid hormone secretion, lipid metabolism, and acute-phase response with reduced translation and DNA maintenance. Despite distinct patterns, both sexes exhibited immune and hemostatic activation, underscoring shared systemic mechanisms and the need for sex-specific biomarkers and therapeutic strategies in AD.

">An artifact-robust framework for measuring tCS effects during stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Transcranial current stimulation (tCS) is a promising technique to non-invasively modulate human brain activity. However, stimulation artifacts in EEG and MEG recordings severely hinder the study of its online effects. Approach: Here, we introduce a new approach to account for these artifacts. The approach rests on two key ideas. First, we focus on interactions of tCS with intrinsic brain activity, which are absent for tCS artifacts. Second, rather than removing artifacts, we compare composite signals that share similar artifacts but potentially differ in the interaction of tCS with intrinsic brain activity. We follow a simple logic: if tCS does not interact with intrinsic brain activity, then neural activity during simultaneous sensory stimulation and tCS should equal the linear superposition of the neural effects of each applied alone. Any deviation from this prediction provides evidence for a neural interaction. Main results: We tested this approach in a proof-of-principle MEG study, applying 10 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) during rest and during a 10 Hz visual flicker. We compared neural activity during simultaneous stimulation with that predicted by the linear superposition of flicker and tACS alone and found a phase-dependent interaction between tACS and flicker-evoked brain activity. Significance: Our work establishes a novel approach to investigate online effects of tCS and suggests a state-dependent interaction of tACS with human brain activity.

">Aversive Learning Induces Context-Gated Global Reorganization of Neural Dynamics in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                Learning generates experience-dependent changes to the brain. However, how neurons of diverse functions and connectivity reorganize and modulate their activities to generate coherent changes while preserving essential functions is not well understood. Here, we address this question using an aversive olfactory learning paradigm whereby Caenorhabditis elegans learns to reduce its olfactory preference for pathogenic bacteria. Using functional imaging during olfactory stimulation in naive and trained animals, we show that, at brain-wide scale, cell type-by-cell type, learning induces context-gated reconfiguration of the organization of neural activity throughout the brain to alter neural responses only during bacteria-discrimination task, while leaving intact bacteria-sensing functions. We found that the context-gated encoding of learning is globally distributed across layers of the nervous system, composed of neurons carrying information of context or learning experience. In particular, aversive training modulates multiple functional connections within the nervous system, including those between sensory neurons and interneurons, as well as those among interneurons, in a context-gated manner. At the systems level, training modulates correlated activity of neural populations; we found that low-dimensional temporal patterns of population activity correlate well with locomotory gaits that express olfactory preferences. Upon training, the rotation and contraction of the low-dimensional neural manifolds shifts the brain into predisposed states for the context-gated display of learned behavior. Because animals encounter unpredictable environments in life, efficient learning about relevant cues while maintaining other functions is essential for survival. Our findings uncover network-level mechanisms that help explain how the brain reorganizes its activity patterns to both encode new experience and preserve essential functions.

">Competition Between Memory Updating and Differentiation Emerges from Intrinsic Network Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                When an event occurs that is similar to a previous experience, the original episodic memory can be modified with new information (updating) or a new memory can be encoded (differentiation). Prediction errors, the deviation between expected and actual stimuli, are believed to mediate the competition between updating and differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present a new analysis of experimental studies (Boeltzig, Liedtke, & Schubotz, 2025; Liedtke et al., 2025) that examine recognition memory and cued recall of similar conversations. The original version was recognized more confidently than the modified version, and the recognition confidence for modified versions showed a U-shaped dependence on the prediction error. Furthermore, the larger the prediction error, the more frequently participants retrieved two versions during cued recall. To account for these results, we propose a computational model based on a modified Hopfield network, which encodes the original and modified versions sequentially and weights the encoding of new patterns by the prediction error. The model shows that (1) similar new memories interfere with previous ones (updating) while dissimilar ones are stored separately (differentiation), (2) interference from similar representations leads to reduced memory accuracy and lower-confidence recognition, and (3) the encoding weight must be modulated by the prediction error to account for the experimental data. Our modeling results show that prediction-error-driven competition between updating and differentiation can emerge from intrinsic network dynamics alone.

">lncRNA 3222401L13Rik/ENSG00000272070 modulates microglial inflammatory programs in association with PU.1</a></h4>

              
                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of brain function, but their contribution to microglial aging and neurodegenerative disease remains largely unknown. Because only 1.5% of the human genome encodes proteins, whereas the vast majority of transcripts belong to the largely unexplored non-coding RNAome, elucidating the functions of non-coding RNAs provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand the space for therapeutic discovery. We recently identified the glia-enriched lncRNA 3222401L13Rik as upregulated in the aging mouse hippocampus. Here, we investigated its function in microglia and its human homolog ENSG00000272070. We found that 3222401L13Rik is expressed in both astrocytes and microglia and increases with age. Knockdown of 3222401L13Rik in primary microglia led to enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFalpha, and increased phagocytic activity. RNA sequencing revealed widespread transcriptional changes enriched for TNF and complement signaling pathways. The human homolog ENSG00000272070 showed conserved functions in iPSC-derived microglia, where its loss similarly promoted inflammatory gene expression and phagocytosis. Mechanistically, 3222401L13Rik interacts with the microglial transcription factor PU.1, and its depletion overlapped with PU.1-driven transcriptional programs. Consistent with these findings, ENSG00000272070 expression was significantly reduced in postmortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and AD-associated genes were enriched among 3222401L13Rik-regulated targets. Together, our results identify 3222401L13Rik/ENSG00000272070 as a conserved, aging-associated lncRNA that modulates microglial inflammatory states through interaction with PU.1. This work links glial lncRNA regulation to AD-related neuroinflammation and suggests 3222401L13Rik as a potential molecular target to fine-tune microglial activity in neurodegenerative diseases.

">From Perception to Appraisal: Hierarchical Brain Responses to Natural and Built Features in Urban Environments</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to urban rather than natural environments has been linked to elevated stress and diminished well-being, prompting interest in the underlying mechanisms and influences of specific urban elements. This study investigated how semantic and lower-level visual characteristics of urban scenes influence subjective experience and underlying neural processes. A total of 63 adults viewed street-level photographs depicting Berlin environments with varying proportions of vegetation, buildings, vehicles, and sky visibility while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Subjective ratings indicated that urban scenes with more greenery compared to built elements were consistently perceived as more positive. In terms of lower-level image features, images with higher non-straight edge density also led to scenes being perceived as more positive. In contrast, more visible sky area and a higher mean metric depth led to more negative scene appraisal. On a neural level, urban scenes with higher greenery/built ratios enhanced visual evoked P1 amplitudes, while higher straight-edge density led to more pronounced N1 amplitudes. Further analysis showed that later P3 and LPP components predicted subjective ratings on higher-level evaluative but not basic affective dimensions. These results partially replicate previous studies, suggesting that urban greenery exerts an effect on subjective well-being and influences early visual processing. Moving forward, neurourbanism research should employ more diversified stimuli and leverage immersive or in situ paradigms to refine our understanding of the relationship between greenery in urban environments and well-being to inform evidence-based urban design strategies.

">Pre-stimulus pupil-linked arousal enhances initial stimulus availability and accelerates decay in iconic memory.</a></h4>

              
                Pupil diameter reflects not only reflexive responses to light but also spontaneous fluctuations in arousal. Such pre-stimulus fluctuations may shape visual performance, yet it remains unclear whether they only affect perceptual sensitivity or decision processes in near-threshold tasks, or instead influence the temporal availability of sensory information even for highly visible stimuli. We tested whether pupil-linked arousal modulates iconic memory, a high-capacity but short-lived visual store bridging sensory encoding and short-term memory. Based on a model in which a brief stimulus evokes an internal response decaying over a few hundred milliseconds, we hypothesized that increased arousal enhances performance either by amplifying the initial response or by slowing its decay. Thirty-seven participants viewed brief displays of six oriented stimuli, followed by a cue after a variable stimulus-cue onset asynchrony indicating which item to report. Pre-stimulus pupil diameter was continuously recorded, and behavioral data were fitted with an exponential decay function estimating initial stimulus availability, decay rate, and asymptotic performance. Larger pre-stimulus pupil dilation was associated with higher initial stimulus availability but faster decay of the iconic trace, while information transferred into short-term memory and confidence ratings remained unaffected. These findings demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations in arousal shape the temporal dynamics of sensory persistence. Elevated arousal boosts the initial strength of visual representations but shortens their duration, suggesting that arousal adaptively prioritizes rapid updating of visual input over prolonged stability.

">Rank- and Threat-Dependent Social Modulation of Innate Defensive Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Fear and defense are among the most fundamental survival behaviors and are profoundly influenced by the social environment in group-living animals. While previous research has largely focused on learned fear paradigms, these approaches fail to capture the complexity of naturalistic threats. It remains poorly understood how social context-and particularly dominance hierarchy, a defining feature of many social species-modulates defensive strategies under ethologically relevant conditions. To address this question, we investigated the social modulation of innate fear in mice exposed to two ethologically relevant threats: a transient visual looming stimulus and a sustained live rat. Pair-housed mice with established dominance ranks were tested alone or with their social partner, and their behaviors were quantitatively analyzed. We found that social presence alleviates threat-induced stress and modulates defensive behaviors in a rank- and threat-specific manner: during looming exposure, it reduces immediate defensive responses and alleviates post-looming anxiety, with dominants showing greater benefit; during rat exposure, it promotes a shift from passive to active defense, again most prominently in dominants. Furthermore, threat exposure reinforces social roles and enhances group cohesion. Together, these findings demonstrate how dominance hierarchy modulates defensive responses to distinct naturalistic threats and, in turn, how threat experience shapes social behavior, providing a framework for probing the neural basis of socially modulated innate fear.

">Sensorimotor confidence during explicit motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Humans can adapt to large and sudden perturbations of sensory feedback. What multisensory and motor-execution cues are used to determine confidence in action success, and do the dynamics of confidence parallel those of ongoing sensorimotor adaptation? Participants made a slicing reach through a visual target with an unseen hand, followed by a continuous judgment of confidence in reach success. For the confidence judgment, participants adjusted the size of an arc centered on the target. Larger arcs reflected lower confidence. Points were awarded if the subsequent visual feedback was within the arc, and fewer points returned for larger arcs. This incentivized attentive reporting of confidence and minimizing feedback-target distance to maximize the score. After the confidence response, visual feedback of hand position was shown at the same distance along the reach as the target. A 20 deg rotation was applied to the feedback during the central 50 trials of a block (alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise across blocks). We used least-squares cross validation to compare four Bayesian-inference models of sensorimotor confidence using prospective cues (knowledge of motor noise and visual feedback from past performance), retrospective cues (proprioceptive measurements), or both sources of information integrated to maximize expected gain (an ideal observer) with additional parameters for learning and bias. All but one of the participants used proprioception to calculate sensorimotor confidence during motor adaptation in addition to prior information. Confidence recovered exponentially to pre-adaptation levels after the perturbation ended, but at a slower rate than motor learning.

">Reward-induced endogenous pain inhibition scales with action-outcome certainty in humans</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous pain modulation is thought to encompass a crucial evolutionary purpose in guiding decision-making away from harm. This is well exemplified by the idea that mechanisms of learning through error-correction and endogenous pain modulation are inherently intertwined. However, adaptive behavior requires more than learning through error-correction. Biological environments are volatile, which can cause decision-makers to be uncertain about what actions lead to rewards or punishments. Evidence on how uncertainty in action-outcome distributions impacts endogenous pain modulation is lacking. In the present study, we extend and adapt a well-established paradigm for the study of endogenous pain modulation with the implementation of a reversal learning outcome schedule. Thirty healthy human volunteers took part in this probabilistic gambling task, where they had to gamble for the obtainment of pain relief and the avoidance of pain punishments. Using a computational approach, we show that decision-making in a situation of acute pain is best explained by models that account for uncertainty. Such uncertainty is associated with the observed pain modulation in the task, indicating that endogenous pain modulation may be sensitive to volatility and the perception of uncertainty. Specifically, pain inhibition from winning pain relief increases as a function of certainty in what actions lead to pain relief. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering mechanisms of uncertainty processing in reinforcement learning from painful outcomes and endogenous pain modulation. Those mechanisms could be relevant to understanding behavioral changes in chronic pain, where altered reinforcement learning has already been established.

">Syntactic Processing Engages the Semantic Control Network</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between semantics and syntax is highly contested. Neuroimaging evidence has offered conflicting views on whether these domains are neurally separable, in part because prior work has not distinguished two key components of semantic cognition: semantic representation and semantic control. In this study, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify regions consistently engaged by more versus less demanding syntactic processing, and compared these directly with regions recruited by demanding versus less demanding semantic processing. Demanding syntactic processing engaged regions across the semantic control network (SCN), including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula (particularly on the left), left posterior temporal cortex (posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus), and bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. No regions outside the SCN responded significantly more to syntactic demands than semantic control. Within the SCN, there was significantly less reliable activation for syntactic than semantic control demands in some anterior (pars triangularis) and ventral (pars orbitalis) portions of the left IFG and a region in posterior fusiform and inferior temporal gyrus. Greater involvement for syntax than semantic control was identified in a small region of posterior left IFG (pars opercularis) within the SCN. Moreover, both controlled semantic and syntactic processing showed multimodal responses to auditory and visual stimuli in the left IFG and posterior temporal cortex. Together, these findings suggest that syntactic processing is distinct from semantic representation, yet demanding syntax engages portions of the SCN, reflecting a shared need to access and manipulate stored semantic knowledge for flexible, context-sensitive use.

">Can you feel what I am saying? Speech-based vibrotactile stimulation enhances the cortical tracking of attended speech in a multi-talker background</a></h4>

              
                In environments with multiple talkers, humans can tune in to a speaker of interest while ignoring competing voices. In such conditions, however, auditory cortices track the attended speech envelope rhythms (cortical tracking of speech, CTS) less accurately than in quiet, hindering intelligibility. Visual speech cues (e.g., lip movements) can enhance this CTS, but it remains unclear whether other non-auditory sensory cues, such as tactile input, provide comparable benefits through similar neural mechanisms. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we quantified syllabic (4-8 Hz) and phrasal (<1 Hz) CTS while participants attended to connected speech alone, together with synchronous or asynchronous speech-based vibrations, or with the corresponding speaker video, in both quiet and a multi-talker background noise. We hypothesized that, in noise, speech-based vibrotactile stimulation improves comprehension by enhancing CTS and modulating auditory-seeded functional brain connectivity with extra-auditory neocortical brain areas. Results revealed that synchronous vibrotactile stimulation improved comprehension in multi-talker noise and increased syllabic CTS at right auditory cortex, with this CTS increase magnitude correlating with comprehension performance. Audio-tactile CTS enhancement was accompanied by stronger beta-band auditory cortex connectivity with ipsilateral angular and ventral inferior temporal gyri, alongside reduced alpha-band coupling with the precuneus. These findings suggest that vibrotactile input can support speech-in-noise processing by impacting both local auditory cortical activity and auditory-seeded long-range functional connectivity.

">Hypothalamic CRH neurons gate rapid social appraisal of conspecifics</a></h4>

              
                Successful navigation of the social environment requires rapid evaluation of conspecifics to distinguish safe from threatening encounters. While the corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRHPVN) are well known for orchestrating endocrine stress responses, their role in real-time social appraisal is unknown. Here, using fibre photometry and optogenetics during ethologically relevant social interactions, we show that CRHPVN neurons exhibit a rapid, transient increase in activity that precedes sniffing, an investigative behaviour through which mice gather social information. This transient signal scales with social context: it is heightened during interactions with unfamiliar and aggressive conspecifics and significantly reduced toward familiar partners. Inhibiting these neurons selectively diminished anogenital sniffing, demonstrating their necessity for optimal social evaluation. Strikingly, across repeated exposures to the same conspecific, behavioural investigation declined while CRHPVN activity remained robust, revealing a dissociation between neuronal and behavioural habituation. This persistence suggests that CRHPVN neurons encode stable neural representation of threat during social encounters. Together, our findings identify CRHPVN neurons as a fast, integrative node linking endocrine stress control to rapid social decision-making.

">Independent Markers of Attentional Shifts</a></h4>

              
                Visuospatial attention has been extensively studied using a wide variety of markers in the brain and in behaviour. We can broadly classify these markers into two distinct groups: reactive measures, where the presence and strength of attentional biases is inferred from the reaction to a probe stimulus, and proactive measures, which track attentional biases without (or before) the presentation of a probe stimulus. A difference in either type of measure (between two experimental conditions) is typically interpreted to reflect a difference in attentional resources. However, it is not a given that these various reactive and proactive measures of attention all read out the same construct; they may very well tap into independent processes. Here, we measure some of these proactive and reactive signatures of attending a location (changes in cortical excitability as measured by RIFT, alpha lateralization, gaze bias, probe-evoked ERPs, and behavioral reports) in an EEG-eyetracking task (n=23). Though all these metrics indeed correlate with our attentional manipulation, we show that they are not direct correlates of each other, and that of all the proactive measures only the gaze bias predicts subsequent behavioral responses. This demonstrates that existing markers of attention cannot be used interchangeably, and likely capture independent subprocesses of attention.

                Introduction and aim Periodontal disease, initiated by dental biofilm and influenced by various local and systemic factors, includes stress as a potential contributor to its progression. Despite associations with severe forms like acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, a comprehensive large-sample study linking stress to periodontal disease is lacking. This study aims to investigate the relationship between mental health and periodontal disease. Materials and Methods Leveraging data (secondary dataset) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011–2012 and NHANES 2013–2014 cycles, relevant information was extracted. Mental health was the exposure variable, and periodontal disease, assessed through indices following Eke et al.’s definition, served as the outcome. Covariates (demographical characteristics) impacting periodontal disease were considered, and disease status analyses employed the Rao-Scott chi-squared test. A logistic regression model assessed mental health’s impact on periodontal disease. Results Among the 2764 Participants, more than a quarter (29.1%) were aged over 60 years, 52% were females. Logistic regression indicated higher odds of periodontal disease among individuals feeling bad about themselves for more than half of the day (OR 1.170, 95% CI 0.533-2.474), though statistical significance was not reached. Periodontitis prevalence significantly varied based on marital status, with 6.6% of married and 10.8% of unmarried Participants affected. Notably, a statistically significant difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between Participants with health insurance (8.3%) and those without (16.5%). Conclusion Our findings suggest trends in periodontal disease prevalence linked to mental health, marital status, and access to health insurance. However, the absence of statistically significant findings calls for caution in interpreting these relationships. We recommend that future studies further investigate these potential associations to provide a clearer understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-138/v3?src=rss">Why is it important? Financial literacy in students in entrepreneurship: A systematic literature review [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Student entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as a driver of economic growth, innovation, and job creation, particularly in developing countries. However, limited financial literacy remains a major barrier to entrepreneurial success among students. This study aims to systematically review the role of financial literacy in supporting student entrepreneurship. A systematic search using the PRISMA 2020 method was conducted in Scopus for the period 2014–2024 with the following search string: (“financial literacy” AND entrepreneurship AND student*) OR (“financial literacy” AND “youth entrepreneurship”). From an initial 155 records, 36 studies met the inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed, empirical, English language, and focusing on students in the context of entrepreneurship. The review identifies three main themes. First, the financial skills addressed include budgeting, saving and borrowing, cash-flow management, investment and risk assessment, and basic accounting. Second, approaches to improving financial literacy are primarily through integrated curricula, business simulations, student venture projects, and industry mentoring. Third, financial literacy strongly impacts entrepreneurial outcomes, including higher self-efficacy, better financial decision-making, stronger resilience in cash-flow management, and greater sustainability of student ventures. The findings underscore the importance of integrating financial literacy as core human capital within entrepreneurship education, especially in developing countries. Limitations of this review include reliance on Scopus and exclusion of non-English studies. The study provides theoretical, practical, and policy implications for universities, educators, and policymakers.

                Spontaneous gastric intramural hematoma (GIH) is an exceptionally rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We report the case of a 57-year-old man with no significant medical history who presented with hematemesis, melena, and hemodynamic instability. Upper endoscopy revealed a large submucosal hematoma with active bleeding. Despite endoscopic hemostasis and supportive management, hemorrhage persisted, requiring emergency partial gastrectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed submucosal hemorrhage without evidence of malignancy or vascular malformation. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering spontaneous GIH in the differential diagnosis of unexplained upper gastrointestinal bleeding and highlights the role of timely surgical intervention when endoscopic therapy fails.

                Background Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a crucial facilitator for the digital transformation of organizations; however, its implementation in the higher education sector of fragile states is still insufficiently studied. This gap makes it harder for policymakers and higher education leaders in countries like Yemen to carry out structured, sector-wide modernization. Methods This study utilizes a systematic integrative review methodology, adhering to PRISMA principles. We synthesized and analyzed 30 peer-reviewed articles and high-credibility reports published between 2010 and June 2025 to identify transferable EA frameworks, governance models, and implementation strategies pertinent to resource-constrained contexts in higher education. Results Our analysis confirms that the TOGAF framework is the most widely used, but it also indicates that successful public sector implementations depend on hybrid adaptations and federated governance models to attain a balance between central policy and institutional autonomy. The most important things that lead to success are strong executive sponsorship and a phased, pilot-led implementation. The primary problems are lack of resources and resistance from within the organization. The results also show a clear link between EA outcomes, such as improved efficiency and resilience, and the main goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Conclusions This review expands EA theory into the inadequately explored area of public administration in fragile contexts. In practice, it provides Yemen with a new, evidence-based, phased implementation pathway. This pathway affords higher education sector leaders a real policy and management tool to help them build strong and useful digital ecosystems in tough places.

<p>The past decade has witnessed groundbreaking clinical implementation of neuroprosthetic limbs driven by signals from peripheral targets (eg, nerves and muscle) and the brain to restore limb function for individuals with limb loss or impairment. In this review, we highlight recent key clinical trials in peripheral neuroprosthetic interfaces directly with nerve, residual muscle, and reinnervated muscle. We then highlight the key advances in brain interfaces, including clinical trials using electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and intracortical electrodes to control neuroprosthetics. Finally, we explore the future of neuroprosthetic control where both peripheral and brain interfaces can be combined to improve neuroprosthetic performance.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A better understanding of factors associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and disability is needed. Given the strong link between comorbid depression and MS disease activity and disability, we aimed to determine whether the depression genetic burden, as modelled using its polygenic score, is associated with MS disease activity and disability worsening.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cohort study, we used samples from neurologist-defined adult people with MS (PwMS) followed in clinical care or during a clinical trial from existing cohorts: Canada, the United States (US), and Sweden with extensive longitudinal phenotypes. We computed the depression polygenic score (PGS) and tested its association with annualized relapse rate and worsening disability. In the US cohort, we additionally explored the time to relapse, number of enhancing lesions, and confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) worsening during the study period.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 3,420 relapsing-onset PwMS of European genetic ancestry with a median follow-up of 3 to 5 years. Meta-analyses revealed for each 1-standard deviation increase in the depression PGS, the relapse rate increased (incidence rate ratio: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.50). In the US cohort, higher depression PGS was associated with protocol-defined relapses (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.03–2.43), and time to confirmed EDSS worsening (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.03–2.22) with this effect largely direct.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Meta-analyses showed a higher depression genetic burden was associated with increased MS disease activity. In the US clinical trial cohort only, we found a significant association between higher depression PGS and time to relapse and confirmed EDSS worsening. These findings may provide insights into MS disease activity and disability worsening. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1057–1069</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Landau–Kleffner syndrome (LKS), is a rare, poorly-understood epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep associated with mutations in <i>GRIN2A</i>, encoding the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2A subunit. Physicians rely on empirical treatments, with scarce information on treatment efficacy and outcomes. This study aims to improve the understanding and clinical management of LKS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-two patients with LKS were recruited via one quaternary referral center. Case-notes review delineated clinical features, long-term outcomes, and prognostic factors. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine the longitudinal association among electroencephalogram abnormalities, steroid therapy, and neuropsychological findings. After genetic screening, the impact of identified <i>GRIN2A</i> missense variants on NMDAR function was assessed using homology modeling, cell-surface trafficking assays, and electrophysiology in artificial synapses. Whole exome/genome sequencing was performed on <i>GRIN2A</i>-negative patients to identify novel gene associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LKS is complex with significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Besides speech and language impairment, many patients had other co-morbidities and almost half have long-term disability. Early age at disease onset was associated with worse outcomes. There was no reliable correlation between electroencephalogram findings and developmental scores. Steroid therapy improved language outcomes independently of electroencephalogram findings. <i>GRIN2A</i> mutations were identified in 15.5% of the cohort. Likely pathogenic variants in <i>GABBR2</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>TRPC1</i>, <i>ERRFI1</i>, <i>CTXN3</i>, <i>IRX6</i>, and <i>IQCA1</i> were identified in 7 <i>GRIN2A-</i>negative individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For LKS, early intervention is important for long-term outcomes. Furthermore, management should not be based solely on electroencephalogram findings. Genetic and functional investigations offer insights into disease pathophysiology and facilitate development of future targeted therapies. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:951–966</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Overactivity of muscles is thought to be involved in postural abnormalities (PA) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the relationship between muscle activity and postural parameters to explore the peripheral mechanisms of PA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 90 PD patients and 19 healthy controls were enrolled. Posture features (F1–F8) and the index for PA were collected. Surface electromyography was acquired from cervical and thoracolumbar muscles during lying, sitting, standing, and walking, respectively. Follow-up was completed for a subset of PD patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Root mean square (RMS) amplitudes of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) and external oblique muscle, were higher in PD patients with PA (PD_PA) than PD patients without PA (PD_NPA) and healthy controls during lying and standing. Extensor activity in PD_PA patients increased only in the antigravity position compared with PD_NPA patients. Spearman's correlation showed that RMS amplitude of SCM in the lying position was associated with index for PA and forward flexion angles including F3–F8, whereas RMS amplitude of the external oblique muscle in the lying position was correlated with F5 alone. Longitudinal analysis showed that changes in F3, F4, and index for PA were significantly correlated with changes in RMS amplitude of the SCM in the lying position. Additionally, PD_NPA patients with SCM overactivity had a significantly higher risk of progressing to PA than those with normal SCM activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The SCM and external oblique muscle are involved in forward trunk flexion in PD patients, while extensors may play a compensatory role. SCM may be the key muscle in PA for PD patients, participating in the pathogenesis of PA. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:967–976</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intracranial language localization with electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) and high-gamma modulation (HGM) mapping relies on artificial, repetitive tasks, requiring sustained cooperation from patients. Herein, we tested the validity of unstructured, interpersonal, naturalistic conversation for language localization, using a novel methodology: Behavior-iEEG-Spectral-Power correlation (BESPoC). We first validated BESPoC against ESM, HGM, and neuropsychological outcomes using well-established language tasks, then demonstrated the validity of naturalistic conversation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 134 patients (59 females), aged 2–29 years, undergoing standard-of-care stereo-electroencephalography monitoring who engaged in picture naming, auditory naming, story listening, and conversed with a family member. ESM and HGM analysis were performed using established methods. BESPoC methodology quantified correlation between stereo-electroencephalography spectral power from task recordings, obviating the need for any trial-based epochs, and behavioral markers. The large sample size allowed mixed-effects modeling to compare BESPoC with HGM and ESM.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>BESPoC showed high specificity (0.79–0.83) and sensitivity (0.64–0.86) for localizing HGM language sites across the tasks. BESPoC also compared well with HGM across all language tasks for localizing ESM speech/language sites. With conventional tasks, BESPoC was superior to HGM for modeling neuropsychological deficits seen, despite preserving ESM speech/language sites. Naturalistic conversation compared well with standard tasks for localization of HGM and ESM language sites, and determined neuropsychological outcomes better than conventional tasks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using BESPoC methodology naturalistic conversation is shown to produce valid cortical language maps of both expressive and receptive language, and determine neuropsychological outcomes after epilepsy surgery. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1096–1110</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity, gait initiation (GI), and freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recorded GI and STN local field potentials (LFPs) via externalized cables in 38 patients with PD (35 reporting FOG in daily life), both OFF- and ON-dopamine (DOPA). GI was also recorded in 24 age-matched controls. GI scores related to pace, rhythm, and balance were derived from kinetics, and FOG was identified using kinematics. We compared GI performance related to FOG and DOPA, and GI-LFP relationships between posterior-sensorimotor versus central-associative STN regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DOPA<sup>OFF</sup>, 12 patients with PD had FOG observed (FOG-OBS, 263 episodes), occurring at a mean of 8 steps after GI, and 26 had no FOG observed (NOBS; FOG-NOBS). GI pace scores were worse in FOG-OBS than in FOG-NOBS patients with PD, even when not followed by FOG, with weaker association with alpha/low-beta activity in the posterior STN. Although rhythm/balance scores were similar between groups, their association with low-beta activity was stronger in FOG-OBS patients, with rhythm correlating more in the central STN and balance in the posterior STN. GI was worse preceding imminent FOG, with disrupted low-beta GI-LFP associations and emergent high-beta correlations with reversed spatial distribution (pace/rhythm-posterior STN, balance-central). Dopamine improved pace, rhythm, and FOG, and partially restored STN activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results reveal 3 distinct GI patterns in patients with PD associated with absence, predisposition to, or imminent occurrence of FOG, with STN neuronal modulations differing dynamically between the posterior and central subregions. These markers could support developing adaptive DBS strategies tailored for episodic gait impairments. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:977–990</p>

<p>In this single-center, randomized, open label trial, participants with MSA were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of exenatide 2 mg weekly for 48 weeks, or as controls, followed by a 48-week washout period. The primary outcome was the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) parts I + II combined score at 48 weeks. Objective secondary outcome measures included the numbers of participants losing ambulation; scoring ≥ 3 on UMSARS part I items for falls, speech, swallowing, as well as timed walking and measures of quality of life and cognition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between September 23, 2020, and May 6, 2022, 50 participants were recruited (25 in each group). At 48 weeks, UMSARS parts I + II scores had worsened by 6.1 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.0 to 9.3, SD = 6.9) in the exenatide group and by 13 3 points (95% CI = 9.2 to 17.3, SD = 9.4) in the control group, an adjusted mean difference of −7.4 points (−11.3 to −3.6, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). There were no statistically significant differences at either 48 or 96 weeks in the secondary outcome measures. Biomarker analysis of neurofilament light chain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein oligomer load, sensor-derived gait measures, and imaging findings were also similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Exenatide was associated with positive effects on participant-reported symptoms and clinician-rated MSA severity. In contrast, none of the objective comparisons differed according to randomization. Given the open label trial design, the discrepancy between the primary outcome and the objective measures may be explicable as placebo effects/observer bias.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70006?af=R">Frequency of Microvascular Pathology and Hippocampal Atrophy on Magnetic Resonance Imaging in a Community Study of Alzheimer's Disease with Blood‐Based Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), representing antemortem indicators of AD pathophysiology, have greatly improved the accuracy of diagnosis. However, these biomarkers may not capture a frequent coincident pathology, such as cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured plasma amyloid-<i>β</i>40, amyloid-<i>β</i>42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, tau phosphorylated at threonine 217, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light chain in 685 multiancestral individuals who had clinical assessments and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The cohort was represented by individuals of European, African American, and Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Participants were then classified as biomarker-positive or -negative for AD based on previously established cutoffs: 2.65 pg/mL for, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 and 0.39 pg/mL for tau phosphorylated at threonine 217. We used magnetic resonance images to compare white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), silent brain infarcts, microhemorrhages, and hippocampus volume across groups by their clinical diagnosis and biomarker status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the P-tau181 group (<i>n</i> = 685), 70 individuals (10.2%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. A total of 40 (57%) were biomarker-positive for AD, and 30 were classified as other dementia. Among 615 without dementia, 265 (40.3%) were preclinical AD, and 348 (50.8%) were biomarker-negative controls. In the tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 group (<i>n</i> = 535), 54 (10.1%) had dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, including 33 biomarker-positive for AD and 21 with other dementia, whereas 183 (38.0%) were preclinical AD and 298 (61.9%) were biomarker-negative controls. Across both classifications, biomarker-positive for AD and other dementia individuals showed greater WMH volumes, more infarcts, and smaller hippocampus. However, P-tau217 positivity was more sensitive to WMH volume differences, whereas tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 better captured hippocampal atrophy and silent brain infarcts. Interestingly, ethnic differences may also influence detection of changes in WMH volumes, hippocampal volume, and infarcts in relation to specific biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results indicate that cerebrovascular disease is consistently involved in dementia either directly or as a coincident pathology in AD. These results underscore the need to incorporate both blood-based biomarkers and structural imaging in the evaluation of patients with dementia. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1027–1043</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Personalized approaches to ischemic stroke diagnosis are needed. We determine differences in proteomic signatures of incident embolic (EIS) and thrombotic stroke (TIS) by age and resultant pathways using large-scale proteomics.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) from visit 2 (V2, 1990–1992) until 2020 without prevalent stroke with available SomaScan data (4,955 protein targets) at V2 (mid-life, n = 10,929), and then again at visit 5 (V5, 2011–2013, n = 4,463) were included. Covariate adjusted Cox hazard models determined the association between proteins, and adjudicated incident EIS or TIS from V2 to V5 and from V5 to 2020.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 10,929 participants (56% female, 23% Black, follow-up ~20 years), 20 proteins measured in mid-life were associated with either EIS (n = 168) or TIS (n = 459) in mid-life, and 4 measured in late-life were associated with late-life stroke (73 EIS and 124 TIS events) at the Bonferroni threshold <i>p</i> &lt; 1E−5. In mid-life, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NPPB) was significantly associated with EIS, but not TIS (<i>p</i>-difference = 9.14E−7). Nineteen mid-life proteins were strongly associated with TIS; 7 strongly associated with TIS and only nominally (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) with EIS and the remaining 12 with TIS only. In late-life, NPPB, serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 4, oligodendrocyte-myelin-glycoprotein, and neurocan-core protein were significantly associated with EIS, but not TIS. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tools implicated cancer for EIS-associated proteins, whereas TIS pathways reflected cell-structure and atherogenesis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified plasma proteins associated with risk of EIS versus TIS reflecting distinct stroke mechanisms: cardiac dysfunction protein in EIS (eg, NPPB) and inflammation dysregulation in TIS (eg, interleukins). ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1125–1135</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70014?af=R">Elevated Risk of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation Rupture during Pregnancy and Puerperium</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) pose a significant risk during pregnancy because of hormonal changes and increased hemodynamic stress. This study aims to assess the risk of AVM rupture during pregnancy and puerperium and to identify risk factors associated with rupture.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study included 588 women with AVMs and a history of pregnancy, enrolled from a nationwide registry in China between August 2011 and August 2021. A case-crossover design was used to compare rupture risk during pregnancy, puerperium, and non-pregnancy periods, adjusting for clinical and morphological factors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified independent risk factors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The risk of AVM rupture was significantly higher during pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy periods (4.5% vs 1.6%; risk ratio [RR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3–4.2; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The risk was particularly elevated during the second and third trimesters. Key factors independently associated with increased rupture risk included adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy (adolescent ≤19 years or advanced ≥35 years, odds ratio [OR], 8.32; 95% CI, 2.09–28.12, <i>p</i> = 0.001), a history of AVM rupture before pregnancy (OR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.37–11.40; <i>p</i> = 0.007), diffuse nidus (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.07–5.12; <i>p</i> = 0.033), and multifetal pregnancy (OR 18.31; 95% CI, 1.14–293.27; <i>p</i> = 0.040).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pregnancy substantially increases the risk of AVM rupture, particularly during the second and third trimesters and compared to pre-first pregnancy periods. Risk factors such as adolescent or advanced-age pregnancy and multifetal pregnancy further increase the risk. These findings underscore the importance of tailored management during pregnancy for optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1136–1145</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.70015?af=R">Anterior Versus Posterior Insular Epilepsy: Correlations with Semiology Based on Stereoelectroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize insular seizure semiology and correlate with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) seizure onset in a well-defined cohort, in particular examining differences between anterior and posterior insular seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We documented all semiological signs and the timing of emergence for 45 patients with SEEG-confirmed insular epilepsy, along with the precise location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) within the insula. Semiological signs and other non-invasive data were compared between those with anterior and posterior insula SOZ, with more detailed insular subregion description when appropriate. Co-occurrence patterns of insular semiological signs were also investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 87% reported auras and the corresponding insular SOZ demonstrated an anterior-to-posterior gradient by aura type. The absence of aura was significantly associated with an anterior insula SOZ (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Late grunting/moaning (<i>p</i> = 0.07), symmetric mouth elementary motor (<i>p</i> = 0.1), blinking (<i>p</i> = 0.05), and chewing/repetitive swallowing (<i>p</i> = 0.09) also suggested an anterior insula SOZ. Unilateral non-painful somatosensory aura (<i>p</i> = 0.07) and early arm/hand elementary motor (<i>p</i> = 0.1) suggested a posterior insular SOZ.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We report the characteristics and semiological features in a large cohort of primary insular epilepsy patients. The type of aura is crucial for identifying the SOZ and the timing of semiological emergence contributes to the anatomo-electro-clinical localization of an insular SOZ. These findings can enhance identification of insular epilepsy, making targeted curative treatment feasible. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1111–1124</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27307?af=R">Mapping Postictal Aphasia through Signal Complexity: A Stereo‐Electroencephalography Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The postictal period provides an opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology underlying aphasia and recovery following epileptic seizures. This study examines postictal aphasia in stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)-explored patients to identify brain regions associated with task-specific language deficits using signal complexity analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated video-SEEG-recorded focal seizures with and without postictal aphasia in patients with SEEG-confirmed hemispheric language dominance. SEEG traces were analyzed using permutation entropy (PE), with the postictal period quantified by a PE-based metric, the Postictal Alteration Time (PAT). Brain region PAT was correlated with language function recovery (eg, repetition). Electro-clinical recuperation was also assessed within the dorsal-ventral language stream framework. Additionally, a bedside testing battery was developed to evaluate postictal aphasia severity and task-specific deficits.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 322 seizures from 98 patients were analyzed. Seizures with postictal aphasia had longer PAT than those without. Task-specific language recovery correlated with regional PAT (eg, naming – middle temporal gyrus). Moreover, the dorsal stream recovered faster than the ventral stream. Additionally, the Postictal Aphasia Scale (PAS) was developed, evaluating naming, reading, repetition, and comprehension (verbal and written) and automatic speech. Higher PAS scores (indicating milder deficits) correlated with faster regional complexity recovery. At 5 and 10 minutes postictally, PAS revealed a global aphasia pattern, with comprehension deficits gradually resolving. By 15 minutes, aphasia was primarily production-related, particularly affecting naming.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of postictal aphasia and introduces PAS as a tool for assessing postictal aphasia severity and domain-specific deficits, aiding surgical planning and rehabilitation. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1080–1095</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate how sex and age at menopause influence the interplay between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) neuropathologies, and their associations with cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from: (1) three Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (i.e., the Religious Orders Study, Rush Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study), and (2) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology Data Set. Neuropathological evaluation assessed LBD (neocortical/limbic-type vs none) and AD, including neuritic plaques (β-amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites) and neurofibrillary tangles. In each dataset, we tested interactive associations between LBD and sex on neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline. Additionally, in the Rush dataset, we tested whether age at spontaneous menopause modified the associations of LBD with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline in women.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the Rush dataset, we included 1,277 women and 579 men. In the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we included 3,283 women and 3,563 men. Across both datasets, men were more likely to have LBD, whereas women showed greater neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burdens. Sex modified the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangles (but not neuritic plaques), whereby LBD was more strongly associated with greater neurofibrillary tangle burden in women than men. Men showed faster LBD-related cognitive decline, whereas women showed faster neurofibrillary tangle-related decline, after adjusting for copathologies (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and LBD, as appropriate). In women, earlier age at menopause exacerbated the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangle burden and episodic memory decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex may influence AD and LBD neuropathologies, highlighting the need for precision approaches to dementia prevention and intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1014–1026</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To examine volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI) in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), compared to multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and healthy controls (HC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized vMRI in MOGAD were compared to age, sex, and disease duration matched MS (5:1), and non-matched NMOSD and HC, in mixed linear models with time and group interactions. Disability assessments included; patient determined disease steps (PDDS), manual dexterity (MDT), walking speed (WST), processing speed (PST), and contrast sensitivity tests (CST). Correlations between vMRI and disability in MOGAD were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 293 patients were included; 32 MOGAD, 160 MS, 49 NMOSD, and 52 HC. MOGAD had a faster rate of volume loss in all brain regions compared to HC (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). At baseline, MOGAD had preserved thalamic (0.000507, <i>p</i> = 0.005), caudate (0.000287, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and putamen (0.000341, <i>p</i> = 0.007) fractions than MS. Longitudinally, MOGAD had increased lateral ventricle fraction (LVF) (−0.000645, <i>p</i> = 0.032), but less hippocampal (0.000031, <i>p</i> = 0.044) and upper cervical cord area (UCCA) loss (1.482887, <i>p</i> = 0.005), compared to NMOSD. MOGAD had increased LVF (0.00529, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), but less UCCA loss (0.538656, <i>p</i> = 0.042) longitudinally compared to MS. Among MOGAD, UCCA was associated with PDDS (−0.72, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and CST (0.60, <i>p</i> = 0.014). Whole brain fraction (WBF) was associated with PDDS (−0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and PST (0.52, <i>p</i> = 0.019). LVF was associated with PDDS (0.78, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MOGAD showed longitudinal brain volume loss compared to HC. Deep gray matter was relatively preserved compared to MS, while MS and NMOSD had greater UCCA loss, indicating regional differences in atrophy. Despite less overall atrophy, volume loss in MOGAD was associated with disability. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1044–1056</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether established heart rate parameters of exercise, related to cardiac autonomic function, are associated with incident Parkinson's disease, independent of both clinical and autonomic prodromal features.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A study of UK Biobank participants who performed a standardized bicycle exercise test (2009–2013), followed until November 2022, and analyzed in January 2024, was carried out. Heart rate increase from rest to exercise, and heart rate decrease from peak exercise to recovery were associated with incident Parkinson's disease. Multivariable adjustment was performed both for clinical characteristics and for prodromal non-cardiac autonomic features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 69,288 eligible participants (men 48%, mean age 56.8 years [SD 8.2 years]) were followed for 12.5 years: among the 319 (0.5%) who developed Parkinson's disease, recognized prodromal markers (constipation, bladder dysfunction) were more common at baseline. The median lag time to diagnosis was 9.3 years (interquartile range 4.4). Both heart rate increase (37.5 [SD 11.5] vs 40.8 [SD 12.4] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and recovery (23.4 [SD 8.8] vs. 27.8 [SD 10.3] b.p.m., <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in incident cases compared with controls. Heart rate recovery was independently associated with incident Parkinson's disease, whereas heart rate increase was not. Specifically, a blunted heart rate lowering during recovery was associated with a 30% higher risk of incident Parkinson's disease (HR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1–1.4; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 per 10 beats less recovery).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Collectively, this suggests that cardiac autonomic involvement precedes clinically manifest Parkinson's disease, and that heart rate recovery might serve as a quantitative prodromal marker. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1004–1013</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autophagy is a fundamental biological pathway with vital roles in intracellular homeostasis. During autophagy, defective cargoes including mitochondria are targeted to lysosomes for clearance and recycling. Recessive truncating variants in the autophagy gene <i>EPG5</i> have been associated with Vici syndrome, a severe early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with extensive multisystem involvement. Here, we aimed to delineate the extended, age-dependent <i>EPG5</i>-related disease spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated clinical, radiological, and molecular features from the largest cohort of <i>EPG5</i>-related patients identified to date, complemented by experimental investigation of cellular and animal models of EPG5 defects.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Through worldwide collaboration, we identified 211 patients, 97 of them previously unpublished, with recessive <i>EPG5</i> variants. The phenotypic spectrum ranged from antenatally lethal presentations to milder isolated neurodevelopmental disorders. A novel Epg5 knock-in mouse model of a recurrent <i>EPG5</i> missense variant featured motor impairments and defective autophagy in brain areas particularly relevant for the neurological disorders in milder presentations. Novel age-dependent neurodegenerative manifestations in our cohort included adolescent-onset parkinsonism and dystonia with cognitive decline, and myoclonus. Radiological features suggested an emerging continuum with brain iron accumulation disorders. Patient fibroblasts showed defects in PINK1-Parkin-dependent mitophagic clearance and α-synuclein overexpression, indicating a cellular basis for the observed neurodegenerative phenotypes. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <i>EPG5</i> knockdown caused motor impairments, defective mitophagic clearance, and changes in mitochondrial respiration comparable to observations in <i>C. elegans</i> knockdown of parkinsonism-related genes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings illustrate a lifetime neurological disease continuum associated with pathogenic <i>EPG5</i> variants, linking neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders through the common denominator of defective autophagy. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:932–950</p>

                <p>by Logan A. Becker, Francois Baccelli, Thibaud Taillefumier</p>

Even when driven by the same stimulus, neuronal responses are well-known to exhibit a striking level of spiking variability. In-vivo electrophysiological recordings also reveal a surprisingly large degree of variability at the subthreshold level. In prior work, we considered biophysically relevant neuronal models to account for the observed magnitude of membrane voltage fluctuations. We found that accounting for these fluctuations requires weak but nonzero synchrony in the spiking activity, in amount that are consistent with experimentally measured spiking correlations. Here we investigate whether such synchrony can explain additional statistical features of the measured neural activity, including neuronal voltage covariability and voltage skewness. Addressing this question involves conducting a generalized moment analysis of conductance-based neurons in response to input drives modeled as correlated jump processes. Technically, we perform such an analysis using fixed-point techniques from queuing theory that are applicable in the stationary regime of activity. We found that weak but nonzero synchrony can consistently explain the experimentally reported voltage covariance and skewness. This confirms the role of synchrony as a primary driver of cortical variability and supports that physiological neural activity emerges as a population-level phenomenon, especially in the spontaneous regime.

                <p>by Araven Tiroumalechetty, Elisa B. Frankel, Peri T. Kurshan</p>

The detection and characterization of fluorescent puncta are critical tasks in image analysis pipelines for fluorescence imaging. Existing methods for quantitative characterization of such puncta often suffer from biases and limitations, compromising the reliability and reproducibility of results. Moreover, the widespread adoption of many available analysis scripts is often hampered by over-optimization for specific samples, requiring extensive coding knowledge to repurpose for other datasets. We present <i>WormSNAP (Worm SyNapse Analysis Program)</i>, a license-free, stand-alone, no-code approach to automated unbiased detection and characterization of 2D fluorescent puncta, originally developed to characterize images of the synapses residing in <i>C. elegans</i> nerve cords but suitable for broader 2D fluorescence image analysis. <i>WormSNAP</i> incorporates a local means thresholding algorithm and a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for efficient and accurate analysis of large datasets, with user control of thresholding and restriction parameters and visualization options for further refinement. <i>WormSNAP</i> also calculates three types of correlation metrics for 2-channel images, enabling users to select the ideal metric for their dataset. <i>WormSNAP</i> provides robust and accurate fluorescent puncta detection in a variety of conditions, accelerating the image analysis workflow from data acquisition to figure generation.

                <p>by Atte S. A. Eskelinen, Joonas P. Kosonen, Moustafa Hamada, Amir Esrafilian, Cristina Florea, Alan J. Grodzinsky, Petri Tanska, Rami K. Korhonen</p>

Degenerative musculoskeletal diseases like osteoarthritis can be initiated by joint injury. Injurious overloading-induced mechanical straining of articular cartilage and subsequent biological responses may trigger cartilage degradation. One early sign of degradation is loss of aggrecan content which is potentially accelerated near chondral lesions under physiological loading. Yet, the mechanoinflammatory mechanisms explaining time-dependent degradation in regions with disparate mechanical loading are unclear and challenging to assess with experiments alone. Here, we developed computational models unraveling potential mechanisms behind aggrecan content adaptation in fibril-reinforced porohyperelastic cartilage after single injurious overloading (50% compressive strain magnitude, 100%/s strain rate) followed by physiological cyclic loading (15% strain, 1 Hz, haversine waveform). The simulated adaptation of aggrecan content was compared spatially and at several time points to tissue composition found in Safranin-O-stained sections of young bovine knee cartilage subjected to the same loading protocols. Incorporating mechanical strain-driven cell damage and downstream proteolytic enzyme release, fluid flow-driven aggrecan depletion, and fluid pressure-stimulated regulation of aggrecan biosynthesis, the models agreed with experiments and exhibited 14%-points greater near-lesion aggrecan loss after 12 days of physiological loading compared to without loading. The near-lesion aggrecan loss was driven by fluid flow and proteolytic aggrecanase activity, while chondroprotective pro-anabolic responses (increased aggrecan biosynthesis) were prominent in the deeper tissue despite damaged superficial layer. This significant advancement in mechanistic understanding incorporated into cartilage adaptation model can help in development and guidance of personalized therapies, such as rehabilitation protocols and tissue-engineered constructs.

                <p>by Stephanie A. Wankowicz</p>

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is one of the richest open‑source repositories in biology, housing over 242,000 macromolecular structural models alongside much of the experimental data that underpins these models. By systematically collecting, validating, and indexing these models, the PDB has accelerated structural biology discoveries, enabling researchers to compare new entries against a vast archive of solved structures and, more recently, powering protein structure prediction. Leveraging this wealth of data, structural bioinformatics has uncovered patterns, such as conserved protein folds, binding‑site features, or subtle conformational shifts among related proteins, that would be impossible to detect from any single structure. Through the democratization of structural data and open-source analytical tools, now amplified by the power of large language models, a broader community of researchers is equipped to drive new scientific discoveries using structural data. However, good structural bioinformatics requires understanding some of the nuances of the underlying experimental data, data encoding conventions, and quality control metrics that can affect a model’s precision, fit‑to‑data, and comparability. This knowledge, combined with developing good controls, statistics, and connections to other databases, is essential for drawing accurate and reliable conclusions from PDB data. Here, we outline 10 recommendations for doing structural bioinformatic analyses crafted to pave the way for others to uncover exciting discoveries.

                Background Misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of misconduct (KoM) level in this population is lacking. This brief report assessed KoM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey (i.e. ; Laval University quiz) with 11 questions on KoM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoM. Results The mean±SD KoM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). Conclusion North-African PGDSs have a low-level of KoM. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoM in this population.

                Background Understanding the epidemiology of soccer injuries during specific international competitions is essential for customizing preventive strategies. Several studies have reported outcomes related to international competitions but, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no investigation into the injury patterns during any African Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournaments. This study aimed to analyze the observed events frequencies and their characteristics during the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON), which took place in Cameroon from January 9 to February 6, 2022. Methods A video-based analysis covering 52 matches was conducted by two independent consultant physicians. They reviewed “observed events” replays to determine frequencies and characteristics ( i.e. ; mechanisms, body location, match moment, player substitution, absence in the next match, and referee decisions). Results The tournament involved 519 male players, comprising 275 African (ALP) and 244 Non-African (NALP) league players. Eighty-seven “observed events” occurred, with frequencies of 1.7 and 48.8 injuries per match and per 1000 match hours, respectively. Observed event frequency rose with competition stages, particularly contact mechanism injuries. Non-contact injuries (23/87) predominantly occurred after 60 minutes of play (19/23), with the thigh being the most frequently affected body part (18/87). Older age and playing time significantly correlated with observed event occurrence (p=0.032 and p<0.001, respectively). NALP midfielders and forwards were notably injured by contact mechanisms (36/45) in the attacking zone. Although non-contact mechanisms were more common in ALP than NALP (13/42 vs. 9/45), the difference lacked statistical significance (p=0.240), with a higher rate of muscle injuries (13/42 vs. 10/45, p=0.001). Conclusion Muscle-related events were the most frequently observed during the 2021 AFCON, with older age and longer playing time identified as key associated factors.

                Background Land tenure inequality and the risk of land grabbing are persistent challenges in Indonesia, particularly within Special Economic Zones (SEZs). While SEZs are designed to attract investment and foster economic growth, they frequently lead to large-scale land acquisitions that can compromise the rights and livelihoods of local communities. Methods This study investigates the juridical-empirical aspects of land tenure within three Indonesian SEZs: Lido, Tanjung Lesung, and Mandalika. A qualitative approach was adopted, utilizing a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) framework. Data collection involved document analysis, community surveys, and in-depth interviews with two respondents to gather both legal perspectives and lived experiences. Results The findings reveal that land tenure practices within SEZs exacerbate the risks of land grabbing, undermine customary land rights, and offer limited economic advantages, particularly concerning the absorption of local labor. Conclusion Addressing these critical issues necessitates enhanced legal protection, transparent land registration processes, robust community participation, and empowerment strategies. These measures should ensure that investment incentives are aligned with principles of fairness and sustainability. By framing agrarian justice as a core analytical lens, this research proposes a model for more equitable land governance within Indonesian SEZs and beyond.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Clinical studies can experience major loss to follow-up and reduced response rates to participant reported outcomes such as quality of life questionnaires, which can lead to a lack of statistical power for the analysis of these outcomes. A number of studies have been embedded within trials to investigate interventions to improve retention. Methods A Study Within a Trial (SWAT) was integrated into the Outcome Monitoring After Cardiac Surgery (OMACS) study, a large observational cardiac surgery study, to investigate whether the use of a theory-informed cover letter with 12-month follow-up questionnaires could improve study retention. OMACS study participants receiving 12-month follow-up questionnaires by post were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a standard cover letter or a theory informed cover letter with their questionnaires. Study retention was assessed by the proportion of participants who returned 12-month follow-up questionnaires. Results Questionnaire return rates were similar between the two groups (67.4% with the standard cover letter compared to 68.5% with the theory-informed cover letter, odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.85 to 1.31]). The results of the OMACS SWAT were consistent with the previously reported meta-analysis (MA) by Gillies et al., with a revised risk difference of 3% (95% CI -1% to 6%) when including OMACS in the MA. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a theory-informed cover letter to increase study retention. We would recommend study teams explore alternative strategies for improving retention where needed.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implant in the subthalamic nucleus and its associated “microlesion” effect impacts oscillatory activity in the hand area of motor cortex.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined cortical local field potentials in 31 patients before and after subthalamic nucleus lead implant at rest and during repetitive voluntary and passive contralateral upper limb movements. We computed continuous wavelet transforms of the signals and correlated (1) baseline spectral power and motor symptom severity and (2) changes in spectral power and contralateral motor symptoms related to microlesion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline motor symptom severity correlated with high-frequency broadband power in primary motor cortex during voluntary movements (200–300Hz: Pearson's r = 0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.014, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.15, 0.75]; and 300–500Hz: r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.038, 95% CI: [0.06, 0.70]). Motor improvements from lead implant correlated with decreases in high gamma power in primary sensory cortex during voluntary movements (70–200Hz: r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.035, 95% CI: [−0.07, 0.62]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>How motor parkinsonism alters electrophysiology in cerebral cortex is unclear. Our findings suggest that both the severity of parkinsonism and its improvement from the microlesion effect are associated most closely with changes in high-frequency oscillatory activity in primary sensorimotor cortex. Better understanding the cortical dynamics of movement disorders could guide novel paradigms for adaptive DBS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1187/v1?src=rss">Artificial Intelligence Adoption as a Driver of Innovation and Competitiveness in SMEs: A Bibliometric and Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This study employs a bibliometric and systematic literature review (B-SLR) approach, guided by the PRISMA 2021 framework, to investigate the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024 across the Scopus databases, the review integrates quantitative mapping and qualitative synthesis to identify emerging research patterns, thematic concentrations, and methodological trends. The findings reveal a marked surge in scholarly engagement since 2020, reflecting growing recognition of AI as both a strategic and operational driver of competitiveness in SMEs. Three dominant thematic clusters emerge: (1) AI-driven innovation, encompassing applications such as machine learning, predictive analytics, automation, and process optimization; (2) entrepreneurial decision-making, highlighting how AI supports opportunity recognition, strategic planning, and market sensing; and (3) adoption barriers and enablers, focusing on organizational readiness, digital infrastructure, human capital, and financial capability. While the field demonstrates expanding theoretical and practical interest, significant gaps remain regarding methodological diversity, contextual variation across developing economies, and the integration of socio-ethical considerations in AI adoption. The study contributes by consolidating fragmented knowledge, mapping the intellectual structure of the domain, and offering actionable implications for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to leverage AI to foster innovation, digital resilience, and sustainable growth in SMEs.

                The study of familial SI-NETs using single-cell RNA-seq identifies the putative cell of origin and stage-specific gene expression driving early tumor development. These findings offer insights into the precursor-to-tumor transition and potential advances in early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

                Mpox virus (MPXV) causes life-threatening mpox disease in HIV-positive individuals. Stampfer et al. evaluated 15 HIV-positive mpox survivors and detected polyfunctional MPXV-specific CD4 and CD8 immunity along with strong binding and neutralizing antibodies. These were even stronger in the 7/15 patient subsets with prior smallpox vaccination who also had broader immunity.

                Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) based on natural serotypes poorly transduce the brain after intravenous administration, limiting clinical efficacy. Lin et al. engineer AAV9 to engage the human version of CA-IV, a blood-brain barrier receptor used previously by potent but mouse-specific vectors, and validate their function in a “humanized” mouse model.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100799">Cryo-electron tomography reveals the microtubule-bound form of inactive LRRK2</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Mutations in human leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments requires LRRK2’s kinase to be in the active-like conformation. However, whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain is in the inactive conformation and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase active site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we show that full-length human LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments. Finally, the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are shorter and less regular, suggesting they are less stable.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101113">Septins function in exocytosis via physical interactions with the exocyst complex in fission yeast cytokinesis</a></h4>

              
                Septins can function as scaffolds for protein recruitment, membrane-bound diffusion barriers, or membrane curvature sensors. Septins are important for cytokinesis, but their exact roles are still obscure. In fission yeast, four septins (Spn1–Spn4) accumulate at the rim of the division plane as rings. The octameric exocyst complex, which tethers exocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane, exhibits a similar localization and is essential for plasma membrane deposition during cytokinesis. Without septins, the exocyst spreads across the division plane but is absent from the rim during septum formation. These results suggest that septins and the exocyst physically interact for proper localization and function. Indeed, we predicted six pairs of interactions between septin and exocyst subunits by AlphaFold, most of them are confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Exocyst mislocalization results in mistargeting of secretory vesicles and their cargos, which leads to cell-separation delay in septin mutants. Our results indicate that septins guide the targeting of the exocyst complex on the plasma membrane for vesicle tethering during cytokinesis through physical interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013646">The relationship between anxious traits and learning about changes in stochasticity and volatility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brónagh McCoy, Rebecca P. Lawson</p>

Anxiety is known to alter learning in uncertain environments. Experimental paradigms and computational models addressing these differences have mainly assessed the impact of volatility, with more highly anxious individuals showing a reduced adaptation of learning rate in volatile compared to stable environments. Previous research has not, however, independently assessed the impact of both changes in volatility, i.e., reversals in reward contingency, and changes in stochasticity (noise) in the same individuals. Here, in an original online study (Experiment 1; N = 80) and a pre-registered replication attempt (Experiment 2; N = 160), we use a simple probabilistic reversal learning paradigm to independently manipulate the level of volatility and noise at the experimental level in a fully orthogonal design. We replicate previous studies showing general increases, irrespective of anxiety levels, in positive learning rate (Experiment 1) and negative learning rate (Experiments 1 and 2) for high compared to low volatility, but here only in the context of low noise. Across both experiments, there was an interaction between volatility and noise on behaviour, with more win-stay responses for high compared to low volatility under low noise, but similar or fewer win-stay responses for the same comparison under high noise. The impact of anxious traits presented differently across experiments; in Experiment 1, increases in lose-shift responses in high versus low noise conditions scaled with level of anxious traits, whereas in Experiment 2, there was a full interaction between volatility, noise and anxious traits on win-stay behaviour. These anxiety-related lose-shift or win-stay differences were reflected in their corresponding negative and positive reinforcement learning rate parameters, respectively. Experiment 2 represents a more robust set of results with a larger sample size, balanced gender representation, and extended block order balancing. These findings suggest that changes in both sources of uncertainty - stochasticity and volatility - should be carefully considered when investigating learning and how learning is shaped by anxiety.

                <p>by Luca Oneto, Davide Chicco</p>

As machine learning (ML) becomes increasingly central to biomedical research, the need for trustworthy models is more pressing than ever. In this paper, we present nine concise and actionable tips to help researchers build ML systems that are technically sound but ethically responsible, and contextually appropriate for biomedical applications. These tips address the multifaceted nature of trustworthiness, emphasizing the importance of considering all potential consequences, recognizing the limitations of current methods, taking into account the needs of all involved stakeholders, and following open science practices. We discuss technical, ethical, and domain-specific challenges, offering guidance on how to define trustworthiness and how to mitigate sources of untrustworthiness. By embedding trustworthiness into every stage of the ML pipeline – from research design to deployment – these recommendations aim to support both novice and experienced practitioners in creating ML systems that can be relied upon in biomedical science.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) can significantly affect RNA expression, gene regulation, and determination of cell fate. As a common and abundant post-transcriptional modification (PTM) of RNA, m6A is also closely associated with the occurrence of numerous diseases. Thus, identifying the m6A modification site in the RNA sequence is a prerequisite for related research. High-throughput sequencing technology has high requirements and low cost performance. Computational methods have made encouraging progress in site prediction. However, most models only consider the effects of different species, ignoring the simultaneous exploration of RNA modifications in different tissues within the same species. We develop and validate a fuzzy system based on Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL), named BSBL-TSK-FS, which is a powerful sequence-level m6A prediction model. We introduce a Bayesian method that provides a posterior probability output to produce more sparse solutions so that the model has higher accuracy. The model classifies the m6A sites in several tissues of mouse, human, and rat. Under the five-fold cross-validation method (5-CV), the precision of the BSBL-TSK-FS model is 0.84 0.95. The accuracy of our model improves by 9.4% over the existing SOTA predictors. BSBL-TSK-FS achieves superior performance over current SOTA methods. Finally, in order to verify the generalizability of the model, we carry out cross-species tests, and the results prove the robustness and adaptability of the model. An accurate and reliable sequence modification prediction model is developed to better understand the complex landscape of methylation modification.

                <p>by Adina Matache, Joao Rodrigues Lima-Junior, Maxim Kuznetsov, Konstancja Urbaniak, Sergio Branciamore, Andrei S. Rodin, Peter P. Lee, Russell C. Rockne</p>

Prior studies have shown that approximately 40% of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) patients harbor immune signaling defects in their blood at diagnosis, and the presence of these defects predicts overall survival. Therefore, it is of interest to quantitatively characterize and measure signaling errors in immune signaling systems in these patients. Here we propose a novel approach combining communication theory and signal processing concepts to model ligand discrimination in immune cells in the peripheral blood. We use the model to measure the specificity of ligand discrimination in the presence of molecular noise by estimating the probability of error, which is the probability of making a wrong ligand identification. We apply our model to the JAK/STAT signaling pathway using high dimensional spectral flow cytometry measurements of transcription factors, including phosphorylated STATs and SMADs, in immune cells stimulated with several cytokines (IFNγ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10) from 19 ER+ breast cancer patients and 32 healthy controls. In addition, we apply our model to 10 healthy donor samples treated with a clinically approved JAK1/2 inhibitor. Our results show reduced ligand identification accuracy and higher levels of molecular noise in BC patients as compared to healthy controls, which may indicate altered immune signaling and the potential for immune cell dysfunction in these patients. Moreover, the inhibition of JAK1/2 produces a unique pattern of signaling dysfunction, inducing increased ligand detection error rates and reduced signal-to-noise ratios for most immune cell subtypes. These results suggest a means to improve the use of signaling kinase inhibitor therapies by identifying patients with favorable ligand discrimination specificity profiles in their immune cells.

                <p>by Aapo E. Korhonen, Olli Sarala, Tuomas Hautamäki, Markku Kuismin, Mikko J. Sillanpää</p>

Gaussian graphical models (GGM) are powerful tools to examine partial correlation structures in high-dimensional omics datasets. Partial correlation networks can explain complex relationships between genes or other biological variables. Bayesian implementations of GGMs have recently received more attention. Usually, the most demanding parts of GGM implementations are: (i) hyperparameter tuning, (ii) edge selection, (iii) scalability for large datasets, and (iv) the prior choice for Bayesian GGM.
To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Bayesian GGM using a hierarchical matrix-F prior with a fast implementation. We show, with extensive simulations and biological example analyses, that this prior has competitive network recovery capabilities compared to state-of-the-art approaches and good properties for recovering meaningful networks. We present a new way of tuning the shrinkage hyperparameter by constraining the condition number of the estimated precision matrix. For edge selection, we propose using approximated credible intervals (CI) whose width is controlled by the false discovery rate. An optimal CI is selected by maximizing an estimated F<sub>1</sub>-score via permutations. In addition, a specific choice of hyperparameter can make the proposed prior better suited for clustering and community detection. Our method, with a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm, computationally outperforms existing Bayesian GGM approaches that use Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.
The method is implemented in the R package HMFGraph, found on GitHub at https://github.com/AapoKorhonen/HMFGraph. All codes to reproduce the results are found on GitHub at https://github.com/AapoKorhonen/HMFGraph-Supplementary.

Inconsistent characterization and reporting of laboratory animal genetics undermine research quality and reproducibility. We need to recognize the value of genetic characterization, improve training for researchers, and implement rigorous reporting standards.

Incomplete characterization and inconsistent reporting of laboratory animal genetics undermine study quality and limit research reproducibility. This Perspective highlights the LAG-R guidelines and calls for collective action to address these critical gaps and enhance scientific integrity.

Scientific progress relies on science’s capacity for self-correction. If erroneous articles remain unchallenged in the publication record, they can mislead future research and undermine evidence-based decision-making. All articles included in a systematic review of animal studies on early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage were analyzed for image-related issues. We included 608 articles, of which 243 articles were identified as problematic (40.0%). Of the 243 problematic articles, 55 (22.6%) have been corrected, 7 (2.9%) have received an expression of concern, 5 (2.1%) were marked with the Taylor & Francis under investigation pop-up, and 19 (7.8%) were retracted. In 9 of the 55 corrected articles (16.4%), new problems were found after correction or not all issues were resolved in the correction. Most (<i>n</i> = 213, 87.7%) problematic articles had a corresponding author affiliated to an institute from China. Our results show that the self-correcting mechanisms in science have stalled in this field of research. Our findings provide insight in the prevalence of image-related issues and can help publishers to take appropriate action. We can only uphold science’s capacity for self-correction when problematic articles are actively identified by peers, and when publishers take swift and adequate action to repair the scientific record.

Assessing species geographic distributions is critical to approximate their ecological niches, understand how global change may reshape their occurrence patterns, and predict their extinction risks. Yet, species records are over-aggregated across taxonomic, geographic, environmental, and anthropogenic dimensions. The under-sampling of remote locations biases the quantification of species geographic distributions and ecological niche for most species. Here, we used nearly one thousand environmental DNA (eDNA) samples across the world’s oceans, including polar regions and tropical remote islands, to determine the extent to which the geographic and ecological niche ranges of marine fishes are underestimated through the lens of global occurrence records based on conventional surveys. Our eDNA surveys revealed that the known geographic ranges for 93% of species and the ecological niche ranges for 7% of species were underestimated, and contributed to filling them. We show that the probability to detect a range filling for a given species is primarily shaped by the GBIF/OBIS sampling effort in a cell, but also by the number of occurrences available for the species. Most gap fillings were achieved by addressing a methodological sampling bias, notably when eDNA facilitated the detection of small fishes in previously sampled locations using conventional methods. Using a machine learning model, we found that a local effort of 10 eDNA samples would detect 24 additional fish species on average and a maximum of 98 species in previously unsampled tropical areas. Yet, a null model revealed that only half of ecological niche range fillings would be due to eDNA surveys, beyond a random allocation of classical sampling effort. Altogether, our results suggest that sampling in remote areas and performing eDNA surveys in over-sampled areas may both increase fish ecological niche ranges toward unexpected values with consequences in biodiversity modeling, management, and conservation.

<p>This essay describes the development of the in vitro hippocampal slice technique and my small contributions to it and to influencing Roger Nicoll's early interests in the hippocampus and LTP. My Ph.D. work at Harvard with Timothy Teyler was on field potential studies of synaptic plasticity, including LTP, in the rat in vitro hippocampal slice. As a postdoc, I introduced the slice preparation to Roger Nicoll's lab at UCSF but failed to interest him in LTP. Here I explain how Nicoll's scientific philosophy both motivated me to develop our first submersion slice chamber and kept him from investigating LTP for nearly a decade. Finally, I recount the history of the name “LTP.”</p>

     alt="Timing of Delamination of Inner Ear Neurons Specifies Their Topography and Target Innervation"/>
<p>Developmental time can encode positional information.
Timing of delamination of otic neuroblasts specifies their final positions within the auditory-vestibular ganglion.
Target innervation choice of the sensory epithelium and organisation of fibres in the 8th nerve are also augured by the time when a neuroblast leaves the otic epithelium.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The neurons of the inner ear delaminate from a sensorineurogenic epithelium in the ventral part of the otocyst. Delaminated neuroblasts then condense to form the acoustico-vestibular ganglion (AVG). As they differentiate, the neurons connect mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) of the inner ear with their targets in the hindbrain in a precise topographical manner. However, it is unclear how or when positional identities of neurons are specified within the AVG, such that topographical information from HCs is maintained into the auditory centers of the brain. Here, we find that the time of delamination from the otocyst correlates with neuroblast position in the ganglion. Using markers for neuronal differentiation, we find that the ganglion differentiates from a dorsal to ventral wave. Neurons that differentiate first innervate the vestibular apparatus, including the lagena and the proximal regions of the BP. Using sequential somatic cell labeling, we find that the central projection also follows a similar dependency on delamination order. Our studies show that the time of delamination of otic neuroblasts presages their target innervation choice and fiber positions within the developing eighth cranial nerve. We suggest that temporal information specifies the spatial identities during early inner ear neuron development.</p>

     alt="Brain-Wide Patterns of CRF Receptor 1 Expression in the Transgenic CRFR1-Cre-2a-tdTom Rat"/>
<p>In this article, we provide an extensive neuroanatomical characterization of a recently generated CRFR1-Cre-2A-tdTomato rat. We show that Cre and tdTomato are expressed in a pattern that closely aligns with previously reported CRFR1 expression patterns. We further demonstrate that Cre recombinase expression in CRFR1 neurons can be used to express virally delivered transgenes, which can be used to trace CRF-responsive neuronal circuits.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ability to manipulate neurons that express corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or its receptors has led to many new discoveries about how CRF signaling modulates stress-related behaviors in mice. However, similar advances in rats have been limited by the lack of reporter lines targeting CRF receptors, restricting access to behavioral paradigms that are more suitable for, or specific to, rats. Here, we provide an extensive neuroanatomical characterization of a recently generated CRFR1-Cre rat. We show that Cre and tdTomato are expressed in a pattern that closely aligns with previously reported CRFR1 expression patterns, as determined by in situ hybridization in rats and by genetic labeling in CRFR1 transgenic mice. We detail expression patterns at multiple rostrocaudal levels to validate the use of this transgenic rat in multiple neural circuits that signal via CRF activation of CRFR1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of Cre recombinase, combined with viral vector delivery, can be used to trace CRFR1-expressing neurons and their axonal terminals in target regions. This study is intended to serve as a resource for examining the expression pattern of CRFR1 and as a validation of the CRFR1-Cre rat for reliable use with Cre-dependent viral approaches to manipulate and/or record the activity of CRFR1-expressing neurons in distinct brain regions. We expect that the availability of the CRFR1-Cre rat, along with an increasing number of transgenic rat lines, will further expand our understanding of how CRF transmission mediates stress responses by leveraging the behavioral strengths of the rat as a model system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1185/v1?src=rss">DTAShiny: An Interactive R Shiny Application for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Analysis and Visualization [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) analyses are essential in clinical research and medical decision-making. Despite the availability of R packages such as pROC and ROCR, their use often requires programming expertise, limiting accessibility for many clinical researchers. An interactive, code-free method is therefore needed to enhance usability and understanding. We developed DTAShiny, an R Shiny based web application that allows users to upload diagnostic data sets in CSV or Stata formats, perform DTA metric calculations, and generate dynamic visualizations. The application is built using shiny, bs4Dash, pROC, ggplot2, and other packages. It includes heuristic-based automatic detection of reference and test variables and offers real time threshold adjustment via an interactive slider. DTAShiny computes standard sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, AUC and advanced F1 score, balanced accuracy. These DTA metrics are accompanied with approximate confidence intervals. The tool generates ROC and PR curves, distribution plots, and a calibration style plot. Real-time interactivity enables users to observe trade offs as thresholds change. This Zenodo deposit contains the DATAShiny source code, an example anonymised dataset, and documentation to run the app locally.

                Background Drinking water of the right and approved quality is a basic requirement for the development of any civilization. According to SDG 6 it is crucial to provide every citizen with equitable water quality and quantity. Methods The study area is the smart city of Bhubaneswar with 67 wards and three zones: the north zone, south-west zone, and south-east zone with around 12.4 lakhs population. To maintain the water quality in the supply pipeline in this city, which is always assumed to be safe, it needs to be examined within certain time intervals to check the contamination. In this context, studies on water quality parameters in the supply pipeline network from different anticipated vulnerable areas have been collected for testing. In this context, water samples were collected from areas near industries, market complexes, educational institutions, and construction sites of each ward of Bhubaneswar. Nearly 10 water quality parameters were tested and analyzed using the weighted arithmetic water quality index method. This method takes input of all the parameters and provides the overall water quality index value, which classifies the water in different grades like excellent, good, poor, and very poor quality. Results According to the WHO (2011) guidelines, the study found that there are deviation in the parameters like 10.78% in pH, 19.48% in dissolved oxygen, 43.88% in conductivity, and 22.95% in hardness from the standard limit, but the overall water quality index indicates the water is not in the poor and very poor range. Also, water quality index values identify that the water in the south-east zone is excellent compared to the north and south-west zones. The reason for the slight deterioration is due to the underground cable works, road works and also some areas where the old pipeline system still exists due to personal encroachment of people as per Public health engineering department.

                Background Clinical laboratories play a significant role in healthcare, providing tests for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Having skilled and adequate staffing is crucial for clinical laboratories to operate efficiently, manage their workload effectively, and deliver timely results. Despite being critical for healthcare delivery, ensuring adequate staffing levels in clinical laboratories remains a complex challenge for healthcare providers worldwide due to resource constraints and workforce shortages. Methods This study evaluates the workload in clinical laboratory staff using Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method, focusing on workload, work pressure, and staffing requirements to optimize staffing levels and ensure an efficient clinical laboratory environment. Annual clinical laboratory data from June 2021 to May 2023 were collected to calculate the average number of days (234) worked annually, percentage of workload, distribution of activity time measurement units, and the ratio of needed, surplus, and existing staff (n=33, complete enumeration) from the laboratory registers and hospital statistics. WISN software was used to calculate staffing requirements, workload pressure, and WISN ratio. The Shapiro–Wilk test assessed normality and the Kruskal–Wallis test evaluated differences across clinical laboratory sections. Result A total of 33 technical staff employed, performed approximately 3.7 million tests across hematology and clinical pathology during the study period, WISN ratios ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, indicating the existing 33 staff members face a high workload burden. The calculated ideal staffing level was 46.33 personnel, indicating a shortfall of 13.3 staff (28.3%). A p < 0.01 confirmed a significant disparity in workload distribution. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of optimizing staffing levels in clinical laboratories to ensure quality service delivery. The WISN methodology can be a useful tool in healthcare facilities for making evidence-based staff allocation, maximizing the utilization of employee skill sets, and establishing standard staffing benchmarks tailored to the needs of clinical laboratories.

                Background Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic infectious inflammatory disease that affects the tissues supporting teeth and results in a progressive deterioration of the alveolar bone. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic autoimmune disease that has been associated with increased severity of periodontal disease. This study aimed to evaluate the salivary levels human leukocyte antigen-DR4 (HLA-DR4), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), and to assess their diagnostic potential using ROC curve analysis in periodontitis patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis. Methods The study included three groups; thirty patients with PD, thirty patients with PD and RA, and twenty healthy control participants. Clinical periodontal parameters [plaque Index (PLI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)] were assessed. Salivary biomarkers were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the microbial load of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) was determined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Our findings showed that salivary HLA-DR4 levels were significantly lower in patient groups compared with healthy controls (P = 0.000), whereas salivary MMP-8 and ACPA levels were significantly elevated in patients (P = 0.034) and (P = 0.001) respectively, with no significant differences between the patient groups(P > 0.05). On the other hand, microbial load was significantly higher in the PD with and without RA groups than that in controls (P = 0.001), with a positive correlation between microbial load and CAL in the PD-RA group.

                Background The translation of research evidence into routine healthcare practice is often slow and inconsistent, even timely implementation can significantly improve patient outcomes. While implementation science offers strategies to close this gap, current approaches are frequently manual, fragmented, and poorly integrated within healthcare systems. To address these challenges, we propose ImpleMATE – an AI-powered implementation science platform designed to streamline implementation efforts. Grounded in the Learning Health System (LHS) model, ImpleMATE aims to establish a continuous, data-driven cycle of learning and improvement in implementation practice. Methods ImpleMATE will be developed through a co-design and co-production approach rooted in human-centred design principles. Development will proceed through four key activities: (1) establishing a data processing pipeline and building an implementation-focused ontology; (2) creating and validating an AI system to extract implementation knowledge, structure the ontology, and support implementation solution delivery; (3) designing an interactive web application to deliver AI-powered decision support and streamline implementation processes; and (4) developing an evaluation framework to assess platform’s effectiveness and plan for national integration. These activities align with three core components of the LHS model: converting data into knowledge, translating knowledge into practice, and feeding implementation process and outcome data back into the system for continuous learning. The platform will be underpinned by strong ethical and governance frameworks to ensure data privacy, transparency, and responsible AI use. Discussion ImpleMATE aims to transform the adoption of evidence-based innovations in healthcare by embedding trustworthy AI into the core of implementation practice. Through the integration of structured ontologies, real-time AI reasoning, and an interactive user interface, the platform will provide tailored solutions to support implementation efforts. Designed as a dynamic learning system, ImpleMATE will evolve with user input and real-world data, offering a scalable, ethically grounded solution to accelerate and enhance implementation across healthcare settings.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Identifying modifiable factors influencing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) risk is important for prevention. Blood biomarkers, particularly cholesterol, have been associated with neurodegenerative risk, but findings in ALS are inconsistent, and data on FTD are limited.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a population-based cohort study using UK primary care records from QResearch linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Adults with biomarker data recorded between 1998 and 2023 were included. We examined associations of low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C and HDL-C), total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, creatine kinase, and HbA1c with ALS and FTD risk. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was applied to explore genetically predicted associations of selected biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were up to 2,695 ALS and 781 FTD diagnoses, with a median follow-up duration of 9.4 and 10.5 years, respectively. Higher LDL-C (hazard ratio [HR]<sub>per 1-SD</sub> = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02–1.11) and total cholesterol levels (HR<sub>per 1-SD</sub> = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02–1.10) were linearly associated with higher ALS risk. Age-stratified analysis showed a stronger association for total cholesterol in those ≥ 60 years (HR<sub>per 1-SD</sub> = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.04–1.13, P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.003). Higher creatinine was inversely associated with FTD risk (HR<sub>per 1-SD</sub> = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.83–0.97), supported by MR (odds ratio [OR] inverse variance weighted (<sub>IVW</sub>)<sub>, per 1-SD</sub> = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.56–0.96). HbA1c showed a U-shaped association with FTD (P<sub>non-linearity</sub> = 0.006).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>LDL and total cholesterol may provide insights into early disease changes or the etiology of ALS, whereas creatinine and HbA1c may be relevant for FTD. Research in monogenic ALS and FTD is needed to determine whether these biomarkers inform targeted prevention or intervention strategies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>No direct demyelination was detected in the brains of <i>Slc20a2</i>-knockout brain calcification mice, but susceptibility to demyelination increased under the induction of oligodendrocyte-toxic cuprizone. The enhanced susceptibility was related to an exacerbation of brain calcification.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal brain calcium-phosphate (Ca-Pi) deposits along microvessels or inside neuronal cells. Eight genes have been linked to PFBC, with the <i>SLC20A2</i> being the earliest identified. <i>SLC20A2</i> encodes PiT-2, which is crucial for Pi homeostasis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In <i>Slc20a2</i> homozygous knockout (HO) mice, the neurotoxic effects resulting from pathological CSF-Pi accumulation and the unique brain transcriptome suggested that the absence of PiT-2 might lead to myelin abnormalities. However, the myelin morphology and content under <i>Slc20a2</i> deficiency remained largely unknown, and these were quantitatively investigated in this study. The results indicated no direct demyelination in the brains of <i>Slc20a2</i>-HO mice, but an increased susceptibility to demyelination under the induction of oligodendrocyte-toxic cuprizone (CPZ). The enhanced susceptibility was related to a greater infiltration of Th17 cells in the brain parenchyma, accompanying an exacerbation of brain calcification in <i>Slc20a2</i> deficiency.</p>

     alt="Newborn Auditory Brainstem Response and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"/>
<p>Newborns who later died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) appeared to show greater variability in auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at birth; however, these differences may reflect data quality rather than true physiological abnormalities, and expert-rated analyses did not replicate the finding. Further research is needed to clarify any link between ABR patterns and SIDS risk.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)—the sudden and unexplained death of a seemingly healthy infant, &lt; 1 year old—may be associated with abnormalities in the brain regions that underlie breathing and arousal during sleep. While post-mortem studies suggest abnormalities in SIDS infants' brainstems, there are no studies of these infants' brainstem function before death. One way to assess the function of the brainstem is with auditory brainstem response (ABR), a routine hearing-screening method that noninvasively measures the brainstem's response to sound. We hypothesized that anomalies in newborns' ABR measures may predict SIDS. We integrated two secondary datasets and examined ABRs of newborns who later died of SIDS (<i>n</i> = 11) compared to a normative sample (<i>n</i> = 198,990), using existing archived records of neonatal ABR results from a sample of newborns born in Florida. As hypothesized, infants who died from SIDS were more likely than non-SIDS infants to have abnormal ABRs as newborns. Children who died of SIDS appeared to have shorter latencies to the trough that follows peak V in the left ear than children without SIDS. However, our expert-rated data failed to replicate this finding, suggesting it is unlikely to reflect a true effect. Understanding the association between SIDS and ABR may facilitate more accurate identification of an infant's risk for SIDS at birth, enabling increased monitoring, which may facilitate interventions and improve survivorship.</p>

     alt="Evolution of Axonal Injury in the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration in Adult Ferrets"/>
<p>A clinically relevant ferret model of concussion was established using the Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration. This model reproduced key features of diffuse axonal injury, including disrupted axonal transport, neurofilament pathology, and persistent disruption of the nodes of Ranvier, alongside motor and cognitive deficits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Concussion-related symptoms, such as impaired balance, slower processing speed, attention deficits, memory dysfunction, and irritability, are thought to result from diffuse axonal injury (DAI), characterized by selective damage to white matter axons. Axons subjected to this mechanical stretch injury exhibit diverse pathological changes, including disruption of axonal transport, neurofilament compaction and degradation, myelin sheath disruption, and loss of sodium channels required for action potential generation and propagation. These distinct forms of axonal pathology may evolve differentially over time and preferentially localize to specific white matter tracts. In this study, we employed the clinically relevant ferret model of concussion using the closed head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA). 55 male ferrets were randomly allocated to sham or injury groups and then to either 24 h, 72 h, or 14d survival time points. We confirmed that axonal transport disruption and neurofilament pathology represent independent processes, with minimal colocalization but a shared peak of around 72 h following injury. Furthermore, we observed a persistent loss of ankyrin-G, a critical anchoring protein for sodium channels at the node of Ranvier, up to 14d postinjury, suggesting that the resultant impairment in axonal transmission may underlie many concussion symptoms. Indeed, injured ferrets displayed significant deficits in balance, working memory, spatial memory, and recognition memory. These findings demonstrate that the CHIMERA model in ferrets recapitulates key axonal pathologies and their associated clinical manifestations following concussion. This model offers a valuable platform for investigating the temporal evolution of axonal injury and developing targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate concussion-related deficits.</p>
