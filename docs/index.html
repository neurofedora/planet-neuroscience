              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04454">Mechanisms for anesthesia, unawareness, respiratory depression, memory replay and sleep: MHb > IPN > PAG + DRN + MRN > claustrum > cortical slow-waves</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: My findings show, for the first time, what causes loss of awareness, anesthesia, memory replay, opioids induced respiratory depression (OIRD), and slow wave sleep. Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and other medial habenula activators slowdown respiration during SWS and anesthesia. Using DTI method I observed that human hippocampus is connected to MHb via posterior septum, while amygdala via anteromedial BNST. MHb projected to pineal gland and contralateral MHb (Vadovi\v{c}ov\'a, 2014). MHb has dense mu-opioids receptors (Gardon and Faget, 2014) and strong projections to IPN. Herkenham (1981) found increased glucose intake during anesthesia in MHb and IPN. The IPN projects to serotonergic MRN/DRN, and pain/interoception/arousal linked PAG. The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? This extended circuit model explains role of the dentate gyrus >posterior septum >MHb >IPN >MRN >hippocampus + BF + claustrum >cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) in memory replay, loss of awareness, anesthesia and SWS. It proposes new neural mechanisms for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN >MRN >claustrum >cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. This brain model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence and wanting. This model suggests that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, cannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, neuropeptide Y, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-proteins production-spines/synapses growth-anti-inflammatory state.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05151">Network Models of Neurodegeneration: Bridging Neuronal Dynamics and Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the underlying biological mechanisms of disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, and glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden feeds back to disrupt circuit function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, we must develop integrated frameworks that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology. In this review, we survey the two modeling approaches and highlight efforts to unify them. We argue that such integration is necessary to address key questions in neurodegeneration and to inform interventions, from targeted stimulation to control-theoretic strategies that slow progression and restore function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05041">Dynamical Learning in Deep Asymmetric Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.05041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that asymmetric deep recurrent neural networks, enhanced with additional sparse excitatory couplings, give rise to an exponentially large, dense accessible manifold of internal representations which can be found by different algorithms, including simple iterative dynamics. Building on the geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap between AI and computational neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13846">Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.13846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09677">Net2Brain: A Toolbox to compare artificial vision models with human brain responses</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2208.09677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.

                arXiv:2503.14333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order" representations (FORs), which encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04633">Scaling Environments for Organoid Intelligence with LLM-Automated Design and Plasticity-Based Evaluation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a controlled biological substrate.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08674">The dynamic interplay between in-context and in-weight learning in humans and neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.08674v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of "in-context learning" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622">Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.04622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04661">Flexible inference of learning rules from de novo learning data using neural networks</a></h4>

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN) that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks, providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the development of behavioral digital twins.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15164">From Frege to chatGPT: Compositionality in language, cognition, and deep neural networks</a></h4>

Abstract: Compositionality has long been considered a key explanatory property underlying human intelligence: arbitrary concepts can be composed into novel complex combinations, permitting the acquisition of an open ended, potentially infinite expressive capacity from finite learning experiences. Influential arguments have held that neural networks fail to explain this aspect of behavior, leading many to dismiss them as viable models of human cognition. Over the last decade, however, modern deep neural networks (DNNs), which share the same fundamental design principles as their predecessors, have come to dominate artificial intelligence, exhibiting the most advanced cognitive behaviors ever demonstrated in machines. In particular, large language models (LLMs), DNNs trained to predict the next word on a large corpus of text, have proven capable of sophisticated behaviors such as writing syntactically complex sentences without grammatical errors, producing cogent chains of reasoning, and even writing original computer programs -- all behaviors thought to require compositional processing. In this chapter, we survey recent empirical work from machine learning for a broad audience in philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, situating recent breakthroughs within the broader context of philosophical arguments about compositionality. In particular, our review emphasizes two approaches to endowing neural networks with compositional generalization capabilities: (1) architectural inductive biases, and (2) metalearning, or learning to learn. We also present findings suggesting that LLM pretraining can be understood as a kind of metalearning, and can thereby equip DNNs with compositional generalization abilities in a similar way. We conclude by discussing the implications that these findings may have for the study of compositionality in human cognition and by suggesting avenues for future research.

                arXiv:2503.17111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During last several years, our research team worked on development of a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture, which could be used in the wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It should work under the condition, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) should have spiking nature. As a result, the CoLaNET (columnar layered network) SNN architecture was invented. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. While CoLaNET is relatively simple, it includes several hyperparameters. Their choice for particular classification tasks is not trivial. Besides that, specific features of the data classified (e.g. classification of separate pictures like in MNIST dataset vs. classifying objects in a continuous video stream) require certain modifications of CoLaNET structure. To solve these problems, the deep mathematical exploration of CoLaNET should be carried out. However, SNNs, being stochastic discrete systems, are usually very hard for exact mathematical analysis. To make it easier, I developed a continuous numeric (non-spiking) machine learning algorithm which approximates CoLaNET behavior with satisfactory accuracy. It is described in the paper. At present, it is being studied by exact analytic methods. We hope that the results of this study could be applied to direct calculation of CoLaNET hyperparameters and optimization of its structure.

Abstract: Bio-inspired algorithms, known as metaphor-based algorithms, utilize natural processes such as evolution, swarm behavior, foraging, and plant growth to solve complex, nonlinear, high-dimensional optimization problems. However, a plethora of these algorithms require a more rigorous review before making them applicable to the relevant fields. This survey categorizes these algorithms into eight groups: evolutionary, swarm intelligence, physics-inspired, ecosystem and plant-based, predator-prey, neural-inspired, human-inspired, and hybrid approaches, and reviews their principles, strengths, novelty, and critical limitations. We provide a critique on the novelty issues of many of these algorithms. We illustrate some of the suitable usage of the prominent algorithms in machine learning, engineering design, bioinformatics, and intelligent systems, and highlight recent advances in hybridization, parameter tuning, and adaptive strategies. Finally, we identify open challenges such as scalability, convergence, reliability, and interpretability to suggest directions for future research. This work aims to serve as a resource for both researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the current landscape and future directions of reliable and authentic advancement of bio-inspired algorithms.

">Altered excitability of dI3 neurons regulates hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury is limited in mammals. Reactivation of locomotor circuits does occur, but primarily through the activation of sensorimotor pathways in the context of locomotor training. Previous investigations have shown that dI3 neurons, a developmentally-defined population of pre-motor, glutamatergic interneurons, are indispensable for this process. However, it remains unclear how dI3 neurons are recruited during locomotor recovery, and whether they could be leveraged to improve locomotor function following spinal cord injury. Herein, we investigated how the excitability of dI3 neurons influences locomotor behaviour and recovery after spinal cord injury. In T9-T10 transected mice, we found that acute chemogenetic silencing of dI3 neurons leads to immediate loss of hindlimb motor tone, and significant reduction in stepping during treadmill locomotion. Conversely, regular chemogenetic stimulation of dI3 neurons led to transient increases in hindlimb motor tone early after injury, but ultimately reduced hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery over the long term. These chronic changes resulting from dI3 neuron stimulation were associated with the absence of expression of the constitutive 5-HT2C-R isoform, potentially representing a homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of dI3 excitability following spinal cord injury. Given these findings, we hypothesized that dI3 stimulation effects on motor tone, while insufficient to drive locomotor function alone, may promote stepping improvements when locomotor rhythm-generating circuits are active. The addition of quipazine, a serotonergic agonist known to facilitate locomotor rhythmogenesis, in combination with dI3 stimulation, significantly improved locomotor function, while also mitigating the long-term reduction in treadmill stepping associated with dI3 stimulation alone. In aggregate, our results suggest that hyper-excitable dI3 neurons are involved in the maintenance of motor tone after spinal cord injury, possibly through a 5-HT2C-R-dependent mechanism, and further show that the selective stimulation of dI3 neurons could enhance the recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury.

">Is critical brain dynamics more prevalent than previously thought?</a></h4>

              
                The hypothesis that the brain operates near criticality has far-reaching implications for brain function and is supported by growing experimental evidence. Observations of scale-invariant brain activity agree with this hypothesis, but what about when brain activity is not scale-invariant? Should we reject the criticality hypothesis When power-laws poorly fit the data or when strong oscillations occur (dominated by a specific time scale)? Here we show several ways that criticality can be hidden from traditional data analytic approaches, leading to false negative conclusions. We use a parsimonious high-dimensional model to demonstrate how neural systems may separate different dynamical modes into different subspaces, simultaneously generating non-critical dynamics, critical oscillations, and scale-invariant avalanches. Our results point to a need for new methods capable of revealing hidden criticality and suggest that criticality could be more prevalent than previously thought, hidden in subspaces not readily revealed by standard data analyses.

">Disrupted Lipid Homeostasis as a Pathogenic Mechanism in ABCA7-Associated Alzheimers Disease Risk</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: ABCA7 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 7) encodes a lipid transporter linked to Alzheimers disease (AD). While common variants confer modest risk in Europeans, a 44-base pair deletion (rs142076058; p.Arg578Alafs) is a strong risk factor in African Americans (AA). Despite this, the biological consequences of this ancestry-specific variant are not well understood. METHODS: We expressed the truncated ABCA7 protein in HEK and HepG2 cells to assess localization and lipid metabolism. Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying the deletion were compared with isogenic controls. RESULTS: The truncated ABCA7 localized to the plasma membrane similarly to wild type but induced significant lipid droplet accumulation in HepG2 cells and iPSC-derived neurons. DISCUSSION: These findings show that the AA-specific ABCA7 deletion disrupts lipid regulation despite normal localization, suggesting a mechanistic link between impaired lipid homeostasis and increased AD risk. This work underscores the importance of ancestry-specific studies in AD research.

">Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase 1 Deficiency Attenuates Amyloid Pathology, Neurodegeneration, and Cognitive Decline in a Familial Alzheimer Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP1) has been implicated in DNA damage responses and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer disease (AD), yet its role in amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) pathology remains unclear. Here, we show that PARP1 activation drives A{beta} pathology and neurodegeneration. Using a sensitive ELISA, we observed significantly elevated PAR levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared to controls. In vitro, oligomeric A{beta} 1-42 activated PARP1 and induced DNA damage, while genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 conferred neuroprotection. In vivo, PARP1 knockout in the 5XFAD mouse model of amyloidosis led to reduced amyloid plaque burden, preserved synaptic and neuronal integrity, attenuated glial activation and neuroinflammation, and rescued cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, PARP1 deficiency decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) and BACE1 levels, altered {gamma}-secretase complex composition, and enhanced A{beta} degradation via neprilysin. These findings position PARP1 as a critical mediator of A{beta} toxicity and neurodegeneration, suggesting its inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder involving a neuroinflammatory response, the cause of which remains unclear. Transposable elements (TE) have been linked to inflammatory states, but their potential role in PD has not been explored. Using bulk- and single nuclei RNAseq of postmortem brain tissue from four brain regions, we studied TE transcriptional activation and its correlation with neuroinflammation in PD. Over a thousand TE loci, including LINE-1s and ERVs, were highly expressed in a cell-type and region-specific manner in the human brain. Increased TE expression was found in microglia and neurons in the substantia nigra and putamen in the PD brains, but not amygdala or prefrontal cortex, compared to age-matched control tissue. This TE activation correlated with innate immune transcriptional responses, characterized by the expression of interferon-related and viral response genes, in the same brain regions. The link between an interferon response and TE activation was mechanistically confirmed using human pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia and neurons. Our findings provide a unique insight into TE transcription in the PD brain and suggests that TEs play a role in chronic neuroinflammatory processes and the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder.

">Mitochondrial dysfunction precedes neurodegeneration in DRPLA patient-derived neurons, and phenylbutyrate improves survival.</a></h4>

              
                Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a progressive autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATN1 gene, which encodes the transcriptional corepressor Atrophin-1. The temporal sequence of molecular mechanisms driving neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in DRPLA is poorly understood, limiting therapeutic development. We generated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiated them into cortical excitatory glutamatergic neurons to model early pathogenic processes. Early pathological features of DRPLA patient-derived neurons included mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. These alterations occurred before overt neuronal loss, highlighting bioenergetic stress as a key early driver of disease progression toward neurodegeneration. Pharmacological treatment with phenylbutyrate significantly improved neuronal survival and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. These findings challenge the conventional aggregation-centric model of polyglutamine disease pathogenesis and position mitochondrial stress as a central and early promoter of neuronal degeneration in DRPLA. By providing mechanistic insight into early-stage disease processes, our study lays the foundation for therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in DRPLA and related polyglutamine disorders.

We identified and characterized a spontaneous heterozygous GNAO1 E246K mutation in an Israeli female infant with complex developmental delays and substantial motor difficulties. This mutation has been reported in other cases as a prevalent pathogenic mutation in patients with motor dysfunction and a broad range of neurological outcomes. To investigate the molecular and functional consequences of the Go E246K mutation, we employed structural modeling and analysis, biochemical assays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and cellular functional assays. We show that this mutation does not affect nucleotide binding, nor basal or RGS-accelerated GTP hydrolysis. Despite the E246 position located within a predicted effector binding region, proteomics analysis did not identify any new cellular partners. Instead, we demonstrate that the E246K mutation disrupts the Go regulatory GTPase cycle by directly impairing G{beta}{gamma} dissociation. This impairment overrides the presence of wild-type Go, explaining the dominant effect of the severe neurogenetic phenotype in the heterozygous background. These findings establish a new molecular mechanism for a GNAO1 mutation with dominant-negative effects on the GTPase regulatory cycle. The insights gained from studying this mechanism of action provide a basis for developing specific and personalized therapeutic strategies based on the outcome of a missense mutation in GNAO1.

">Using Tools as Cues for Motor Adaptation in Virtual Reality</a></h4>

              
                Humans are adept at using multiple tools, often switching between them even when each involves distinct and potentially conflicting motor demands. This study investigated how different features of a tool influence the formation of distinct motor memories during dual adaptation to opposing visuomotor perturbations. Using an immersive virtual reality (VR) setup, participants performed an aiming task in which they launched a ball toward a target using virtual tools, each consistently associated with a different visuomotor rotation. We manipulated tool features across three groups: one in which tools differed only in colour (Colour Control), one in which they differed in shape but involved similar operational dynamics (Motor Congruent), and one in which they differed in both shape and mode of operation (Motor Incongruent). A control group that adapted to a single perturbation with a single tool at a time was also included. Only the Motor Incongruent group demonstrated robust dual adaptation and clear aftereffects, comparable to those observed during single-tool learning. These results suggest that distinct modes of tool operation play a critical role in supporting the formation and retention of separate internal models during sensorimotor adaptation.

">Relative value learning in Drosophila melanogaster larvae</a></h4>

              
                The ability to learn from past experiences to inform future decision-making is crucial for humans and animals alike. One question with important implications for adaptive decision-making is whether we learn about the absolute values of cues we encounter (how good or bad?), or about their relative values (how much better or worse than the alternative?). Humans have been shown to use relative value learning, even when it leads to suboptimal decisions. In this study, we ask whether insects use absolute or relative value learning. Using the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we designed associative odour-taste learning experiments to distinguish both kinds of learning and find that larvae learn about the relative rather than the absolute values of both rewards and punishments, irrespective of the number and sequence of training trials. This suggests that relative value learning is a facility shared across the animal kingdom from maggots to humans, and can be realized even by simple insect brains. Given the great potential of D. melanogaster as a model organism for in-depth neurobiological analyses, our study opens up the opportunity to reveal the mechanism underlying relative value learning in unprecedented detail.

">Quantitative spectral Linear Unmixing and Ratiometric FRET for live-cell imaging of protein interactions</a></h4>

              
                We present a biophysical imaging strategy based on linear unmixing Forster resonance energy transfer (lux-FRET) for investigating protein-protein interactions and receptor-mediated signaling in live cells. This method utilizes spectral unmixing of FRET signals acquired via confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM), enabling high-resolution quantification of molecular interactions with both spatial and temporal precision. Applying lux-FRET, we examined receptor-receptor interactions and downstream signaling events, including agonist specificity for 5-HT receptors. Ratiometric FRET measurements with a genetically encoded cAMP biosensor allowed us to assess biosensor sensitivity to cyclic nucleotides and receptor efficacy. Additionally, we explored physiological interactions between CD44 and 5-HT receptors and characterized the oligomerization state of the 5-HT1A receptor through apparent FRET efficiency analysis. Our findings demonstrate the utility of lux-FRET combined with quantitative molecular microscopy as a powerful tool for dissecting dynamic signaling mechanisms in live cells. This approach offers broad applicability for researchers studying receptor pharmacology, cellular signaling, and protein interaction dynamics.

">Hypoimmunogenic human motor neurons induced from iPSCs in vivo substantially ameliorate ALS disease in large animal models</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell-based therapy holds great potential for substituting degenerated motor neurons (MNs) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Missing protocols for advanced differentiation of transplanted cells into MNs, immune rejection, and the lack of suitable ALS models for preclinical trials have slowed the development of effective therapies. Here, we employed multiplex genetic-editing to generate a novel human pluripotent stem cell line containing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible MNs-specific transcription factors and comprehensively modified immunomodulatory genes. We transplanted these cells into the spinal cord of ALS large animal models (SOD1G93A pigs and TIA1P362L rabbits), which faithfully recapitulate pathologies and symptoms observed in ALS patients. The transplanted cells could efficiently differentiate into functional MNs upon Dox treatment in vivo, distribute throughout the spinal cord and motor cortex via extensive migration, survive long-term without the need for immunosuppression. Notably, these MNs integrated into host neural circuits, as evidenced by their long projection of peripheral axons to target muscle and reformation of neuromuscular junctions. As result, pathologies and motor deficits were substantially ameliorated in both animal models.

">Heterochronic myeloid cell replacement reveals the local brain environment as key driver of microglia aging</a></h4>

              
                Aging, the key risk factor for cognitive decline, impacts the brain in a region-specific manner, with microglia among the most affected cell types. However, it remains unclear whether this is intrinsically mediated or driven by age-related changes in neighboring cells. Here, we describe a scalable, genetically modifiable system for in vivo heterochronic myeloid cell replacement. We find reconstituted myeloid cells adopt region-specific transcriptional, morphological and tiling profiles characteristic of resident microglia. Young donor cells in aged brains rapidly acquired aging phenotypes, particularly in the cerebellum, while old cells in young brains adopted youthful profiles. We identified STAT1-mediated signaling as one axis controlling microglia aging, as STAT1-loss prevented aging trajectories in reconstituted cells. Spatial transcriptomics combined with cell ablation models identified rare natural killer cells as necessary drivers of interferon signaling in aged microglia. These findings establish the local environment, rather than cell-autonomous programming, as a primary driver of microglia aging phenotypes.

">Erucamide regulates retinal neurovascular crosstalk</a></h4>

              
                Neurovasculoglial crosstalk is critical in establishing and maintaining a functional neurovascular unit. Breakdown in the unit is central to many neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS of which the retina is a component. A growing literature indicated that primary fatty acid amides (PFAMs) can regulate this crosstalk between vasculature and neuronal tissues. In this study we describe a central role for erucamide, a 22:1 mono-unsaturated omega-9 fatty acid amide, in degenerating retinal tissues. Using high-resolution global mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we cataloged metabolites in murine models of retinal degeneration and show that while PFAMs, in general, are highly dysregulated, erucamide is the one most significantly diminished during photoreceptor atrophy. Using rodent models of retinal degeneration and novel organosilane-modified porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) for the in vivo delivery of erucamide, we demonstrate that erucamide activates CD11b+ myeloid cells, leading to the upregulation of angiogenic and neurotrophic cytokines that stabilize retinal degeneration. We identified TMEM19 as a novel binding protein for erucamide that is crucial for human iPSC-derived macrophage precursor cells activation and subsequent neurotrophic and angiogenic factor production. These findings reveal a previously unknown PFAM pathway that is modulated during retinal degenerative diseases, demonstrating that erucamide or functional analogues and their action through TMEM19 may be useful as a therapeutic alternative to neuroprotective and stem cell-based approaches for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.

">Ischemic stroke increases levels of the folate receptor and one-carbon enzymes in male and female brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide and predominantly affects individuals over 65 years old. Its prevalence is projected to increase in parallel with the aging global population. Nutrition is a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. Folates, B-vitamins and choline play a central role in one-carbon metabolism (1C), which is a key metabolic network that integrates nutritional signals with biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, epigenetics, regulation of cell proliferation, and stress resistance. Our research group has previously shown that deficiencies in 1C lead to worsened stroke outcomes using preclinical models. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on 1C enzymes in affected brain tissue remains unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate whether ischemic stroke contributes to a change in the levels of 1C enzymes after ischemic stroke in male and female patients. Cortical brain tissue sections from ischemic stroke patients and controls were stained for enzymes involved in 1C. All tissue was co-stained with neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The colocalization of all three markers was evaluated by two individuals who were blinded to the experimental groups. Ischemic stroke increased neuronal levels of the folate receptor and 1C enzymes, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS) and serine hydroxy methyltransferase (SHMT). In male stroke brain tissue was observed to have increased levels of MTHFR, TS, and SHMT. Female brain tissue had increases in the folate receptor and TS. The results suggest that ischemic stroke leads to increased demand of 1C and that there are some differences between males and females.

">Neuroinflammation links the neurogenic and neurodegenerative phenotypes of Nrmt1-/- mice</a></h4>

              
                It is widely thought that age-related damage is the single biggest contributing factor to neurodegenerative diseases. However, recent studies are beginning to indicate that many of these diseases may have developmental origins that become unmasked overtime. It has been difficult to prove these developmental origins, as there are still few known links between defective embryonic neurogenesis and progressive neurodegeneration. We have created a constitutive knockout mouse for the N-terminal methyltransferase NRMT1 (Nrmt1-/- mice). Nrmt1-/- mice display phenotypes associated with premature aging. Specifically in the brain, they exhibit age-related striatal and hippocampal degeneration, which is accompanied by impaired short and long-term memory. These phenotypes are preceded by depletion of the postnatal neural stem cell (NSC) pools, which appears to be driven by their premature differentiation and migration. However, this differentiation is often incomplete, as many resulting neurons cannot permanently exit the cell cycle and ultimately undergo apoptosis. Here, we show that the onset of apoptosis corresponds to increased cleavage of p35 into the CDK5 activator p25, which can promote neuroinflammation. Accordingly, Nrmt1-/- brains exhibit an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, astrogliosis, complement activation, microgliosis, and markers of a compromised blood brain barrier, all of which indicate an activated neuroimmune response. We also find Nrmt1-/- mice do not activate a corresponding anti-inflammatory response. These data indicate that abnormal neurogenesis can trigger neuroinflammation, which in the absence of compensatory anti-inflammatory signaling, could lead to neuronal apoptosis and progressive neurodegeneration.

">Enduring Autism-like Phenotypes and Deregulated Hypothalamic Prosocial Peptides After Early-Life Exposure to Indoor Flame Retardants in Male C57BL/6 Mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are neuroendocrine disrupting chemicals that produce adverse neurodevelopmental effects. PBDEs have been implicated as risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by abnormal psychosocial functioning and is commonly accompanied by co-morbidities such as cognitive and attentional deficits. Here, we used a mouse model with translationally relevant exposure to establish direct causal evidence that maternal transfer of a commercial mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant behavioral and neurochemical deficits in male offspring. Methods: C57Bl6/N mouse dams were exposed to a commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71, via oral administration of 0 (vehicle control, VEH/CON), 0.1 (L-DE-71), or 0.4 (H-DE-71) mg/kg bw/d for 10 weeks, spanning three weeks prior to gestation through the end of lactation at postnatal day (PND) 21. Results: Mass spectrometric analysis indicated dose-dependent transfer of PBDEs (in ppb) to brains of F1 male offspring at PND 30, with reduction in levels by PND 110. Adult F1 male offspring displayed ASD-relevant neurobehavioral phenotypes, including impaired short- and long-term social recognition memory (SRM), despite intact general sociability, and exaggerated repetitive behavior. Exposed mice also displayed altered olfactory discrimination of social odors, impaired novel object recognition memory, and reduced open field habituation. However, no changes were observed in anxiety-like, sensorimotor, or depressive-like behaviors relative to VEH/CON. At the molecular level, DE-71 exposed males displayed deregulated gene markers of prosocial neuropeptides. Oxt was upregulated in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN); Avp was upregulated in the PVN and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) but downregulated in the lateral septum (LS); Avp1ar and Adcyap1 were upregulated in the BNST; and Adcyap1r1 was upregulated in the PVN, supraoptic nucleus (SON), and BNST. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that developmental PBDE exposure produces enduring behavioral and neurochemical phenotypes that resemble core domains of ASD, which may result from early neurodevelopmental reprogramming within central social and memory networks.

">Enhancing experience-dependent plasticity accelerates vision loss in a murine model of retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Modulating neural plasticity is pursued as a therapeutic approach for several neurologic conditions. Here we evaluated if enhancing experience-dependent plasticity prolongs vision in a murine model of retinitis pigmentosa. First, we quantified the loss of visual acuity under both scotopic and photopic conditions for mice heterozygous for the P23H mutation in the Rhodopsin gene (Rho P23H/+). Acuity progressively declined under scotopic conditions followed by photopic conditions. Acuity deficits only broadly correlated with the retinal response measured by the electroretinogram. In contrast, acuity deficits were consistent with the percent of cortical excitatory layer 2/3 neurons responsive to higher spatial frequency visual stimuli. Then, we tested if enhancing plasticity in adult visual circuity by deleting the nogo-66 receptor gene (Ngr1) would preserve vision in Rho P23H/+ mice. However, loss of vision was accelerated in Ngr1 -/-; Rho P23H/+ mice. Thus, enhancing plasticity can be maladaptive in the context of neural degeneration.

">The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis: How predictive coding of CT-touch explains Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response and its therapeutic applications.</a></h4>

              
                Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a pleasant tingling sensation felt across the scalp and neck, widely reported to reduce anxiety and improve sleep. The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis (PPH) is the first comprehensive predictive coding model explaining ASMR's underlying neural mechanism. PPH posits that near-field acoustic cues from common ASMR triggers (e.g., brushing sounds, whispered speech) engage the audio-tactile Peripersonal Space Network, generating a top-down prediction of gentle C-tactile (CT) touch on CT fibre-rich skin of the scalp and neck. This prediction suppresses locus coeruleus (LC) arousal and increases vagal output, offering a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon's therapeutic benefits. In a subjective-experience survey (N = 64), ASMR-labelled trials were rated significantly more pleasant but only slightly more arousing than controls. Pleasantness predicted both the presence and intensity of tingles, supporting PPH's core claim that hedonic value, rather than sympathetic activation, drives the graded somatosensory response. PPH situates ASMR within the Neurovisceral Integration framework, predicting measurable Central Nervous System-Autonomic Nervous System (CNS-ANS) markers (beta-band desynchronisation in the posterior insula and proportional increases in high-frequency heart rate variability with tingle intensity). It further predicts reduced LC activity during ASMR, stronger effects in individuals with high interoceptive prediction error (e.g., anxiety, autism), and attenuation of tingles when spatial proximity cues are removed. By integrating auditory proximity, CT-touch anticipation, and autonomic regulation into a single predictive-coding account, PPH provides a unified, testable framework for explaining ASMR, offering a blueprint for translating this sensory phenomenon into targeted, evidence-based interventions for anxiety and sleep disorders.

">Obesogenic Diet Impairs Social Memory Through Alterations of Hippocampal CA2 Excitability and Oxytocin Signaling</a></h4>

              
                While obesity induces cardio-metabolic disorders and cognitive deficits, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unexplored. In mice, exposure to an obesogenic high-fat and sugar diet (HFD) resulted in social recognition memory deficits, a process that is dependent upon hippocampal area CA2 and oxytocin signaling. HFD-fed mice had stronger inputs onto CA2 pyramidal neurons that led to increased action potential firing, without altering intrinsic properties or inhibitory transmission. Chemogenetic CA2 inhibition rescued HFD-induced social memory deficits, confirming the role of CA2 hyperexcitability in these effects. In CA2, oxytocin receptor activation resulted in membrane depolarization, spontaneous action-potential firing and permitted endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity in control diet-fed mice, but not HFD-fed littermates. In a concentration-dependent manner, oxytocin restored potentiation of excitatory responses and allowed for endocannabinoid plasticity at CA2 inhibitory synapses as well as social memory deficits in HFD-fed mice. By investigating the influence of diet on hippocampal area CA2, this study uncovers novel mechanisms linking neuromodulation and plasticity in social memory encoding.

">Redefined Strategies to generate Conditional miR-141/200c miRNA cluster Knockout mice to eliminate confounding neo cassettes</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miRNAs) of the miR-200 family specifically miR-141 and miR0-200c regulate neurogenesis, differentiation, and epithelial mesenchymal transitions in development and several diseases including cancer and stroke. The STOCK Mirc13tm1Mtm /Mmjax mouse line, which targets the miR-141/200c cluster, was originally described by Park et al. (2012) as a conditional knockout-first allele requiring a two-step breeding strategy: Flp recombination to excise lacZ/neo cassettes followed by Cre recombination to delete the floxed miRNA cluster. However, subsequent studies frequently bypassed this step and reported knockouts based on direct crosses with Cre mouse lines, leaving residual lacZ/neo sequences that may silence upstream elements or introduce transcriptional artifacts. Here, we present a detailed and refined strategy to generate both global and tissue-specific miR-141/200c knockouts that adheres to the original design intent and eliminates confounding cassettes. Our approach confirmed robust baseline expression of miR-141 and miR-200c in various organs such olfactory bulbs and lungs where these miRNAs are robustly expressed, with near-complete loss of expression in knockout animals as validated by qPCR and in situ hybridization. By restoring a clean floxed allele prior to Cre deletion, we establish a reliable and interpretable mouse model for dissecting the roles of the miR-141/200c cluster miRNA in various disease models in these mice.

">Benchmarking Orientation Distribution Function Estimation Methods for Tractometry in Single-Shell Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging - An Evaluation of Test-Retest Reliability and Predictive Capability</a></h4>

              
                Deriving white matter (WM) bundles in-vivo has thus far mainly been applied in research settings, leveraging high angular resolution, multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) acquisitions that enable advanced reconstruction methods. However, these advanced acquisitions are both time-consuming and costly to acquire. The ability to reconstruct WM bundles in the massive amounts of existing single-shelled, lower angular resolution data from legacy research studies and healthcare systems would offer much broader clinical applications and population-level generalizability. While legacy scans may offer a valuable, large-scale complement to contemporary research datasets, the reliability of white matter bundles derived from these scans remains unclear. Here, we leverage a large research dataset where each 64-direction dMRI scan was acquired as two independent 32-direction runs per subject. To investigate how recently developed bundle segmentation methods generalize to this data, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of the two 32-direction scans, of WM bundle extraction across three orientation distribution function (ODF) reconstruction methods: generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI), constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and single-shell three-tissue CSD (SS3T). We found that the majority of WM bundles could be reliably extracted from dMRI scans that were acquired using the 32-direction, single-shell acquisition scheme. The mean dice coefficient of reconstructed WM bundles was consistently higher within-subject than between-subject for all WM bundles and ODF reconstruction methods, illustrating preservation of person-specific anatomy. Further, when using features of the bundles to predict complex reasoning assessed using a computerized cognitive battery, we observed stable prediction accuracies (r: 0.15-0.36) across the test-retest data. Among the three ODF reconstruction methods, SS3T had a good balance between sensitivity and specificity in external validation, a high intra-class correlation of extracted features, more plausible bundles, and strong predictive performance. More broadly, these results demonstrate that bundle segmentation can achieve robust performance even on lower angular resolution, single-shell dMRI, with particular advantages for ODF methods optimized for single-shell data. This highlights the considerable potential for dMRI collected in healthcare settings and legacy research datasets to accelerate and expand the scope of WM research.

">Conserved Axonal Transcriptome Dynamics Underlie PGE2-Induced Sensitisation and Identify Tnfrsf12a/Fn14 as a Regulator of Neuronal Excitability in DRG Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain arises when dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons become sensitised to noxious inputs, a process driven by inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Local translation of axonal mRNAs is a key regulator of nociceptor plasticity, yet how axonal transcriptome dynamics contribute to inflammatory sensitisation remains unclear. Using compartmentalised culture systems and RNA-sequencing, we defined axonal and somatic transcriptomes in embryonic (E16.5) and adult (W8) DRG neurons and assessed their remodelling after PGE2 exposure. We identify a conserved core axonal transcriptome spanning embryonic to adult stages, prominently enriched for ribosomal and mitochondrial functions, consistent with sustained translational and metabolic demands. PGE2 elicited compartment-specific reprogramming: pathways related to sensory processing and pain were upregulated in axons but downregulated in somata. Functionally, prolonged axonal PGE2 exposure enhanced capsaicin-evoked calcium responses and drove retrograde sensitisation of neuronal somata. Integrating transcriptomics with functional assays, we pinpointed Tnfrsf12a (Fn14), a cytokine receptor linked to regeneration and neuropathic pain, as a PGE2-induced axonal mRNA. Crucially, local axonal knockdown of Tnfrsf12a significantly reduced neuronal excitability, providing proof-of-concept that axonally enriched transcripts can be targeted to modulate sensitisation. These findings position conserved axonal transcriptome programmes as drivers of peripheral sensitisation and establish Tnfrsf12a/Fn14 as a therapeutic candidate for inflammatory pain.

">Preserved synaptic architecture but impaired ketamine-induced synaptic plasticity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the aged frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging is accompanied by a gradual decline in higher-order cognitive functions, including working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility, processes that critically rely on intact frontal cortical circuits. While neuronal loss is minimal during aging, whether there are changes in functional plasticity in this region remains unexplored. In this regard, dendritic spines, the primary postsynaptic structures of excitatory synapses, act as key hubs for experience-dependent synaptic remodeling. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging in Thy1-eGFP-M mice, we examined age-related changes in dendritic spine density and dynamics in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the secondary motor area (MOs), a frontal cortical region essential for strategy switching and cognitive flexibility, and that was assessed using an operant conditioning paradigm. We found that aged mice (18 to 22 months) exhibited significant impairments in cognitive flexibility relative to young mice (3 to 5 months) in the four-odor choice discrimination and reversal task. Analysis of dendritic spine plasticity revealed that baseline spine density, turnover, and morphology were largely preserved in aged mice. Sex differences were evident, with females displaying higher spine density and a greater fraction of stable spines, a feature maintained across aging. Importantly, despite preserved baseline architecture, aged mice showed impaired ketamine-induced spinogenesis and reduced stabilization of newly formed spines, in contrast to the robust structural plasticity observed in young mice. These results indicate that healthy aging selectively impairs activity-dependent synaptic remodeling without affecting steady-state spine architecture in frontal cortical circuits. By linking deficits in induced synaptic plasticity to age-related impairments in cognitive flexibility, our study highlights the critical need to target plasticity mechanisms as a therapeutic strategy to restore executive function and cognitive adaptability in the aging brain.

                Classic experiments showing that monocular visual disruption alters synaptic connections to binocular neurons in the brain established the fundamental concept of synaptic plasticity through coincident spike time arrival. However, if the speed of impulse transmission from the eye is altered by visual deprivation, spike time arrival at binocular neurons would be affected, thereby inducing synaptic plasticity. This possibility is tested here in adult mice by monocular eyelid suture and action potential inhibition in retinal axons. The results show that spike time arrival in visual cortex is altered by monocular visual disruption in association with morphological changes in myelin (nodes of Ranvier) on axons in optic nerve and optic tract. This non-synaptic mechanism of ocular dominance plasticity, mediated by myelin-forming cells, supplements and may drive synaptic plasticity.

">Critical point drying of brain tissue for X-ray phase contrast imaging</a></h4>

              
                X-ray phase contrast tomography is emerging as a powerful method for imaging large volumes of brain tissue at sub-cellular resolution. However, current sample preparation methods are largely inherited from visible light or electron microscopy workflows and hence are not optimised to exploit the full potential of X-ray contrast mechanisms. Here we propose to replace interstitial material by air to enhance X-ray phase contrast of the ultrastructural features. We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue. The contrast gain remained consistent across samples, imaging conditions, and beamlines. Our results suggest that CPD offers a generalisable route for preparing tissue for high-resolution X-ray imaging. It retains structural detail while improving signal, and is compatible with other processing procedures like femtosecond laser milling or electron microscopy, paving the path for large-scale biological tissue imaging.

">Brain structure-function coupling - relationship with language lateralisation</a></h4>

              
                Language is one of the most extensively studied lateralised cognitive functions in the human brain, predominantly relying on the left hemisphere in most individuals. However, the mechanisms by which a stable white matter architecture underpins individual language functions remain unclear. Previous studies have employed structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) coupling for individual fingerprinting and task decoding, suggesting that variability in brain entropy may serve as a distinguishing characteristic for language lateralisation. We examined a large cohort of healthy adults (n = 285) to investigate SC-FC coupling and identify markers distinguishing different language laterality groups. Functional connectivity was measured using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) time-series data, while structural connectivity was determined via probabilistic fibre tractography. SC-FC coupling was investigated using the SENSAAS language atlas and defined as the Pearson correlation between non-zero elements of regional structural and functional connectivity profiles. Group differences were assessed using the PALM toolbox in FSL. Our findings revealed that increased SC-FC coupling in the left precentral sulcus was associated with typical language lateralisation, while increased coupling in the right middle temporal gyrus and left anterior insula was observed in individuals with atypical language lateralisation (pFDR < 0.05). Non-lateralised individuals exhibited increased coupling in the left anterior insula compared to lateralised (pFDR<0.05). SC-FC coupling offers a promising framework to uncover functional and anatomical differences among individuals with varying language lateralisation. This regional specificity indicates that typical, atypical, and non-lateralised profiles rely on different structural-functional alignments, likely reflecting the recruitment of alternative pathways for language processing.

">Language laterality and cognitive skills: does anatomy matter?</a></h4>

              
                Brain anatomy, particularly white matter microstructure, is thought to play a critical role in the relationships between cognitive function and language lateralisation. This study investigates whether white matter microstructural parameters of the arcuate fasciculus and corpus callosum is associated with cognitive performance across distinct language lateralisation groups. Neuroimaging and cognitive data from 279 healthy adults were sourced from the BIL&GIN database. Participants completed a sentence production fMRI task, diffusion MRI, and cognitive tasks assessing verbal, visuospatial, and arithmetic skills. Significant positive associations were observed in strongly atypical individuals between fractional anisotropy in the splenium and working memory (R2 = 0.96, pFDR = 0.042) and between FA in the genu and visuospatial attention (R2 = 0.92, pFDR = 0.042). ANCOVA revealed that cross-dominant individuals had significantly lower visuospatial attention scores compared to consistently lateralised individuals (pFDR = 0.02). These findings challenge the notion that atypical lateralisation is inherently maladaptive and suggest that white matter pathways may serve as an alternative mechanism for supporting cognitive function in individuals with rightward language dominance. Furthermore, the results highlight the cognitive disadvantages of crossed dominance, implicating disrupted interhemispheric communication as a potential underlying mechanism.

">Neural computations of visual, semantic, and memorability features in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Object recognition requires integrated processing that extends beyond the visual cortex, incorporating semantic and memory-related processes. However, it remains unclear how different attributes, such as visual, semantic, and memorability features, are encoded and interact during perception. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from 5143 channels while participants viewed natural object images. We systematically characterized the spatiotemporal patterns of neural encoding for visual, semantic, and memorability attributes and showed that memorability was encoded in a distributed manner, which can be dissociated from visual and semantic coding. While the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) was engaged in encoding all three attributes, the representations were dissociable. Interestingly, memorability representations in the prefrontal cortex appeared to arise from integrated visual and semantic signals from the VTC; and memorability influenced early stages of visual and semantic processing. Our results were corroborated by high-resolution 7T fMRI, which revealed continuous encoding across the brain, and further validated using a separate dataset featuring within-category object variability. Lastly, single-neuron recordings confirmed semantic and memorability coding in the medial temporal lobe. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of how visual, semantic, and memorability attributes are dynamically encoded across the brain, highlighting the complex interplay between these attributes that collectively shape object recognition and memory formation.

">The human cerebellum encodes temporally sensitive reinforcement learning signals</a></h4>

              
                In addition to supervised motor learning, the cerebellum also supports nonmotor forms of learning, including reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies in animal models have identified core RL signals related to reward processing, reward prediction, and prediction errors in specific regions in cerebellar cortex. However, the computational constraints on these signals remain poorly understood, particularly in humans. Here, we investigated cerebellar RL signals in a computationally-driven fMRI study. Human participants performed an RL task with no low-level sensorimotor contingencies. We observed robust RL signals related to reward processing and reward prediction errors in cognitive regions of the cerebellum (Crus I and II). These signals were not explained by oculomotor or physiological confounds. By manipulating the delay between choices and reward outcomes, we discovered that cerebellar RL signals are temporally sensitive, becoming undetectable at supra-second feedback delays. Similar delay effects were not found in other areas implicated in reward processing, including the ventral striatum and hippocampus. Connectivity analyses revealed that during RL feedback, cognitive areas of the cerebellum coactivate with a network that includes the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus. Together, these results highlight a temporally constrained contribution of the human cerebellum to a cognitive learning task.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 80% of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) have autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor, and clinical characteristics may vary between early-onset (symptom onset age &lt;50 years) and late-onset MG (EOMG and LOMG), but the pathophysiological differences between EOMG and LOMG are not well established.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an exploratory in-depth proteomics analysis examining 768 inflammatory proteins utilizing the baseline serum samples from the BeatMG study (NCT02110706). We performed pathway enrichment analysis to assess the pathways involved in LOMG. A total of 15 selected proteins from the initial analysis were further examined using the UK Biobank and further quantified in a separate validation cohort.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 21 patients with EOMG (age 38.3 ± 12.1 years, 16 women [76.2%]) and 28 patients with LOMG (age 67.3 ± 8.6 years, 7 women [25%]) from the BeatMG study were included in the exploratory analysis. Several proteins involved in the regulation of leukocyte differentiation and myeloid leukocyte differentiation and migration pathways were more abundant in the LOMG group. Among them, 7 were significantly different in the UK Biobank cohort. A total of 80 participants (39 MG patients (age 54.33 ± 18.9 years, 17 women [43.6%]) and 41 healthy controls (age 49.56 ± 17.06 years, 21 women [66.1%]) were included in the validation cohort, and IL18R1, CXCL17, and CCL11 were validated to be specific for LOMG.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Growing evidence supports that LOMG has a distinct immune pathomechanism. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm the utility of these proteins as biomarkers of LOMG, and the feasibility of using them for more precise therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.

">TBK1 activity regulates the directionality of axonal transport of signalling endosomes</a></h4>

              
                The polarised and complex morphology of neurons pose massive challenges for efficient cargo delivery between the axon and soma, a process termed axonal transport. We have previously shown that the retrograde axonal transport of pro-survival, neurotrophic signalling endosomes relies on Rab7 in motor neurons, and that their trafficking is impaired in the early stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. Here, we report the effect of Rab7 phosphorylation on the transport of these signalling endosomes. We show that the ALS-linked kinase TBK1 phosphorylates Rab7 at S72 in neurons, altering its binding to cytoplasmic dynein adaptors. Accordingly, both TBK1 knockdown and the expression of a loss-of-function Rab7 mutant (S72E) induce aberrant bidirectional movement of signalling endosomes without modifying neuronal polarity or endosomal sorting. This alteration is specific for signalling endosomes, as axonal transport of lysosomes and mitochondria remain unaffected. We have therefore discovered a new TBK1 function that ensures the unidirectional transport of signalling endosomes, suggesting that reduced TBK1 activity determines retrograde transport dysfunctions and long-range signalling impairments.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hummingbirds (family <i>Trochilidae</i>) are easily recognized due to their unique ability to hover. Critical to hovering flight is head and body stabilization. In birds, stabilization during flight is mediated, among other things, by the detection of optic flow, the motion that occurs across the entire retina during self-motion. Given this increased requirement for stabilization, it is not surprising that previous studies have shown that hummingbirds have neural specializations in the visual pathways involved in the detection of optic flow. Particularly, previous studies have found some structural and functional differences in the hummingbird brain, in the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM): compared to other avian species, LM shows a massive hypertrophy, and LM neurons have unique response properties to optic flow stimuli. Here, we used intraocular injections of a neural tracer, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated with a fluorescent molecule, to study the retinal projections in Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) and compare them to those of a similarly sized non-hovering species, the zebra finch (<i>Taeniopygia castanotis</i>). Retinal targets in both birds were similar and correspond closely to those reported in other birds from a variety of avian clades. Importantly, we found differences in the projections to LM between hummingbirds and zebra finches. Consistent with previous reports of specialization of LM, it was more intensely labelled compared to other retinal-recipient nuclei in hummingbirds. Moreover, this increase in intensity was most apparent in the lateral subnucleus. This study reinforces previous evidence that the LM of hummingbirds is adapted to sustain the unique flight abilities of this clade.</p>

                <p>by Shuze Liu, Samuel Joseph Gershman</p>

Real-world decision-making often involves navigating large action spaces with state-dependent action values, taxing the limited cognitive resources at our disposal. While previous studies have explored cognitive constraints on generating action consideration sets or refining state-action mappings (policy complexity), their interplay remains underexplored. In this work, we present a resource-rational framework for policy compression that integrates both constraints, offering a unified perspective on decision-making under cognitive limitations. Through simulations, we characterize the suboptimality arising from reduced action consideration sets and reveal the complex interaction between policy complexity and action consideration set size in mitigating this suboptimality. We then use such normative insight to explain empirically observed phenomena in option generation, including the preferential sampling of generally valuable options and increased correlation in responses across contexts under cognitive load. We further validate the framework’s predictions through a contextual multi-armed bandit experiment, showing how humans flexibly adapt their action consideration sets and policy complexity to maintain near-optimality in a task-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for fine-grained resource constraints in understanding human cognition, and highlights the presence of adaptive metacognitive strategies even in simple tasks.

                <p>by Dongju Lim, Kyeong Tae Ko, Hyukpyo Hong, Hyojung Lee, Boseung Choi, Won Chang, Sunhwa Choi, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting complex dynamical systems, ranging from gene regulatory networks to population-level dynamics. However, model predictions are highly sensitive to initial conditions, which are often unknown. In infectious disease models, for instance, the initial number of exposed individuals (E) at the time the model simulation starts is frequently unknown. This initial condition has often been estimated using an unrealistic, history-independent assumption for simplicity: the chance that an exposed individual becomes infectious is the same regardless of the timing of their exposure (i.e., exposure history). Here, we show that this history-independent method can yield serious bias in the estimation of the initial condition. To address this, we developed a <i>history-dependent</i> initial condition estimation method derived from a master equation expressing the time-varying likelihood of becoming infectious during a latent period. Our method consistently outperformed the history-independent method across various scenarios, including those with measurement errors and abrupt shifts in epidemics, for example, due to vaccination. In particular, our method reduced estimation error by 55% compared to the previous method in real-world COVID-19 data from Seoul, Republic of Korea, which includes likely infection dates, allowing us to obtain the true initial condition. This advancement of initial condition estimation enhances the precision of epidemic modeling, ultimately supporting more effective public health policies. We also provide a user-friendly package, Hist-D, to facilitate the use of this history-dependent initial condition estimation method.

This study addresses the pressing global health burden of mosquito-borne diseases by investigating the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mosquito species identification using wing images. Conventional identification methods are hampered by the need for significant expertise and resources, while CNNs offer a promising alternative. Our research aimed to develop a reliable and applicable classification system that can be used under real-world conditions, with a focus on improving model adaptability to unencountered devices, mitigating dataset biases, and ensuring usability across different users without standardized protocols. We utilized a large, diverse dataset of mosquito wing images of 21 taxa and three image-capturing devices (N = 14,888) and a preprocessing pipeline to standardize images and remove undesirable image features. The developed CNN models demonstrated high performance, with an average balanced accuracy of 98.3% and a macro F1-score of 97.6%, effectively distinguishing between the 21 mosquito taxa, including morphologically similar pairs. The preprocessing pipeline improved the model’s robustness, reducing performance drops on unfamiliar devices effectively. However, the study also highlights the persistence of inherent dataset biases, which the preprocessing steps could only partially mitigate. The classification system’s practical usability was demonstrated through a feasibility study, showing high inter-rater reliability. The results underscore the potential of the proposed workflow to enhance vector surveillance, especially in resource-constrained settings, and suggest its applicability to other winged insect species. The classification system developed in this study is available for public use, providing a valuable tool for vector surveillance and research, supporting efforts to mitigate the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.

Drug-induced liver injury is a leading cause of high attrition rates for both candidate drugs and marketed medications. Previous in silico models may not effectively utilize biological drug property information and often lack robust model validation. In this study, we developed a graph convolutional network embedded with a biological graph learning (BioGL) module—named BioGL-GCN(Biological Graph Learning-Graph Convolutional Network)—for drug-induced liver injury prediction using toxicogenomic profiles. The BioGL module learned the optimal graph representations of gene interactions by utilizing the constructed protein-protein interaction network, which represents initial gene relationships, and gene frequency information obtained from gene enrichment analysis. Finally, the graph convolutional network was used to identify drug hepatotoxicity. Our method pays more attention to gene-gene relationships compared to previous approaches, thereby achieving more accurate predictive performance. We applied BioGL-GCN to predict DILI risk for active components in the integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) database and validated these predictions through hepatotoxicity experiments using a 3D primary human hepatocyte (PHH) model. The results showed that our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 79%, thus further validating the reliability of the constructed model.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013392">Generating correlated data for omics simulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jianing Yang, Gregory R. Grant, Thomas G. Brooks</p>

Simulation of realistic omics data is a key input for benchmarking studies that help users obtain optimal computational pipelines. Omics data involves large numbers of measured features on each sample and these measures are generally correlated with each other. However, simulation too often ignores these correlations, perhaps due to computational and statistical hurdles of doing so. To alleviate this, we describe three approaches for generating omics-scale data with correlated measures which mimic real datasets. These approaches are all based on a Gaussian copula approach with a covariance matrix that decomposes into a diagonal part and a low-rank part. This decomposition allows for extremely efficient simulation, overcoming a hurdle for adoption of past methods. We use these approaches to demonstrate the importance of including correlation in two benchmarking applications. First, we show that variance of results from the popular DESeq2 method increases when dependence is included. Second, we demonstrate that CYCLOPS, a method for inferring circadian time of collection from transcriptomics, improves in performance when given gene-gene dependencies in some circumstances. We provide an R package, dependentsimr, that has efficient implementations of these methods and can generate dependent data with arbitrary marginal distributions, including discrete (binary, ordered categorical, Poisson, negative binomial), continuous (normal), or with an empirical distribution.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013271">The detection of algebraic auditory structures emerges with self-supervised learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pierre Orhan, Yves Boubenec, Jean-Rémi King</p>

Humans can spontaneously detect complex algebraic structures. Historically, two opposing views explain this ability, at the root of language and music acquisition. Some argue for the existence of an innate and specific mechanism. Others argue that this ability emerges from experience: i.e. when generic learning principles continuously process sensory inputs. These two views, however, remain difficult to test experimentally. Here, we use deep learning models to evaluate the factors that lead to the spontaneous detection of algebraic structures in the auditory modality. Specifically, we use self-supervised learning to train multiple deep-learning models with a variable amount of either natural (environmental sounds) and/or cultural sounds (speech or music) to evaluate the impact of these stimuli. We then expose these models to the experimental paradigms classically used to evaluate the processing of algebraic structures. Like humans, these models spontaneously detect repeated sequences, probabilistic chunks, and complex algebraic structures. Also like humans, this ability diminishes with structure complexity. Importantly, this ability can emerge from experience alone: the more the models are exposed to natural sounds, the more they spontaneously detect increasingly complex structures. Finally, this ability does not emerge in models pretrained only on speech, and emerges more rapidly in models pretrained with music than environmental sounds. Overall, our study provides an operational framework to clarify sufficient built-in and acquired principles that model human’s advanced capacity to detect algebraic structures in sounds.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003337">Developmental auditory deprivation in one ear impairs brainstem binaural processing and reduces spatial hearing acuity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kelsey L. Anbuhl, Alexander T. Ferber, Andrew D. Brown, Victor Benichoux, Nathaniel T. Greene, Daniel J. Tollin</p>

Early sensory experience can exert lasting perceptual consequences. For example, a brief period of auditory deprivation early in life can lead to persistent spatial hearing deficits. Some forms of hearing loss (i.e., conductive; CHL) can distort acoustical cues needed for spatial hearing, which depend on inputs from both ears. We hypothesize that asymmetric acoustic input during development disrupts auditory circuits that integrate binaural information. Here, we identify prolonged maturation of the binaural auditory brainstem in the guinea pig by tracking auditory evoked potentials across development. Using this age range, we induce a reversible unilateral CHL and ask whether behavioral and neural maturation are disrupted. We find that developmental CHL is associated with alterations in a brainstem readout of binaural function, an effect that was not observed in a separate cohort with adult-onset CHL. Startle-based behavioral measures suggest that Early CHL animals exhibit reduced spatial resolution for high-frequency sound sources. Finally, single-unit recordings of auditory midbrain neurons reveal significantly poorer neural acuity to a sound location cue that largely depends on high-frequency sounds. Thus, these findings show that unilateral deprivation can disrupt developing auditory circuits that integrate binaural information and may give rise to lingering spatial hearing deficits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97870">The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex pangenome is small and shaped by sub-lineage-specific regions of difference</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTBC) is a group of bacteria causing tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals. Understanding MTBC genetic diversity is crucial for insights into its adaptation and traits related to survival, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. While it is known that within-MTBC diversity is characterised by large deletions found only in certain lineages (regions of difference [RDs]), a comprehensive pangenomic analysis incorporating both coding and non-coding regions remains unexplored. We utilised a curated dataset representing various MTBC genomes, including under-represented lineages, to quantify the full diversity of the MTBC pangenome. The MTBC was found to have a small, closed pangenome with distinct genomic features and RDs both between lineages (as previously known) and between sub-lineages. The accessory genome was identified to be a product of genome reduction, showing both divergent and convergent deletions. This variation has implications for traits like virulence, drug resistance, and metabolism. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the MTBC pangenome, highlighting the importance of genome reduction in its evolution, and underlines the significance of genomic variations in determining the pathogenic traits of different MTBC lineages.

                <p>The causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and white matter injury and communication remains unclear. We aimed to scrutinize the plausible causal impact of GM on white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), white matter microstructure, white matter connectivity, and multiple neurological diseases via Mendelian randomization study. We identified four WMH-related bacterial taxa, including class <I>Melainabacteria</I>, order <I>Gastranaerophilales</I>, family <I>Alcaligenaceae</I>, and genus <I>Ruminiclostridium 6</I>. In addition, three bacterial taxa were discovered that have consistent effect on multiple aspects of white matter microstructure. Furthermore, we found 12 strong associations between genetic liability in GM and white matter connectivity. Among these bacterial taxa, the family <I>Clostridiaceae 1</I> demonstrated a protective effect against ischemic stroke (IS). The genus <I>Barnesiella</I> showed protective effect on IS and small vessel stroke while posed a risk effect on neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), as well as on aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD). The order <I>Desulfovibrionales</I> and family <I>Desulfovibrionaceae</I> showed protective effect against cardioembolic stroke, and the genus <I>Ruminococcus gnavus group</I> showed a protective effect on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In terms of the mapped genes of statistically significant bacterial taxa, genes such as <I>CPNE1</I>, <I>PIGU</I>, <I>MED22</I>, <I>SURF6</I>, <I>DOCK10</I>, and <I>COPS3</I> exhibited a significant causal correlation with the corresponding white matter connectivity. This study demonstrated a genetically predicted causal relationship between GM and WMH, white matter microstructure, white matter connectivity, and multiple neurological diseases, based on GWAS data from mixed-sex cohorts without sex-stratified summary statistics. These findings highlight the potential role of GM in influencing brain structural integrity.</p>

                <p>by Giuseppe Agapito, Mario Cannataro, Pietro Cinaglia, Marianna Milano</p>

Network alignment (NA) is a computational methodology employed to compare biological networks across different species or conditions. By identifying conserved structures, functions, and interactions, NA provides invaluable insights into shared biological processes, evolutionary relationships, and system-level behaviors. This manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of NA methodologies, including the importance of preprocessing network data, selecting suitable input formats, and understanding diverse network types such as attributed, temporal, and multilayer networks. Additionally, it explores key challenges such as seed nodes selection, algorithm configuration, and cross-species alignment, emphasizing the necessity of integrating functional annotations, sequence similarity, and network topology for biologically meaningful results. Various NA strategies, including Local and Global Network Alignment, are discussed alongside their respective advantages and limitations. Practical recommendations for effectively documenting and visualizing NA experiments are also provided, ensuring reproducibility and clarity in research. By leveraging diverse alignment tools and adopting best practices, researchers can unlock the potential of NA to advance our understanding of complex biological systems.

                <p>by Arthur L. Caplan</p>

Recent efforts by a private company to modify modern species with ancient DNA in the name of ‘de-extinction’ are both scientifically and morally suspect. A bright line requiring more than press releases as well as independent ethical oversight must be drawn before they are extended to distant human and hominid ancestors.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003356">Recent extinctions of plant and animal genera are rare, localized, and decelerated</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John J. Wiens, Kristen E. Saban</p>

An important aspect of the current extinction crisis is the loss of distinct clades (e.g., genera). A recent study suggested that there is rapidly accelerating extinction of genera (and other higher taxa), indicating a current mass extinction event that endangers human survival. However, that study was based only on land vertebrates, which include only about half of vertebrates and <2% of living species. Here, we examine the recent extinction (last 500 years) of higher taxa across living organisms. We find that 102 genera have gone extinct (90 animals, 12 plants), along with 10 families and two orders. Yet, the majority of these genus-level extinctions were among mammals and birds, as were all extinctions of families and orders. There were very few extinctions among the thousands of genera of ray-finned fishes (<i>n</i> = 4; 0.08%), squamate reptiles (<i>n</i> = 2; 0.17%), and amphibians (<i>n</i> = 1; 0.18%). Documented extinctions were also rare among the thousands of assessed genera of arthropods (<i>n</i> = 11; 0.32%) and plants (<i>n</i> = 12; 0.17%), which together encompass most known species. Most extinct genera were monotypic (~80%), and most were island endemics (76%). Moreover, despite the claim that extinctions of higher taxa are rapidly accelerating, the highest rates of genus-level extinctions occurred more than 100 years ago, and have declined subsequently. Overall, the recent extinctions of higher taxa are not as dire as previously suggested.

                <p>by Yutong Song, Tianmu Zhang, Tae Hoon Ryu, Kyle Wong, Zekun Wu, Yanan Wei, Justine Schweizer, Khoi-Nguyen Ha Nguyen, Alex Kwan, Xiaoli Zhang, Kweon Yu, Woo Jae Kim</p>

Neuropeptide SIFamide (SIFa) neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> have been characterized by their exceptionally elaborate arborization patterns, which extend from the brain into the ventral nerve cord (VNC). SIFa neurons are equipped to receive signals that integrate both internal physiological cues and external environmental stimuli. These signals enable the neurons to regulate energy balance, sleep patterns, metabolic status, and circadian timing. These peptidergic neurons are instrumental in orchestrating the animal’s internal states and refining its behavioral responses, yet the precise molecular underpinnings of this process remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that SIFa neurons coordinate a range of behavioral responses by selectively integrating inputs and outputs in a context-dependent manner. These neurons engage in a feedback loop with sNPF neurons in the VNC, modifying behaviors such as longer mating duration (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD). Additionally, SIFa neurons interact with dopamine and glutamate to differentially regulate sleep and mating duration. Activating SIFa neurons leads to reduced mating duration and increased food intake, while deactivating them reduces food intake. Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of SIFa neurons in absorbing inputs and turning them into behavioral outputs, shedding light on animal’s intricate behavioral orchestration.

                <p>by Tianmu Zhang, Zekun Wu, Yutong Song, Tae Hoon Ryu, Xiaoli Zhang, Wenjing Li, Yanying Sun, Kyle Wong, Justine Schweizer, Khoi-Nguyen Ha Nguyen, Alex Kwan, Kweon Yu, Woo Jae Kim</p>

Neuropeptides play crucial roles in regulating context-dependent behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We investigate the role of the neuropeptide SIFa and its receptor SIFaR in regulating two distinct mating duration behaviors in male <i>Drosophila</i>: Longer-Mating-Duration (LMD) and Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD). We found that SIFaR expression in specific neurons is required for both LMD and SMD behaviors. Social context and sexual experience lead to synaptic reorganization between SIFa and SIFaR neurons, altering internal states of brain. We revealed that the SIFa-SIFaR/Crz-CrzR neuropeptide relay pathway is essential for generating distinct interval timing behaviors, with Crz neurons being responsive to the activity of SIFa neurons. Additionally, CrzR expression in glial cell population is critical for regulating LMD behavior. Our study provides insights into how neuropeptides and their receptors modulate context-dependent behaviors through synaptic plasticity and calcium signaling, with implications for understanding the neural circuitry underlying interval timing and neuropeptidergic system modulation of behavioral adaptations.

                <p>by Stephen Thomas, Ayatollah S. El-Zayat, James Gurney, Jennifer Rattray, Sam P. Brown</p>

Bacterial quorum sensing is often mediated by multiple signaling systems that interact with each other. The quorum-sensing systems of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> for example, are considered hierarchical, with the <i>las</i> system acting as a master regulator. By experimentally controlling the concentration of auto-inducer signals in a signal deficient strain (PAO1Δ<i>lasI</i>Δ<i>rhlI</i>), we show that the two primary quorum-sensing systems—<i>las</i> and <i>rhl</i>—act reciprocally rather than hierarchically. Just as the <i>las</i> system’s 3‑oxo‑C<sub>12</sub>‑HSL can induce increased expression of <i>rhlI,</i> the <i>rhl</i> system’s C<sub>4</sub>‑HSL increases the expression level of <i>lasI.</i> We develop a mathematical model to quantify relationships both within and between the <i>las</i> and <i>rhl</i> quorum-sensing systems and the downstream genes they influence. The results show that not only do the systems interact in a reciprocal manner, but they do so asymmetrically, cooperatively, and nonlinearly, with the combination of C<sub>4</sub>‑HSL and 3‑oxo‑C<sub>12</sub>‑HSL increasing expression level far more than the sum of their individual effects. We next extend our parameterized mathematical model to generate quantitative predictions on how a QS-controlled effector gene (<i>lasB</i>) responds to changes in wildtype bacterial stationary phase density and find close quantitative agreement with an independent dataset. Finally, we use our parameterized model to assess how changes in multi-signal interactions modulate functional responses to variation in social (population density) and physical (mass transfer) environment and demonstrate that a reciprocal architecture is more responsive to density and more robust to mass transfer than a strict hierarchy.

                Harbers et al. demonstrate that female marmosets carrying heterozygous FMR1 mutations exhibit phenotypes resembling those of patients with fragile X syndrome, establishing a non-human primate model for the disorder. This distinct model provides a valuable resource for studying pathophysiology and evaluating therapeutic strategies.

                IgM emerged in jawed vertebrates 500 Mya and remains the most evolutionarily conserved antibody class. However, despite extensive studies on IgM as an ancient antiviral weapon in warm-blooded vertebrates, its role and mechanisms in combating viral infections in early vertebrates remain poorly understood. Here, significant virus-specific sIgM titers are generated in the serum and gut mucus of a teleost fish (largemouth bass) that survive infection, and fish lacking sIgM were more susceptible to viral infection. These results challenge the paradigm that IgM and IgT are specialized to systemic and mucosal immunity, respectively. More crucially, the neutralization assay provides further insight into the role of sIgM in viral neutralization and clarifies the mechanism through which teleost sIgM blocks viral infection by directly targeting viral particles. From an evolutionary perspective, sIgM in both primitive and modern vertebrates follows conserved principles in the development of specialized antiviral immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97514">Spatial integration of sensory input and motor output in Pseudomonas aeruginosa chemotaxis through colocalized distribution</a></h4>

              
                The opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> serves as a model organism for studying multiple signal transduction pathways. The chemoreceptor cluster, a core component of the chemotaxis pathway, is assembled from hundreds of proteins. The unipolar distribution of receptor clusters has long been recognized, yet the precise mechanism governing their assembly remains elusive. Here, we directly observed the relative positions of the flagellar motor and chemoreceptor cluster using flagellar filament labeling and gene editing techniques. Surprisingly, we found that both are located at the same cell pole, with the distribution pattern controlled by the polar anchor protein FlhF. Additionally, the efficient assembly of the chemoreceptor cluster is partially dependent on the integrity of the motor structure. Furthermore, we discovered that overexpression of the chemotaxis regulatory protein CheY leads to high intracellular levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP, triggering cell aggregation. Therefore, the colocalization of the chemoreceptor cluster and flagellum in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> serves to avoid cross-pathway signaling interference, enabling cells to conduct various physiological activities in an orderly manner.

                Human and murine studies reveal that innate immune cells are able to mount enhanced responses to pathogens after primary inflammatory exposure. Innate immune memory has been shown to last for months to years, longer than the lifespan of most innate immune cells. Indeed, long-lived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) serve as a cellular reservoir for innate immune memory. In this review, we summarize the evidence that innate immune memory is epigenetically encoded in HSPCs, and we consider whether HSPC subpopulations with differentiation bias, cell autonomous epigenetic reprogramming, or both features underlie the phenomenon of central trained immunity. We further profile the significant implications of central trained immunity in stem cell transplant, aging, inflammatory diseases, and vaccination strategies for the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89125">Meaning-making behavior in a small-brained hominin, Homo naledi, from the late Pleistocene: contexts and evolutionary implications</a></h4>

              
                Explorations in the Dinaledi Subsystem of the Rising Star cave system have yielded some of the earliest evidence of a mortuary practice in hominins. Because the evidence is attributable to the small-brained <i>Homo naledi</i>, these analyses call into question several assumptions about behavioral and cognitive evolution in Pleistocene hominins. The evidence from the Dinaledi Subsystem, and at other locations across the Rising Star cave system may widen the phylogenetic breadth of mortuary, and possibly funerary, behaviors. These discoveries may also associate the creation of meaning-making and increased behavioral complexity with a small-brained hominin species, challenging certain assertions about the role of encephalization and cognition in hominin and human evolution. We suggest that the hominin socio-cognitive niche is more diverse than previously thought. If true, technological, meaning-making activities, and cognitive advances in human evolution are not associated solely with the evolution of larger-brained members of the genus <i>Homo</i>.Evidence for complex behaviors associated with a small-brained hominin suggests that large brains are not solely responsible for the manifestation of human-like behavioral complexity.

                <p>Visual perception is characterized by known asymmetries in the visual field; human&rsquo;s visual sensitivity is higher along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries decrease with decreasing eccentricity from the periphery to the center of gaze, suggesting that they may be absent in the <f></f> foveola, the retinal region used to explore scenes at high-resolution. Using high-precision eyetracking and gaze contingent display, allowing for accurate control over the stimulated foveolar location despite the continuous eye motion at fixation, we investigated fine visual discrimination at different isoeccentric locations across the foveola and parafovea in 12 human observers (both sexes). Although the tested foveolar locations were only <f></f> away from the center of gaze, we show that, similar to more eccentric locations, humans are more sensitive to stimuli presented along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Whereas the magnitude of this asymmetry is reduced in the foveola, the magnitude of the vertical meridian asymmetry is comparable but, interestingly, the asymmetry is reversed: stimuli presented slightly above the center of gaze are more easily discerned than when presented at the same eccentricity below the center of gaze. Therefore, far from being uniform, as often assumed, foveolar vision is characterized by perceptual asymmetries. Further, these asymmetries differ not only in magnitude but also in direction compared to those present just ~<f></f> away from the center of gaze, resulting in overall different foveal and extrafoveal perceptual fields.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal CA3 region is thought to play crucial roles in episodic memory functions because of the extensive recurrent connections between CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3PCs). However, different methods provided contradicting observations about the synaptic connectivity between CA3PCs. Therefore, we estimated the connectivity rate between individual CA3PCs using a new approach that is not affected by the confounds of conventional methods. Specifically, we used voltage imaging with the Voltron sensor in acute slices from rats of either sex to test CA3PC connections by detecting spontaneous spiking and subthreshold responses in anatomically identified neurons. We detected 164 monosynaptic excitatory connections in 3,078 tested CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC pairs. This 5.3% connectivity rate was much higher than that we observed with the theoretically more sensitive patch-clamp method in similar experimental conditions, but it remained below the anatomically observed number of CA3PC&ndash;CA3PC contacts. We verified that the imaged excitatory connections were mediated by AMPA receptors. Our results also showed that the recurrent connections did not enrich into preferred connectivity motifs and followed a distribution that was consistent with random connectivity in general. Moreover, voltage imaging revealed CA3PCs with distinct firing properties and somatic locations corresponding to previously established heterogeneity and showed that specific connectivity rules create preferred information routes among these subpopulations. Finally, we showed that there is at least one condition, influencing patch-clamp recordings but not voltage imaging, that affects the observable functional connections between CA3PCs. Altogether, our results obtained with a new voltage imaging approach argue for high local connectivity rates between CA3PCs.</p>

                <p>Cerebellum (CB) interactions with forebrain systems contribute to learning cognitive and motor tasks, but the nature of these interactions is unknown. Trace eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an excellent associative learning paradigm for examining interactions between forebrain systems and CB. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (AM), and CB are essential for trace EBC, and we previously recorded changes in neuronal activity in these areas during learning with paired presentations of the conditional stimulus (CS) and unconditional stimulus (US). We attributed changes in activity to learning CS&ndash;US contingency but did not report contingency manipulations. Here, we analyzed data from the same rats of both sexes during sessions with transitions from CS&ndash;US (paired) trials to CS-alone (extinction) trials and from CS-alone trials to CS&ndash;US trials. All three areas showed changes in activity with changes in contingency, during both stimuli and the intertrial interval (ITI). Subsets of ACC, AM, and CB neurons showed higher activity during paired trials, while others showed higher activity during extinction trials both during trial events and ITI. Within- and between-area neuronal synchrony and machine learning predictions of behavior from neuronal activity decreased during extinction trials relative to paired trials, indicating widespread effects of contingency change on the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network. The findings suggest that the ACC&ndash;AM&ndash;CB network encodes both within-trial stimulus contingency and between-trial task context. The transition from paired to extinction trials may decrease mossy fiber input consistency to CB from ACC and AM and decrease the likelihood of CRs.</p>

                <p>Autism is characterized by two key diagnostic criteria including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the underlying neural circuit dysfunction that accounts for these coexisting symptoms in autism remains poorly understood. Here we revealed that prenatal valproate exposure induced functional alterations of dopaminergic projections from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) to dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Specifically, we observed enhanced excitatory input and increased excitability in SNc-&gt;DMS dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in a basal state of potentiation. This potentiated baseline activity blunted the phasic responses of SNc-&gt;DMS projections, as evidenced by reduction of transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DA signaling during social interaction and expression of repetitive behaviors in valproate-exposed male mice. We then utilized chronic chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches to selectively manipulate the abnormal basal activity of SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling. This targeted intervention successfully rectified the dysfunction in D1R-expressed medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) associated with social deficits, while simultaneously restoring the functionality of D2-MSNs linked to repetitive behaviors. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that prenatal valproate exposure disrupts SNc-&gt;DMS dopaminergic signaling, which mediates the coexistence of two core autism-like behaviors by reshaping the dynamics of direct and indirect pathway MSNs. Moreover, these results highlight potential therapeutic targets for developing interventions for both core symptoms of autism.</p>

                <p>GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs) are an important building block in neural activity. Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>

                <p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/36/e2119242025?rss=1">Uncovering the Role of the Human Hippocampus in Procedural Motor Learning: Insights from Implicit Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent evidence suggests that the human hippocampus, traditionally associated with declarative memory, plays a role in motor sequence learning (MSL). However, the classic MSL paradigm depends initially on declarative learning. Thus, it is critical to discern whether the participation of the hippocampus relates to its canonical role or to processing a general aspect of learning that transcends the declarative/non-declarative distinction. To address this issue, here we turned to visuomotor adaptation (VMA)&mdash;a type of motor learning involving skill recalibration&mdash;which unlike MSL can be easily manipulated to eliminate the explicit component. We examined the broader involvement of the hippocampus in procedural motor learning by using diffusion MRI in a sample of males and females to assess structural plasticity associated with memory consolidation in VMA and an implicit-only version (IVMA). We found that both VMA and IVMA engaged the left posterior hippocampus in a learning-specific manner. Remarkably, while VMA induced only transient hippocampal alterations, IVMA elicited structural changes that persisted overnight, underscoring the reliance on implicit learning for enduring neuroplasticity. As expected, training on both tasks impacted the microstructure of the cerebellum and the motor and posterior parietal cortex. Notably, the temporal dynamics of changes in these regions paralleled those of the left hippocampus, suggesting that motor and limbic regions operate together as part of the same network. Collectively, our findings support an active role of the hippocampus in implicit motor learning and argue for a unified function in memory encoding regardless of the declarative or non-declarative nature of the task.</p>

                <p>The insular cortex is involved in a wide range of auditory functions in the mammalian brain. We studied the organization and basic response properties of auditory neurons in the insular cortex and adjacent areas by recording responses to sound stimuli in anesthetized female rats. Auditory neurons were present in an insulo-parietal auditory field that spans the boundary between the posterior insula, particularly in the granular insular cortex, and the ventral part of the adjacent nonprimary somatosensory fields. Confirming previous reports, neurons in this field had narrow tuning and were preferentially tuned to relatively low frequencies (&lt;16&nbsp;kHz). Intriguingly, auditory units in this field displayed shorter minimal latencies than units in the primary auditory cortex, as well as weaker sensitivity to deviance. These results establish the existence of a rapid auditory information stream with distinct properties through the insulo-parietal cortex that may parallel the pathway through the primary and anterior auditory fields.</p>

                <p>Prosocial behaviors are crucial for maintaining primates' complex social relationships. As central regions involved in social decision-making, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) processes social salience and value, while the gyrus of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACCg) integrates social information to guide decision-making. Oxytocin, a key modulator of social behavior, can influence both prosocial behavior and neural activity in these regions, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated oxytocin's effects on prosocial behavior and neural activity by infusing oxytocin or saline into the BLA (Oxt-BLA, Sal-BLA) and examining the effects of Oxt-BLA on prosocial decisions, BLA and ACCg neural activity, and the coordination between the two regions in male rhesus macaques. We found that Oxt-BLA's behavioral effects were state-dependent: during high prosocial states, it sustained prosocial choices and task engagement, counteracting the natural decline seen in the control condition. However, during low prosocial states, Oxt-BLA had minimal behavioral effects. At the neural level, Oxt-BLA enhanced BLA and ACCg activity for prosocial choices only during high prosocial states. Importantly, Oxt-BLA maintained stable BLA&ndash;ACCg coordination during high prosocial states, preventing the decline in communication observed in control conditions. These findings demonstrate that oxytocin's ability to sustain prosocial behavior depends on social motivational state. These results support that oxytocin processing in the BLA acts as a state-dependent neuromodulator that enhances BLA and ACCg neural responses and maintains BLA&ndash;ACCg communication to guide prosocial decisions.</p>
