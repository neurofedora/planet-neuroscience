              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A unified framework for measuring selection on cellular lineages and traits</a></h4>

              
                Intracellular states probed by gene expression profiles and metabolic activities are intrinsically noisy, causing phenotypic variations among cellular lineages. Understanding the adaptive and evolutionary roles of such variations requires clarifying their linkage to population growth rates. Extending a cell lineage statistics framework, here we show that a population’s growth rate can be expanded by the cumulants of a fitness landscape that characterize how fitness distributes in a population. The expansion enables quantifying the contribution of each cumulant, such as variance and skewness, to population growth. We introduce a function that contains all the essential information of cell lineage statistics, including mean lineage fitness and selection strength. We reveal a relation between fitness heterogeneity and population growth rate response to perturbation. We apply the framework to experimental cell lineage data from bacteria to mammalian cells, revealing distinct levels of growth rate gain from fitness heterogeneity across environments and organisms. Furthermore, third or higher order cumulants’ contributions are negligible under constant growth conditions but could be significant in regrowing processes from growth-arrested conditions. We identify cellular populations in which selection leads to an increase of fitness variance among lineages in retrospective statistics compared to chronological statistics. The framework assumes no particular growth models or environmental conditions, and is thus applicable to various biological phenomena for which phenotypic heterogeneity and cellular proliferation are important.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The clinical pharmacology of tafenoquine in the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria: an individual patient data meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Tafenoquine is a newly licensed antimalarial drug for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. The mechanism of action and optimal dosing are uncertain. We pooled individual data from 1,102 patients and 72 healthy volunteers studied in the pre-registration trials. We show that tafenoquine dose is the primary determinant of efficacy. Under an Emax model, we estimate the currently recommended 300mg dose in a 60kg adult (5mg/kg) results in 70% of the maximal obtainable hypnozoiticidal effect. Increasing the dose to 7.5mg/kg (i.e. 450mg) would result in 90% reduction in the risk of P. vivax recurrence. After adjustment for dose, the tafenoquine terminal elimination half-life, and day 7 methaemoglobin concentration, but not the parent compound exposure, were also associated with recurrence. These results suggest that the production of oxidative metabolites is central to tafenoquine's hypnozoiticidal efficacy. Clinical trials of higher tafenoquine doses are needed to characterise their efficacy, safety and tolerability.

	<p>Background: The severity of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in patients with acute lacunar stroke (ALS) may be not completely parallel to cognitive impairment. Controversies persist about the effects of WMH on cognitive dysfunction. It is vital to explore whether the association may be affected by certain factors and whether a subsequent subgroup analysis is necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between WMH and cognitive impairment in acute lacunar stroke patients and the possible causal factors. Methods: We continuously enrolled patients with ALS who were hospitalized at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between October 2017 and June 2022. The cognitive function of all patients was assessed by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale 14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2 days after the onset of AIS, and the results were adjusted to the education level. The MoCA scale was reevaluated at the 6-month (day 182 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7) follow-up by outpatient visit or video. Demographic and clinical data were collected. The manifestations of chronic cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD), including the total Fazekas score and total CSVD burden score, were assessed with an MRI scan. A mismatch refers to an inconsistency between the severity of WMH and cognitive dysfunction. A Type 1 mismatch refers to cognitive impairment with mild WMH (total Fazekas score = 0&amp;amp;ndash;1), and a Type 2 mismatch refers to severe WMH (total Fazekas score = 5&amp;amp;ndash;6) in patients with normal cognitive function. Results: Among 213 enrolled ALS patients, 66 patients (31.0%) had cognitive dysfunction, and 40 patients (18.8%) had mismatches. Twenty-seven cases (12.7%) were Type 1 mismatched, and seventeen cases (8.0%) were Type 2 mismatched. Age, gender, fibrinogen and cerebral infarction history were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment in ALS patients. Imaging features, including moderate to severe WMH, deep WMH and the total CSVD burden score, were also independently associated with cognitive impairment. The patients in the mismatched group were older, had more severe deep WMH and had a higher occurrence of depression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The NIHSS score, depression and microbleeds were significantly different between the Type 1 mismatched group and the matched group (p = 0.018, p = 0.012 and p = 0.047). Patients in the Type 2 mismatched group were male (p = 0.04), had a lower level of fibrinogen (p = 0.005), a lower incidence of CMBs (p = 0.003), a lower total CSVD burden score (p = 0.017), more severe paraventricular WMH (p = 0.035) and milder deep WMH (p = 0.026). Conclusions: Our study examined a homogeneous study cohort of recruited patients with symptomatic ALS. We found heterogeneity between WMH and cognitive function in ALS patients. Despite a similar WMH severity, some baseline clinical features and other conventional CSVD imaging characteristics may account for this heterogeneity phenomenon. Our findings provide data for the early diagnosis and prevention of cognitive impairment in ALS patients and suggest that the severity of WMH is not completely parallel to cognitive impairment. The white matter microstructural injury and remote WMH effects may account for the mismatch phenomenon. More attention should be paid to understanding the underlying mechanisms and finding new imaging markers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Electronic signature and attestation in conveyancing practice: A Malaysian legal perspective [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background  The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about an unprecedented disruption to global business activities. Physical face-to-face activities must be restricted due to movement control order (MCO). The clients are required to sign the documents physically in the presence of the solicitor who must subsequently attest to the signature of the clients. The issue arises whether electronic signature (e-signature) and attestation are permissible under the laws of Malaysia. The aim of this research was to study the legality of e-signature and attestation in conveyancing practice in Malaysia and subsequently to propose recommendations to overcome these issues.   Methods   This is qualitative study and not an empirical study. The data was collected by library-based research from various primary and secondary data sources, including case law in Malaysia, written statutes, publication of journal and article.   Results  The Digital Signatures Act 1997 (DSA) and the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 (ECA) have legalised e-signatures. The DSA is the law that governs the digital signatures in Malaysia. ECA has listed a few documents which are not legally accepted if signed electronically, namely Power of Attorney, the Wills and codicils, the Trusts, and negotiable instruments. However, with regards to the issue of attestation of these documents, there are no clear laws which govern the attestation. The legal issue arises when the lawyers who have attested these documents are liable to be called as witness under the Evidence Act 1950 to testify their signature if these documents are tendered as evidence in any court proceedings.   Conclusion  The laws in Malaysia have provided sufficient provisions for e-signatures but not the issue of attestation via online. Thus, it is suggested that there is a need for unique legal framework for attestation via online in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer in health care quality improvements. A second systematic review. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traditionally, EB-CPGs have been believed to mainly improve the quality and consistency of health care, but this claim must be conclusively proven. We used the Donabedian three-dimensional model (structure, process, and patient outcomes) to assess improvements in the quality of medical care derived from implementing EB-CPGs. This study corresponds to the second systematic review carried out as a series of studies on different clinical issues that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of the EB-CPG for improving the quality of care. Methods: We followed the methods described by the Cochrane Handbook and presented a descriptive analysis because of the high heterogeneity found across the included studies. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and EBSCO Host databases, as well as the grey literature, between 1990 and April 2021. No language restrictions were applied. Only randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were selected. Results: Of the total of 364 interventions included in the eleven RCTs evaluated, 11 (3%) were related to healthcare structure, 51 (14%) to the healthcare delivery process and 302 (83%) to patient outcomes. Regarding the impact of using the EB-CPGs, in 303 interventions (83%), there were no significant differences between the control and experimental groups. In 4 interventions (1%), the result favoured the control and intervention groups in 57 of the interventions (16%). Conclusions: Our study showed that EB-CPGs slightly enhanced the quality of health care in the three dimensions described by Donabedian. Future RCTs should improve their design and methodological rigour by considering the certainty of the evidence supporting the EB-CPGs recommendations. In that context, broader analyses could be performed, having more concise hypotheses for further research. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020205594

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mutation patterns of resistance genes for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in nontuberculous mycobacteria isolates from Kenya [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) treatment constitutes a macrolide-based antibiotic regimen in combination with aminoglycosides for Rapid-Growing mycobacteria (RGM), and rifampicin for Slow-Growing mycobacteria (SGM). Mutations in the anti-NTM drug target regions promote NTM evolution to mutant strains that are insusceptible to NTM drugs leading to treatment failure. We, therefore, described the mutation patterns of anti-NTM drug target genes including rrl, rrs, and rpoB in NTM isolates from Kenya.  Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study that included 122 NTM obtained from the sputum of symptomatic tuberculosis-negative patients in Kenya. All the 122 NTM underwent targeted sequencing of the rrl gene. The 54 RGM were also sequenced for rrs, and the 68 SGM were sequenced for rpoB genes using ABI 3730XL analyzer. The obtained sequences were aligned to their wild-type reference sequences for each gene using Geneious then mutations were identified. Pearson chi-square at 95% confidence interval tested the association of NTM to mutation patterns for each gene. Results: Twenty-eight (23%) of the NTM harbored mutations associated with resistance to at least one of the macrolide-based therapy antibiotics. Twelve (10.4%)  NTM comprising 7(58.3%) of RGM and 5(41.7%) of SGM had mutations in the rrl gene. For ten (83.3%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2058, while for two (16.6%) NTM, mutations were found at position 2059. Six (11.1%) of the 54 RGM exhibited mutations in the aminoglycoside target gene rrs at location 1408. Ten (14.7%) of the 68 SGM harbored mutations in the rpoB gene with 40 percent having mutations at codon 531. Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant level of mutations associated with drug resistance for macrolides, aminoglycosides, and rifampicin in NTM isolated from symptomatic TB negative patients in Kenya.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of open research in improving the standards of evidence synthesis: current challenges and potential solutions in systematic reviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine and are placed at the top of the level-of-evidence pyramid. To date, there are several methodological resources available from international organizations such as the Cochrane Collaboration that aim to aid researchers in conducting high-quality secondary research and promoting reproducibility, transparency and scientific rigour. Nevertheless, researchers still face challenges in most stages of evidence synthesis. Open research and the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles are rising initiatives being increasingly implemented in primary research. However, their beneficial role in secondary research is less emphasized. This article addresses how the challenges commonly faced during evidence synthesis research could be overcome using open research practices and currently available open research tools. Despite the phenomenally simple SR workflow, researchers still find tasks such as framing the SR research question, search strategy development, data extraction, and assessing for bias, challenging. The implementation of FAIR practices, including prospective registration at the PROSPERO database, abiding with the PRISMA guidelines, and making all SR data openly available could have significant benefits in avoiding duplication of effort and reducing research waste while improving the reporting standards of SRs. Additionally, this article highlights the need for further education in open research culture to overcome ethical and motivational barriers in implementing open research practices in evidence synthesis. Finally, in the era of technological breakthroughs, artificial intelligence may eventually be incorporated into the process of SRs and should abide by the FAIR standards for open research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Remeshing flexible membranes under the control of free energy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xinxin Wang, Gaudenz Danuser</p>

Cell membranes are flexible and often undergo large-scale morphological changes during processes like mitosis, protrusion and retraction, or vesicle fusion. Mathematical modeling of cell membranes depends on a representation of the free-form surface by discrete meshes. During morphological changes, these meshes must be adjusted under the minimization of the total free energy. Current methodology for meshing is limited in one of two ways: 1) Free energy-dependent methods have no restriction on the mesh geometry. The resulting irregular meshes cause artifacts in follow-up models of morphodynamics. 2) Geometry-dependent methods maintain mesh quality but violate the physics of free energy minimization. To fill this gap, we regulate mesh geometries via a free-energy-determined remeshing process: adding and removing mesh elements upon morphological changes based on barrier crossings in a double-barrier potential between neighboring vertices in the meshes. We test the method’s robustness by reproducing the morphodynamics of red blood cells and vesicle fusions; and we demonstrate the method’s adaptability by simulating the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia and invaginations. Finally, we use the method to study a mechanical decoupling effect of two connected membrane tethers that has been recently observed experimentally, but has not been mechanistically explained in the context of a complete membrane surface. We propose a biophysical model that strengthens the decoupling effect and broadens the original interpretation of the experiment. The method is developed in C/Matlab and distributed via https://github.com/DanuserLab/biophysicsModels.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Secuer: Ultrafast, scalable and accurate clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nana Wei, Yating Nie, Lin Liu, Xiaoqi Zheng, Hua-Jun Wu</p>

Identifying cell clusters is a critical step for single-cell transcriptomics study. Despite the numerous clustering tools developed recently, the rapid growth of scRNA-seq volumes prompts for a more (computationally) efficient clustering method. Here, we introduce Secuer, a Scalable and Efficient speCtral clUstERing algorithm for scRNA-seq data. By employing an anchor-based bipartite graph representation algorithm, Secuer enjoys reduced runtime and memory usage over one order of magnitude for datasets with more than 1 million cells. Meanwhile, Secuer also achieves better or comparable accuracy than competing methods in small and moderate benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we showcase that Secuer can also serve as a building block for a new consensus clustering method, Secuer-consensus, which again improves the runtime and scalability of state-of-the-art consensus clustering methods while also maintaining the accuracy. Overall, Secuer is a versatile, accurate, and scalable clustering framework suitable for small to ultra-large single-cell clustering tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Leveraging infectious disease models to interpret randomized controlled trials: Controlling enteric pathogen transmission through water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew F. Brouwer, Marisa C. Eisenberg, Kevin M. Bakker, Savannah N. Boerger, Mondal H. Zahid, Matthew C. Freeman, Joseph N. S. Eisenberg</p>

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluate hypotheses in specific contexts and are often considered the gold standard of evidence for infectious disease interventions, but their results cannot immediately generalize to other contexts (e.g., different populations, interventions, or disease burdens). Mechanistic models are one approach to generalizing findings between contexts, but infectious disease transmission models (IDTMs) are not immediately suited for analyzing RCTs, since they often rely on time-series surveillance data. We developed an IDTM framework to explain relative risk outcomes of an infectious disease RCT and applied it to a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) RCT. This model can generalize the RCT results to other contexts and conditions. We developed this compartmental IDTM framework to account for key WASH RCT factors: i) transmission across multiple environmental pathways, ii) multiple interventions applied individually and in combination, iii) adherence to interventions or preexisting conditions, and iv) the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. We employed a hybrid sampling and estimation framework to obtain posterior estimates of mechanistic parameter sets consistent with empirical outcomes. We illustrated our model using WASH Benefits Bangladesh RCT data (n = 17,187). Our model reproduced reported diarrheal prevalence in this RCT. The baseline estimate of the basic reproduction number R 0 for the control arm (1.10, 95% CrI: 1.07, 1.16) corresponded to an endemic prevalence of 9.5% (95% CrI: 7.4, 13.7%) in the absence of interventions or preexisting WASH conditions. No single pathway was likely able to sustain transmission: pathway-specific R 0 s for water, fomites, and all other pathways were 0.42 (95% CrI: 0.03, 0.97), 0.20 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.59), and 0.48 (95% CrI: 0.02, 0.94), respectively. An IDTM approach to evaluating RCTs can complement RCT analysis by providing a rigorous framework for generating data-driven hypotheses that explain trial findings, particularly unexpected null results, opening up existing data to deeper epidemiological understanding.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">EEG-representational geometries and psychometric distortions in approximate numerical judgment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefan Appelhoff, Ralph Hertwig, Bernhard Spitzer</p>

When judging the average value of sample stimuli (e.g., numbers) people tend to either over- or underweight extreme sample values, depending on task context. In a context of overweighting, recent work has shown that extreme sample values were overly represented also in neural signals, in terms of an anti-compressed geometry of number samples in multivariate electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. Here, we asked whether neural representational geometries may also reflect a relative underweighting of extreme values (i.e., compression) which has been observed behaviorally in a great variety of tasks. We used a simple experimental manipulation (instructions to average a single-stream or to compare dual-streams of samples) to induce compression or anti-compression in behavior when participants judged rapid number sequences. Model-based representational similarity analysis (RSA) replicated the previous finding of neural anti-compression in the dual-stream task, but failed to provide evidence for neural compression in the single-stream task, despite the evidence for compression in behavior. Instead, the results indicated enhanced neural processing of extreme values in either task, regardless of whether extremes were over- or underweighted in subsequent behavioral choice. We further observed more general differences in the neural representation of the sample information between the two tasks. Together, our results indicate a mismatch between sample-level EEG geometries and behavior, which raises new questions about the origin of common psychometric distortions, such as diminishing sensitivity for larger values.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regional mutational signature activities in cancer genomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Caitlin Timmons, Quaid Morris, Caitlin F. Harrigan</p>

Cancer genomes harbor a catalog of somatic mutations. The type and genomic context of these mutations depend on their causes and allow their attribution to particular mutational signatures. Previous work has shown that mutational signature activities change over the course of tumor development, but investigations of genomic region variability in mutational signatures have been limited. Here, we expand upon this work by constructing regional profiles of mutational signature activities over 2,203 whole genomes across 25 tumor types, using data aggregated by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. We present GenomeTrackSig as an extension to the TrackSig R package to construct regional signature profiles using optimal segmentation and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We find that 426 genomes from 20 tumor types display at least one change in mutational signature activities (changepoint), and 306 genomes contain at least one of 54 recurrent changepoints shared by seven or more genomes of the same tumor type. Five recurrent changepoint locations are shared by multiple tumor types. Within these regions, the particular signature changes are often consistent across samples of the same type and some, but not all, are characterized by signatures associated with subclonal expansion. The changepoints we found cannot strictly be explained by gene density, mutation density, or cell-of-origin chromatin state. We hypothesize that they reflect a confluence of factors including evolutionary timing of mutational processes, regional differences in somatic mutation rate, large-scale changes in chromatin state that may be tissue type-specific, and changes in chromatin accessibility during subclonal expansion. These results provide insight into the regional effects of DNA damage and repair processes, and may help us localize genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during cancer development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ToMExO: A probabilistic tree-structured model for cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammadreza Mohaghegh Neyshabouri, Jens Lagergren</p>

Identifying the interrelations among cancer driver genes and the patterns in which the driver genes get mutated is critical for understanding cancer. In this paper, we study cross-sectional data from cohorts of tumors to identify the cancer-type (or subtype) specific process in which the cancer driver genes accumulate critical mutations. We model this mutation accumulation process using a tree, where each node includes a driver gene or a set of driver genes. A mutation in each node enables its children to have a chance of mutating. This model simultaneously explains the mutual exclusivity patterns observed in mutations in specific cancer genes (by its nodes) and the temporal order of events (by its edges). We introduce a computationally efficient dynamic programming procedure for calculating the likelihood of our noisy datasets and use it to build our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference algorithm, ToMExO. Together with a set of engineered MCMC moves, our fast likelihood calculations enable us to work with datasets with hundreds of genes and thousands of tumors, which cannot be dealt with using available cancer progression analysis methods. We demonstrate our method’s performance on several synthetic datasets covering various scenarios for cancer progression dynamics. Then, a comparison against two state-of-the-art methods on a moderate-size biological dataset shows the merits of our algorithm in identifying significant and valid patterns. Finally, we present our analyses of several large biological datasets, including colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer. In all the analyses, we validate the results using a set of method-independent metrics testing the causality and significance of the relations identified by ToMExO or competing methods.

Identifying host factors that influence infectious disease transmission is an important step toward developing interventions to reduce disease incidence. Recent advances in methods for reconstructing infectious disease transmission events using pathogen genomic and epidemiological data open the door for investigation of host factors that affect onward transmission. While most transmission reconstruction methods are designed to work with densely sampled outbreaks, these methods are making their way into surveillance studies, where the fraction of sampled cases with sequenced pathogens could be relatively low. Surveillance studies that use transmission event reconstruction then use the reconstructed events as response variables (i.e., infection source status of each sampled case) and use host characteristics as predictors (e.g., presence of HIV infection) in regression models. We use simulations to study estimation of the effect of a host factor on probability of being an infection source via this multi-step inferential procedure. Using TransPhylo—a widely-used method for Bayesian estimation of infectious disease transmission events—and logistic regression, we find that low sensitivity of identifying infection sources leads to dilution of the signal, biasing logistic regression coefficients toward zero. We show that increasing the proportion of sampled cases improves sensitivity and some, but not all properties of the logistic regression inference. Application of these approaches to real world data from a population-based TB study in Botswana fails to detect an association between HIV infection and probability of being a TB infection source. We conclude that application of a pipeline, where one first uses TransPhylo and sparsely sampled surveillance data to infer transmission events and then estimates effects of host characteristics on probabilities of these events, should be accompanied by a realistic simulation study to better understand biases stemming from imprecise transmission event inference.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Input correlations impede suppression of chaos and learning in balanced firing-rate networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rainer Engelken, Alessandro Ingrosso, Ramin Khajeh, Sven Goedeke, L. F. Abbott</p>

Neural circuits exhibit complex activity patterns, both spontaneously and evoked by external stimuli. Information encoding and learning in neural circuits depend on how well time-varying stimuli can control spontaneous network activity. We show that in firing-rate networks in the balanced state, external control of recurrent dynamics, i.e., the suppression of internally-generated chaotic variability, strongly depends on correlations in the input. A distinctive feature of balanced networks is that, because common external input is dynamically canceled by recurrent feedback, it is far more difficult to suppress chaos with common input into each neuron than through independent input. To study this phenomenon, we develop a non-stationary dynamic mean-field theory for driven networks. The theory explains how the activity statistics and the largest Lyapunov exponent depend on the frequency and amplitude of the input, recurrent coupling strength, and network size, for both common and independent input. We further show that uncorrelated inputs facilitate learning in balanced networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Orientation control strategies and adaptation to a visuomotor perturbation in rotational hand movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Or Zruya, Ilana Nisky</p>

Computational approaches to biological motor control are used to discover the building blocks of human motor behaviour. Models explaining features of human hand movements have been studied thoroughly, yet only a few studies attempted to explain the control of the orientation of the hand; instead, they mainly focus on the control of hand translation, predominantly in a single plane. In this study, we present a new methodology to study the way humans control the orientation of their hands in three dimensions and demonstrate it in two sequential experiments. We developed a quaternion-based score that quantifies the geodicity of rotational hand movements and evaluated it experimentally. In the first experiment, participants performed a simple orientation-matching task with a robotic manipulator. We found that rotations are generally performed by following a geodesic in the quaternion hypersphere, which suggests that, similarly to translation, the orientation of the hand is centrally controlled, possibly by optimizing geometrical properties of the hand’s rotation. This result established a baseline for the study of human response to perturbed visual feedback of the orientation of the hand. In the second experiment, we developed a novel visuomotor rotation task in which the rotation is applied on the hand’s rotation, and studied the adaptation of participants to this rotation, and the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation. We observed partial adaptation to the rotation. The patterns of the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation were consistent with the representation of the orientation in extrinsic coordinates. The methodology that we developed allows for studying the control of a rigid body without reducing the dimensionality of the task. The results of the two experiments open questions for future studies regarding the mechanisms underlying the central control of hand orientation. These results can be of benefit for many applications that involve fine manipulation of rigid bodies, such as teleoperation and neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Early enforcement of cell identity by a functional component of the terminally differentiated state</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zahra Bahrami-Nejad, Zhi-Bo Zhang, Stefan Tholen, Sanjeev Sharma, Atefeh Rabiee, Michael L. Zhao, Fredric B. Kraemer, Mary N. Teruel</p>

How progenitor cells can attain a distinct differentiated cell identity is a challenging problem given the fluctuating signaling environment in which cells exist and that critical transcription factors are often not unique to a differentiation process. Here, we test the hypothesis that a unique differentiated cell identity can result from a core component of the differentiated state doubling up as a signaling protein that also drives differentiation. Using live single-cell imaging in the adipocyte differentiation system, we show that progenitor fat cells (preadipocytes) can only commit to terminally differentiate after up-regulating FABP4, a lipid buffer that is highly enriched in mature adipocytes. Upon induction of adipogenesis in mouse preadipocyte cells, we show that after a long delay, cells first abruptly start to engage a positive feedback between CEBPA and PPARG before then engaging, after a second delay, a positive feedback between FABP4 and PPARG. These sequential positive feedbacks both need to engage in order to drive PPARG levels past the threshold for irreversible differentiation. In the last step before commitment, PPARG transcriptionally increases FABP4 expression while fatty acid-loaded FABP4 increases PPARG activity. Together, our study suggests a control principle for robust cell identity whereby a core component of the differentiated state also promotes differentiation from its own progenitor state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity orchestrates resilience to brain aging in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sheng Huang, Chengji Piao, Christine B. Beuschel, Zhiying Zhao, Stephan J. Sigrist</p>

The brain as a central regulator of stress integration determines what is threatening, stores memories, and regulates physiological adaptations across the aging trajectory. While sleep homeostasis seems to be linked to brain resilience, how age-associated changes intersect to adapt brain resilience to life history remains enigmatic. We here provide evidence that a brain-wide form of presynaptic active zone plasticity (“PreScale”), characterized by increases of active zone scaffold proteins and synaptic vesicle release factors, integrates resilience by coupling sleep, longevity, and memory during early aging of <i>Drosophila</i>. PreScale increased over the brain until mid-age, to then decreased again, and promoted the age-typical adaption of sleep patterns as well as extended longevity, while at the same time it reduced the ability of forming new memories. Genetic induction of PreScale also mimicked early aging-associated adaption of sleep patterns and the neuronal activity/excitability of sleep control neurons. Spermidine supplementation, previously shown to suppress early aging-associated PreScale, also attenuated the age-typical sleep pattern changes. Pharmacological induction of sleep for 2 days in mid-age flies also reset PreScale, restored memory formation, and rejuvenated sleep patterns. Our data suggest that early along the aging trajectory, PreScale acts as an acute, brain-wide form of presynaptic plasticity to steer trade-offs between longevity, sleep, and memory formation in a still plastic phase of early brain aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Interrogation of an ovine serum peptide spectral library to annotate ambiguous clinicopathological biomarkers using data-independent acquisition [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The use of data-independent data acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) on biological samples from domestic animals is still uncommon. Here, sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) – a variant of DIA-MS was used to analyse serum peptides of healthy sheep as compared with serum of sick sheep by interrogating a novel peptide spectral library (PSL). This approach enabled the detection and annotation of a wide range of proteins, than conventional clinical pathology protein assays. Methods: Serum samples from healthy sheep were obtained from a commercial source and normalised to represent a healthy sheep proteome background and then compared with serum samples of sheep suffering from a range of naturally-acquired illnesses submitted to The University of Queensland, Australia. Purified tryptic peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (TripleTOF 5600+, SCIEX) set in a cyclic data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode using a generic (SWATH™, SCIEX) acquisition method. Data were processed using PeakView® v2.2 software with SWATH™ Acquisition MicroApp 2.0 (SCIEX) and MarkerView™ v1.3 software (SCIEX) pipeline to generate protein lists for downstream gene ontology annotation and pathway analysis of identified proteins. Results: There were distinct differences in peptide chromatographic features of sick sheep samples compared to those from healthy sheep. Healthy and sick sheep serum samples yielded 335 and 236 protein identifications (IDs), respectively. There were 96 protein IDs unique to sick sheep serum. A total of 431 protein IDs were annotated by combining healthy control and sick sheep protein IDs. Conclusions: SWATH analysis successfully aided in the detection some established clinicopathological serum biochemical analytes. This approach enabled the distinction of protein profiles of sick sheep samples from a healthy control sample, thereby providing a promising future perspective for the application of SWATH analysis in veterinary clinical use.

                As research becomes more interdisciplinary, fast-paced, data-intensive, and collaborative, there is an increasing need to share data and other research products in accordance with Open Science principles. In response to this need, we created an Open Science & Data Collaborations (OSDC) program at the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries that provides Open Science tools, training, collaboration opportunities, and community-building events to support Open Research and Open Science adoption. This program presents a unique end-to-end model for Open Science programs because it extends open science support beyond open repositories and open access publishing to the entire research lifecycle. We developed a logic model and a preliminary assessment metrics framework to evaluate the impact of the program activities based on existing data collected through event and workshop registrations and platform usage. The combination of these evaluation instruments has provided initial insight into our service productivity and impact. It will further help to answer more in-depth questions regarding the program impact, launch targeted surveys, and identify priority service areas and interesting Open Science projects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A cross-sectional survey among parents to report challenges and barriers in the administration of drugs to children [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lack of knowledge among parents can result in inappropriate administration practices.  After analyzing different studies among children, there was no data on challenges and barriers in the administration of drugs among children in this region because of the diverse environmental issues and challenges in the UAE. The objective of this study was to determine the reported administration practices of parents and challenges and barriers in the administration of drugs among children in UAE. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted. A convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. An online Raosoft® sample size calculator was applied (n = 248). The inclusion criteria were parents who had a child under 10 years of age and gave consent to participate in this study. Children with vision problems, cognitive/physical disabilities, and caregivers other than parents were excluded from this study. Results: The study reported response rate of 73.2%. The mean ± S.D age of the parents in years was 35.5 ± 7.8, and the mean ± S.D of children aged years was 2.60 ± 1.54. The majority of parents (83.9%) completing the survey were mothers and resided in the city (97.2%). When the children did not like taking tablet drugs 41.9% used multiple practices and 26.2% of parents reported treatment failure due to oral drug administration. Around 47.6% of those who were interviewed reported that their children had swallowing problems during the administration of oral medication. A total of 22.2% of parents reported that they gave drugs in doses higher than prescribed by the doctor to treat their children more quickly. Similarly, a total of 64.5% of the parents reported self-medication without consultation from a healthcare provider. Conclusions: The study concluded that there were inappropriate drug administration practices among parents. Parents reported administration of higher doses to treat their children quickly.

                Background: Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The aim of this study was to assess the role of speckle tracking echocardiography in detecting subclinical myocardial damage in children with SCA. Methods: A cross-sectional case–control study was conducted at the echocardiography laboratory of the military hospital of Tunis between July and December 2018. Thirty patients with SCA were included. A control(C) group including 30 normally developing children was selected and matched to the SCA group by sex and age. We compared between the two groups: conventional echocardiographic parameters including cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), thickness and the global longitudinal strain (GLS). The echocardiographic measurements were indexed according to body surface area. The left ventricular (LV) GLS association with clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were also evaluated. Results: Patients and controls were matched for age and sex: the mean age was (11± 2years) in SCA group versus (12± 1 years) in C group with a sex ratio of (1.31 versus 1.27, respectively). Body surface area was comparable. LV hypertrophy and dilation were revealed in the SCA group, whereas measurements were normal in the C group. No significant differences were observed for cardiac output (p=0.4). LVEF were preserved in both groups. However, two-dimensional (2D) LVGLS was impaired in 46% of SCA group (n=14) with mean value of (-21%±3.07 vs -25%±2.98; p<0.01).In SCA group, impaired LVGLS was significantly associated with LV mass (r = – 0.399, p<0.01), LV tele diastolic diameter(r= -0.419, p<0.01) and left atrial volume (r= - 0.399, p< 0.04). In multivariate analysis, LV mass was the only independent factor. Conclusions: In the present study, LVGLS measurement revealed subclinical LV systolic impairment in patients with SCA. Therefore, 2D strain could be beneficial to detect the natural history of LV dysfunction in SCA.

                Background: Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a promising implant material due to its superior biomechanical strength. However, due to its hydrophobic nature and lack of cellular adhesion properties, it has poor integration with bone tissue. Methods: A fractional CO2 laser was used with various parameters for surface texturing of PEEK substrate to enhance its surface properties. An optical microscope and field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) were used to examine the surface morphology of untextured and laser-textured samples. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed to determine the effect of the laser on the microstructure of PEEK. Surface microroughness, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and wettability were investigated. Results: There were significant increases in microroughness, nanoroughness, surface area ratio, and wettability after laser texturing with no change in the elemental composition. The best results were obtained by using 400 µs laser pulse duration with a dot separation distance of 0.2 mm and a 60° staggered dots pattern. Conclusions: Laser surface texturing of PEEK implant material by fractional CO2 laser is an easy and fast method of introducing patterned topographical features with no need for additional devices. With further investigations, this method of PEEK modification might have the potential to be used in the implant field.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A transit map for micro-scale urban development in Alexandria, Egypt [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to Egypt's strategic location among countries, transportation is one of the most significant development sectors because it plays a major part in today's economy and society and has a large influence on growth and employment. Over the years, the Egyptian General Organisation of Physical Planning (GOPP) has prepared strategic general urban plans in collaboration with local and foreign organisations, including transportation plans. The constant focus of authorities on strategic plans and their inability to implement them on schedule are a major issue. In other words, they always take development from a distant perspective and do not deal with the main problem that exists within cities, as the existing micro-scale transit built environments (MSTBEs) of cities are not ready due to a lack of transit-oriented communities (TOCs), sustainably developed transit supply systems, and mobility hubs. Methods: The "Enhanced MSTBE Phases" methodology is used for the key elements of the study design used in this research, depending on data collection, approvals, techniques, and analysis methods. As a case study, these key elements are in the documentation, analysis, and development of the Muharram Bek El Mowkaf El Gedid Mobility Hub (MBMH) and the 800 m radius around it. Results: The results indicate that Enhanced MSTBE Phases led to the establishment of the MBMH and the 800 m radius surrounding it as a sustainable MSTBE in Alexandria, Egypt, which is chosen as the case study. Conclusions: The development of this MSTBE is a catalyst for future effects that will have a long-term impact on meso-scale and, ultimately, macro-scale transit built environments.

<p>This study demonstrates that nanoparticulate matter (nPM) exposure and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) promote oxidative stress and induce neuronal apoptosis in a synergistic manner. Oligodendrocytes are preferentially vulnerable to the toxicity of nPM exposure and CCH. nPM exposure causes mature oligodendrocyte cell death and increases the number oligodendrocyte precursor cells.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) may amplify the neurotoxicity of nanoscale particulate matter (nPM), resulting in white matter injury. This study characterized the joint effects of nPM (diameter ≤ 200 nm) and CCH secondary to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) exposure on neuronal and white matter injury in a murine model. nPM was collected near a highway and re-aerosolized for exposure. Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were randomized into four groups: filtered air (FA), nPM, FA + BCAS, and nPM + BCAS. Mice were exposed to FA or nPM for 10 weeks. BCAS surgeries were performed. Markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were examined. nPM + BCAS exposure increased brain hemisphere TNFα protein compared to FA. iNOS and HNE immunofluorescence were increased in the corpus callosum and cerebral cortex of nPM + BCAS mice compared to FA. While nPM exposure alone did not decrease cortical neuronal cell count, nPM decreased corpus callosum oligodendrocyte cell count. nPM exposure decreased mature oligodendrocyte cell count and increased oligodendrocyte precursor cell count in the corpus callosum. nPM + BCAS mice exhibited a 200% increase in cortical neuronal TUNEL staining and a 700% increase in corpus callosum oligodendrocyte TUNEL staining compared to FA. There was a supra-additive interaction between nPM and BCAS on cortical neuronal TUNEL staining (2.6× the additive effects of nPM + BCAS). nPM + BCAS exposure increased apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the cerebral cortex and corpus callosum. nPM + BCAS exposure increased neuronal apoptosis above the separate responses to each exposure. However, oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum demonstrated a greater susceptibility to the combined neurotoxic effects of nPM + BCAS exposure.</p>

                Background: The main characteristic of selective mutism (SM) is the failure to speak in specific social situations. Thus, assessing speech across social contexts is important for confirming a diagnosis of SM and for differentiating it from other disorders. The purpose of this review was to organize how the core symptom of SM, a lack of speech in specific social situations, has been assessed in previous studies. Methods: A systematic search of articles was conducted in three databases, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed and reviews of surveys or experimental studies that reported empirical data on individuals with SM were performed. We excluded review, qualitative, epidemiological, and intervention studies. The study summarized the diagnostic criteria, methods of confirming SM diagnosis, distinction of SM from other disorders, and methods of speech assessment. Results: A total of 447 articles were screened, where 60 articles were considered eligible. The results demonstrate that different interviews and questionnaires were used to establish the diagnosis of SM. However, the majority of interviews and questionnaires lacked validation. Only two (2/60) articles used validated methods of speech assessment to confirm SM diagnosis. Moreover, a consensus was lacking on the assessment method for differentiating SM from other disorders across studies. Specifically, 17 studies measured speech and are not intended for diagnosis. The majority of studies (16/17) used the questionnaire to assess the severity of the SM condition, and only one study conducted behavioral observation. Assessment methods based on the measurement of speech in real-life situations for individuals with SM were not established. Conclusion: We have the limitation that we did not review intervention studies. However, this systematic review revealed the problem that speech assessment methods for surveys or experimental studies of SM were not established. Future studies should establish methods of speech assessment across social situations to assess SM symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glycine inhibits NINJ1 membrane clustering to suppress plasma membrane rupture in cell death</a></h4>

              
                First recognized more than 30 years ago, glycine protects cells against rupture from diverse types of injury. This robust and widely observed effect has been speculated to target a late downstream process common to multiple modes of tissue injury. The molecular target of glycine that mediates cytoprotection, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that glycine works at the level of NINJ1, a newly identified executioner of plasma membrane rupture in pyroptosis, necrosis, and post-apoptosis lysis. NINJ1 is thought to cluster within the plasma membrane to cause cell rupture. We demonstrate that the execution of pyroptotic cell rupture is similar for human and mouse NINJ1, and that NINJ1 knockout functionally and morphologically phenocopies glycine cytoprotection in macrophages undergoing lytic cell death. Next, we show that glycine prevents NINJ1 clustering by either direct or indirect mechanisms. In pyroptosis, glycine preserves cellular integrity but does not affect upstream inflammasome activities or accompanying energetic cell death. By positioning NINJ1 clustering as a glycine target, our data resolve a long-standing mechanism for glycine-mediated cytoprotection. This new understanding will inform the development of cell preservation strategies to counter pathologic lytic cell death.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Insight into the evolutionary assemblage of cranial kinesis from a Cretaceous bird</a></h4>

              
                The independent movements and flexibility of various parts of the skull, called cranial kinesis, are an evolutionary innovation that is found in living vertebrates only in some squamates and crown birds and is considered to be a major factor underpinning much of the enormous phenotypic and ecological diversity of living birds, the most diverse group of extant amniotes. Compared to the postcranium, our understanding of the evolutionary assemblage of the characteristic modern bird skull has been hampered by sparse fossil records of early cranial materials, with competing hypotheses regarding the evolutionary development of cranial kinesis among early members of the avialans. Here, a detailed three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull of the Early Cretaceous enantiornithine <i>Yuanchuavis kompsosoura</i> allows for its in-depth description, including elements that are poorly known among early-diverging avialans but are central to deciphering the mosaic assembly of features required for modern avian cranial kinesis. Our reconstruction of the skull shows evolutionary and functional conservation of the temporal and palatal regions by retaining the ancestral theropod dinosaurian configuration within the skull of this otherwise derived and volant bird. Geometric morphometric analysis of the palatine suggests that loss of the jugal process represents the first step in the structural modifications of this element leading to the kinetic crown bird condition. The mixture of plesiomorphic temporal and palatal structures together with a derived avialan rostrum and postcranial skeleton encapsulated in <i>Yuanchuavis</i> manifests the key role of evolutionary mosaicism and experimentation in early bird diversification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glycolytic flux-signaling controls mouse embryo mesoderm development</a></h4>

              
                How cellular metabolic state impacts cellular programs is a fundamental, unresolved question. Here we investigated how glycolytic flux impacts embryonic development, using presomitic mesoderm (PSM) patterning as the experimental model. First, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as an in vivo sentinel metabolite that mirrors glycolytic flux within PSM cells of post-implantation mouse embryos. We found that medium-supplementation with FBP, but not with other glycolytic metabolites, such as fructose 6-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, impaired mesoderm segmentation. To genetically manipulate glycolytic flux and FBP levels, we generated a mouse model enabling the conditional overexpression of dominant active, cytoplasmic PFKFB3 (cytoPFKFB3). Overexpression of cytoPFKFB3 indeed led to increased glycolytic flux/FBP levels and caused an impairment of mesoderm segmentation, paralleled by the downregulation of Wnt-signaling, reminiscent of the effects seen upon FBP-supplementation. To probe for mechanisms underlying glycolytic flux-signaling, we performed subcellular proteome analysis and revealed that cytoPFKFB3 overexpression altered subcellular localization of certain proteins, including glycolytic enzymes, in PSM cells. Specifically, we revealed that FBP supplementation caused depletion of Pfkl and Aldoa from the nuclear-soluble fraction. Combined, we propose that FBP functions as a flux-signaling metabolite connecting glycolysis and PSM patterning, potentially through modulating subcellular protein localization.

                We present a new approach for macromolecular structure determination from multiple particles in electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) data sets. Whereas existing subtomogram averaging approaches are based on 3D data models, we propose to optimise a regularised likelihood target that approximates a function of the 2D experimental images. In addition, analogous to Bayesian polishing and contrast transfer function (CTF) refinement in single-particle analysis, we describe approaches that exploit the increased signal-to-noise ratio in the averaged structure to optimise tilt series alignments, beam-induced motions of the particles throughout the tilt series acquisition, defoci of the individual particles, as well as higher-order optical aberrations of the microscope. Implementation of our approaches in the open-source software package RELION aims to facilitate their general use, in particular for those researchers who are already familiar with its single-particle analysis tools. We illustrate for three applications that our approaches allow structure determination from cryo-ET data to resolutions sufficient for de novo atomic modelling.

                Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by selective vulnerability of distinct cell populations; however, the cause for this specificity remains elusive. Here we show that entorhinal cortex layer 2 (EC2) neurons are unusually vulnerable to prolonged neuronal inactivity compared with neighboring regions of the temporal lobe, and that reelin+ stellate cells connecting EC with the hippocampus are preferentially susceptible within the EC2 population. We demonstrate that neuronal death after silencing can be elicited through multiple independent means of activity inhibition, and that preventing synaptic release, either alone or in combination with electrical shunting, is sufficient to elicit silencing-induced degeneration. Finally, we discovered that degeneration following synaptic silencing is governed by competition between active and inactive cells, which is a circuit refinement process traditionally thought to end early in postnatal life. Our data suggests that the developmental window for wholesale circuit plasticity may extend into adulthood for specific brain regions. We speculate that this sustained potential for remodeling by entorhinal neurons may support lifelong memory but renders them vulnerable to prolonged activity changes in disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dependence of diffusion in Escherichia coli cytoplasm on protein size, environmental conditions and cell growth</a></h4>

              
                Inside prokaryotic cells, passive translational diffusion typically limits the rates with which cytoplasmic proteins can reach their locations. Diffusion is thus fundamental to most cellular processes, but the understanding of protein mobility in the highly crowded and non-homogeneous environment of a bacterial cell is still limited. Here we investigated the mobility of a large set of proteins in the cytoplasm of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, by employing fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) combined with simulations and theoretical modeling. We conclude that cytoplasmic protein mobility could be well described by Brownian diffusion in the confined geometry of the bacterial cell and at the high viscosity imposed by macromolecular crowding. We observed similar size dependence of protein diffusion for the majority of tested proteins, whether native or foreign to <i>E. coli</i>. For the faster-diffusing proteins, this size dependence is well consistent with the Stokes-Einstein relation once taking into account the specific dumbbell shape of protein fusions. Pronounced subdiffusion and hindered mobility are only observed for proteins with extensive interactions within the cytoplasm. Finally, while protein diffusion becomes markedly faster in actively growing cells, at high temperature, or upon treatment with rifampicin, and slower at high osmolarity, all of these perturbations affect proteins of different sizes in the same proportions, which could thus be described as changes of a well-defined cytoplasmic viscosity.

                Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are sensory epithelial cells that transmit airway status to the brain via sensory neurons and locally via calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and γ- aminobutyric acid (GABA). Several other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters have been detected in various species, but the number, targets, functions, and conservation of PNEC signals are largely unknown. We used scRNAseq to profile hundreds of the rare mouse and human PNECs. This revealed over 40 PNEC neuropeptide and peptide hormone genes, most cells expressing unique combinations of 5–18 genes. Peptides are packaged in separate vesicles, their release presumably regulated by the distinct, multimodal combinations of sensors we show are expressed by each PNEC. Expression of the peptide receptors predicts an array of local cell targets, and we show the new PNEC signal angiotensin directly activates one subtype of innervating sensory neuron. Many signals lack lung targets so may have endocrine activity like those of PNEC-derived carcinoid tumors. PNECs are an extraordinarily rich and diverse signaling hub rivaling the enteroendocrine system.

                Human behaviour requires flexible arbitration between actions we do out of habit and actions that are directed towards a specific goal. Drugs that target opioid and dopamine receptors are notorious for inducing maladaptive habitual drug consumption; yet, how the opioidergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems contribute to the arbitration between habitual and goal-directed behaviour is poorly understood. By combining pharmacological challenges with a well-established decision-making task and a novel computational model, we show that the administration of the dopamine D2/3 receptor antagonist amisulpride led to an increase in goal-directed or ‘model-based’ relative to habitual or ‘model-free’ behaviour, whereas the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone had no appreciable effect. The effect of amisulpride on model-based/model-free behaviour did not scale with drug serum levels in the blood. Furthermore, participants with higher amisulpride serum levels showed higher explorative behaviour. These findings highlight the distinct functional contributions of dopamine and opioid receptors to goal-directed and habitual behaviour and support the notion that even small doses of amisulpride promote flexible application of cognitive control.

                Recent advances in connectomic and neurophysiological tools make it possible to probe whole-brain mechanisms in the mouse that underlie cognition and behavior. Based on experimental data, we developed a large-scale model of the mouse brain for a cardinal cognitive function called working memory, the brain's ability to internally hold and process information without sensory input. In the model, interregional connectivity is constrained by mesoscopic connectome data. The density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the model varies systematically across the cortex. We found that the long-range cell type-specific targeting and density of cell classes define working memory representations. A core cortical subnetwork and the thalamus produce distributed persistent activity, and the network exhibits numerous attractor states.

                The spinal cord is of fundamental importance for somatosensory processing and plays a significant role in various pathologies, such as chronic pain. However, knowledge on spinal cord processing in humans is limited due to the vast technical challenges involved in its investigation via non-invasive recording approaches. Here, we aim to address these challenges by developing an electrophysiological approach -- based on a high-density electrode-montage -- that allows for characterizing spinal cord somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and combining this with concurrent recordings of the spinal cord's input (peripheral nerve action potentials) and output (SEPs in brainstem and cortex). In two separate experiments, we first methodologically validate the approach (including replication and robustness analyses) and then assess its application in the context of a neuroscientific question (integrative processes along the neural hierarchy). Critically, we demonstrate the benefits of multi-channel recordings in terms of enhancing sensitivity via spatial filtering, which also allows for obtaining spinal cord SEPs at the single-trial level. We make use of this approach to demonstrate the feasibility of recording spinal cord SEPs in low-signal scenarios (single-digit stimulation) and -- most importantly -- to provide evidence for bottom-up signal integration already at the level of the spinal cord. Taken together, our approach of concurrent multi-channel recordings of evoked responses along the neural hierarchy allows for a comprehensive assessment of the functional architecture of somatosensory processing at a millisecond timescale.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generation of adult hippocampal neural stem cells occurs in the early postnatal dentate gyrus and depends on cyclin D2</a></h4>

              
                In the hippocampus, lifelong neurogenesis is maintained by a pool of multipotent adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) residing in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG). Yet, the mechanisms guiding the transition of NSCs from developmental to adult remain unclear. By using nestin-reporter mice deficient for D2, a cyclin expressed mainly postnatally, we show that the aNSC pool is established through D2-dependent proliferation during the first two weeks of life. The absence of D2 allows the normal development of the DG until birth but prevents the postnatal formation of radial glia-like aNSCs. Additionally, retroviral fate mapping demonstrates that aNSCs are born on-site from precursors located in the DG shortly after birth. Altogether, our data suggest that aNSCs are a population distinct from developmental NSCs and thus imply that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not a mere continuation of development.

                High-density electrophysiology probes have opened new possibilities for systems neuroscience in human and non-human animals, but probe motion (or drift) while recording poses a challenge for downstream analyses, particularly in human recordings. Here, we improve on the state of the art for tracking this drift with an algorithm termed DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data) with four major contributions. First, we extend previous decentralized methods to exploit multiband information, leveraging the local field potential (LFP), in addition to spikes detected from the action potentials (AP). Second, we show that the LFP-based approach enables registration at sub-second temporal resolution. Third, we introduce an efficient online motion tracking algorithm, allowing the method to scale up to longer and higher spatial resolution recordings, which could facilitate real-time applications. Finally, we improve the robustness of the approach by accounting for the nonstationarities that occur in real data and by automating parameter selection. Together, these advances enable fully automated scalable registration of challenging datasets from both humans and mice.

                Dynamic functional organization by synchronization is theorized to be essential for dimension reduction of the cerebellar learning space. We analyzed a large amount of coordinate-localized, two-photon imaging data from cerebellar Crus II in mice undergoing Go/No-go reinforcement learning. Tensor component analysis revealed that a majority of climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells were reduced to only four functional components, corresponding to accurate timing control of motor initiation related to a Go cue, cognitive error-based learning, reward processing, and inhibition of erroneous behaviors after a No-go cue. Spatial distribution of these components coincided well with the boundaries of Aldolase-C/zebrin II expression in Purkinje cells, whereas several components are mixed in single neurons. Synchronization within individual components was bidirectionally regulated according to specific task contexts and learning stages. These findings suggest that the cerebellum, based on anatomical compartments, reduces dimensions by self-organization of components, a feature that may inspire new-generation AI designs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Older age is associated with a shift from ventral to dorsal PCC in pathways connecting the DMN with visual and limbic areas and a directionality shift in pathways connecting the DMN with sensorimotor areas</a></h4>

              
                Alterations in the default mode network (DMN) are known to associated with aging and with neurological and psychiatric diseases. We assessed age-dependent changes in interactions within the DMN and between the DMN with other brain areas, and correlations of these interactions with a battery of neuropsychological tests to formulate a macroscopic model of ageing. Using a novel multivariate analysis method, enabling determination of directed pathways, on resting-state functional MRI data from fifty young and thirty-one old healthy individuals, we identified directed intra- and inter-DMN directed pathways that differed between the groups and used their correlations with neuropsychological tests to infer their behavioral meaning. Pathways connecting the DMN with visual and limbic regions in old subjects engaged at BOLD low frequency and involved the dorsal PCC. In young subjects, they were at high frequency and involved the ventral PCC. Pathways combining the sensorimotor (SM) and the DMN, were efferent in young subjects (DMN<SM) and afferent in old subjects (DMN>SM). Most inter-DMN pathways in the old subjects, correlated with reduced speed and working memory and, were DMN efferent (DMN>). We suggest a macroscopic model of aging centered in the DMN. It suggests that the reduced sensorimotor efferent, probably brought about from reduced physical activity, and the increased need to control such activities by the mPFC, causes a higher dependency on external versus internal cues. This results in a shift from ventral to dorsal PCC of inter-DMN pathways. Consequently, the model combines physical activity with ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ketamines rapid antidepressant effects are mediated by Ca2+ - permeable AMPA receptors in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine is shown to enhance excitatory synaptic drive in the hippocampus, which is presumed to underlie its rapid antidepressant effects. Moreover, ketamines therapeutic actions are likely mediated by enhancing neuronal Ca2+ signaling. However, ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission and postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling. Thus, it is a puzzling question how ketamine enhances glutamatergic and Ca2+ activity in neurons to induce rapid antidepressant effects while blocking NMDARs in the hippocampus. Here, we find that ketamine treatment for one hour in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons significantly reduces calcineurin activity to elevate AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation ultimately induces the expression of Ca2+ - permeable, GluA2-lacking, and GluA1-containing AMPARs (CP-AMPARs). Such ketamine-induced expression of CP-AMPARs enhances glutamatergic activity and synaptic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons. When a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine is given to mice, it increases synaptic GluA1 levels, but not GluA2, and GluA1 phosphorylation in the hippocampus within one hour after treatment. These changes are likely mediated by ketamine-induced reduction of calcineurin activity in the hippocampus. Using the open field and tail suspension tests, we demonstrate that a low dose of ketamine rapidly reduces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in both male and female mice. However, when in vivo treatment of a CP-AMPAR antagonist abolishes the ketamines effects on animals behavior. We thus discover that ketamine at the low dose promotes the expression of CP-AMPARs via reduction of calcineurin activity in the hippocampus, which in turn enhances synaptic strength to induce rapid antidepressant actions.

                The dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) receive dopaminergic projections that control motor functions and reward-related behavior. It remains poorly understood how dopamine release dynamics across different temporal scales in these regions are coupled to behavioral outcomes. Here, we employ the dopamine sensor dLight1.3b together with multi-region fiber photometry and machine learning-based analysis to decode dopamine dynamics across striatum during selfpaced exploratory behavior in mice. Our data show a striking coordination of rapidly fluctuating signal in the DS, carrying information across dopamine levels, with a slower signal in the VS, consisting mainly of slow-paced transients. Importantly, these release dynamics correlated with discrete behavioral motifs, such as turns, running and grooming on a subsecond-to-minutes time scale. Disruption of dopamine dynamics with cocaine caused randomization of action selection sequencing and disturbance of DS-VS coordination. The data suggest that distinct dopamine dynamics of DS and VS jointly encode behavioral sequences during unconstrained activity with DS modulating the stringing together of actions and VS the signal to initiate and sustain the selected action.

                Microglia are heterogenous cells characterized by distinct populations each contributing to specific biological processes in the nervous system, including neuroprotection. To elucidate the impact of sex-specific microglia heterogenicity to the susceptibility of neuronal stress, we analysed the dynamic changes in shape and motility occurring in primary mouse microglia following pro-inflammatory or neurotoxic insults, thus finding sex-specific responses of microglial subpopulations. Male microglia exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype, whereas female microglia showed enhanced neuroprotective capabilities associated with the activation of Nrf2 detoxification pathway in neurons. The sex difference in neuroprotective functions is lost by inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, the product of the GBA1 gene, mutations of which are the major risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). This finding is consistent with the increased risk of PD observed in female carriers of GBA1 mutation, when compared with wild type population, suggesting a role for microglial functionality in the etiopathogenesis of PD-GBA1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulus information guides the emergence of behavior related signals in primary somatosensory cortex during learning</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neurons in primary sensory cortex carry not only sensory but also behavior-related information. However, it remains unclear how these types of information emerge and are integrated with one another over learning and what the relative contribution of activity in individual cells versus neuronal populations is in this process. Current evidence supports two opposing views of learning-related changes: 1) sensory information increases in primary cortex or 2) sensory information remains stable in primary cortex but its readout efficiency in association cortices increases. Here, we investigate these questions in primary sensory cortex during learning of a sensory task. Over the course of weeks, we imaged neuronal activity at different depths within layers 2 and 3 of the mouse vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) before, during, and after training on a whisker-based object-localization task. We leveraged information theoretical analysis to quantify stimulus and behavior-related information in vS1 and estimate how much neural activity encoding sensory information is used to inform perceptual choices as sensory learning progresses. We also quantified the extent to which these types of information are supported by an individual neuron or population code. We found that, while sensory information rises progressively from the start of training, choice information is only present in the final stages of learning and is increasingly supported by a population code. Moreover, we demonstrate that not only the increase in available information, but also a more efficient readout of such information in primary sensory cortex mediate sensory learning. Together, our results highlight the importance of primary cortical neurons in perceptual learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuro-immune modulation of cholinergic signaling in an addiction vulnerability trait</a></h4>

              
                Sign-tracking (ST) describes the propensity to approach and contact a Pavlovian reward cue. By contrast, goal-trackers (GTs) respond to such a cue solely by retrieving the reward. These behaviors index the presence of opponent cognitive-motivational traits, with STs exhibiting attentional control deficits, behavior dominated by incentive motivational processes, and vulnerability for addictive drug taking. Attentional control deficits in STs were previously attributed to attenuated cholinergic signaling, resulting from deficient translocation of intracellular choline transporters (CHTs) into synaptosomal plasma membrane. Here we investigated a post-translational modification of CHTs (poly-ubiquitination), and tested the hypothesis that elevated cytokine signaling in STs contributes to CHT modification. We demonstrated that intracellular CHTs, but not plasma membrane CHTs, are highly ubiquitinated in male and female sign-tracking rats when compared with GTs. Moreover, levels of cytokines measured in two brain regions, but not spleen, were higher in STs than in GTs. Activation of the innate immune system by systemic administration of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elevated ubiquitinated CHT levels in cortex and striatum of GTs only, suggesting ceiling effects in STs. In spleen, LPS increased levels of most cytokines in both phenotypes. In cortex, LPS particularly robustly increased levels of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10. Phenotype-specific increases were restricted to GTs, again suggesting ceiling effects in STs. These results indicate that interactions between elevated brain immune modulator signaling and CHT regulation are essential components of the neuronal underpinnings of the addiction vulnerability trait indexed by sign-tracking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Why is the perceptual octave stretched? An account based on mismatched time constants within the auditory brainstem.</a></h4>

              
                This paper suggests an explanation for listeners' greater tolerance to positive than negative mistuning of the higher tone within an octave pair. It hypothesizes a neural circuit tuned to cancel the lower tone, that also cancels the higher tone if that tone is in tune. Imperfect cancellation is the cue to mistuning of the octave. The circuit involves two neural pathways, one delayed with respect to the other, that feed a coincidence-sensitive neuron via excitatory and inhibitory synapses. A mismatch between the time constants of these two synapses results in an asymmetry in sensitivity to mismatch. Specifically, if the time constant of the delayed pathway is greater than that of the direct pathway, there is a greater tolerance to positive mistuning than to negative mistuning. The model is directly applicable to the harmonic octave (concurrent tones), but extending it to the melodic octave (successive tones) requires additional assumptions that are discussed. The paper reviews evidence from auditory psychophysics and physiology in favor - or against - this explanation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Unitary Mechanism Underlies Adaptation to Both Local and Global Environmental Statistics in Time Perception</a></h4>

              
                Our sense of the passage of time flexibly adapts to the statistical properties of the temporal context. Humans and non-human species exhibit a perceptual bias towards the mean of durations previously observed as well as serial dependence, a perceptual bias towards the duration of recently processed events. Here we asked whether those two phenomena arise from a unitary mechanism or reflect the operation of two distinct systems that adapt separately to the global and local statistics of the environment. We employed a set of duration reproduction tasks in which the target duration was sampled from distributions with different variances and means. The central tendency and serial dependence biases were jointly modulated by the range and the variance of the prior, and these effects were well-captured by a unitary mechanism model in which temporal expectancies are updated after each trial based on perceptual observations. Alternative models that assume separate mechanisms for global and local contextual effects failed to capture the empirical results.

                The visual signal processing in the retina requires the precise organization of diverse neuronal types working in concert. We performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of over 100,000 cells from the mouse retia, uncovering the spatial distribution of all major retina cell types with over 100 cell subtypes. Our data revealed that the retina is organized in a laminar structure at the major cell type and subgroup level, both of which has strong correlation with the birth order of the cell. In contrast, overall random dispersion of cells within sub-laminar layers indicates that retinal mosaics are driven by dendritic field patterning rather than neuron soma placement. Through the integration of single cell transcriptomic and spatial data, we have generated the first comprehensive spatial single cell reference atlas of the mouse retina, a resource to the community and an essential step toward gaining a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of retinal function.

                Long-lasting pain stimuli can trigger maladaptive changes in the spinal cord, reminiscent of plasticity associated with memory formation. Metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons has been implicated in neuronal plasticity and memory formation in the CNS, but neither its involvement in pathological pain nor in spinal plasticity has been tested. Here, we report a novel form of neuroglia signaling involving spinal astrocytic glycogen dynamics triggered by persistent noxious stimulation via upregulation of the metabolic signaling molecule PTG exclusively in spinal astrocytes. PTG drove glycogen build-up in astrocytes, and blunting glycogen accumulation and turnover by Ptg gene deletion reduced pain-related behaviors and promoted faster recovery by shortening pain maintenance. Furthermore, mechanistic analyses revealed that glycogen dynamics is a critically required process for maintenance of pain by facilitating neuronal plasticity in spinal lamina 1 neurons. Finally, metabolic analysis indicated that glycolysis and lactate transfer between astrocytes and neurons fuels spinal neuron hyperexcitability. Spinal glycogen-metabolic cascades therefore hold therapeutic potential to alleviate pathological pain.

                N-terminal phosphorylation at residues T3 and S13 is believed to have important beneficial implications for the biological and pathological properties of mutant huntingtin, where IKBKB was identified as a candidate regulator of huntingtin N-terminal phosphorylation. The paucity of mechanistic information on IKK pathways, together with the lack of sensitive methods to quantify endogenous huntingtin phosphorylation, prevented detailed study of the role of IKBKB in Huntington's disease. Using novel ultrasensitive assays, we demonstrate that IKBKB can regulate endogenous S13 huntingtin phosphorylation in a manner dependent on its kinase activity and known regulators. We found that the ability of IKBKB to phosphorylate endogenous huntingtin S13 is mediated through a non-canonical IRF3-mediated IKK-pathway, distinct from the established involvement of IKBKB in mutant huntingtin's pathological mechanisms mediated via the canonical pathway. Furthermore, increased huntingtin S13 phosphorylation by IKBKB resulted in decreased aggregation of mutant huntingtin in cells, again dependent on its kinase activity. These findings point to a non-canonical IKK-pathway linking S13 huntingtin phosphorylation to the pathological properties of mutant huntingtin aggregation, thought to be significant to Huntington's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain activation by a VR-based motor imagery andobservation task: An fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Training motor imagery (MI) and motor observation (MO) tasks is being intensively exploited to promote brain plasticity in the context of post-stroke rehabilitation strategies. The desired brain plasticity mechanisms may benefit from the use of closed-loop neurofeedback, embedded in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to provide an alternative non-muscular channel. These can be further augmented through embodied feedback delivered through virtual reality (VR). Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activation elicited by a VR-based MI-MO BCI task called NeuRow and compared with a conventional non-VR, and MI-only, task based on the Graz BCI paradigm. We found that, in healthy adults, NeuRow elicits stronger brain activation when compared to the Graz task, as well as to an overt motor execution task, recruiting large portions of the parietal and occipital cortices in addition to the motor and premotor cortices. In particular, NeuRow activates the mirror neuron system (MNS), associated with action observation, as well as visual areas related with visual attention and motion processing. We studied a cohort of healthy adults including younger and older subgroups, and found no significant age-related effects in the measured brain activity. Overall, our findings suggest that the virtual representation of the arms in a bimanual MI-MO task engage the brain beyond conventional MI tasks, even in older adults, which we propose could be explored for effective neurorehabilitation protocols.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous and multifaceted ATP release from astrocytes at the scale of hundreds of synapses</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes participate in information processing by releasing neuroactive substances termed gliotransmitters, including ATP. Individual astrocytes come into contact with thousands of synapses with their ramified structure, but the spatiotemporal dynamics of ATP gliotransmission remain unclear, especially in physiological brain tissue. Using a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, GRABATP1.0, we discovered that extracellular ATP increased locally and transiently in absence of stimuli in neuron-glia co-cultures, cortical slices, and the anesthetized mouse brain. Spontaneous ATP release events were tetrodotoxin-insensitive but suppressed by gliotoxin, fluorocitrate, and typically spread over 50--250 {micro}m2 area at concentrations capable of activating purinergic receptors. Besides, most ATP events did not coincide with Ca2+ transients. Clustering analysis revealed that these events followed multiple distinct kinetics, and blockade of exocytosis only decreased a minor group of slow events. Overall, astrocytes spontaneously release ATP through multiple mechanisms, mainly in non-vesicular and Ca2+-independent manners, thus potentially regulating hundreds of synapses all together.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 6 (ALS6) is a familial subtype of ALS linked to Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene mutation. FUS mutations lead to decreased global protein synthesis, but the mechanism that drives this has not been established. Here, we used ALS6 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) to study the effect of the ALS6 FUSR521H mutation on the translation machinery in motor neurons (MNs). We find, in agreement with findings of others, that protein synthesis is decreased in ALS6 MNs. Furthermore, ALS6 MNs are more sensitive to oxidative stress and display reduced expression of TGF-{beta} and mTORC gene pathways when stressed. Finally, we show that IFN{gamma} treatment reduces apoptosis of ALS6 MNs exposed to oxidative stress and partially restores the translation rates in ALS6 MNs. Overall, these findings suggest that a functional IFN{gamma} response is important for FUS-mediated protein synthesis, possibly by FUS nuclear translocation in ALS6.

                Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene are the second most common known cause of ALS. SOD1 variants express high phenotypic variability and over 200 have been reported in people with ALS. Investigating how different SOD1 variants affect the protein dynamics might help in understanding their pathogenic mechanism and explaining their heterogeneous clinical presentation. It was previously proposed that variants can be broadly classified in two groups, "wild-type like" (WTL) and "metal binding region" (MBR) variants, based on their structural location and biophysical properties. MBR variants are associated with a loss of SOD1 enzymatic activity. In this study we used molecular dynamics and large clinical datasets to characterise the differences in the structural and dynamic behaviour of WTL and MBR variants with respect to the wild-type SOD1, and how such differences influence the ALS clinical phenotype. Our study identified marked structural differences, some of which are observed in both variant groups, while others are group specific. Moreover, applying graph theory to a network representation of the proteins, we identified differences in the intramolecular contacts of the two classes of variants. Finally, collecting clinical data of approximately 500 SOD1 ALS patients carrying variants from both classes, we showed that the survival time of patients carrying an MBR variant is generally longer (~6 years median difference, p < 0.001) with respect to patients with a WTL variant. In conclusion, our study highlights key differences in the dynamic behaviour of the WTL and MBR SOD1 variants, and wild-type SOD1 at an atomic and molecular level. We identified interesting structural features that could be further investigated to explain the associated phenotypic variability. Our results support the hypothesis of a decoupling between mechanisms of onset and progression of SOD1 ALS, and an involvement of loss-of-function of SOD1 with the disease progression.

                Auditory perception can benefit from stimuli in non-auditory sensory modalities, as for example in lip-reading. Compared with such visual influences, tactile influences are still poorly understood. It has been shown that single tactile pulses can enhance the perception of auditory stimuli depending on their relative timing, but whether and how such brief auditory enhancements can be stretched in time with more sustained, phase-specific periodic tactile stimulation is still unclear. To address this question, we presented tactile stimulation that fluctuated coherently and continuously at 4Hz with an auditory noise (either in-phase or anti-phase) and assessed its effect on the cortical processing and perception of an auditory signal embedded in that noise. Scalp-electroencephalography recordings revealed an enhancing effect of in-phase tactile stimulation on cortical responses phase-locked to the noise and a suppressive effect of anti-phase tactile stimulation on responses evoked by the auditory signal. Although these effects appeared to follow well-known principles of multisensory integration of discrete audio-tactile events, they were not accompanied by corresponding effects on behavioral measures of auditory signal perception. Our results indicate that continuous periodic tactile stimulation can enhance cortical processing of acoustically-induced fluctuations and mask cortical responses to an ongoing auditory signal. They further suggest that such sustained cortical effects can be insufficient for inducing sustained bottom-up auditory benefits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term effects of THC exposure on reward learning and motivated behavior in adolescent and adult male rats</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: The endocannabinoid system makes critical contributions to reward processing, motivation, and behavioral control. Repeated exposure to THC or other cannabinoid drugs can cause persistent adaptions in the endocannabinoid system and associated neural circuitry. It remains unclear how such treatments affect the way rewards are processed and pursued. Objective and methods: We examined if repeated THC exposure (5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) during adolescence or adulthood led to long-term changes in rats' capacity to flexibly encode and use action-outcome associations for goal-directed decision making. Effects on hedonic feeding and progressive ratio responding were also assessed. Results: THC exposure had no effect on rats' ability to flexibly select actions following reward devaluation. However, instrumental contingency degradation learning, which involves avoiding an action that is unnecessary for reward delivery, was augmented in rats with a history of adult but not adolescent THC exposure. THC-exposed rats also displayed more vigorous instrumental behavior in this study, suggesting a motivational enhancement. A separate experiment found that while THC exposure had no effect on hedonic feeding behavior, it increased rats' willingness to work for food on a progressive ratio schedule, an effect that was more pronounced when THC was administered to adults. Adolescent and adult THC exposure had opposing effects on the CB1-receptor dependence of progressive ratio performance, decreasing and increasing sensitivity to rimonabant-induced behavioral suppression, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that exposure to a translationally relevant THC exposure regimen induces long-lasting, age-dependent alterations in cognitive and motivational processes that regulate the pursuit of rewards.

                Prior knowledge facilitates our perception and goal-directed behaviors in the dynamic world, particularly when sensory input is lacking or noisy. However, the neural mechanisms underlying how prior expectation improves sensory-motor behaviors remain unknown. Herein, we examined neural activity in the middle temporal visual area (MT) while monkeys perform a smooth pursuit eye movement task with the prior expectation of the visual target's motion direction. We found that prior expectation discriminately reduced the MT neural responses depending on their preferred directions, only when the sensory evidence was weak. This response reduction effectively sharpens neural population direction tuning. Furthermore, the state-space analysis showed the task-specific prior expectation signals in population activity. In-silico simulations with a realistic MT population demonstrated that the sharpening of the tuning fully explained the biases and variabilities in smooth pursuit, suggesting neural computations in the sensory area alone can underpin the integration of prior knowledge and sensory evidence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microdissection and culturing of adult lateral entorhinal cortex layer II neurons from APP/PS1 Alzheimer model mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Primary neuronal cultures enable cell-biological studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), albeit typically non-neuron-specific. The first cortical neurons affected in AD reside in layer II of the lateralmost part of the entorhinal cortex, and they undergo early accumulation of intracellular amyloid-{beta}, form subsequent tau pathology, and start degenerating pre-symptomatically. These vulnerable entorhinal neurons uniquely express the glycoprotein reelin and provide selective inputs to the hippocampal memory system. Gaining a more direct access to study these neurons is therefore highly relevant. New method: We demonstrate a methodological approach for microdissection and long-term culturing of adult lateral entorhinal layer II-neurons from AD-model mice. Results: We maintain adult microdissected lateralmost entorhinal layer II-neurons beyond two months in culture. We show that they express neuronal markers, and that they are electrophysiologically active by 15 days in vitro and continuing beyond 2 months. Comparison with existing methods: Primary neurons are typically harvested from embryonic or early postnatal brains because such neurons are easier to culture compared to adult neurons. Methods to culture adult primary neurons have been reported, however, to our knowledge, culturing of adult entorhinal subregion-specific primary neurons from AD-model animals has not been reported. Conclusions: Our methodological approach offers a window to study initial pathological changes in the AD disease-cascade. This includes the study of proteinopathy, single-neuron changes, and network-level dysfunction.

                Background: Widescale evidence points to the involvement of glia and immune pathways in the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). AD-associated iPSC-derived glial cells show a diverse range of AD-related phenotypic states encompassing cytokine/chemokine release, phagocytosis and morphological profiles, but to date studies are limited to cells derived from PSEN1, APOE and APP mutations or sporadic patients. The aim of the current study was to successfully differentiate iPSC-derived microglia and astrocytes from patients harbouring an AD-causative PSEN2 (N141I) mutation and characterise the inflammatory and morphological profile of these cells. Methods: iPSCs from three healthy control individuals and three familial AD patients harbouring a heterozygous PSEN2 (N141I) mutation were used to derive astrocytes and microglia-like cells and cell identity and morphology were characterised through immunofluorescent microscopy. Cellular characterisation involved the stimulation of these cells by LPS and A{beta}42 and analysis of cytokine/chemokine release was conducted through ELISAs and multi-cytokine arrays. The phagocytic capacity of these cells was then indexed by the uptake of fluorescently labelled fibrillar A{beta}42. Results: AD-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells exhibited an atrophied and less complex morphological appearance than healthy controls. AD-derived astrocytes showed increased basal expression of GFAP, S100{beta} ; and increased secretion and phagocytosis of A{beta}42 while AD-derived microglia-like cells showed decreased IL-8 secretion compared to healthy controls. Upon immunological challenge AD-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells show exaggerated secretion of the pro-inflammatory IL-6, CXCL1, ICAM-1 and IL-8 from astrocytes and IL-18 and MIF from microglia. Conclusion: Our study showed, for the first time, the differentiation and characterisation of iPSC-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells harbouring a PSEN2 (N141I) mutation. PSEN2 (N141I)-mutant astrocytes and microglia-like cells presented with a primed phenotype characterised by reduced morphological complexity, exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and altered A{beta}42 production and phagocytosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elucidation of Amyloid-Beta's Gambit in Oligomerisation:Truncated Aβ fragments of residues Aβ1-23, Aβ1-24 and Aβ1-25 rapidly seed to form SDS-stable, low molecular weight Aβ oligomers that impair synaptic plasticity.</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyloid-beta (A{beta}) oligomers are considered an appealing therapeutic- and diagnostic target. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms associated with the pathological accumulation or structure of A{beta} oligomers remains an enigma to the scientific community. Here we demonstrate the strong seeding properties of unique A{beta} fragment signatures and show that the truncated A{beta}peptides of residues A{beta}1-23, A{beta}1-24 and A{beta}1-25, rapidly seed to form small, SDS-PAGE stable assemblies of ~5kDa to ~14kDa molecular mass range. Mass spectrometry analysis of SDS-PAGE fractionated and gel extracted oligomers revealed that the truncated A{beta} isoforms of residues 1-23 to 1-25 form stable entities with low molecular weight (LMW) oligomers, which strongly resemble the regularly reported A{beta} entities of putative dimeric or trimeric assemblies found in human post-mortem AD and Tg mouse brain extracts. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings in the mouse hippocampus indicate that LMW A{beta} assemblies formed by fragments A{beta}1-23 to A{beta}1-25 significantly impair long-term-potentiation (LTP) in the absence of full-length A{beta}1-42. Extensive antibody screening highlights the important observation, that the LMW A{beta} assemblies formed by these truncated A{beta} peptides escape immuno-detection using conventional, conformation specific antibodies but, more importantly, the clinical antibody aducanumab. Our novel findings suggest that there are new A{beta} target loopholes which can be exploited for the development of therapeutic antibodies with binding properties against stable target hotspots present in A{beta} oligomers. We provide here a first example of a new class of monoclonal antibody with unique binding properties against LMW A{beta} oligomers, in the absence of binding to large fibrillar A{beta} assemblies, or dense amyloid plaques. Our research supports a novel, unparalleled approach for targeting early, pathological A{beta} species during the insidious phase of AD and prior to the appearance of large oligomeric or protofibrilar assemblies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A scoping review on the use of consumer-grade EEG devices for research</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Commercial electroencephalography (EEG) devices have become increasingly available over the last decade. These devices have been used in a wide variety of fields ranging from engineering to cognitive neuroscience. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to chart peer-review articles that used currently available consumer-grade EEG devices to collect neural data. We provide an overview of the research conducted with these relatively more affordable and user-friendly devices. We also inform future research by exploring the current and potential scope of consumer-grade EEG. METHODS: We followed a five-stage methodological framework for a scoping review that included a systematic search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. We searched the following electronic databases: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. We charted study data according to application (BCI, experimental research, validation, signal processing, and clinical) and location of use as indexed by the first author's country. RESULTS: We identified 916 studies that used data recorded with consumer-grade EEG: 531 were reported in journal articles and 385 in conference papers. Emotiv devices were most used, followed by the NeuroSky MindWave, OpenBCI, interaXon Muse, and MyndPlay Mindband. The most common use was for brain-computer interfaces, followed by experimental research, signal processing, validation, and clinical purposes. CONCLUSIONS: Consumer-grade EEG has proven to be a useful tool for neuroscientific research and will likely continue to be used well into the future. Our study provides a comprehensive review of their application, as well as future directions for researchers who wish to use these devices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EEG is better left alone</a></h4>

              
                Automated preprocessing methods are critically needed to process the large publicly-available EEG databases, but the optimal approach remains unknown because we lack data quality metrics to compare them. Here, we designed a simple yet robust EEG data quality metric assessing the percentage of significant channels between two experimental conditions within a 100 ms post-stimulus time range. Because of volume conduction in EEG, given no noise, most brain-evoked related potentials (ERP) should be visible on every single channel. Using three publicly available collections of EEG data, we showed that, with the exceptions of high-pass filtering and bad channel interpolation, automated data corrections had no effect on or significantly decreased the percentage of significant channels. Referencing and advanced baseline removal methods were significantly detrimental to performance. Rejecting bad data segments or trials could not compensate for the loss in statistical power. Automated Independent Component Analysis rejection of eyes and muscles failed to increase performance reliably. We compared optimized pipelines for preprocessing EEG data maximizing ERP significance using the leading open-source EEG software: EEGLAB, FieldTrip, MNE, and Brainstorm. Only one pipeline performed significantly better than high-pass filtering the data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-surface targeting of fluorophores in Drosophila for rapid neuroanatomy visualization</a></h4>

              
                Visualizing neuronal anatomy often requires labor-intensive immunohistochemistry on fixed and dissected brains. To facilitate rapid anatomical staining in live brains, we used genetically targeted membrane tethers that covalently link fluorescent dyes for in vivo neuronal labeling. We generated a series of extracellularly trafficked small molecule tethering proteins, HaloTag-CD41 and SNAPf-CD4, which directly label transgene expressing cells with commercially available ligand substituted fluorescent dyes. We created stable transgenic Drosophila reporter lines which express extracellular HaloTag-CD4 and SNAPf-CD4 with LexA and Gal4 drivers. Expressing these enzymes in live Drosophila brains, we labeled the expression patterns of various Gal4 driver lines recapitulating histological staining in live brain tissue. Pan-neural expression of SNAPf-CD4 enabled registration of live brains to an existing template for anatomical comparisons. We predict that these extracellular platforms will not only become a valuable complement to existing anatomical methods but will also prove useful for future genetic targeting of other small molecule probes, drugs, and actuators.

	<p>The aim of this article was to present an important perspective on reading skill development. The perspective &amp;amp;lsquo;READ&amp;amp;rsquo; builds on the phonics approach which has been found to be most important in relation to reading achievement i.e., to teach children to break the reading code. In addition, READ builds on theories within learning and skill development. The Ericsson concept of &amp;amp;lsquo;deliberate practice&amp;amp;rsquo; refer to baseline measurements that provide a basis for follow-up and deliberate practice. The concept of &amp;amp;lsquo;flow&amp;amp;rsquo; is also of great importance where challenges are always in relation to the skills. It means that each child will be able to experience &amp;amp;lsquo;flow&amp;amp;rsquo; where mastery is the key word, feeling I CAN! When mastery is experienced, the dopamine hormone gives the feeling of reward. Stimuli, experience, and repetition is also a key word in the &amp;amp;lsquo;training hour&amp;amp;rsquo; where children get the possibility to strengthen the neural network that is used for specific skills which are trained. In this respect, the letter-sound knowledge is trained until the child has broken the reading code. The results from the first year in the school in Vestmannaeyjar in Iceland indicates that all the children were able to break the reading code or read simple words. In addition, 96% of the children were able to read sentences, and 88% where able to read text. These promising results are discussed in relation to Ericsson&amp;amp;rsquo;s and Csikszentmihalyi&amp;amp;rsquo;s important theories.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to have the potential to improve the motor recovery of the affected upper limbs in patients with stroke, and recently, several optimized tDCS methods have been proposed to magnify its effectiveness. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of personalized tDCS using brain MRI-based electrical field simulation and optimization, to enhance motor recovery of the upper limbs in the patients. This trial is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in the subacute to chronic rehabilitation phase. Forty-two adult stroke patients with unilateral upper limb involvement will be randomly allocated to three groups: (1) personalized tDCS with MRI-based electrical field simulation and optimized stimulation, (2) conventional tDCS with bihemispheric stimulation of the primary motor cortex, and (3) sham tDCS. All three groups will undergo 10 intervention sessions with 30 min of 2-mA intensity stimulation, during a regular upper limb rehabilitation program over two weeks. The primary outcome measure for the motor recovery of the upper limb impairment is the Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer assessment for the upper extremity score at the end of the intervention, and the secondary measures include changes in the motor evoked potentials, the frequency power and coherence of the electroencephalography, performance in activities of daily living, and adverse events with a 1-month follow-up assessment. The primary outcome will be analyzed on the intention-to-treat principle. There is a paucity of studies regarding the effectiveness of personalized and optimized tDCS that considers individual brain lesions and electrical field characteristics in the real world. No feasibility or pivotal studies have been performed in stroke patients using brain MRI, to determine a lesion-specific tDCS simulation and optimization that considers obstacles in the segmentation and analysis of the affected brain tissue, such as ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions. This trial will contribute to addressing the effectiveness and safety of personalized tDCS, using brain MRI-based electrical field simulation and optimization, to enhance the motor recovery of the upper limbs in patients with stroke.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is the second most common disease of the nervous system. Because of its high disability rate and the long course of the disease, it is a worldwide medical problem and social public health problem. Therefore, the timely detection and treatment of epilepsy are very important. Currently, medical professionals use their own diagnostic experience to identify seizures by visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Not only does it require a lot of time and effort, but the process is also very cumbersome. Machine learning-based methods have recently been proposed for epilepsy detection, which can help clinicians make rapid and correct diagnoses. However, these methods often require extracting the features of EEG signals before using the data. In addition, the selection of features often requires domain knowledge, and feature types also have a significant impact on the performance of the classifier. In this paper, a one-dimensional depthwise separable convolutional neural network and long short-term memory networks (1D DSCNN-LSTMs) model is proposed to identify epileptic seizures by autonomously extracting the features of raw EEG. On the UCI dataset, the performance of the proposed 1D DSCNN-LSTMs model is verified by cross-validation and time complexity comparison. Compared with other previous models, the experimental results show that the highest recognition rates of binary and quintuple classification are 99.57% and 81.30%, respectively. It can be concluded that the 1D DSCNN-LSTMs model proposed in this paper is an effective method to identify seizures based on EEG signals.</p>

	<p>The animal thromboembolic model of ischemia perfectly mimics human ischemic stroke which remains the leading cause of disability and mortality in humans. The development of new treatment strategies was therefore imperative. The purpose of this study is to improve the thromboembolic stroke model in rats in order to design experiments that use motor tests, and are in accordance with the 3R principles to prevent complications and maintain the same size of the infarct repeatedly. Tail vein dye application, a protective skull mask and a stress minimization protocol were used as additional modifications to the animal stroke model. These modifications significantly minimized the pain and stress severity of the procedures in this model. In our experimental group of Long-Evans rats, a photo-induced stroke was caused by the application of a photosensitive dye (Rose Bengal) activated with white-light irradiation, thus eliminating the need to perform a craniotomy. The animals&amp;amp;rsquo; neurological status was evaluated using a runway elevated test. Histological examination of the brain tissue was performed at 12, 24 and 48 h, and seven days post-stroke. Tissue examination revealed necrotic foci in the cortex and the subcortical regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere in all experimental groups. Changes in the area, width and depth of the necrotic focus were observed over time. All the experimental groups showed motor disturbances after stroke survival. In the proposed model, photochemically-induced stroke caused long-term motor deficits, showed high reproducibility and low mortality rates. Consequently, the animals could participate in motor tests which are particularly suitable for assessing the efficacy of neuro-regenerative therapies, while remaining in line with the latest trends in animal experimental design.</p>

     alt="Bulbar projecting subcortical GABAergic neurons send collateral branches extensively and selectively to primary olfactory cortical regions"/>
<p>Olfactory bulb projecting subcortical GABAergic neurons arising from the horizontal diagonal band also send collateral branches extensively to primary olfactory cortical regions. Thus, bulbar GABAergic projections may simultaneously modulate bulb and primary olfactory cortex through these extensive collateral branches.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Circuit operations of the olfactory bulb are modulated by higher order projections from multiple regions, many of which are themselves targets of bulbar output. Multiple glutamatergic regions project to the olfactory bulb, including the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), prefrontal cortex (PFC), piriform cortex (PC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and tenia tecta (TT). In contrast, only one region provides GABAergic projections to the bulb. These GABA neurons are located in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca extending posteriorly through the magnocellular preoptic nucleus to the nucleus of the lateral olfactory bulb. However, it was unclear whether bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons collaterallize projecting to other brain regions. To address this, we mapped collateral projections from bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons using intersectional strategies of viral and traditional tract tracers. This approach revealed bulbar projecting GABAergic neurons show remarkable specificity targeting other primary olfactory cortical regions exhibiting abundant collateral projections into the accessory olfactory bulb, AON, PFC, PC, and TT. The only "nonolfactory" region receiving collateral projections was sparse connectivity to the medial prefrontal orbital cortex. This suggests that basal forebrain inhibitory feedback also modulates glutamatergic feedback areas that are themselves prominent bulbar projection regions. Thus, inhibitory feedback may be simultaneously modulating both synaptic processing of olfactory information in the bulb and associational processing of olfactory information from primary olfactory cortex. We hypothesize that these olfactory GABAergic feedback neurons are a regulator of the entire olfactory system.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A circuit from the locus coeruleus to the anterior cingulate cortex modulates offspring interactions in mice</a></h4>

              
                Social sensitivity to other individuals in distress is crucial for survival. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a structure involved in making behavioral choices and is influenced by observed pain or distress. Nevertheless, our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying this sensitivity is incomplete. Here, we reveal unexpected sex-dependent activation of ACC when parental mice respond to distressed pups by returning them to the nest ('pup retrieval'). We observe sex differences in the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory ACC neurons during parental care, and inactivation of ACC excitatory neurons increased pup neglect. Locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline in ACC during pup retrieval, and inactivation of the LC-ACC pathway disrupts parental care. We conclude that ACC maintains sex-dependent sensitivity to pup distress under LC modulation. We propose that ACC's involvement in parenting presents an opportunity to identify neural circuits that support sensitivity to the emotional distress of others.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integrated proteomics reveals the landscape of autophagy degradation in human neurons and autophagy receptors regulating neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a catabolic and self-degradative process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Malfunctional autophagy is implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact role and targets of autophagy in human neurons remain elusive. Here we reported a systematic investigation of neuronal autophagy targets through integrated proteomics. Deep proteomic profiling of multiple autophagy-deficient lines of human induced neurons, mouse brains, and LC3-interactome uncovers a role of neuronal autophagy in targeting primarily endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, endosome, Golgi apparatus, synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins, and cAMP-PKA pathway, for degradation. Tubular ER and specific SV proteins are significant autophagy cargos in the axons. Functional validation identified calumenin as an ER resident autophagy receptor and illuminated a role of autophagy in regulating PKA and neuronal activity through AKAP11-mediated degradation. Our study thus reveals the landscape of autophagy degradation in human neurons and offers molecular insight into mechanisms of neurological disorders linked to autophagy deficiency.

	<p>Recent scientific evidence supports the idea that foot plantar stimulation increases the functional connectivity of brain regions involved in visuo-spatial and sensory-motor integration. In this before&amp;amp;ndash;after, non-randomised intervention study we assessed the change in several gait and postural parameters using inertial sensor measurements after acute plantar stimulation using custom 3D-printed insoles. The pilot study was performed on 22 institutionalised, older individuals with a high comorbidity burden who either walked autonomously or with the help of a cane. The intensity of the effects in the first mechanical plantar stimulation session (at one week) strongly predicted a change in the 180&amp;amp;deg; turn duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and the standard deviation of the step duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) during the timed up-and-go test. Based on these effects, researchers also predicted decreases in some postural parameters such as the root mean square of displacement on the anterior&amp;amp;ndash;posterior axis (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Thus, these preliminary findings provide a strong rationale for performing controlled clinical trials with larger samples to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of mechanical plantar stimulation in frail elderly individuals.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to explore changes in the white matter microstructure in herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) patients and to estimate the correlation of these changes with clinical data. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected from 33 HZ patients, 32 PHN patients, and 35 well-matched healthy controls (HCs). Subsequently, these data were analyzed by automated fiber quantification (AFQ) to accurately locate alterations in the white matter microstructure. Compared with HCs, HZ and PHN patients both showed a wide range of changes in the diffusion properties of fiber tracts. HZ patients exhibited changes primarily in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), whereas PHN patients predominantly exhibited changes in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. The bilateral SLF and the left corticospinal tract were altered in the PHN patients compared with HZ patients. In addition, PHN patients showed a trend toward more expansive white matter alterations compared with those observed in HZ patients; additionally, in PHN patients, changes in the left cingulum cingulate were significantly correlated with changes in emotion and the duration of disease. These findings may help to elucidate the transformation from HZ to PHN and provide new ideas regarding the reasons for intractable neuropathic pain in PHN.</p>

	<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key modulator of neuroplasticity and has an important role in determining the susceptibility to severe psychiatric disorder with a significant neurodevelopmental component such as major psychoses. Indeed, a potential association between BDNF serum levels and schizophrenia (SCZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) has been tested in diverse studies and a considerable amount of them found reduced BDNF levels in these disorders. Here, we aimed at testing the association of BDNF serum levels with several demographic, clinical, and psychometric measures in 105 patients with SCZ and SAD, assessing the moderating effect of genetic variants within the BDNF gene. We also verified whether peripheral BDNF levels differed between patients with SCZ and SAD. Our findings revealed that BDNF serum levels are significantly lower in patients affected by SCZ and SAD presenting more severe depressive symptomatology. This finding awaits replication in future independent studies and points to BDNF as a possible prognostic indicator in major psychoses.</p>

	<p>Alcohol is one of the most commonly used illicit substances among pregnant women. Clinical and experimental studies have revealed that prenatal alcohol exposure affects fetal brain development and ultimately results in the persistent impairment of the offspring&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive functions. Despite this, the rate of alcohol use among pregnant women has been progressively increasing. Various aspects of human and animal behavior, including learning and memory, are dependent on complex interactions between multiple mechanisms, such as receptor function, mitochondrial function, and protein kinase activation, which are especially vulnerable to alterations during the developmental period. Thus, the exploration of the mechanisms that are altered in response to prenatal alcohol exposure is necessary to develop an understanding of how homeostatic imbalance and various long-term neurobehavioral impairments manifest following alcohol abuse during pregnancy. There is evidence that prenatal alcohol exposure results in vast alterations in mechanisms such as long-term potentiation, mitochondrial function, and protein kinase activation in the brain of offspring. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are very few recent reviews that focus on the cognitive effects of prenatal alcohol exposure and the associated mechanisms. Therefore, in this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the recently reported alterations to various mechanisms following alcohol exposure during pregnancy, and to draw potential associations with behavioral changes in affected offspring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Emerging mitochondrial‐mediated mechanisms involved in oligodendrocyte development</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia of the central nervous system and are generated after oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) transition into pre-oligodendrocytes and then into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Myelin is essential for proper signal transmission within the nervous system and axonal metabolic support. Although the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that support the differentiation, survival, integration, and subsequent myelination of appropriate axons have been well investigated, little is known about how mitochondria-related pathways such as mitochondrial dynamics, bioenergetics, and apoptosis finely tune these developmental events. Previous findings suggest that changes to mitochondrial morphology act as an upstream regulatory mechanism of neural stem cell (NSC) fate decisions. Whether a similar mechanism is engaged during OPC differentiation has yet to be elucidated. Maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics is vital for regulating cellular bioenergetics, functional mitochondrial networks, and the ability of cells to distribute mitochondria to subcellular locations, such as the growing processes of oligodendrocytes. Myelination is an energy-consuming event, thus, understanding the interplay between mitochondrial dynamics, metabolism, and apoptosis will provide further insight into mechanisms that mediate oligodendrocyte development in healthy and disease states. Here we will provide a concise overview of oligodendrocyte development and discuss the potential contribution of mitochondrial mitochondrial-mediated mechanisms to oligodendrocyte bioenergetics and development.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task Demands Differentiate Regional Depth-Dependent Activity Profiles Within the Ventral Visual Pathway</a></h4>

              
                FMRI has become a key tool for human neuroscience. At ultra-high field (=> 7 Tesla) it is possible to acquire images with submillimeter spatial precision, which allows examinations of mesoscale functional organization. Studying the brain at this scale does not come without its challenges, however. To tackle some of these challenges, we propose an approach that builds upon task modulations to identical visual stimuli and the simultaneous imaging of distal areas of varying complexity across the cortical hierarchy. Specifically, we record BOLD responses elicited by face stimuli during a stimulus relevant and a stimulus irrelevant task across cortical depths in V1, Occipital Face (OFA) and Fusiform Face area (FFA). We observed that task-related top-down modulations were larger in the inner compared to the outer layers of V1; and in the outer compared to the inner layers in the FFA. Our findings are consistent with animal reports of feedback exchange between deeper and superficial layers and with the notion of apical dendritic amplification as a key mechanism of conscious perception. Our approach showcases the potential of laminar-fMRI to explore large scale network activity and represents a promising step towards characterizing laminar functional profiles in humans for complex, cognitively meaningful, and socially relevant stimuli such as faces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating methods for measuring background connectivity in slow event-related functional MRI designs</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is widely used for measuring functional interactions between brain regions, significantly contributing to our understanding of large-scale brain networks and brain-behavior relationships. Furthermore, idiosyncratic patterns of resting-state connections can be leveraged to identify individuals and predict individual differences in clinical symptoms, cognitive abilities, and other individual factors. Idiosyncratic connectivity patters are thought to persist across task states, suggesting task-based fMRI can be similarly leveraged for individual differences analyses. Here, we tested the degree to which functional interactions occurring in the background of a task during slow event-related fMRI parallel or differ from those captured during resting-state fMRI. We compared two approaches for removing task-evoked activity from task-based fMRI: (1) applying a low-pass filter to remove task-related frequencies in the signal, or (2) extracting residuals from a general linear model (GLM) that accounts for task-evoked responses. We found that the organization of large-scale cortical networks and individual's idiosyncratic connectivity patterns are preserved during task-based fMRI. In contrast, individual differences in connection strength can vary more substantially between rest and task. Compared to low-pass filtering, background connectivity obtained from GLM residuals produced idiosyncratic connectivity patterns and individual differences in connection strength that more resembled rest. However, all background connectivity measures were highly similar when derived from the low-pass filtered signal or GLM residuals, indicating that both methods are suitable for measuring background connectivity. Together, our results highlight new avenues for the analysis of task-based fMRI datasets and the utility of each background connectivity method.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrusion of pathological synergies does not explain impaired 3D arm movements in subacute stroke</a></h4>

              
                It has long been of interest what the contribution of pathological synergies is to abnormal motor control of the arm after stroke. The flexor synergy is defined as unwanted co-activation of flexion at the shoulder and elbow joints. Here we used a video-based, marker-less 3D pose-estimation kinematic model to examine two reaching tasks with different requirements for elbow flexion. Twenty-eight sub-acute (2-12 weeks) post-stroke subjects and sixteen healthy controls performed both a cup to mouth task, requiring shoulder and elbow flexion (within flexor synergy), and a reaching task, requiring shoulder flexion and elbow extension (outside of flexor synergy). Using kinematic analysis of the hand and of elbow/shoulder joint angles, we assessed both overall task performance and intrusion of pathological synergies. Motor impairment, strength and spasticity were measured using established clinical scales. Performance in both tasks was impaired to a similar degree in the patients compared to controls. This lack of performance difference for the in- vs. out-of-flexor synergy tasks was consistent with our finding of no evidence for intrusion of a flexor synergy in the reaching task. Specifically, for the reaching task there was no difference between patients and controls either in time spent within-movement in flexor synergy or in the correlation between shoulder and elbow angles when the shoulder was flexing. A regression analysis indicated that the only significant predictor of poor task performance was degree of weakness. Notably, even though we found no kinematic evidence for post-stroke intrusive flexor synergies, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), which was devised to quantify post-stroke synergies, was markedly abnormal. This seeming contradiction is resolved by the observation that abnormal coupling at the shoulder and elbow can occur due to weakness alone, and it is this "synergy mimic" that leads to a low FMA score. The finding that FMA can be abnormal for two qualitatively distinct forms of impaired inter-joint coordination has implications for the interpretation of longitudinal studies that use this single measure. In the sub-acute stage of stroke, intrusion of abnormal synergies is not the reason for impaired reaching.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divisively normalized neuronal processing of uncertain visual feedback for visuomotor learning</a></h4>

              
                When encountering a visual error during a reaching movement, the motor system improves the motor command for the subsequent trial. The degree of improvement is well-known to be degraded with visual error uncertainty, which is considered evidence that the motor system optimally estimates the error. However, it remains unclear how such statistical computation is accomplished. Here, we propose an alternative motor learning scheme implemented with a divisive normalization (DN) mechanism. This scheme assumes that when an uncertain visual error is provided by multiple cursors, the motor system processes the error conveyed by each cursor and integrates the information using DN. The DN scheme can reproduce the patterns of learning response when 1, 2, or 3 cursors are concurrently displayed and predict how the increase in the visual error uncertainty degrades the learning response. Our proposed scheme provides a novel view of how the motor learning system updates the motor command according to visual error information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha suppression during prehension indicates neural motor drive inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Changes in alpha band activity (8-12 Hz) have been shown to indicate the inhibition of engagement of brain regions during cognitive tasks, reflecting real-time cognitive load. Despite this, its feasibility to be used in a more dynamic environment with ongoing motor corrections has not been studied. This research used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore how different brain regions are engaged during a simple grasp and lift task where unexpected changes to the properties of the object are introduced. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show alpha activity changes related to motor error correction occur only in motor-related areas (i.e. central areas), but not in error processing areas (ie. fronto-parietal network). This suggests that oscillations over motor areas could reflect inhibition of motor drive related to motor error correction, thus being a potential cortical electrophysiological biomarker for the process, and not solely as a proxy for cognitive demands. This observation is particularly relevant in scenarios where these signals are used to evaluate high cognitive demands co-occurring with high levels of motor errors and corrections, such as prosthesis use. The establishment of electrophysiological biomarkers of mental resource allocation during movement and cognition can help identify indicators of mental workload and motor drive, which may be useful for improving brain-machine interfaces.

                Many visual tasks involve looking for specific object features. But we also often solve generic tasks where we look for a specific property, such as finding an odd item, deciding if two items are same, or if an object has symmetry. How do we solve such tasks? Building on simple neural rules, we show that displays with repeating elements can be distinguished from heterogeneous displays using a property we denote visual homogeneity. In behavior, visual homogeneity predicted response times on visual search and symmetry tasks. Brain imaging during these tasks revealed that visual homogeneity in both tasks is highly localized to a region in the object-selective cortex. Thus, a novel image property, visual homogeneity, is encoded in a localized brain region, to solve generic visual tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A cortical circuit for orchestrating oromanual food manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Cooperative forelimb and mouth movements during eating contribute to diet selection among vertebrates including the oromanual manipulatory skills in rodents and primates. Whereas spinal and brainstem circuits implement forelimb and orofacial actions, whether there is a specialized cortical circuit that flexibly assembles these to achieve cross-body and oromanual coordination for skilled manipulation remains unclear. Here we discover a cortical region and its cell-type-specific circuitry that orchestrates body postures and oromanual coordination for food manipulation in mice. An optogenetic screen of cortical areas and projection neuron types identified a rostral forelimb-orofacial area (RFO), wherein activation of pyramidal tract (PTFezf2) and intratelencephalic (ITPlxnD1) neurons induced concurrent posture, forelimb and orofacial eating-like movements. In a pasta-eating behavior, RFO PTFezf2 and ITPlxnD1 activity were closely correlated with picking up the pasta, adopting a sitting posture, oromanual manipulation, and hand-assisted biting. RFO inactivation and inhibition of RFO PTsFezf2 and ITsPlxnD1 impaired posture and oromanual coordination, leading to deficient pasta manipulation and biting. RFO is reciprocally connected to forelimb and orofacial sensorimotor areas as well as insular and visceral areas. Within this network, ITsPlxnD1 project bilaterally to the entire network and the ventrolateral striatum and PTsFezf2 project to multiple subcortical areas associated with forelimb and orofacial control. These results suggest that ITsPlxnD1 select and coordinate the feeding program involving multiple body parts and PTsFezf2 implement the fine details of movements. Our study reveals a neural circuit basis of hand-mouth coordination for object manipulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Higher-order thalamic nuclei facilitate the generalization and maintenance of spike-and-wave discharges in absence seizures</a></h4>

              
                Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), generated by the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) network, are pathological, large amplitude oscillations and the hallmark of absence seizures (ASs). SWDs begin in a cortical initiation network in both humans and animal models, including the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), where it is located in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). The behavioral manifestation of an AS occurs when SWDs spread from the cortical initiation site to the whole brain, however, the mechanisms behind this rapid propagation remain unclear. Here we investigated these processes beyond the principal CTC network, in higher-order (HO) thalamic nuclei (lateral posterior (LP) and posterior (PO) nuclei) since their diffuse connectivity and known facilitation of intracortical communications make these nuclei key candidates to support SWD generation and maintenance. In freely moving GAERS, multi-site LFP in LP, PO and multiple cortical regions revealed a novel feature of SWDs: during SWDs there are short periods (named SWD-breaks) when cortical regions far from S1, such the primary visual cortex (V1), become transiently unsynchronized from the ongoing EEG rhythm. Inactivation of HO nuclei with local muscimol injections or optogenetic perturbation of HO nuclei activity increased the occurrence of SWD-breaks and the former intervention also increased the SWD propagation-time from S1. The neural underpinnings of these findings were explored further by silicon probe recordings from single units of PO which uncovered two previously unknown groups of excitatory neurons based on their burst firing dynamics at SWD onset. Moreover, a switch from tonic to burst firing at SWD onset was shown to be an important feature since it was much less prominent for non-generalized events, i.e. SWDs that remained local to S1. Additionally, one group of neurons showed a reverse of this switch during SWD-breaks, demonstrating the importance of this firing pattern throughout the SWD. In summary, these results support the view that multiple HO thalamic nuclei are utilized at SWD onset and contribute to cortical synchrony throughout the paroxysmal discharge.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by intraneuronal inclusions of alpha-synuclein (-Syn), a strong neuroinflammatory component and neurodegeneration. Human genetic association studies have shown that variants affecting quantity and quality of major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) have implications in PD susceptibility and it was recently shown that PD patients have -Syn specific T lymphocytes in circulation. The class II transactivator (Ciita) is the major regulator of MHCII expression and reduced Ciita expression has been shown to increase -Syn induced neurodegeneration and pathology in vivo. Here we show, using flow cytometry in an -Syn overexpression model combined with -Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF), that congenic rats with naturally occurring differences in Ciita expression have altered local and peripheral immune populations. Lower Ciita levels are associated with increased percentages of microglia and circulating myeloid cells being MHCII+ but with lower levels of MHCII on individual cells. Additionally, lower Ciita levels was associated to higher TNF levels in serum, trends of higher CD86 levels in circulating myeloid population and a lower CD4/CD8 T lymphocyte ratio. Taken together, these results indicate that Ciita regulates serum TNF levels and baseline immune populations which could mediate an increased susceptibility to PD-like pathology.

	<p>(1) Objective: Resting-state fMRI studies have indicated that juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) could cause widespread functional connectivity disruptions between the cerebrum and cerebellum. However, the directed influences or effective connectivities (ECs) between these brain regions are poorly understood. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the ECs between the cerebrum and cerebellum in patients with new-onset JME. (2) Methods: Thirty-four new-onset JME patients and thirty-four age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. We compared the degree centrality (DC) between the two groups to identify intergroup differences in whole-brain functional connectivity. Then, we used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to explore JME-caused changes in EC between cerebrum regions and cerebellum regions. Furthermore, we applied a correlation analysis to identify associations between aberrant EC and disease severity in patients with JME. (3) Results: Compared to HCs, patients with JME showed significantly increased DC in the left cerebellum posterior lobe (CePL.L), the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG.R) and the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG.R), and decreased DC in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.L) and the left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L). The patients also showed unidirectionally increased ECs from cerebellum regions to the cerebrum regions, including from the CePL.L to the right precuneus (PreCU.R), from the left cerebellum anterior lobe (CeAL.L) to the ITG.R, from the right cerebellum posterior lobe (CePL.R) to the IFG.L, and from the left inferior semi-lunar lobule of the cerebellum (CeISL.L) to the SFG.R. Additionally, the EC from the CeISL.L to the SFG.R was negatively correlated with the disease severity. (4) Conclusions: JME patients showed unidirectional EC disruptions from the cerebellum to the cerebrum, and the negative correlation between EC and disease severity provides a new perspective for understanding the cerebro-cerebellar neural circuit mechanisms in JME.</p>

	<p>Although emotional expressions conveyed by the eye regions are processed efficiently, little is known regarding the relationship between emotional processing of isolated eye regions and temporal attention. In this study, we conducted three rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiments with varying task demands (emotion discrimination, eye detection, eyes ignored) related to the first target (T1) to investigate how the perception of emotional valence in the eye region (T1: happy, neutral, fearful) impacts the identification of a second target (T2: neutral houses). Event-related potential (ERP) findings indicated that fearful stimuli reliably increased N170 amplitude regardless of the emotional relevance of task demands. The P3 component exhibited enhanced responses to happy and fearful stimuli in the emotion discrimination task and to happy eye regions in the eye detection task. Analysis of T2-related ERPs within the attentional blink period revealed that T2 houses preceded by fearful and happy stimuli elicited larger N2 and P3 amplitudes than those preceded by neutral stimuli only in the emotion discrimination task. Together, these findings indicate that attention to affective content conveyed by the eyes can not only amplify the perceptual analysis of emotional eye regions but also facilitate the processing of a subsequent target.</p>

	<p>Relatively little research has examined sex differences among people affected by obesity. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between negative emotions and eating behaviors, taking into account the role of biological sex. The final sample consists of 200 candidates for bariatric surgery, 62 males (31%) and 138 females (69%), aged from 18 to 60 years (M = 40.71; SD = 11.30). Participants were screened with the Binge Scale Questionnaire (BSQ) and individually evaluated with the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Correlations were calculated by splitting the sample by sex. Analyses of the relationship between negative emotions and eating behavior showed a large number of correlations in the sample of women and few correlations in men. The differences between women and men with obesity suggest the need for a different theoretical construct that explains the differentiated mechanisms of functioning and lays the foundations for specific therapeutic paths.</p>

	<p>Background: Pneumonia is common in patients with tracheostomy and dysphagia. However, the influence of dysphagia and tracheostomy on pneumonia in patients with stroke remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors related to pneumonia, and the association between dysphagia, tracheostomy and pneumonia in patients with stroke was investigated. Methods: Patients with stroke who experienced tracheostomy and dysphagia were included and divided into two groups based on record of pneumonia at discharge. Clinical manifestations and physical examination were used to diagnose pneumonia, whereas clinical swallowing examination, and videofluoroscopy swallowing studies (VFSS) were used to evaluate swallowing function. Results: There were significant differences between the pneumonia group and the no pneumonia group in total tracheostomy time (6.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.9 vs. 4.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 months, p = 0.003), number of instances of ventilator support (0.41 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.49 vs. 0.18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.38, p = 0.007), PAS score (5.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.92 vs. 4.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.79, p = 0.039), impaired or absent cough reflex (76.4 vs. 55.6%, p = 0.035), oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (60.6 vs. 40.8%, p = 0.047), length of hospital stay (36.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.2 vs. 30.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.7 days, p = 0.025) and direct medical costs (15,702.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14,244.61 vs. 10,923.99 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7250.14 United States dollar [USD], p = 0.042). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the total tracheostomy time (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.966&amp;amp;ndash;12.922, p = 0.001), impaired or absent cough reflex (95% CI, 0.084&amp;amp;ndash;0.695, p = 0.008), and oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (95% CI, 1.087&amp;amp;ndash;8.148, p = 0.034) were risk factors for pneumonia. Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis demonstrated that PAS scores were significantly correlated with cough reflex dysfunction (r = 0.277, p = 0.03), oropharyngeal phase dysfunction (r = 0.318, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and total tracheostomy time (r = 0.178, p = 0.045). The oropharyngeal phase dysfunction was significantly correlated with cough reflex (r = 0.549, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and UES opening (r = 0.643, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Tracheostomy and dysphagia increased the risk of pneumonia in patients with stroke. Total tracheostomy time, duration of ventilator support, degree of penetration and aspiration, and oropharyngeal phase dysfunction are risk factors. Given this, we also found that there may be a correlation between tracheostomy and dysphagia.</p>

	<p>Objective: This paper reports the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination features of 15 Chinese patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmunity. Methods: From June 2016 to December 2019, patients suspected to have neurological autoimmune disease after having their serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested for conventional neural antibodies were scanned for additional autoantibodies by immunohistochemistry. Samples that showed a characteristic immunoreactive pattern reminiscent of the GFAP of astrocytes were selected and confirmed by cell-based assay using cells-expressing human GFAP&amp;amp;alpha;. Results: A total of 15 patients (eight male and seven female) with a median age at onset of 53 years (range 28&amp;amp;ndash;72) were identified as GFAP-IgG-positive. Fourteen cases had GFAP-IgG detected in the CSF, while serum GFAP-IgG was detected in 11 cases. Eleven of the fifteen patients (73.3%) presented with an acute monophasic course, of which 10 (90.9%) had antecedent flu-like symptoms. The predominant phenotype was meningoencephalitis (46.7%), followed by meningoencephalomyelitis in 40% of the cases. The most common clinical features included long tract signs, brainstem symptoms, tremors, headaches, and psychiatric symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the enhancement of the meninges, the surface of the brainstem, the cerebellum, and the spinal cord as predominant. Inflammatory CSF showed mild lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis with a median of 51/&amp;amp;mu;L and elevated protein with a median of 87.5 mg/dL. Five patients had coexisting antibodies, including NMDAR-IgG in three patients and Yo and MOG-IgG in one patient each. One patient underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy, and the neuropathology diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. One patient had ovarian teratoma. Eleven of the fifteen (73.3%) patients received both intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. Among them, three patients also received immunosuppressive agents later. During a two-year follow-up, 9 of the 15 (60%) patients achieved complete clinical remission. Conclusions: The clinical presentation of GFAP astrocytopathy is heterogeneous. It can be characterized by an acute monophasic course and a chronic relapsing course. Tremors are a prominent clinical manifestation in patients with an acute monophasic course with GFAP-IgG antibodies only. Most patients responded well to immunotherapy. In patients with GFAP autoimmunity, presenting with a chronic relapsing course, one should actively search for immunogenic factors and the culprit antibodies. In the case of primary central nervous system lymphoma, GFAP autoimmunity does not always equate to autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy.</p>

	<p>Ceratonia siliqua L. (Carob tree) is a Mediterranean evergreen, well known for its medicinal properties. The different parts of Carob were proven to exert antidiabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiproliferative effects. Hence, the present paper aims to validate the positive correlation between the high antioxidant activity of carob seed peels and the improvement of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Materials &amp;amp;amp; Methods: The antioxidant activity was carried out using the &amp;amp;beta;-carotene test. Methionine and carob seed peels (CSP) extracts (50 and 100 mg/kg) were orally administrated to mice for a week. After administration, behavioral tests were assessed using the Y-maze, elevated plus maze, and forced swimming tests, as well as the novel object recognition task. Furthermore, the oxidative stress status was evaluated by analyzing the levels of the antioxidant enzymes: Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde levels (MDA). Results: Both extracts exhibited remarkable antioxidant activity and showed antibacterial effect against Gram-positive bacteria tested (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative). Therefore, Escherichia coli was very resistant. The behavioral tests proved the efficacy of CSP in enhancing the cognitive impairment of animal models of schizophrenia. Hence, the stated correlation between oxidative stress and schizophrenia was confirmed by the increased SOD and GPx activities and the decreased MDA level. Conclusions: The present study gave further confirmation of the potential correlation between oxidative stress and the development of psychiatric disorders and highlighted the use of natural antioxidants, especially Ceratonia siliqua L. in the improvement of cognitive impairment in the dementia of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The GAITFAST study (gait recovery in patients after acute ischemic stroke) aims to compare the effects of treadmill-based robot-assisted gait training (RTGT) and therapist-assisted treadmill gait training (TTGT) added to conventional physical therapy in first-ever ischemic stroke patients. GAITFAST (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04824482) was designed as a single-blind single-center prospective randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint of gait speed recovery up to 6 months after ischemic stroke. A total of 120 eligible and enrolled participants will be randomly allocated (1:1) in TTGT or RTGT. All enrolled patients will undergo a 2-week intensive inpatient rehabilitation including TTGT or RTGT followed by four clinical assessments (at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation 8&amp;amp;ndash;15 days after stroke onset, after 2 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after the first assessment). Every clinical assessment will include the assessment of gait speed and walking dependency, fMRI activation measures, neurological and sensorimotor impairments, and gait biomechanics. In a random selection (1:2) of the 120 enrolled patients, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data will be acquired and analyzed. This study will provide insight into the mechanisms behind poststroke gait behavioral changes resulting from intensive rehabilitation including assisted gait training (RTGT or TTGT) in early subacute IS patients.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this paper is to re-examine the relationship between grammars and processing systems in light of the various forms of experimental research (especially of an electrophysiological nature) that has been conducted in the last fifteen years or so. First, the notion of &amp;amp;lsquo;processing strategy&amp;amp;rsquo; or &amp;amp;lsquo;heuristics processing&amp;amp;rsquo; is considered followed by a discussion of structures of great morphosyntactic complexity that parsing systems seem to tackle by simply respecting complex grammatical laws, instead of by resorting to shortcuts. Then, grammatical illusions and what these can teach us about the processing of grammar are considered. It is argued that illusions allow us to discern a few explanatory principles that may redefine the way we see parser&amp;amp;ndash;grammar relations. Among these is the idea that how long illusions last in the online-to-offline transition depends in part on their &amp;amp;lsquo;templatability&amp;amp;rsquo;, that is, the ease with which they become gestaltic templates. Another key idea is that some apparent illusions are in fact nothing more than grammar contemplated at work as in slow motion.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Novel estimates reveal subnational heterogeneities in disease-relevant contact patterns in the United States</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Casey F. Breen, Ayesha S. Mahmud, Dennis M. Feehan</p>

Population contact patterns fundamentally determine the spread of directly transmitted airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Reliable quantitative estimates of contact patterns are therefore critical to modeling and reducing the spread of directly transmitted infectious diseases and to assessing the effectiveness of interventions intended to limit risky contacts. While many countries have used surveys and contact diaries to collect national-level contact data, local-level estimates of age-specific contact patterns remain rare. Yet, these local-level data are critical since disease dynamics and public health policy typically vary by geography. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a flexible model that can estimate age-specific contact patterns at the subnational level by combining national-level interpersonal contact data with other locality-specific data sources using multilevel regression with poststratification (MRP). We estimate daily contact matrices for all 50 US states and Washington DC from April 2020 to May 2021 using national contact data from the US. Our results reveal important state-level heterogeneities in levels and trends of contacts across the US over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for the spread of respiratory diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stability and learning in excitatory synapses by nonlinear inhibitory plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christoph Miehl, Julijana Gjorgjieva</p>

Synaptic changes are hypothesized to underlie learning and memory formation in the brain. But Hebbian synaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses on its own is unstable, leading to either unlimited growth of synaptic strengths or silencing of neuronal activity without additional homeostatic mechanisms. To control excitatory synaptic strengths, we propose a novel form of synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. Using computational modeling, we suggest two key features of inhibitory plasticity, dominance of inhibition over excitation and a nonlinear dependence on the firing rate of postsynaptic excitatory neurons whereby inhibitory synaptic strengths change with the same sign (potentiate or depress) as excitatory synaptic strengths. We demonstrate that the stable synaptic strengths realized by this novel inhibitory plasticity model affects excitatory/inhibitory weight ratios in agreement with experimental results. Applying a disinhibitory signal can gate plasticity and lead to the generation of receptive fields and strong bidirectional connectivity in a recurrent network. Hence, a novel form of nonlinear inhibitory plasticity can simultaneously stabilize excitatory synaptic strengths and enable learning upon disinhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A phylogenetic approach to inferring the order in which mutations arise during cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuan Gao, Jeff Gaither, Julia Chifman, Laura Kubatko</p>

Although the role of evolutionary process in cancer progression is widely accepted, increasing attention is being given to the evolutionary mechanisms that can lead to differences in clinical outcome. Recent studies suggest that the temporal order in which somatic mutations accumulate during cancer progression is important. Single-cell sequencing (SCS) provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect that the mutation order has on cancer progression and treatment effect. However, the error rates associated with single-cell sequencing are known to be high, which greatly complicates the task. We propose a novel method for inferring the order in which somatic mutations arise within an individual tumor using noisy data from single-cell sequencing. Our method incorporates models at two levels in that the evolutionary process of somatic mutation within the tumor is modeled along with the technical errors that arise from the single-cell sequencing data collection process. Through analyses of simulations across a wide range of realistic scenarios, we show that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches for identifying mutation order. Most importantly, our method provides a unique means to capture and quantify the uncertainty in the inferred mutation order along a given phylogeny. We illustrate our method by analyzing data from colorectal and prostate cancer patients, in which our method strengthens previously reported mutation orders. Our work is an important step towards producing meaningful prediction of mutation order with high accuracy and measuring the uncertainty of predicted mutation order in cancer patients, with the potential to lead to new insights about the evolutionary trajectories of cancer.

                <p>Cerebral cortical encephalitis (CCE) is a recently described myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) phenotype. In this observational retrospective study, we characterized 19 CCE patients (6.7% of our MOGAD cohort). Headache (n = 15, 79%), seizures (n = 13, 68%), and encephalopathy (n = 12, 63%) were frequent. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed unilateral (n = 12, 63%) or bilateral (n = 7, 37%) cortical T2 hyperintensity and leptomeningeal enhancement (n = 17, 89%). N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor autoantibodies coexisted in 2 of 15 tested (13%). CCE pathology (n = 2) showed extensive subpial cortical demyelination (n = 2), microglial reactivity (n = 2), and inflammatory infiltrates (perivascular, n = 1; meningeal, n = 1). Most received high-dose steroids (n = 17, 89%), and all improved, but 3 had CCE relapses. This study highlights the CCE spectrum and provides insight into its pathogenesis.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Telemedicine is frequently used to provide remote neurological expertise for acute stroke workup and was associated with better functional outcomes when combined with a stroke unit system-of-care. We investigated whether such system-of-care yields additional benefits when implemented on top of neurological competence already available onsite.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Quality improvement measures were implemented within a “hub-and-spoke” teleneurology network in 11 hospitals already provided with onsite or telestroke expertise. Measures included dedicated units for neurological emergencies, standardization of procedures, multiprofessional training, and quality-of-care monitoring. Intervention effects were investigated in a controlled study enrolling patients insured at 3 participating statutory health insurances diagnosed with acute stroke or other neurological emergencies. Outcomes during the intervention period between November 2017 and February 2020 were compared with those pre-intervention between October 2014 and March 2017. To control for temporal trends, we compared outcomes of patients with respective diagnoses in 11 hospitals of the same region. Primary outcome was the composite of up-to-90-day death, new disability with the need of ambulatory or nursing home care, expressed by adjusted hazard ratio (aHR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,418 patients post-implementation (55% female, mean age 76.7 ± 12.8 year) and 2,306 patients pre-implementation (56%, 75.8 ± 13.0 year, respectively). The primary outcome occurred in 479/1,418 (33.8%) patients post-implementation and in 829/2,306 (35.9%) pre-implementation. The aHR for the primary outcome was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.04) with no improvement seen in non-participating hospitals between post- versus pre-implementation periods (aHR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95–1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Implementation of a multicomponent system-of-care was associated with a lower risk of poor outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of strokes are embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS). Undetected atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an important cause. Yet, oral anticoagulation in unselected ESUS patients failed in secondary stroke prevention. Guidance on effective AF detection is lacking. Here, we introduce a novel, non-invasive AF risk assessment after ESUS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Catch-Up ESUS is an investigator-initiated, observational cohort study conducted between 2018 and 2019 at the Munich University Hospital. Besides clinical characteristics, patients received ≥72 h digital electrocardiogram recordings to generate the rhythm irregularity burden. Uni- and multivariable regression models predicted the primary endpoint of incident AF, ascertained by standardized follow-up including implantable cardiac monitors. Predictors included the novel rhythm irregularity burden constructed from digital electrocardiogram recordings. We independently validated our model in ESUS patients from the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 297 ESUS patients were followed for 15.6 ± 7.6 months. Incident AF (46 patients, 15.4%) occurred after a median of 105 days (25th to 75th percentile 31–33 days). Secondary outcomes were recurrent stroke in 7.7% and death in 6.1%. Multivariable-adjusted analyses identified the rhythm irregularity burden as the strongest AF-predictor (hazard ratio 3.12, 95% confidence interval 1.62–5.80, <i>p</i> &lt; 0001) while accounting for the known risk factors age, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-Score, and NT-proBNP. Independent validation confirmed the rhythm irregularity burden as the most significant AF-predictor (hazard ratio 2.20, 95% confidence interval 1.45–3.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The novel, non-invasive, electrocardiogram-based rhythm irregularity burden may help adjudicating AF risk after ESUS, and subsequently guide AF-detection after ESUS. Clinical trials need to clarify if high-AF risk patients benefit from tailored secondary stroke prevention. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Entry of the antipsychotic drug, olanzapine, into the developing rat brain in mono- and combination therapies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Olanzapine is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in women of childbearing age. Continuation of psychotropic medications throughout pregnancy and lactation is often required as cessation could be dangerous for both mother and child. However, there is a lack of information on the transfer of these drugs into the developing brain. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats at three developmental ages: embryonic day E19, postnatal day P4 and non-pregnant adult females were administered unlabelled or radiolabelled (3H) olanzapine (0.15 mg/kg) either as monotherapy or in combination with each of seven other common medications. Similar injections were administered to pregnant E19 females to investigate placental transfer. Olanzapine in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain was measured by liquid scintillation counting after a single dose (acute) or following 5 days of treatment (prolonged). Results: Olanzapine entry into brain and CSF was not age-dependent. Prolonged olanzapine treatment reduced placental transfer from 53% to 46% (p<0.05). Co-administration of digoxin or lamotrigine with olanzapine increased its entry into the fetal brain, whereas paracetamol decreased its entry into the CSF. Placental transfer of olanzapine was increased by co-treatment with cimetidine and digoxin, whereas co-treatment with lamotrigine, paracetamol or valproate led to a substantial decrease. Repeated co-treatment of digoxin and olanzapine increased olanzapine transfer into the brain and CSF, but not across the placenta. Overall entry of olanzapine from maternally administered drugs into the fetal brain was higher after combination therapy with cimetidine and digoxin. Conclusions: Co-administration of olanzapine with some commonly used drugs affected its entry into the fetus and its developing brain to a greater extent than in adults. It appears that protection of the fetal brain for these drugs primarily comes from the placenta rather than from the fetal brain barriers. Results suggest that drug combinations should be used with caution particularly during pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Significance of visual scene‐based learning in the hippocampal systems across mammalian species</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and its associated cortical regions in the medial temporal lobe play essential roles when animals form a cognitive map and use it to achieve their goals. As the nature of map-making involves sampling different local views of the environment and putting them together in a spatially cohesive way, visual scenes are essential ingredients in the formative process of cognitive maps. Visual scenes also serve as important cues during information retrieval from the cognitive map. Research in humans has shown that there are regions in the brain that selectively process scenes and that the hippocampus is involved in scene-based memory tasks. The neurophysiological correlates of scene-based information processing in the hippocampus have been reported as “spatial view cells” in nonhuman primates. Like primates, it is widely accepted that rodents also use visual scenes in their background for spatial navigation and other kinds of problems. However, in rodents, it is not until recently that researchers examined the neural correlates of the hippocampus from the perspective of visual scene-based information processing. With the advent of virtual reality (VR) systems, it has been demonstrated that place cells in the hippocampus exhibit remarkably similar firing correlates in the VR environment compared with that of the real-world environment. Despite some limitations, the new trend of studying hippocampal functions in a visually controlled environment has the potential to allow investigation of the input–output relationships of network functions and experimental testing of traditional computational predictions more rigorously by providing well-defined visual stimuli. As scenes are essential for navigation and episodic memory in humans, further investigation of the rodents' hippocampal systems in scene-based tasks will provide a critical functional link across different mammalian species.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Positioning the brainstem within the neural network of threat prediction</a></h4>

              
                In a recent study, Strickland and McDannald dissected the role of brainstem networks in threat prediction. Using probabilistic threat discrimination in rats, the authors demonstrated that brainstem neurons estimate threat probability and generate positive aversive prediction errors after unexpected outcomes. Their findings suggest that, beyond organizing defensive behaviors, brainstem neurons are involved in threat prediction computations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosophila SUMM4 complex couples insulator function and DNA replication control</a></h4>

              
                Asynchronous replication of chromosome domains during S phase is essential for eukaryotic genome function, but the mechanisms establishing which domains replicate early versus late in different cell types remain incompletely understood. Intercalary heterochromatin domains replicate very late in both diploid chromosomes of dividing cells and in endoreplicating polytene chromosomes where they are also underrelicated. <i>Drosophila</i> SNF2-related factor SUUR imparts locus-specific underreplication of polytene chromosomes. SUUR negatively regulates DNA replication fork progression; however, its mechanism of action remains obscure. Here we developed a novel method termed MS-Enabled Rapid protein Complex Identification (MERCI) to isolate a stable stoichiometric native complex SUMM4 that comprises SUUR and a chromatin boundary protein Mod(Mdg4)-67.2. Mod(Mdg4) stimulates SUUR ATPase activity and is required for a normal spatiotemporal distribution of SUUR <i>in vivo</i>. SUUR and Mod(Mdg4)-67.2 together mediate the activities of <i>gypsy</i> insulator that prevent certain enhancer-promoter interactions and establish euchromatin-heterochromatin barriers in the genome. Furthermore, <i>SuUR</i> or <i>mod(mdg4)</i> mutations reverse underreplication of intercalary heterochromatin. Thus, SUMM4 can impart late replication of intercalary heterochromatin by attenuating the progression of replication forks through euchromatin/heterochromatin boundaries. Our findings implicate a SNF2 family ATP-dependent motor protein SUUR in the insulator function, reveal that DNA replication can be delayed by a chromatin barrier and uncover a critical role for architectural proteins in replication control. They suggest a mechanism for the establishment of late replication that does not depend on an asynchronous firing of late replication origins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differential axonal trafficking of Neuropeptide Y-, LAMP1-, and RAB7-tagged organelles in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Different organelles traveling through neurons exhibit distinct properties in vitro, but this has not been investigated in the intact mammalian brain. We established simultaneous dual color two-photon microscopy to visualize the trafficking of Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-, LAMP1-, and RAB7-tagged organelles in thalamocortical axons imaged in mouse cortex in vivo. This revealed that LAMP1- and RAB7-tagged organelles move significantly faster than NPY-tagged organelles in both anterograde and retrograde direction. NPY traveled more selectively in anterograde direction than LAMP1 and RAB7. By using a synapse marker and a calcium sensor, we further investigated the transport dynamics of NPY-tagged organelles. We found that these organelles slow down and pause at synapses. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, a significant increase of transport speed was observed after spontaneous activity and elevated calcium levels in vivo as well as electrically stimulated activity in acute brain slices. Together, we show a remarkable diversity in speeds and properties of three axonal organelle marker in vivo that differ from properties previously observed in vitro.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">m6A epitranscriptomic modification regulates neural progenitor-to-glial cell transition in the retina</a></h4>

              
                <i>N</i> <sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent mRNA internal modification and has been shown to regulate the development, physiology, and pathology of various tissues. However, the functions of the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome in the visual system remain unclear. In this study, using a retina-specific conditional knockout mouse model, we show that retinas deficient in <i>Mettl3</i>, the core component of the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex, exhibit structural and functional abnormalities beginning at the end of retinogenesis. Immunohistological and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of retinogenesis processes reveal that retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and Müller glial cells are the two cell types primarily affected by <i>Mettl3</i> deficiency. Integrative analyses of scRNA-seq and MeRIP-seq data suggest that m<sup>6</sup>A fine-tunes the transcriptomic transition from RPCs to Müller cells by promoting the degradation of RPC transcripts, the disruption of which leads to abnormalities in late retinogenesis and likely compromises the glial functions of Müller cells. Overexpression of m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated RPC transcripts in late RPCs partially recapitulates the <i>Mettl3</i>-deficient retinal phenotype. Collectively, our study reveals an epitranscriptomic mechanism governing progenitor-to-glial cell transition during late retinogenesis, which is essential for the homeostasis of the mature retina. The mechanism revealed in this study might also apply to other nervous systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation of Drosophila larva foraging in response to changes in food resources</a></h4>

              
                All animals face the challenge of finding nutritious resources in a changing environment. To maximize life-time fitness, the exploratory behavior has to be flexible, but which behavioral elements adapt and what triggers those changes remain elusive. Using experiments and modeling, we characterized extensively how <i>Drosophila</i> larvae foraging adapts to different food quality and distribution and how the foraging genetic background influences this adaptation. Our work shows that different food properties modulated specific motor programs. Food quality controls the travelled distance by modulating crawling speed and frequency of pauses and turns. Food distribution, and in particular the food-no food interphase, controls turning behavior, stimulating turns towards the food when reaching the patch border and increasing the proportion of time spent within patches of food. Finally, the polymorphism in the <i>foraging</i> gene (rover-sitter) of the larvae adjusts the magnitude of the behavioral response to different food conditions. This study defines several levels of control of foraging and provides the basis for the systematic identification of the neuronal circuits and mechanisms controlling each behavioral response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Uncertainty alters the balance between incremental learning and episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                A key question in decision making is how humans arbitrate between competing learning and memory systems to maximize reward. We address this question by probing the balance between the effects, on choice, of incremental trial-and-error learning versus episodic memories of individual events. Although a rich literature has studied incremental learning in isolation, the role of episodic memory in decision making has only recently drawn focus, and little research disentangles their separate contributions. We hypothesized that the brain arbitrates rationally between these two systems, relying on each in circumstances to which it is most suited, as indicated by uncertainty. We tested this hypothesis by directly contrasting contributions of episodic and incremental influence to decisions, while manipulating the relative uncertainty of incremental learning using a well-established manipulation of reward volatility. Across two large, independent samples of young adults, participants traded these influences off rationally, depending more on episodic information when incremental summaries were more uncertain. These results support the proposal that the brain optimizes the balance between different forms of learning and memory according to their relative uncertainties and elucidate the circumstances under which episodic memory informs decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lhx2 is a progenitor-intrinsic modulator of Sonic Hedgehog signaling during early retinal neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                An important question in organogenesis is how tissue-specific transcription factors interact with signaling pathways. In some cases, transcription factors define the context for how signaling pathways elicit tissue- or cell-specific responses, and in others, they influence signaling through transcriptional regulation of signaling components or accessory factors. We previously showed that during optic vesicle patterning, the Lim-homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 has a contextual role by linking the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway to downstream targets without regulating the pathway itself. Here, we show that during early retinal neurogenesis in mice, Lhx2 is a multilevel regulator of Shh signaling. Specifically, Lhx2 acts cell autonomously to control the expression of pathway genes required for efficient activation and maintenance of signaling in retinal progenitor cells. The Shh co-receptors Cdon and Gas1 are candidate direct targets of Lhx2 that mediate pathway activation, whereas Lhx2 directly or indirectly promotes the expression of other pathway components important for activation and sustained signaling. We also provide genetic evidence suggesting that Lhx2 has a contextual role by linking the Shh pathway to downstream targets. Through these interactions, Lhx2 establishes the competence for Shh signaling in retinal progenitors and the context for the pathway to promote early retinal neurogenesis. The temporally distinct interactions between Lhx2 and the Shh pathway in retinal development illustrate how transcription factors and signaling pathways adapt to meet stage-dependent requirements of tissue formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evidence linking APOBEC3B genesis and evolution of innate immune antagonism by gamma-herpesvirus ribonucleotide reductases</a></h4>

              
                Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to antagonize host immunity such as direct inhibition and relocalization of cellular APOBEC3B (A3B) by the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) of Epstein-Barr virus. Here, we investigate the mechanistic conservation and evolutionary origin of this innate immune counteraction strategy. First, we find that human gamma-herpesvirus RNRs engage A3B via largely distinct surfaces. Second, we show that RNR-mediated enzymatic inhibition and relocalization of A3B depend upon binding to different regions of the catalytic domain. Third, we show that the capability of viral RNRs to antagonize A3B is conserved among gamma-herpesviruses that infect humans and Old World monkeys that encode this enzyme but absent in homologous viruses that infect New World monkeys that naturally lack the <i>A3B</i> gene. Finally, we reconstruct the ancestral primate A3B protein and demonstrate that it is active and similarly engaged by the RNRs from viruses that infect humans and Old World monkeys but not by the RNRs from viruses that infect New World monkeys. These results combine to indicate that the birth of <i>A3B</i> at a critical branchpoint in primate evolution may have been a driving force in selecting for an ancestral gamma-herpesvirus with an expanded RNR functionality through counteraction of this antiviral enzyme.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modular UBE2H-CTLH E2-E3 complexes regulate erythroid maturation</a></h4>

              
                The development of haematopoietic stem cells into mature erythrocytes – erythropoiesis – is a controlled process characterized by cellular reorganization and drastic reshaping of the proteome landscape. Failure of ordered erythropoiesis is associated with anaemias and haematological malignancies. Although the ubiquitin system is a known crucial post-translational regulator in erythropoiesis, how the erythrocyte is reshaped by the ubiquitin system is poorly understood. By measuring the proteomic landscape of in vitro human erythropoiesis models, we found dynamic differential expression of subunits of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that formed maturation stage-dependent assemblies of topologically homologous RANBP9- and RANBP10-CTLH complexes. Moreover, protein abundance of CTLH’s cognate E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2H increased during terminal differentiation, and UBE2H expression depended on catalytically active CTLH E3 complexes. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated inactivation of CTLH E3 assemblies or UBE2H in erythroid progenitors revealed defects, including spontaneous and accelerated erythroid maturation as well as inefficient enucleation. Thus, we propose that dynamic maturation stage-specific changes of UBE2H-CTLH E2-E3 modules control the orderly progression of human erythropoiesis.

                Innate T cells, including CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, are characterized by their rapid activation in response to non-peptide antigens, such as lipids. While the transcriptional profiles of naive, effector and memory adaptive T cells have been well studied, less is known about transcriptional regulation of different iNKT cell activation states. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we performed longitudinal profiling of activated murine iNKT cells, generating a transcriptomic atlas of iNKT cell activation states. We found that transcriptional signatures of activation are highly conserved among heterogeneous iNKT cell populations, including NKT1, NKT2 and NKT17 subsets, and human iNKT cells. Strikingly, we found that regulatory iNKT cells, such as adipose iNKT cells, undergo blunted activation, and display constitutive enrichment of memory-like cMAF<sup>+</sup> and KLRG1<sup>+</sup> populations. Moreover, we identify a conserved cMAF-associated transcriptional network among NKT10 cells, providing novel insights into the biology of regulatory and antigen experienced iNKT cells.

                Undruggability of RAS proteins has necessitated alternative strategies for the development of effective inhibitors. In this respect, phosphorylation has recently come into prominence as this reversible post-translational modification attenuates sensitivity of RAS towards RAF. As such, in this study, we set out to unveil the impact of phosphorylation on dynamics of HRAS<sup>WT</sup> and aim to invoke similar behavior in HRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutant by means of small therapeutic molecules. To this end, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using phosphorylated HRAS and showed that phosphorylation of Y32 distorted Switch I, hence the RAS/RAF interface. Consequently, we targeted Switch I in HRAS<sup>G12D</sup> by means of approved therapeutic molecules and showed that the ligands enabled detachment of Switch I from the nucleotide-binding pocket. Moreover, we demonstrated that displacement of Switch I from the nucleotide-binding pocket was energetically more favorable in the presence of the ligand. Importantly, we verified computational findings in vitro where HRAS<sup>G12D</sup>/RAF interaction was prevented by the ligand in HEK293T cells that expressed HRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mutant protein. Therefore, these findings suggest that targeting Switch I, hence making Y32 accessible might open up new avenues in future drug discovery strategies that target mutant RAS proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">VPS9D1-AS1 overexpression amplifies intratumoral TGF-β signaling and promotes tumor cell escape from CD8+ T cell killing in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                Efficacy of immunotherapy is limited in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) because high expression of tumor-derived transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway molecules and interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) promotes tumor immune evasion. Here, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), VPS9D1-AS1, which was located in ribosomes and amplified TGF-β signaling and ISG expression. We show that high expression of VPS9D1-AS1 was negatively associated with T lymphocyte infiltration in two independent cohorts of CRC. VPS9D1-AS1 served as a scaffolding lncRNA by binding with ribosome protein S3 (RPS3) to increase the translation of TGF-β, TGFBR1, and SMAD1/5/9. VPS9D1-AS1 knockout downregulated OAS1, an ISG gene, which further reduced IFNAR1 levels in tumor cells. Conversely, tumor cells overexpressing VPS9D1-AS1 were resistant to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killing and lowered IFNAR1 expression in CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells. In a conditional overexpression mouse model, VPS9D1-AS1 enhanced tumorigenesis and suppressed the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Treating tumor-bearing mice with antisense oligonucleotide drugs targeting VPS9D1-AS1 significantly suppressed tumor growth. Our findings indicate that the tumor-derived VPS9D1-AS1/TGF-β/ISG signaling cascade promotes tumor growth and enhances immune evasion and may thus serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Growth/differentiation factor 15 controls number of ependymal and neural stem cells in the ventricular/subventricular zone</a></h4>

              
                Late in neural development, the expression of growth/differentiation factor (GDF) 15 increases in the germinal epithelium of the murine ganglionic eminence (GE). However, the function of GDF15 in this region is unknown. We here show that ablation of GDF15 leads to an increase in proliferation of apically and subapically dividing progenitors in the GE. This is associated with faster cell cycle progression in both progenitor groups, and an increase in the total number of cycling progenitors. Enhanced proliferation of apically dividing progenitors leads to a permanent significant increase in the number of ependymal and apical neural stem cells (NSCs). Our data also indicate that the extra proliferation of subapically dividing progenitors causes a transient increase in the number of neuronal progenitors, which is compensated by increased apoptosis. Independent of the genotype, activity of endogenous epidermal growth factor (EGFR) signalling is essential for the proliferation of apically and subapically dividing progenitors. However, lack of GDF15 leads to a reduced cell surface expression of EGFR and altered dynamics of MAPK activation in response to EGF stimulation. Application of exogenous GDF15 rescued the effect of the genotype on the expression of EGFR and decreased proliferation in the mutant GE. Taken together, our results indicate that GDF15 modulates proliferation and growth factor responsiveness of apical progenitors in the developing GE, thereby regulating the number of total ependymal and NSCs.

                The brain is composed of disparate neural populations that communicate and interact with one another. Although fiber bundles, similarities in molecular architecture, and synchronized neural activity all represent brain connectivity, a comprehensive study of how these connectivity modes jointly reflect brain structure and function remains missing. Here we systematically integrate seven multimodal, multiscale brain connectivity profiles derived from gene expression, neurotransmitter receptor density, cellular morphology, glucose metabolism, haemodynamic activity, and electrophysiology. We uncover a compact set of universal organizational principles through which brain geometry and neuroanatomy shape emergent connectivity modes. Connectivity modes also exhibit unique and diverse connection patterns, hub profiles, dominant gradients, and modular organization. Throughout, we observe a consistent primacy of molecular connectivity modes---namely correlated gene expression and receptor similarity---that map well onto multiple phenomena including the rich club and patterns of cortical abnormalities across 13 neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Finally, we fuse all seven connectivity modes into a single multimodal network and show that it maps onto major organizational features of the brain including structural conenctivity, intrinsic functional networks, and cytoarchitectonic classes. Altogether, this work contributes to next-generation connectomics and the integrative study of inter-regional relationships.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rhythmic temporal coordination of neural activity avoids representational conflict during working memory</a></h4>

              
                Selective attention includes alternating states associated with either attentional sampling or attentional shifting, helping to avoid functional conflicts by isolating function-specific neural activity in time. We hypothesized that such rhythmic temporal coordination might also help to avoid representational conflicts during working memory. Multiple items can be simultaneously held in working memory, and these items can be represented by overlapping neural populations. Traditional theories propose that short-term storage of to-be-remembered items occurs through persistent neural activity, but when neurons are simultaneously representing multiple items, persistent activity creates a potential for representational conflicts. In comparison, more recent, activity-silent theories of working memory propose that items are stored through short-term changes in synaptic weights. Transient bursts in neural activity, rather than persistent activity, would serve to refresh these short-term synaptic changes. Here, we used EEG and response times (RTs) to test whether rhythmic temporal coordination helps to isolate neural activity associated with different to-be-remembered items, thereby avoiding representational conflicts. Consistent with this hypothesis, we report that the relative strength of different item representations alternates over time as a function of frequency-specific phase. Although RTs were linked to theta (~6Hz) and beta (~25 Hz) phase during a memory delay, the relative strength of item representations only alternated as a function of beta phase. The present findings support activity-silent theories of working memory, and inform models describing the role of oscillatory dynamics in organizing working memory. Finally, these findings support rhythmic temporal coordination as a general mechanism for avoiding either functional or representational conflicts during cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisite Thalamic Recordings to Characterize Seizure Propagation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT) has shown to be efficacious in patients with refractory focal epilepsy, but it is not uniformly effective. One important uncertainty is to what extent thalamic subregions other than the ANT are recruited earlier and more prominently in the propagation of seizures in patients with presumed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To address this unknown, we studied 11 patients with clinical manifestations of TLE planned to undergo invasive stereo-encephalography (sEEG) monitoring. We extended cortical electrodes to reach thalamic nuclear subdivisions in the anterior (ANT), middle (mediodorsal) and or posterior (pulvinar) sites. This multisite thalamic sampling was without any adverse events. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings confirmed seizure onset in medial temporal lobe, insula, orbitofrontal and temporal neocortical sites, thereby highlighting the importance of iEEG for more accurate localization of seizure foci. Visual review of EEGs documented early and prominent involvement of specific thalamic sites. Seizures originating from the same brain origin produced a stereotyped thalamic EEG signature. Visual review of EEGs, validated with single-pulse corticothalamic evoked potentials, documented early and prominent involvement of thalamic sites that would have not been predicted given the anatomy of seizure onset zones. Pulvinar was involved earlier and more prominently than other sampled nuclear subgroups in 60% of patients, even though all patients had a presumed diagnosis of TLE prior to invasive monitoring. Our findings document the feasibility and safety of multisite sampling from the human thalamus and suggest that the anatomy of thalamic involvement may not be entirely predictable on the basis of clinical information or lobar localization of seizures. Future clinical trials can establish whether offering more personalized targets for thalamic neuromodulation will lead to greater meaningful improvements in outcome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The interplay of uncertainty, relevance and learning influences auditory categorization</a></h4>

              
                Auditory perception requires categorizing sound sequences, such as speech, into classes, such as syllables. Auditory categorization depends not only on the sequences acoustic waveform, but also on the listeners sensory uncertainty, any individual sounds relevance to the task, and learning the temporal statistics of the acoustic environment. However, whether and how these factors interact to shape categorization is unknown. Here, we measured human participants performance on a multi-tone categorization task. Task-relevant tones contributed more to category choice than task-irrelevant tones, confirming that participants combined information about sensory features with task relevance. Conversely, poor estimates of tones task relevance or high sensory uncertainty adversely impacted category choice. Learning temporal statistics of sound category also affected decisions. The magnitude of this effect correlated inversely with participants relevance estimates. These results demonstrate that humans differentially weigh sensory uncertainty, task relevance and learning, providing a novel understanding of sensory decision-making under real-life behavioral demands.

                Expectations about the quality of a medical treatment influence how much an inert treatment helps to improve patient well-being. Similarly, expectations about the quality of products influence how identical goods and services are evaluated differently after their consumption. One driver for such "placebo effects" in medical treatments is social cognition in the form of trust, which may be influenced by the hormone oxytocin. An open question is whether trust and oxytocin play similar roles in marketing placebo effects. To answer this question, we combined oxytocin administration (24 IU) and trust questionnaires in a pre-registered double-blind randomized between-subjects study design (N food tasting task = 223; N cognitive performance task = 202). We could not find evidence that oxytocin and trust play a role in placebo effects of marketing actions. Together with other recent null findings from oxytocin administration studies, these findings question the role trust might play in different types of placebo effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prenatal development has stable and consistent effects on the human brain throughout the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Human fetal development has been associated with brain health at later stages. It is unknown whether and how consistently growth in utero, as indexed by birth weight (BW), relates to lifespan brain characteristics and changes, and to what extent these influences are of a genetic and/or environmental nature. We hypothesized that associations of BW and structural brain characteristics persist through the lifespan, with topographically consistent effects across samples of varying age and origin, that BW is not protective against atrophy in aging, and that effects are partly environmental. The associations of BW and cortical area, thickness, volume and their change were investigated vertex-wise in developmental (ABCD), older adult and aging (UKB) and lifespan (LCBC) longitudinal samples. In total, 5794 persons (4-82 years, w/ 386 monozygotic twins), were followed for up to 8.3 years, yielding 12,088 brain MRIs. Positive associations between BW and cortical surface area and volume were remarkably stable through the lifespan, within and across samples of different origin, with spatial correlations in the range r = .51-.79. In contrast, there was modest and no consistent effect of BW on brain changes. Effects of BW discordance in the monozygotic twin subsample indicated the effects were partly environmental. In conclusion, the influence of prenatal growth on cortical topography is stable through the lifespan, and is reliably seen in development, adulthood, and aging. These findings support early life influence on the brain through the lifespan according to a threshold model of brain reserve, rather than a maintenance model.

                The accumulation of mutant ataxin-3 (Atx3) in neuronal nuclear inclusions is a pathological hallmark of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3. Decreasing the protein aggregation burden is a possible disease-modifying strategy to tackle MJD and other neurodegenerative disorders for which only symptomatic treatments are currently available. We performed a drug repurposing screening to identify inhibitors of Atx3 aggregation with known toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiles. Interestingly, dopamine hydrochloride and other catecholamines are among the most potent inhibitors of Atx3 aggregation in vitro. Our results indicate that low micromolar concentrations of dopamine markedly delay the formation of mature amyloid fibrils of mutant Atx3 through the inhibition of the earlier oligomerization steps. Although dopamine itself does not pass the blood-brain barrier, dopamine levels in the brain can be increased by low doses of dopamine precursors and dopamine agonists commonly used to treat Parkinsonian symptoms. These findings disclose a possible application of dopaminergic drugs to halt or reduce Atx3 accumulation in the brains of MJD patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Color and Spatial Frequency Provide Functional Signatures of Retinotopic Visual Areas</a></h4>

              
                The visual cortex contains multiple retinotopic representations of the visual field. A long-standing question of visual neuroscience concerns the role of these different regions in visual computations and perception. Differences in psychophysical properties have also been noted across the visual field, varying with eccentricity and with the upper and lower hemifields. Inspired by studies that used linear-systems-defined stimuli to characterize single neuron responses, we collected fMRI data from two macaque monkeys as they passively viewed gratings that varied in color, saturation, and spatial frequency. We apply a novel variant of multivariate linear discriminant analysis to discover combinations of these features that best separated visual cortex, along three dimensions of representation: eccentricity; classic retinotopic progression (V1, V2, V3, V3a, V4, MT+); and upper vs lower visual field. As expected from prior work, eccentricity across all visual areas was characterized by responses to color and spatial frequency: foveal regions, compared to peripheral regions, showed greater responses to colors not restricted to the S-cone-axis and high spatial frequency. Retinotopic visual areas were characterized by their responses to saturation: relative to anterior visual areas (V3-V4, V3a, MT+), posterior areas (V1-V2) were more responsive to increases in saturation. And upper-vs-lower representations were distinguished by responses to colors modulating along the Daylight locus: ventral areas showed relatively higher responses to colors associated with the Daylight locus (orange/blue) as compared to responses to achromatic luminance. Together, these results provide a data driven approach that recovers functional signatures of retinotopic organization using color and spatial frequency, providing clues toward the different roles that the components of retinotopic cortex play in visual perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Species-dependent actions of the Gαob selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist BnOCPA</a></h4>

              
                We have previously reported that in rat hippocampal area CA1, the A1R-selective agonist, BnOCPA, potently inhibited excitatory synaptic transmission but did not cause membrane hyperpolarisation in CA1 pyramidal neurons, as would be expected of A1R agonists. This functional discrimination by BnOCPA may arise from its ability, in cAMP inhibition assays, to selectively activate only Gob out of the six Gi/o subtypes. This may explain why BnOCPA is a potent analgesic that does not cause sedation or cardiorespiratory depression in the rat. Since many preclinical studies are performed using mice, we have here investigated whether BnOCPAs functional discrimination extends to the mouse. While the potency of BnOCPA against the inhibition of hippocampal synaptic transmission was comparable between rats and mice, we discovered that low concentrations of BnOCPA hyperpolarised mouse CA1 neurons and reduced both their input resistance and firing rate in an A1R-dependent manner. In interleaved experiments we confirmed our previous observations in the rat that concentrations of BnOCPA equivalent to those tested in the mouse had little or no effect on membrane potential or input resistance. Using NanoBRET binding we established that BnOCPA had similar affinity at the mouse and rat A1Rs, and displayed little difference in G protein coupling, as determined using the TRUPATH assay. Thus, although the mechanism for the loss of BnOCPA functional selectivity between pre- and postsynaptic receptors in the mouse hippocampus is currently unclear, it may stem from differences in expression of the individual G proteins subunits or the coupling to murine K+ channels.

Short summaryWe describe the differential actions of the selective A1R agonist BnOCPA in mouse vs rat hippocampus. In mice, BnOCPA does not show a selectivity between pre and postsynaptic A1Rs, unlike in rats. This may stem from differences in the G protein coupling to K+ channels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Complex spatiotemporal oscillations emerge from transverse instabilities in large-scale brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Spatiotemporal oscillations underlie all cognitive brain functions. Large-scale brain models, constrained by neuroimaging data, aim to trace the principles underlying such macroscopic neural activity from the intricate and multi-scale structure of the brain. Despite substantial progress in the field, many aspects about the mechanisms behind the onset of spatiotemporal neural dynamics are still unknown. In this work we establish a simple framework for the emergence of complex brain dynamics, including high-dimensional chaos and travelling waves. The model consists of a complex network of 90 brain regions, whose structural connectivity is obtained from tractography data. The activity of each brain area is governed by a Jansen neural mass model and we normalize the total input received by each node so it amounts the same across all brain areas. This assumption allows for the existence of an homogeneous invariant manifold, i.e., a set of different stationary and oscillatory states in which all nodes behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous solutions unveils a transverse instability of the synchronized state, which gives rise to different types of spatiotemporal dynamics, such as chaotic alpha activity. Additionally, we illustrate the ubiquity of this route towards complex spatiotemporal activity in a network of next-generation neural mass models. Altogehter, our results unveil the bifurcation landscape that underlies the emergence of function from structure in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network topology in brain tumor patients with and without structural epilepsy- a prospective MEG-study</a></h4>

              
                It has been proposed that functional connectivity (FC) and network topology (NT) are altered in patients with glial brain tumors. So far there is no consensus on the pattern of these changes, furthermore data on FC in patients with brain metastases (BM) as well as on the presence and absence of tumor-related epilepsy is lacking. We aimed to analyze preoperative NT of newly diagnosed, singular, supratentorial glial brain tumors (GBT) and BMs with and without structural epilepsy. FC and NT derived from resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) were compared between patients (PAs) and matched healthy controls (HCs), between GBTs and BMs as well as between patients with and without structural epilepsy. We investigated all patients, who met our inclusion criteria from February 2019 to March 2021. Clinical data was collected from patients electronic medical charts. We analyzed whole brain (wb) connectivity in six frequency bands, calculated three different network topological parameters (node degree (ND), shortest path length (L), clustering coefficient (CC)) and performed a stratification, where differences in the power were to be found. For data analysis we used Fieldtrip, Brain Connectivity Matlab toolboxes and in-house built scripts. We consecutively included 41 patients (21 men), mean age 60.1ys (range 23- 82), who were operated on at our institution. Tumor histology included high-grade gliomas (n=18), low-grade gliomas (n=4), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET, n=1), BMs (n=14) and others (n=4). Statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease for wb ND in patients compared to healthy controls in every frequency range analyzed at the descriptive and corrected level (p1-30Hz=0.002, p(gamma)=0.002, p(beta)=0.002, p(alpha)=0.002, p(theta)=0.024, p(delta)=0.002). Furthermore, at the descriptive level, we found a significant augmentation for wb CC (p1-30Hz=0.031, p(delta)=0.013) in PAs compared to HCs, which did not persist the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. There were no differences in the networks of glial brain tumors and metastases identified. However, we found a significant increase in wb CC in patients with structural epilepsy (p(theta)= 0.048), and significantly lower wb ND (p(alpha)= 0.039) at the uncorrected level. Our data suggests that network topology is altered in brain tumor patients, which is in line with previous studies. Tumor histology per se might not influence the brain s functional network, however, tumor-related epilepsy seems to do so. Longitudinal studies and in-depth analysis of possible factors and confounders might be helpful to further substantiate these findings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channel properties underlie sustained fast AP signaling</a></h4>

              
                Human cortical pyramidal neurons are large, have extensive dendritic trees, and yet have surprisingly fast input-output properties: rapid subthreshold synaptic membrane potential changes are reliably encoded in timing of action potentials (APs). Here, we tested whether biophysical properties of voltage-gated sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) currents in human pyramidal neurons can explain their fast input-output properties. Human Na+ and K+ currents had depolarized voltage-dependence, slower inactivation and exhibited a faster recovery from inactivation than their mouse counterparts. Computational modeling showed that despite lower Na+ channel densities in human neurons, the biophysical properties of Na+ channels resulted in higher channel availability and contributed to fast AP kinetics stability. Finally, human Na+ channel properties also resulted in a larger dynamic range for encoding of subthreshold membrane potential changes. Thus, biophysical adaptations of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels enable fast input-output properties of large human pyramidal neurons.

One-Sentence SummaryBiophysical properties of Na+ and K+ ion channels enable human neurons to encode fast inputs into output.

	<p>Background: Although increased food cue reactivity is evidenced to be crucial to the development and maintenance of pediatric obesity, virtually nothing is known about the underlying neurophysiological aspects of food cue reactivity in children with obesity. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating neural characteristics in children with overweight or obesity using electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Electrophysiological brain activity was measured using EEG frequency band analysis in n = 9 children with overweight or obesity versus n = 16 children with normal weight (8&amp;amp;ndash;13 years) during the presentation of high- and low-calorie food pictures and images of appealing non-food stimuli. Results: Children with overweight or obesity showed significantly increased relative central beta band activity induced by high-calorie foods and appealing non-food stimuli compared to children with normal weight. Beyond significant effects of the scalp region on EEG activity, non-significant effects of stimulus category or weight status were seen for theta and alpha frequency bands. Conclusions: This study demonstrated elevated beta band activity in children with overweight or obesity when viewing high-calorie food stimuli. Beta band activity may, thus, be a valuable target for neuromodulatory interventions in children with overweight or obesity.</p>

	<p>Background: Multimodal postoperative pain regimens are widely used following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, there are few studies on the rehabilitation of the co-application of local infiltration analgesia (LIA) and femoral nerve block (FNB) combined with dexmedetomidine (DEX) for patients undergoing TKA. This study aimed to investigate the effect of LIA plus FNB and co-application of perioperative DEX on TKA outcomes. Methods: 95 patients were randomized into two groups. Patients in group B (n = 48) received a single preoperative FNB and LIA. Patients in group A (n = 47) received FNB and LIA, as well as continuous intravenous injection of DEX starting from the induction of anesthesia to postoperative day 2. All patients were allowed patient-controlled analgesia postoperatively. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores, knee range of motion (ROM) degrees, narcotic consumption, length of hospital stay (LOS), complications, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) scores and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B) Scores were recorded. Results: In group A, the mean VAS scores at rest and during movement were lower, the amount of rescue analgesia was decreased, first time of ambulation was reduced, ROM was improved, MoCA-B Scores were increased, LOS was shorter, HSS scores were higher postoperatively compared with group B (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Our study indicated multimodal analgesia involving a single FNB and LIA combined with DEX accelerates rehabilitation for patients undergoing TKA.</p>

	<p>Proprioceptive deficits are common following stroke, yet the white matter involved in proprioception is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that multiple cortical regions are involved in proprioception, each connected by major white matter tracts, namely: Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (branches I, II and III), Arcuate Fasciculus and Middle Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF I, SLF II, SLF III, AF and MdLF respectively). However, direct evidence on the involvement of these tracts in proprioception is lacking. Diffusion imaging was used to investigate the proprioceptive role of the SLF I, SLF II, SLF III, AF and MdLF in 26 participants with stroke, and seven control participants without stroke. Proprioception was assessed using a robotic Arm Position Matching (APM) task, performed in a Kinarm Exoskeleton robotic device. Lesions impacting each tract resulted in worse APM task performance. Lower Fractional Anisotropy (FA) was also associated with poorer APM task performance for the SLF II, III, AF and MdLF. Finally, connectivity data surrounding the cortical regions connected by each tract accurately predicted APM task impairments post-stroke. This study highlights the importance of major cortico&amp;amp;ndash;cortical white matter tracts, particularly the SLF III and AF, for accurate proprioception after stroke. It advances our understanding of the white matter tracts responsible for proprioception.</p>

	<p>Cerebral ischemia impedes the functional or metabolic demands of the central nervous system (CNS), which subsequently leads to irreversible brain damage. While recanalization of blocked vessels recovers cerebral blood flow, it can also aggravate brain injury, termed as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Exosomes, nanometric membrane vesicles, attracted wide attention as carriers of biological macromolecules. In the brain, exosomes can be secreted by almost all types of cells, and their contents can be altered during the pathological and clinical processes of cerebral I/R injury. Herein, we will review the current literature on the possible role of cargos derived from exosomes and exosomes-mediated intercellular communication in cerebral I/R injury. The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched through January 2015. The studies published in English were identified using search terms including &amp;amp;ldquo;exosomes&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;brain ischemia-reperfusion injury&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;stroke&amp;amp;rdquo;. We will also focus on the potential therapeutic effects of stem cell-derived exosomes and underlying mechanisms in cerebral I/R injury. Meanwhile, with the advantages of low immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, high bioavailability, and the capacity to pass through the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier, exosomes also attract more attention as therapeutic modalities for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury.</p>

	<p>There are few clinical and electrophysiological studies on paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) with peripheral nerve damage, which brings great challenges to clinical identification and diagnosis. We analyzed the clinical and electrophysiological data of twenty-five confirmed PNS cases using peripheral nerve damage patients. The results showed the most common chief complaint was weakness (20/25, 80%), followed by numbness (13/25, 52%). Nineteen patients (76%) exhibited peripheral nervous system lesions prior to occult tumors, and the median time from symptom onset to the diagnosis of a tumor was 4 months. The electrophysiological results revealed a higher rate of abnormal amplitudes than latency or conduction velocity, especially in sensory nerves. Meanwhile, we found that, compared with patients &amp;amp;gt;65 y, patients aged &amp;amp;le;65 y exhibited more chronic onset (p = 0.01) and longer disease duration (p = 0.01), more motor nerve involvements (p = 0.02), more amplitude involvement (p = 0.01), and higher rates of the inability to walk independently at presentation (p = 0.02). The present study construed that weakness and paresthesia are common symptoms in PNS with peripheral nerve damage in some areas, and the electrophysiological results mainly changed in amplitude. Tumor screening in young and middle-aged patients with peripheral neuropathy cannot be ignored.</p>

	<p>Chronic pain is associated with abnormal cortical excitability and increased pain intensity. Research investigating the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate motor cortex excitability and reduce pain in individuals with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) yield mixed results. The present randomised, placebo-controlled study examined the impact of anodal-tDCS over left-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC) on motor cortex excitability and pain in those with CLBP. Nineteen participants with CLBP (Mage = 53.16 years, SDage = 14.80 years) received 20-min of sham or anodal tDCS, twice weekly, for 4 weeks. Short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were assessed using paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation prior to and immediately following the tDCS intervention. Linear Mixed Models revealed no significant effect of tDCS group or time, on SICI or ICF. The interactions between tDCS group and time on SICI and ICF only approached significance. Bayesian analyses revealed the anodal-tDCS group demonstrated higher ICF and SICI following the intervention compared to the sham-tDCS group. The anodal-tDCS group also demonstrated a reduction in pain intensity and self-reported disability compared to the sham-tDCS group. These findings provide preliminary support for anodal-tDCS over left-DLPFC to modulate cortical excitability and reduce pain in CLBP.</p>

	<p>Cognitive difficulties are common in people with mental health issues, including psychotic disorders, although this population may have difficulty accessing treatments due to various challenges, including transportation, remembering appointments, or discomfort in crowded or unfamiliar places. Home-based services can be crucial and effective for reaching populations with accessibility issues; one home-based intervention technique is individual cognitive stimulation (iCS), which has been shown to be an effective strategy to target and improve cognitive functioning in various samples. Using a previously established Portuguese iCS protocol, based on an initial brief cognitive assessment and the subsequent administration of cognitive stimulation materials and reflection exercises, the current randomized controlled trial explored the effectiveness of the iCS intervention on participants in Portugal with psychotic disorders. Outcome tools included measures of cognition, depression, quality of life, and functional abilities at baseline, the completion of the intervention, and post-intervention follow-up. With two well-matched groups at baseline, the results revealed significant improvements in the intervention group on cognitive functioning, depression, quality of life, and, more modestly, functional activities. These results offer an important contribution to the field of iCS protocols, in an effort to enhance the lives and well-being of various clinical populations, including those with psychotic disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current views of community and hospital pharmacists on pharmaceutical care services in the United Arab Emirates: A mixed methodological study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The profession of pharmacy has evolved significantly in recent years in terms of professional service delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the current views of pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on pharmaceutical care services and the nature of barriers encountered in practice using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among hospital and community pharmacists (n = 305) between March and May 2021, using qualitative and quantitative assessment methods. In the qualitative phase, 15 interviews were conducted to explore five main criteria: patient information, inadequate patient counseling, prescribing errors prevention and identifying drug-related problems, lack of participation in health awareness programs, and barriers to pharmaceutical care implementation. In the quantitative phase, 305 consenting pharmacists completed a questionnaire on seven criteria: demographic profile, pharmacist-physician interaction, patient counseling assessment, patient reports of adverse drug events, pharmacist participation in health awareness programs, perceptions of reducing prescribing errors and identifying drug-related problems, and barriers to appropriate pharmaceutical care implementation. Results: The results of both the qualitative and quantitative phases of the study revealed that pharmacists' influence on practice in the UAE is limited due to many factors, mainly lack of time and patients' ignorance of the pharmacist's role in the medical field. The mean responses regarding pharmacists' approach to patient counseling and patients' knowledge of pharmacists' role in managing adverse drug reactions were 77.1% and 59.7%, respectively. Active participation in health awareness programs was 64.8%. The mean positive response of participants in reducing prescribing errors and recognizing drug-related problems was 9.2%. Pharmacists' age and number of years in practice were the most important factors influencing the pharmaceutical care services implementation. Conclusion: The study has shown the need to shed light on the proper implementation of pharmaceutical care while maintaining a trusting relationship with physicians.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Decoding the Time Course of Spatial Information from Spiking and Local Field Potential Activities in the Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Place code representation is ubiquitous in circuits that encode spatial parameters. For visually guided eye movements, neurons in many brain regions emit spikes when a stimulus is presented in their receptive fields and/or when a movement is directed into their movement fields. Crucially, individual neurons respond for a broad range of directions or eccentricities away from the optimal vector, making it difficult to decode the stimulus location or the saccade vector from each cell&rsquo;s activity. We investigated whether it is possible to decode the spatial parameter with a population-level analysis, even when the optimal vectors are similar across neurons. Spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) in the superior colliculus (SC) were recorded with a laminar probe as monkeys performed a delayed saccade task to one of eight targets radially equidistant in direction. A classifier was applied offline to decode the spatial configuration as the trial progresses from sensation to action. For spiking activity, decoding performance across all eight directions was highest during the visual and motor epochs and lower but well above chance during the delay period. Classification performance followed a similar pattern for LFP activity too, except the performance during the delay period was limited mostly to the preferred direction. Increasing the number of neurons in the population consistently increased classifier performance for both modalities. Overall, this study demonstrates the power of population activity for decoding spatial information not possible from individual neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Tree Shrews as an Animal Model for Studying Perceptual Decision-Making Reveal a Critical Role of Stimulus-Independent Processes in Guiding Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Decision-making is an essential cognitive process by which we interact with the external world. However, attempts to understand the neural mechanisms of decision-making are limited by the current available animal models and the technologies that can be applied to them. Here, we build on the renewed interest in using tree shrews (<I>Tupaia belangeri</I>) in vision research and provide strong support for them as a model for studying visual perceptual decision-making. Tree shrews learned very quickly to perform a two-alternative forced choice contrast discrimination task, and they exhibited differences in response time distributions depending on the reward and punishment structure of the task. Specifically, they made occasional fast guesses when incorrect responses are punished by a constant increase in the interval between trials. This behavior was suppressed when faster incorrect responses were discouraged by longer intertrial intervals. By fitting the behavioral data with two variants of racing diffusion decision models, we found that the between-trial delay affected decision-making by modulating the drift rate of a time accumulator. Our results thus provide support for the existence of an internal process that is independent of the evidence accumulation in decision-making and lay a foundation for future mechanistic studies of perceptual decision-making using tree shrews.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Brain-based learning in design and visual arts education: a bibliometric assessment of Scopus indexed literature [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aims to critically review, quantify, and assess research outcomes on brain-based learning with an evidence-based study on Scopus indexed literature, with a focus to understand the evolution structure and growth, detect trends, subject development, and most importantly, identify the gaps in the published body of literature that relates brain-based learning to design and visual arts education. Methods: Various scientometric tools were used to map, visualize, and analyze 186 research publications, indexed in Scopus in a twenty-year timespan ‘2001-2021’. Annual publication trends, relevant sources, prolific authors, authorship patterns, productive organizations and countries, funding agencies, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and thematic evolution mapping on brain-based learning publications were examined in this study. Results: Despite the significance to apply brain-based learning strategies in design and visual arts education to boost students’ knowledge and creative skills, the findings show a decline in quantities and growth patterns in brain-based learning research directed towards design disciplines in the past twenty years. Among the identified (186) documents published in (128) sources, with (1013) citations, the study detected only (57) research (30%) that were related to ‘design education,’ including those focusing on ‘instructional design, ‘and ‘syllabus design’ whereas only (3) articles were in ‘design and visual arts’ disciplines. Conclusion: These rather small numbers reflect the big gap in the current body of literature that associates brain-based learning with creativity-based disciplines, specifically in design and visual arts education. This infers the necessity to direct the attention of academics, researchers, and educationalists in the fields of design and arts towards brain-based learning applications, research and pedagogy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Measuring the motives of informal entrepreneurs [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Handling non-observed activities pose major challenges to the governments and other stakeholders. Non-observed activities refer to underground activities, illegal activities, informal sector and any other activities that result in goods or services consumed by the household. The impact of these non-observed activities shows that the volume of people involved in the informal sector will rapidly increase. Informal economic activities are technically illegal yet are not intended as antisocial,   thereby remaining acceptable to many individuals within the society. This research aimed to identify the factors that lead to entrepreneurial necessity and opportunity.   Methods – The data of 51 respondents who were employed as informal entrepreneurs in Klang Valley areas in Malaysia was collected with the use of a questionnaire and convenient and proportionate sampling techniques. The data were analysed using SPSS software.   Results – The two primary drivers of informal entrepreneurial activity were necessity and opportunity. The inability to find a formal job was an example of being driven by necessity. Meanwhile, individuals that are driven by opportunity chose to work independently in these informal sectors. Between necessity and engagement, refinement acted as a mediator. Often, necessity and opportunity do not automatically translate into successful entrepreneurship; further refinement is required in terms of market potential, technology usage, location preferences, and capital requirements. Improved refinement results in increased entrepreneurial engagement.  Conclusions - The role and contribution of the informal sector entrepreneurship in economic development need to be evaluated and not just observed as an opportunity for individuals who choose this type of career. Therefore, further research is required in a wider variety of contexts to evaluate whether the same remains true in different populations. The results of this study can be useful for the government to set policies to encourage the transition of informal to formal entrepreneurships in Malaysia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Plausible pathway for a host-parasite molecular replication network to increase its complexity through Darwinian evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rikuto Kamiura, Ryo Mizuuchi, Norikazu Ichihashi</p>

How the complexity of primitive self-replication molecules develops through Darwinian evolution remains a mystery with regards to the origin of life. Theoretical studies have proposed that coevolution with parasitic replicators increases network complexity by inducing inter-dependent replication. Particularly, Takeuchi and Hogeweg proposed a complexification process of replicator networks by successive appearance of a parasitic replicator followed by the addition of a new host replicator that is resistant to the parasitic replicator. However, the feasibility of such complexification with biologically relevant molecules is still unknown owing to the lack of an experimental model. Here, we investigated the plausible complexification pathway of host-parasite replicators using both an experimental host-parasite RNA replication system and a theoretical model based on the experimental system. We first analyzed the parameter space that allows for sustainable replication in various replication networks ranging from a single molecule to three-member networks using computer simulation. The analysis shows that the most plausible complexification pathway from a single host replicator is the addition of a parasitic replicator, followed by the addition of a new host replicator that is resistant to the parasite, consistent with the previous study by Takeuchi and Hogeweg. We also provide evidence that the pathway actually occurred in our previous evolutionary experiment. These results provide experimental evidence that a population of a single replicator spontaneously evolves into multi-replicator networks through coevolution with parasitic replicators.

                <p>by Matthias C. Rillig</p>

Lab teams are dynamic entities in which a lot depends on the principal investigator (PI) and the framework set by them. However, within these parameters, there is a lot of room for lab members to contribute to a happy and productive environment. Often doctoral students or postdocs (or other staff) may underestimate how much of a difference they can really make. Here are 10 simple rules on how to help make a lab a better place; these rules are mostly aimed at building better lab communities, where people help each other, look out for each other, and take an interest in critically questioning the status quo.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten quick tips for sequence-based prediction of protein properties using machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qingzhen Hou, Katharina Waury, Dea Gogishvili, K. Anton Feenstra</p>

The ubiquitous availability of genome sequencing data explains the popularity of machine learning-based methods for the prediction of protein properties from their amino acid sequences. Over the years, while revising our own work, reading submitted manuscripts as well as published papers, we have noticed several recurring issues, which make some reported findings hard to understand and replicate. We suspect this may be due to biologists being unfamiliar with machine learning methodology, or conversely, machine learning experts may miss some of the knowledge needed to correctly apply their methods to proteins. Here, we aim to bridge this gap for developers of such methods. The most striking issues are linked to a lack of clarity: how were annotations of interest obtained; which benchmark metrics were used; how are positives and negatives defined. Others relate to a lack of rigor: If you sneak in structural information, your method is not sequence-based; if you compare your own model to “state-of-the-art,” take the best methods; if you want to conclude that some method is better than another, obtain a significance estimate to support this claim. These, and other issues, we will cover in detail. These points may have seemed obvious to the authors during writing; however, they are not always clear-cut to the readers. We also expect many of these tips to hold for other machine learning-based applications in biology. Therefore, many computational biologists who develop methods in this particular subject will benefit from a concise overview of what to avoid and what to do instead.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interneuronal network model of theta-nested fast oscillations predicts differential effects of heterogeneity, gap junctions and short term depression for hyperpolarizing versus shunting inhibition</a></h4>

Theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus have been hypothesized to play a role in the encoding and retrieval of memories. Recently, it was shown that an intrinsic fast gamma mechanism in medial entorhinal cortex can be recruited by optogenetic stimulation at theta frequencies, which can persist with fast excitatory synaptic transmission blocked, suggesting a contribution of interneuronal network gamma (ING). We calibrated the passive and active properties of a 100-neuron model network to capture the range of passive properties and frequency/current relationships of experimentally recorded PV+ neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). The strength and probabilities of chemical and electrical synapses were also calibrated using paired recordings, as were the kinetics and short-term depression (STD) of the chemical synapses. Gap junctions that contribute a noticeable fraction of the input resistance were required for synchrony with hyperpolarizing inhibition; these networks exhibited theta-nested high frequency oscillations similar to the putative ING observed experimentally in the optogenetically-driven PV-ChR2 mice. With STD included in the model, the network desynchronized at frequencies above ~200 Hz, so for sufficiently strong drive, fast oscillations were only observed before the peak of the theta. Because hyperpolarizing synapses provide a synchronizing drive that contributes to robustness in the presence of heterogeneity, synchronization decreases as the hyperpolarizing inhibition becomes weaker. In contrast, networks with shunting inhibition required non-physiological levels of gap junctions to synchronize using conduction delays within the measured range.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Monitoring real-time transmission heterogeneity from incidence data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yunjun Zhang, Tom Britton, Xiaohua Zhou</p>

The transmission heterogeneity of an epidemic is associated with a complex mixture of host, pathogen and environmental factors. And it may indicate superspreading events to reduce the efficiency of population-level control measures and to sustain the epidemic over a larger scale and a longer duration. Methods have been proposed to identify significant transmission heterogeneity in historic epidemics based on several data sources, such as contact history, viral genomes and spatial information, which may not be available, and more importantly ignore the temporal trend of transmission heterogeneity. Here we attempted to establish a convenient method to estimate real-time heterogeneity over an epidemic. Within the branching process framework, we introduced an instant-individualheterogenous infectiousness model to jointly characterize the variation in infectiousness both between individuals and among different times. With this model, we could simultaneously estimate the transmission heterogeneity and the reproduction number from incidence time series. We validated the model with data of both simulated and real outbreaks. Our estimates of the overall and real-time heterogeneities of the six epidemics were consistent with those presented in the literature. Additionally, our model is robust to the ubiquitous bias of under-reporting and misspecification of serial interval. By analyzing recent data from South Africa, we found evidence that the Omicron might be of more significant transmission heterogeneity than Delta. Our model based on incidence data was proved to be reliable in estimating the real-time transmission heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Inorganic sulfur fixation via a new homocysteine synthase allows yeast cells to cooperatively compensate for methionine auxotrophy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason S. L. Yu, Benjamin M. Heineike, Johannes Hartl, Simran K. Aulakh, Clara Correia-Melo, Andrea Lehmann, Oliver Lemke, Federica Agostini, Cory T. Lee, Vadim Demichev, Christoph B. Messner, Michael Mülleder, Markus Ralser</p>

The assimilation, incorporation, and metabolism of sulfur is a fundamental process across all domains of life, yet how cells deal with varying sulfur availability is not well understood. We studied an unresolved conundrum of sulfur fixation in yeast, in which organosulfur auxotrophy caused by deletion of the homocysteine synthase Met17p is overcome when cells are inoculated at high cell density. In combining the use of self-establishing metabolically cooperating (SeMeCo) communities with proteomic, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we discovered an uncharacterized gene product YLL058Wp, herein named Hydrogen Sulfide Utilizing-1 (<i>HSU1</i>). Hsu1p acts as a homocysteine synthase and allows the cells to substitute for Met17p by reassimilating hydrosulfide ions leaked from <i>met17Δ</i> cells into O-acetyl-homoserine and forming homocysteine. Our results show that cells can cooperate to achieve sulfur fixation, indicating that the collective properties of microbial communities facilitate their basic metabolic capacity to overcome sulfur limitation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">ERK1/2 signalling dynamics promote neural differentiation by regulating chromatin accessibility and the polycomb repressive complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Claudia I. Semprich, Lindsay Davidson, Adriana Amorim Torres, Harshil Patel, James Briscoe, Vicki Metzis, Kate G. Storey</p>

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a neural inducer in many vertebrate embryos, but how it regulates chromatin organization to coordinate the activation of neural genes is unclear. Moreover, for differentiation to progress, FGF signalling must decline. Why these signalling dynamics are required has not been determined. Here, we show that dephosphorylation of the FGF effector kinase ERK1/2 rapidly increases chromatin accessibility at neural genes in mouse embryos, and, using ATAC-seq in human embryonic stem cell derived spinal cord precursors, we demonstrate that this occurs genome-wide across neural genes. Importantly, ERK1/2 inhibition induces precocious neural gene transcription, and this involves dissociation of the polycomb repressive complex from key gene loci. This takes place independently of subsequent loss of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and transcriptional onset. Transient ERK1/2 inhibition is sufficient for the dissociation of the repressive complex, and this is not reversed on resumption of ERK1/2 signalling. Moreover, genomic footprinting of sites identified by ATAC-seq together with ChIP-seq for polycomb protein Ring1B revealed that ERK1/2 inhibition promotes the occupancy of neural transcription factors (TFs) at non-polycomb as well as polycomb associated sites. Together, these findings indicate that ERK1/2 signalling decline promotes global changes in chromatin accessibility and TF binding at neural genes by directing polycomb and other regulators and appears to serve as a gating mechanism that provides directionality to the process of differentiation.

     alt="Cholesterol-24-hydroxylase (CYP46) in the old brain: Analysis of positive populations and factors triggering its expression in astrocytes"/><p>Aging triggers cholesterol-24-hydroxylase (CYP46) increase in neuronal populations but not in astrocytes. Enhanced <i>cyp46A1</i> gene expression in astrocytes requires cell activation and IL-6. Our data suggest different roles for CYP46 in both types of cells. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cholesterol-24-hydroxylase (CYP46), a member of the <i>cytochrome P450</i> superfamily of enzymes, is selectively expressed in the brain and is mainly responsible for cholesterol turnover in the central nervous system. Although increased <i>cyp46A1</i> gene expression has been linked to cognitive alterations in aging and observed in neurodegenerative diseases and after traumatic brain injury, a detailed characterization of the brain regions and cell types in which CYP46 is expressed in old individuals has not been performed. Using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, we investigated the specific regions and cell populations in the brain, in which <i>cyp46A1</i> is expressed in 24-month-old mice. We found that CYP46 is localized in the same neuronal populations in young and old brains, mainly in the hippocampus, in cortical layers, and in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. No increase in CYP46 levels was found in astrocytes in old mice brains, in primary astrocyte-neuron cocultures aged in vitro, or in primary cultures of senescent astrocytes. However, interleukin-6 treatment strongly induced <i>cyp46A1</i> expression in reactive astrocytes characterized by high GFAP levels but had no effect in nonactivated astrocytes. Our data suggest that cholesterol-24-hydroxylase expression is triggered in reactive astrocytes in response to proinflammatory signals, probably as part of a response mechanism to injury.</p>

     alt="The local and long-range input landscape of inhibitory neurons in mouse auditory cortex"/>
<p>We used monosynaptic rabies tracing to compare the presynaptic input landscape onto three inhibitory neuron subtypes, PV, SST, and VIP, in the mouse primary auditory cortex (A1). A leakless mutant of TVA receptor allowed us to compare both local patterns of monosynaptic inputs as well as long-range input patterns. Our work can be used as a resource for a quantitative comparison of the location and level of inputs impinging onto discrete populations of neurons in mouse A1.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Roughly 20% of the neurons in the mouse cortex are inhibitory interneurons (INs). Of these, the three major subtypes are parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) expressing neurons. We used monosynaptic rabies tracing to compare the presynaptic input landscape onto these three IN subtypes in the mouse primary auditory cortex (A1). We compared both local patterns of monosynaptic inputs as well as long-range input patterns. The local monosynaptic input landscape to SST neurons was more widespread as compared to PV and VIP neurons. The brain-wide input landscape was rich and heterogeneous with &gt;40 brain regions connecting to all the three INs subtypes from both hemispheres. The general pattern of the long-range input landscape was similar among the groups of INs. Nevertheless, a few differences could be identified. At low resolution, the proportion of local versus long-range inputs was smaller for PV neurons. At mesoscale resolution, we found fewer inputs from temporal association area to VIP INs, and more inputs to SST neurons from basal forebrain and lateral amygdala. Our work can be used as a resource for a quantitative comparison of the location and level of inputs impinging onto discrete populations of neurons in mouse A1.</p>

     alt="Diversity of cellular physiology and morphology of Purkinje cells in the adult zebrafish cerebellum"/><p>Simplified local circuitry of the zebrafish cerebellum based on our results. Four subtypes of Purkinje cells (Type I, II, IIIa, and IIIb) were identified based on the patterns of their dendritic arbors. Their physiology was also variable, but distinguishable from that of nearby eurydendroid cells. All subtypes of Purkinje cells receive parallel fiber (PF) inputs but in a selective manner. While Type II, IIIa, and IIIb cells respond to climbing fiber (CF) activation, it is uncertain whether Type I cells receive CF input. Like the Type I Purkinje cells, eurydendroid cells respond to PF, but not to CF activation. Thus, the zebrafish cerebellar cortex may perform different computations according to its diverse Purkinje cell subtypes, hence requiring a reevaluation of the learning rules expressed in its circuitry.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study was designed to explore the functional circuitry of the adult zebrafish cerebellum, focusing on its Purkinje cells and using whole-cell patch recordings and single cell labeling in slice preparations. Following physiological characterizations, the recorded single cells were labeled for morphological identification. It was found that the zebrafish Purkinje cells are surprisingly diverse. Based on their physiology and morphology, they can be classified into at least three subtypes: Type I, a <i>narrow spike cell</i>, which fires only narrow Na<sup>+</sup> spikes (&lt;3 ms in duration), and has a single primary dendrite with an arbor restricted to the distal molecular layer; Type II, a <i>broad spike cell</i>, which fires broad Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (5–7 ms in duration) and has a primary dendrite with limited branching in the inner molecular layer and then further radiates throughout the molecular layer; and Type III, a <i>very broad spike cell</i>, which fires very broad Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (≥10 ms in duration) and has a dense proximal dendritic arbor that is either restricted to the inner molecular layer (Type IIIa), or radiates throughout the entire molecular layer (Type IIIb). The graded paired-pulse facilitation of these Purkinje cells’ responses to parallel fiber activations and the all-or-none, paired-pulse depression of climbing fiber activation are largely similar to those reported for mammals. The labeled axon terminals of these Purkinje cells end locally, as reported for larval zebrafish. The present study provides evidence that the corresponding functional circuitry and information processing differ from what has been well-established in the mammalian cerebellum.</p>
