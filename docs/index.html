              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stable antibiotic resistance and rapid human adaptation in livestock-associated MRSA</a></h4>

              
                Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are agents of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, but can also be vertically inherited by daughter cells. Establishing the dynamics that led to contemporary patterns of MGEs in bacterial genomes is central to predicting the emergence and evolution of novel and resistant pathogens. Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) clonal-complex (CC) 398 is the dominant MRSA in European livestock and a growing cause of human infections. Previous studies have identified three categories of MGEs whose presence or absence distinguishes livestock-associated CC398 from a closely related and less antibiotic-resistant human-associated population. Here, we fully characterise the evolutionary dynamics of these MGEs using a collection of 1180 CC398 genomes, sampled from livestock and humans, over 27 years. We find that the emergence of livestock-associated CC398 coincided with the acquisition of a Tn<i>916</i> transposon carrying a tetracycline resistance gene, which has been stably inherited for 57 years. This was followed by the acquisition of a type V SCC<i>mec</i> that carries methicillin, tetracycline, and heavy metal resistance genes, which has been maintained for 35 years, with occasional truncations and replacements with type IV SCC<i>mec</i>. In contrast, a class of prophages that carry a human immune evasion gene cluster and that are largely absent from livestock-associated CC398 have been repeatedly gained and lost in both human- and livestock-associated CC398. These contrasting dynamics mean that when livestock-associated MRSA is transmitted to humans, adaptation to the human host outpaces loss of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the stable inheritance of resistance-associated MGEs suggests that the impact of ongoing reductions in antibiotic and zinc oxide use in European farms on livestock-associated MRSA will be slow to be realised.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CAMSAP2 organizes a γ-tubulin-independent microtubule nucleation centre through phase separation</a></h4>

              
                Microtubules are dynamic polymers consisting of αβ-tubulin heterodimers. The initial polymerization process, called microtubule nucleation, occurs spontaneously via αβ-tubulin. Since a large energy barrier prevents microtubule nucleation in cells, the γ-tubulin ring complex is recruited to the centrosome to overcome the nucleation barrier. However, a considerable number of microtubules can polymerize independently of the centrosome in various cell types. Here, we present evidence that the minus-end-binding calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2) serves as a strong nucleator for microtubule formation by significantly reducing the nucleation barrier. CAMSAP2 co-condensates with αβ-tubulin via a phase separation process, producing plenty of nucleation intermediates. Microtubules then radiate from the co-condensates, resulting in aster-like structure formation. CAMSAP2 localizes at the co-condensates and decorates the radiating microtubule lattices to some extent. Taken together, these in vitro findings suggest that CAMSAP2 supports microtubule nucleation and growth by organizing a nucleation centre as well as by stabilizing microtubule intermediates and growing microtubules.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robotic search for optimal cell culture in regenerative medicine</a></h4>

              
                Induced differentiation is one of the most experience- and skill-dependent experimental processes in regenerative medicine, and establishing optimal conditions often takes years. We developed a robotic AI system with a batch Bayesian optimization algorithm that autonomously induces the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (iPSC-RPE) cells. From 200 million possible parameter combinations, the system performed cell culture in 143 different conditions in 111 days, resulting in 88% better iPSC-RPE production than that obtained by the pre-optimized culture in terms of the pigmentation scores. Our work demonstrates that the use of autonomous robotic AI systems drastically accelerates systematic and unbiased exploration of experimental search space, suggesting immense use in medicine and research.

	<p>Background: Comprehensive geriatric care (CGC) is a multidisciplinary approach developed to meet the needs of older patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides valuable information for monitoring the cerebral function. As a surrogate, EEG findings may help to estimate the course of diseases as well as the treatment outcomes. Objectives: Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate EEG findings in older patients receiving CGC. Methods: Patients with an initial EEG in a geriatric unit between May 2019 and April 2020 and treated using the CGC approach were analyzed. EEG abnormalities were defined as generalized (diffuse) background slowing and/or intermittent/persistent focal slowing and/or epileptiform discharges. Assessment results for the Barthel index (BI), Tinetti Balance and Gait test (TBGT), and Timed Up and Go test (TUG) were analyzed in relation to the presence of EEG abnormalities. Results: The study included 398 patients (mean age: 83.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.57 years, 69.3% were female). Abnormal EEG patterns were found in 94 (23.6%) patients. Patients with EEG abnormalities had a mean age of 83.4 years versus a mean of 82.8 years in those without (p = 0.451). Based on all calculated scores, the majority of the patients improved after CGC, with a tendency to higher-grade improvements in those without EEG abnormalities (BI: 86.2% vs. 75.5%, p = 0.024; TUG: 53.3% vs. 31.9%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001); for TBGT, only a gradual difference was detected (TBGT prior CGC: 79.9% vs. TBGT after CGC: 71.3%, p = 0.088). The presence of EEG abnormalities was associated with the parameters dementia (36.2% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.010), known epilepsy/seizure (19.1% vs. 5.9%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), structural brain lesion (47.9% vs. 19.7%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and delirium (9.6% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.030) during hospitalization. Conclusions: We found EEG abnormalities in almost a quarter of the patients treated in the geriatric unit. In older patients, the presence of EEG abnormalities is associated with lower improvements after CGC.</p>

	<p>To evaluate the potential effect of radiofrequency ablation and deep brain stimulation in patients with treatment-refractory Tourette syndrome (TS), this study enrolled thirteen patients with TS who were admitted to our hospital between August 2002 and September 2018. Four patients received a single- or multi-target radiofrequency ablation after local, potentiated, or general anesthesia; eight patients underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery; and one patient underwent both ablation and DBS surgery. The severity of tics and obsessive compulsive disorder symptoms and the quality of life were evaluated using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), Yale&amp;amp;ndash;Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), and Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life scale (GTS-QOL), respectively, before surgery, one month after surgery, and at the final follow-up after surgery, which was conducted in December 2018. A paired-sample t test and a multiple linear regression analysis were performed to analyze the data. All patients underwent the operation successfully without any severe complications. Overall, the YGTSS total scores at one month post-surgery (44.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 22.3) and at the final visit (35.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 23.7) were significantly decreased compared with those at baseline (75.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.2; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Additionally, the YBOCS scores at one month post-surgery (16.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 10.1) and at the final visit (12.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.5) were significantly decreased compared with those at baseline (22.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.1; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the GTS-QOL scores at one month post-surgery (44.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.8) and at the final visit (31.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 17.8) were significantly decreased compared with those at baseline (58.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.2; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Results from a multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the improvement in the YGTSS total score was independently associated with the improvement in the GTS-QOL score at one month post-surgery (standardized &amp;amp;beta; = 0.716, p = 0.023) and at the final visit (standardized &amp;amp;beta; = 1.064, p = 0.000). Conversely, changes in YBOCS scores did not correlate with changes in GTS-QOL scores (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Our results demonstrate that tics, psychiatric symptoms, and the quality of life in patients with intractable TS may be relieved by stereotactic ablation surgery and deep brain stimulation. Furthermore, it appears that the improvement in tics contributes more to the post-operative quality of life of patients than does the improvement in obsessive compulsive symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Postnatal Development of Projections of the Postrhinal Cortex to the Entorhinal Cortex in the Rat</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to encode and retrieve contextual information is an inherent feature of episodic memory that starts to develop during childhood. The postrhinal cortex (POR), an area of the parahippocampal region (PHR), has a crucial role in encoding object-space information and translating egocentric to allocentric representation of local space. The strong connectivity of POR with the adjacent entorhinal cortex (EC), and consequently the hippocampus, suggests that the development of these connections could support the postnatal development of contextual memory. Here, we report that POR projections of the rat develop progressively from the first to the third postnatal week starting in the medial EC (MEC) before spreading to the lateral EC (LEC). The increased spread and complexity of postrhinal axonal distributions is accompanied by an increased complexity of entorhinal dendritic trees and an increase of postrhinal-entorhinal synapses, which supports a gradual maturation in functional activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Visual System Hyperexcitability and Compromised V1 Receptive Field Properties in Early-Stage Retinitis Pigmentosa in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Inherited retinal degenerative diseases are a prominent cause of blindness. Although mutations causing death of photoreceptors are mostly known, the pathophysiology downstream in the inner retina and along the visual pathway is incompletely characterized in the earliest disease stages. Here, we investigated retinal, midbrain and cortical visual function using electroretinography (ERG), the optomotor response (OMR), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), respectively, and single unit electrophysiology at the primary visual cortex (V1) in light-adapted juvenile (approximately one-month-old) and young adult (three-month-old) <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice, representative of early-stage retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Photopic ERG revealed up to ~30% hypersensitivity to light in <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice, as measured by the light intensity required to generate half-maximal b-wave (I<SUB>50</SUB> parameter). <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice also showed increased OMRs toward low spatial frequency (SF) drifting gratings, indicative of visual overexcitation at the midbrain level. At the V1 level, VEPs and single-cell recordings revealed prominent hyperexcitability in the juvenile <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice. Mean VEP amplitudes for light ON stimuli were nearly doubled in one-month-old <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice compared with controls, and more than doubled for light OFF. Single-cell recordings showed a significantly increased spontaneous V1 neuron firing in the <I>Rho</I><sup>P23H/WT</sup> mice, and persistent contrast and temporal sensitivities. In contrast, direction selectivity was severely compromised. Our data suggest that during early RP, the visual pathway becomes hyperexcited. This could have both compensatory and deleterious consequences for visual behavior. Further studies on the mechanisms of hyperexcitability are warranted as this could lead to therapeutic interventions for RP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Impairments in Fear Extinction Memory and Basolateral Amygdala Plasticity in the TgF344-AD Rat Model of Alzheimers Disease Are Distinct from Nonpathological Aging</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Fear-based disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) steepen age-related cognitive decline and double the risk for developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD). Because of the seemingly hyperactive properties of fear memories, PTSD symptoms can worsen with age. Perturbations in the synaptic circuitry supporting fear memory extinction are key neural substrates of PTSD. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a medial temporal lobe structure that is critical in the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of fear memories. As little is known about fear extinction memory and BLA synaptic dysfunction within the context of aging and AD, the goal of this study was to investigate how fear extinction memory deficits and basal amygdaloid nucleus (BA) synaptic dysfunction differentially associate in nonpathologic aging and AD in the TgF344AD (TgAD) rat model of AD. Young, middle-aged, and older-aged WT and TgAD rats were trained on a delay fear conditioning and extinction procedure before <I>ex vivo</I> extracellular field potential recording experiments in the BA. Relative to young WT rats, long-term extinction memory was impaired, and in general, was associated with a hyperexcitable BA and impaired LTP in TgAD rats at all ages. In contrast, long-term extinction memory was impaired in aged WT rats and was associated with impaired LTP but not BA hyperexcitability. Interestingly, the middle-aged TgAD rats showed intact short-term extinction and BA LTP, which is suggestive of a compensatory mechanism, whereas differential neural recruitment in older-aged WT rats may have facilitated short-term extinction. As such, associations between fear extinction memory and amygdala deficits in nonpathologic aging and AD are dissociable.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">MEG Activity in Visual and Auditory Cortices Represents Acoustic Speech-Related Information during Silent Lip Reading</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Speech is an intrinsically multisensory signal, and seeing the speaker&rsquo;s lips forms a cornerstone of communication in acoustically impoverished environments. Still, it remains unclear how the brain exploits visual speech for comprehension. Previous work debated whether lip signals are mainly processed along the auditory pathways or whether the visual system directly implements speech-related processes. To probe this, we systematically characterized dynamic representations of multiple acoustic and visual speech-derived features in source localized MEG recordings that were obtained while participants listened to speech or viewed silent speech. Using a mutual-information framework we provide a comprehensive assessment of how well temporal and occipital cortices reflect the physically presented signals and unique aspects of acoustic features that were physically absent but may be critical for comprehension. Our results demonstrate that both cortices feature a functionally specific form of multisensory restoration: during lip reading, they reflect unheard acoustic features, independent of co-existing representations of the visible lip movements. This restoration emphasizes the unheard pitch signature in occipital cortex and the speech envelope in temporal cortex and is predictive of lip-reading performance. These findings suggest that when seeing the speaker&rsquo;s lips, the brain engages both visual and auditory pathways to support comprehension by exploiting multisensory correspondences between lip movements and spectro-temporal acoustic cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Ovarian Hormones Regulate Nicotine Consumption and Accumbens Glutamatergic Plasticity in Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Women report greater cigarette cravings during the menstrual cycle phase with higher circulating levels of 17&beta;-estradiol (E2), which is metabolized to estrone (E1). Both E2 and E1 bind to estrogen receptors (ERs), which have been highly studied in the breast, uterus, and ovary. Recent studies have found that ERs are also located on GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). Glutamatergic plasticity in NAcore MSNs is altered following nicotine use; however, it is unknown whether estrogens impact this neurobiological consequence. To test the effect of estrogen on nicotine use, we ovariectomized (OVX) female rats that then underwent nicotine self-administration acquisition and compared them to ovary-intact (sham) rats. The OVX animals then received either sesame oil (vehicle), E2, or E1+E2 supplementation for 4 or 20 d before nicotine sessions. While both ovary-intact and OVX females readily discriminated levers, OVX females consumed less nicotine than sham females. Further, neither E2 nor E1+E2 increased nicotine consumption back to sham levels following OVX, regardless of the duration of the treatment. OVX also rendered NAcore MSNs in a potentiated state following nicotine self-administration, which was reversed by 4 d of systemic E2 treatment. Finally, we found that E2 and E1+E2 increased ER&alpha; mRNA in the NAcore, but nicotine suppressed this regardless of hormone treatment. Together, these results show that estrogens regulate nicotine neurobiology, but additional factors may be required to restore nicotine consumption to ovary-intact levels.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Atypical odontalgia and trigeminal neuralgia: psychological, behavioral and psychopharmacological approach in a dental clinic – an overview of pathologies related to the challenging differential diagnosis in orofacial pain [version 3; peer review: 1 appro</a></h4>

              
                Orofacial pain represents a challenge for dentists, especially if it does not have an odontogenic origin. Orofacial neuropathic pain may be chronic, is arduous to localize and may develop without obvious pathology. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, coexist and negatively affect this condition. This article presents one case of atypical odontalgia and one of trigeminal neuralgia treated with psychological and psychopharmacological tailored and adapted therapies, after conventional medications had failed. Additionally, an overview of the pathologies related to the challenging differential diagnosis in orofacial pain is given.  A 68-year-old man complained of chronic throbbing and burning pain in a maxillary tooth, which worsened upon digital pressure. Symptoms did not abate after amitriptyline therapy; psychological intervention along with antianxiety drug were supplemented and antidepressant agent dosage were incremented. The patient reported improvement and satisfaction with the multidisciplinary approach to his pathology. A 72-year-old man complained of chronic stabbing, intermittent, sharp, shooting and electric shock-like pain in an upper tooth, radiating and following the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Pain did not recur after psychological intervention and a prescription of antidepressant and antianxiety agents, while carbamazepine therapy had not been sufficient to control pain. Due to concerns with comorbid psychiatric disorders, we adopted a patient-centered, tailored and balanced therapy, favorably changing clinical outcomes. Comorbid psychiatric disorders have a negative impact on orofacial pain, and dentists should consider adopting tailored therapies, such as psychological counselling and behavioral and psychopharmacologic strategies, besides conventional treatments. They also must be familiar with the signs and symptoms of orofacial pain, obtaining a comprehensive view of the pathologies concerning the differential diagnosis. A prompt diagnosis may prevent pain chronicity, avoiding an increase in complexity and a shift to orofacial neuropathic pain and legal claims.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of ICU diaries on the occurrence of impaired mental health and quality of life of ICU SARS-CoV-2 patients and their families: a protocol for an observational cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic puts patients and their relatives at risk of developing post-intensive care syndrome (PICS and PICS-family). The use of an intensive care unit (ICU) diary for these patients could help fill in memory gaps and complete their fragmented illness narrative. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of an ICU diary on the occurrence of impaired mental health in patients admitted with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and their relatives. Methods: An observational cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 patients treated in the ICU of Elizabeth-Tweesteden Hospital (ETZ) in Tilburg, The Netherlands will be conducted. Adult patients admitted at the ICU because of respiratory insufficiency due to SARS-CoV-2, who are mechanically ventilated, are included. During treatment in the ICU a diary is kept of the patient. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, cognitive dysfunction and quality of life will be screened in patients and their relatives by using the psychosocial screening instrument for adult trauma patients (PSIT), the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) and the short-form health survey 36 (SF-36). The recollection of patients’ memory of the ICU stay will be evaluated by the ICU memory tool. The appreciation of the ICU diary will be assessed using a questionnaire. Results: Participants’ characteristics including how they valued the diary, and their memory of ICU treatment will be reported. Multiple logistic regression analysis will be performed for analyzing the relation between mental health outcome and the use of ICU diaries. Change in PICS symptoms over time will be analyzed using longitudinal data analysis. Missing values in questionnaires will be analyzed using missing value analysis and multiple imputations at item level will be performed if necessary. Conclusions: This study will contribute to the knowledge of mental health outcome in SARS-CoV-2 patients and the use of ICU diaries in this group.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A large-scale image dataset of wood surface defects for automated vision-based quality control processes [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The wood industry is facing many challenges. The high variability of raw material and the complexity of manufacturing processes results in a wide range of visible structure defects, which have to be controlled by trained specialists. These manual processes are not only tedious and biased, but also less effective. To overcome the drawbacks of the manual quality control processes, several automated vision-based systems have been proposed. Even though some conducted studies achieved a higher recognition rate than trained experts, researchers have to deal with a lack of large-scale databases and authentic data in this field. To address this issue, we performed a data acquisition experiment set in the industrial environment, where we were able to acquire an extensive set of authentic data from a production line. For this purpose, we designed and implemented a complex technical solution suitable for high-speed acquisition during harsh manufacturing conditions. In this data note, we present a large-scale dataset of high-resolution sawn timber surface images containing more than 43 000 labelled surface defects and covering 10 types of the most common wood defects. Moreover, with each image record, we provide two types of labels allowing researchers to perform semantic segmentation, as well as defect classification, and localization.

                Background - Smart City integrates systems with the latest technologies to enable fast track of information and decision making by individuals, government, businesses, and public. Smart City connects people and information to manage public amenities, control crime rates, enhance services effectiveness, create vibrant, competitive, and innovative cities, and improve quality of life. Islamic Smart City can be defined as a smart city that incorporates the Islamic Syariah from Al-Quran and Hadith as a way of life; and impart the main component of Islamic Syariah compliance in individual and organisational behaviour aspects such as ethics, cleanliness, trust, security, and others. This research aims to explore the stakeholders’ readiness in four aspects of technology, human, institutional and Islamic factors, which are important in the development and implementation of the Islamic Smart City. Methods – This qualitative research design collected data through interviews with 20 selected stakeholders.  Results– The findings provide the state government with insights into stakeholders’ readiness, which is crucial to the development of Islamic Smart City. The findings also show that the stakeholders’ readiness in the technology is high; but it is lacking in the Institutional and Islamic factors. Conclusion: This research provides insights that the development of Islamic Smart City requires major concern  such as ensuring the stakeholders’ readiness  for technology,  human factors, the institutional and the Islamic factors are met.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Utilizing data sampling techniques on algorithmic fairness for customer churn prediction with data imbalance problems [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Customer churn prediction (CCP) refers to detecting which customers are likely to cancel the services provided by a service provider, for example, internet services. The class imbalance problem (CIP) in machine learning occurs when there is a huge difference in the samples of the positive class compared to the negative class. It is one of the major obstacles in CCP as it deteriorates performance in the classification process. Utilizing data sampling techniques (DSTs) helps to resolve the CIP to some extent. Methods: In this paper, we review the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness, i.e., to investigate whether the results pose any discrimination between male and female groups and compare the results before and after using DSTs. Three real-world datasets with unequal balancing rates were prepared and four ubiquitous DSTs were applied to them. Six popular classification techniques were utilized in the classification process. Both classifier’s performance and algorithmic fairness are evaluated with notable metrics. Results: The results indicated that the Random Forest classifier outperforms other classifiers in all three datasets and, that using SMOTE and ADASYN techniques causes more discrimination in the female group. The rate of unintentional discrimination seems to be higher in the original data of extremely unbalanced datasets under the following classifiers: Logistics Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Conclusions: Algorithmic fairness has become a broadly studied area in recent years, yet there is very little systematic study on the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness. This study presents important findings to further the use of algorithmic fairness in CCP research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Saudi Arabian students in postgraduate dental programs: Investigating factors associated with burnout [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout related to emotional and physical study or work demands affects an individual’s performance and wellbeing. This study focused on Saudi Arabian dental residents studying in the United States and the United Kingdom who are faced with many challenges in the pursuit of a higher education degree.  Methods: A survey including demographic and Maslach Burnout inventory (MBI) questions was distributed to assess this population’s level of burnout. The MBI has been widely used in the literature to assess three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DEP), and (diminished) personal accomplishment (PA). Potential predictors of burnout level, tested for statistical significance, included: (1) country (US vs UK), (2) hours of work, (3) sponsorship status, (4) marital status (5) gender, and (6) prior work experience.  Results: The number of participants from the UK was 29 and from the US was 64 (n=93). The total number of participants who completed the survey was 87. Using multiple regression analyses, those found to predict EE included hours of work, sponsorship status, and gender. Only gender was found to predict PA. None of the variables were predictive of DEP. Moreover, after controlling for the demographic variables, the country where studying did not help account for the level of burnout.  Conclusion: In the literature, burnout was found to be prevalent among dental postgraduate students. This study suggests that Saudi Arabian dental residents experience high burnout due to emotional exhaustion when compared to other medical professionals. Moreover, Female residents are more likely to report experiencing burnout than their male counterparts. Limitations of the study, implications for practice and suggestions for further research are offered in the discussion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Leveraging on digital technology for financial inclusion of women agripreneurs in Southern Nigeria [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Women are key players in agriculture, but they are under-resourced, particularly in terms of finance. Microfinance has long been recognized as the most effective method of financially empowering these women, but using the benefits of digital technology can help scale it up and ensure its long-term viability. Methods The study area was Southern Nigeria. Respondents were women agripreneurs (n=479), from six states. 239 women agripreneurs who accessed digital financial products and 240 women agripreneurs who did not access financial products participated in the survey in 2019. Results The tests for significant difference between income of participants and non-participants in digital finance indicated a T-value of 3.214 (P< 0.001), which implies that there was a significant difference in the income of those that are accessing digital financial products (DFPs) and those that are not accessing DFPs. The tests for significant difference between savings of participants and non-participants indicated a T-value of 2.479 (p<0.05), which also implies that there was a significant difference in the women agripreneurs’ savings for participants and non-participants in DFPs. Only 2.5% of  women agripreneurs are participating in micro-insurance in Southern Nigeria. Conclusions Women agripreneurs who are accessing digital financial products earned more income and saved more than those who are not accessing digital financial products. This implies that you are more advantaged in using digital finance in business. Micro-insurance is poorly accessed in Nigeria, and awareness of insurance products is moderately low. This study recommends that Central Bank of Nigeria should engage in more outreach programmes to enable all women in Nigeria access digital financial products because of its convenience and contributions to success in business. Insurance companies should capitalize on business models that incorporate mobile technologies in order to increase insurance penetration in rural areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bayesian subjectivism and psychosocial attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: People resistant to vaccination against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been counted in almost all countries worldwide. This anti-scientific subjectivity attitude could be explained by assuming as background the individual probability theory originally elaborated by the statistical school of de Finetti. Methods: This research method is based on a sample of 613 subjects from European countries who completed a questionnaire on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations. On a six-value scale, a questionnaire investigated knowledge, assessments, degree of confidence, level of fear, anguish, and anger. Some items proposed an imaginary bet on the probability of not getting sick to deepen the possible presence of subjectivist assumptions about pandemics. Results: 50.4% were against vaccines and 52.5% against the so-called "Green Pass". Results of t-tests and correlations and stepwise regressions indicate that the sample’s reasons for opposing vaccination are related to an ego centred vision of the values that assign minor, if any, confidence to authority. Conclusions: This result supports the conclusion that No Vax decisions are more based on subjectivist probabilistic assumptions, thus in line with the significant social trend called "individualism".

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Phytochemical study of the plant species Bidens pilosa L. (Asteraceae) and Croton floccosus (Euphorbiaceae) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Given the chemical richness of medicinal plants (Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus) in Ecuador, they are considered the natural source of numerous medicines. Methods: The leaves were dried at 40°C and 50°C and the extracts were characterized by means of phytochemical screening, verifying the presence of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, reducing sugars, phenols, flavonoids, tannins and saponins. Three extraction processes were carried out, with two solvents of different polarities: hexane and ethanol. The extraction methods that were applied to the leaves of the plants were Soxhlet, ultrasonic bath and maceration, the latter two at room temperature and Soxhlet at the boiling temperature of the solvent. Determination of the total content of phenols and flavonoids is carried out using the Follin-Ciocalteau colorimetric reaction, Quercetin standard, Aluminum Chloride solution measured with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity was performed with the DPPH radical and measured with the same equipment. Results: The highest content of total phenols obtained by employing the Soxhlet method for extraction when the material was dried at 50°C was 48.609 ± 0.370 mg GAE/g of dry sample for Bidens pilosa L. while in the case of Croton floccosus it was 128.212 ± 0.601 mg GAE/g of dry sample obtained from the extraction by means of maceration. Finally, the antioxidant activity against the 1.1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl radical was determined, and it was found that the Bidens pilosa L. species performed better and responded better to the test, with an IC50 value of 239.33 µg/mL, than Croton floccosus (IC50 of 644.125 µg/mL). Conclusions: The following preliminary phytochemical study of the Bidens pilosa L. and Croton floccosus plants provided important information on the content of secondary metabolites and response to the DPPH radical reported for the first time in Ecuador, which may be future use for medicinal application.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterizing superspreading potential of infectious disease: Decomposition of individual transmissibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shi Zhao, Marc K. C. Chong, Sukhyun Ryu, Zihao Guo, Mu He, Boqiang Chen, Salihu S. Musa, Jingxuan Wang, Yushan Wu, Daihai He, Maggie H. Wang</p>

In the context of infectious disease transmission, high heterogeneity in individual infectiousness indicates that a few index cases can generate large numbers of secondary cases, a phenomenon commonly known as superspreading. The potential of disease superspreading can be characterized by describing the distribution of secondary cases (of each seed case) as a negative binomial (NB) distribution with the dispersion parameter, <i>k</i>. Based on the feature of NB distribution, there must be a proportion of individuals with individual reproduction number of almost 0, which appears restricted and unrealistic. To overcome this limitation, we generalized the compound structure of a Poisson rate and included an additional parameter, and divided the reproduction number into independent and additive fixed and variable components. Then, the secondary cases followed a Delaporte distribution. We demonstrated that the Delaporte distribution was important for understanding the characteristics of disease transmission, which generated new insights distinct from the NB model. By using real-world dataset, the Delaporte distribution provides improvements in describing the distributions of COVID-19 and SARS cases compared to the NB distribution. The model selection yielded increasing statistical power with larger sample sizes as well as conservative type I error in detecting the improvement in fitting with the likelihood ratio (LR) test. Numerical simulation revealed that the control strategy-making process may benefit from monitoring the transmission characteristics under the Delaporte framework. Our findings highlighted that for the COVID-19 pandemic, population-wide interventions may control disease transmission on a general scale before recommending the high-risk-specific control strategies.

                <p>by Raphael R. Eguchi, Christian A. Choe, Po-Ssu Huang</p>

While deep learning models have seen increasing applications in protein science, few have been implemented for protein backbone generation—an important task in structure-based problems such as active site and interface design. We present a new approach to building class-specific backbones, using a variational auto-encoder to directly generate the 3D coordinates of immunoglobulins. Our model is torsion- and distance-aware, learns a high-resolution embedding of the dataset, and generates novel, high-quality structures compatible with existing design tools. We show that the Ig-VAE can be used with Rosetta to create a computational model of a SARS-CoV2-RBD binder via latent space sampling. We further demonstrate that the model’s generative prior is a powerful tool for guiding computational protein design, motivating a new paradigm under which backbone design is solved as constrained optimization problem in the latent space of a generative model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Data-based stochastic modeling reveals sources of activity bursts in single-cell TGF-β signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Niklas Kolbe, Lorenz Hexemer, Lukas-Malte Bammert, Alexander Loewer, Mária Lukáčová-Medvid’ová, Stefan Legewie</p>

Cells sense their surrounding by employing intracellular signaling pathways that transmit hormonal signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. TGF-β/SMAD signaling encodes various cell fates, controls tissue homeostasis and is deregulated in diseases such as cancer. The pathway shows strong heterogeneity at the single-cell level, but quantitative insights into mechanisms underlying fluctuations at various time scales are still missing, partly due to inefficiency in the calibration of stochastic models that mechanistically describe signaling processes. In this work we analyze single-cell TGF-β/SMAD signaling and show that it exhibits temporal stochastic bursts which are dose-dependent and whose number and magnitude correlate with cell migration. We propose a stochastic modeling approach to mechanistically describe these pathway fluctuations with high computational efficiency. Employing high-order numerical integration and fitting to burst statistics we enable efficient quantitative parameter estimation and discriminate models that assume noise in different reactions at the receptor level. This modeling approach suggests that stochasticity in the internalization of TGF-β receptors into endosomes plays a key role in the observed temporal bursting. Further, the model predicts the single-cell dynamics of TGF-β/SMAD signaling in untested conditions, e.g., successfully reflects memory effects of signaling noise and cellular sensitivity towards repeated stimulation. Taken together, our computational framework based on burst analysis, noise modeling and path computation scheme is a suitable tool for the data-based modeling of complex signaling pathways, capable of identifying the source of temporal noise.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Increasing reproducibility, robustness, and generalizability of biomarker selection from meta-analysis using Bayesian methodology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laurynas Kalesinskas, Sanjana Gupta, Purvesh Khatri</p>

A major limitation of gene expression biomarker studies is that they are not reproducible as they simply do not generalize to larger, real-world, heterogeneous populations. Frequentist multi-cohort gene expression meta-analysis has been frequently used as a solution to this problem to identify biomarkers that are truly differentially expressed. However, the frequentist meta-analysis framework has its limitations–it needs at least 4–5 datasets with hundreds of samples, is prone to confounding from outliers and relies on multiple-hypothesis corrected p-values. To address these shortcomings, we have created a Bayesian meta-analysis framework for the analysis of gene expression data. Using real-world data from three different diseases, we show that the Bayesian method is more robust to outliers, creates more informative estimates of between-study heterogeneity, reduces the number of false positive and false negative biomarkers and selects more generalizable biomarkers with less data. We have compared the Bayesian framework to a previously published frequentist framework and have developed a publicly available R package for use.

                <p>by Yili Zhang, Paul Smolen, Cristina M. Alberini, Douglas A. Baxter, John H. Byrne</p>

Key features of long-term memory (LTM), such as its stability and persistence, are acquired during processes collectively referred to as consolidation. The dynamics of biological changes during consolidation are complex. In adult rodents, consolidation exhibits distinct periods during which the engram is more or less resistant to disruption. Moreover, the ability to consolidate memories differs during developmental periods. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying consolidation are poorly understood, the initial stages rely on interacting signaling pathways that regulate gene expression, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α (CaMKIIα) dependent feedback loops. We investigated the ways in which these pathways may contribute to developmental and dynamical features of consolidation. A computational model of molecular processes underlying consolidation following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training in rats was developed. Differential equations described the actions of CaMKIIα, multiple feedback loops regulating BDNF expression, and several transcription factors including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), and SIN3 transcription regulator family member A (Sin3a). This model provides novel explanations for the (apparent) rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the temporal progression of memory consolidation in adults. Simulations predict that dual effects of MeCP2 on the expression of <i>bdnf</i>, and interaction between MeCP2 and CaMKIIα, play critical roles in the rapid forgetting of infantile memory and the progress of memory resistance to disruptions. These insights suggest new potential targets of therapy for memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical modeling of the microtubule detyrosination/tyrosination cycle for cell-based drug screening design</a></h4>

Microtubules and their post-translational modifications are involved in major cellular processes. In severe diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, tyrosinated tubulin and tyrosinated microtubules are in lower concentration. We present here a mechanistic mathematical model of the microtubule tyrosination cycle combining computational modeling and high-content image analyses to understand the key kinetic parameters governing the tyrosination status in different cellular models. That mathematical model is parameterized, firstly, for neuronal cells using kinetic values taken from the literature, and, secondly, for proliferative cells, by a change of two parameter values obtained, and shown minimal, by a continuous optimization procedure based on temporal logic constraints to formalize experimental high-content imaging data. In both cases, the mathematical models explain the inability to increase the tyrosination status by activating the Tubulin Tyrosine Ligase enzyme. The tyrosinated tubulin is indeed the product of a chain of two reactions in the cycle: the detyrosinated microtubule depolymerization followed by its tyrosination. The tyrosination status at equilibrium is thus limited by both reaction rates and activating the tyrosination reaction alone is not effective. Our computational model also predicts the effect of inhibiting the Tubulin Carboxy Peptidase enzyme which we have experimentally validated in MEF cellular model. Furthermore, the model predicts that the activation of two particular kinetic parameters, the tyrosination and detyrosinated microtubule depolymerization rate constants, in synergy, should suffice to enable an increase of the tyrosination status in living cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An ensemble forecast system for tracking dynamics of dengue outbreaks and its validation in China</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuliang Chen, Tao Liu, Xiaolin Yu, Qinghui Zeng, Zixi Cai, Haisheng Wu, Qingying Zhang, Jianpeng Xiao, Wenjun Ma, Sen Pei, Pi Guo</p>

As a common vector-borne disease, dengue fever remains challenging to predict due to large variations in epidemic size across seasons driven by a number of factors including population susceptibility, mosquito density, meteorological conditions, geographical factors, and human mobility. An ensemble forecast system for dengue fever is first proposed that addresses the difficulty of predicting outbreaks with drastically different scales. The ensemble forecast system based on a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) type of compartmental model coupled with a data assimilation method called the ensemble adjusted Kalman filter (EAKF) is constructed to generate real-time forecasts of dengue fever spread dynamics. The model was informed by meteorological and mosquito density information to depict the transmission of dengue virus among human and mosquito populations, and generate predictions. To account for the dramatic variations of outbreak size in different seasons, the effective population size parameter that is sequentially updated to adjust the predicted outbreak scale is introduced into the model. Before optimizing the transmission model, we update the effective population size using the most recent observations and historical records so that the predicted outbreak size is dynamically adjusted. In the retrospective forecast of dengue outbreaks in Guangzhou, China during the 2011–2017 seasons, the proposed forecast model generates accurate projections of peak timing, peak intensity, and total incidence, outperforming a generalized additive model approach. The ensemble forecast system can be operated in real-time and inform control planning to reduce the burden of dengue fever.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring the effective reproductive number from deterministic and semi-deterministic compartmental models using incidence and mobility data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jair Andrade, Jim Duggan</p>

The effective reproduction number (ℜ<sub>t</sub>) is a theoretical indicator of the course of an infectious disease that allows policymakers to evaluate whether current or previous control efforts have been successful or whether additional interventions are necessary. This metric, however, cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from available data. One approach to obtaining such estimates is fitting compartmental models to incidence data. We can envision these dynamic models as the ensemble of structures that describe the disease’s natural history and individuals’ behavioural patterns. In the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the assumption of a constant transmission rate is rendered unrealistic, and it is critical to identify a mathematical formulation that accounts for changes in contact patterns. In this work, we leverage existing approaches to propose three complementary formulations that yield similar estimates for ℜ<sub>t</sub> based on data from Ireland’s first COVID-19 wave. We describe these Data Generating Processes (DGP) in terms of State-Space models. Two (DGP1 and DGP2) correspond to stochastic process models whose transmission rate is modelled as Brownian motion processes (Geometric and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross). These DGPs share a measurement model that accounts for incidence and transmission rates, where mobility data is assumed as a proxy of the transmission rate. We perform inference on these structures using Iterated Filtering and the Particle Filter. The final DGP (DGP3) is built from a pool of deterministic models that describe the transmission rate as information delays. We calibrate this pool of models to incidence reports using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. By following this complementary approach, we assess the tradeoffs associated with each formulation and reflect on the benefits/risks of incorporating proxy data into the inference process. We anticipate this work will help evaluate the implications of choosing a particular formulation for the dynamics and observation of the time-varying transmission rate.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The topology of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions unravels independent modules and high network flexibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Verónica S. Martínez, Pedro A. Saa, Jason Jooste, Kanupriya Tiwari, Lake-Ee Quek, Lars K. Nielsen</p>

The topology of metabolic networks is recognisably modular with modules weakly connected apart from sharing a pool of currency metabolites. Here, we defined modules as sets of reversible reactions isolated from the rest of metabolism by irreversible reactions except for the exchange of currency metabolites. Our approach identifies topologically independent modules under specific conditions associated with different metabolic functions. As case studies, the <i>E</i>.<i>coli i</i>JO1366 and Human Recon 2.2 genome-scale metabolic models were split in 103 and 321 modules respectively, displaying significant correlation patterns in expression data. Finally, we addressed a fundamental question about the metabolic flexibility conferred by reversible reactions: “Of all Directed Topologies (DTs) defined by fixing directions to all reversible reactions, how many are capable of carrying flux through all reactions?”. Enumeration of the DTs for <i>i</i>JO1366 model was performed using an efficient depth-first search algorithm, rejecting infeasible DTs based on mass-imbalanced and loopy flux patterns. We found the direction of 79% of reversible reactions must be defined before all directions in the network can be fixed, granting a high degree of flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Covalent docking and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the specificity-shifting mutations Ala237Arg and Ala237Lys in TEM beta-lactamase</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriel Monteiro da Silva, Jordan Yang, Bunlong Leang, Jessie Huang, Daniel M. Weinreich, Brenda M. Rubenstein</p>

The rate of modern drug discovery using experimental screening methods still lags behind the rate at which pathogens mutate, underscoring the need for fast and accurate predictive simulations of protein evolution. Multidrug-resistant bacteria evade our defenses by expressing a series of proteins, the most famous of which is the 29-kilodalton enzyme, TEM β-lactamase. Considering these challenges, we applied a covalent docking heuristic to measure the effects of all possible alanine 237 substitutions in TEM due to this codon’s importance for catalysis and effects on the binding affinities of commercially-available β-lactam compounds. In addition to the usual mutations that reduce substrate binding due to steric hindrance, we identified two distinctive specificity-shifting TEM mutations, Ala237Arg and Ala237Lys, and their respective modes of action. Notably, we discovered and verified through minimum inhibitory concentration assays that, while these mutations and their bulkier side chains lead to steric clashes that curtail ampicillin binding, these same groups foster salt bridges with the negatively-charged side-chain of the cephalosporin cefixime, widely used in the clinic to treat multi-resistant bacterial infections. To measure the stability of these unexpected interactions, we used molecular dynamics simulations and found the binding modes to be stable despite the application of biasing forces. Finally, we found that both TEM mutants also bind strongly to other drugs containing negatively-charged R-groups, such as carumonam and ceftibuten. As with cefixime, this increased binding affinity stems from a salt bridge between the compounds’ negative moieties and the positively-charged side chain of the arginine or lysine, suggesting a shared mechanism. In addition to reaffirming the power of using simulations as molecular microscopes, our results can guide the rational design of next-generation β-lactam antibiotics and bring the community closer to retaking the lead against the recurrent threat of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The LXRs agonist GW3965 ameliorates chronic unpredictable stress-induced depression-like behaviors. LXRs agonist treatment can inhibit hippocampal neuroinflammation of CUS model mice, reverse the increase in the number of Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells in the hippocampal subregions, inhibit the activation of microglia in hippocampal CA2/3 and DG regions, and significantly increase the branch length and endpoints of microglia in the DG of CUS model mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Liver X receptors (LXRs) have recently been reported to be novel and potential targets for the reversal of depressive-like behaviors, but the mechanism remains unclear. Hippocampal neuroinflammation and impairment of the normal structure and function of microglia are closely associated with depression. To investigate the effects of LXRs agonist (GW3965) on neuroinflammation and microglia in the hippocampal formation of mice with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression, depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by behavioral tests, hippocampal LXRs gene expression were evaluated by qRT-PCR, the protein expression levels of interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor kappa B, and cluster of differentiation 206 were estimated by western blotting, modern stereological methods were used to precisely quantify the total number of microglia in each hippocampal subregion, and immunofluorescence was used to detect the density of activated microglia and the morphology of microglia. We found that GW3965 alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by CUS, reversed the decrease in hippocampal LXRα and LXRβ induced by CUS, increased the protein expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and decreased the protein expression of antiinflammatory factors induced by CUS. Moreover, CUS intervention significantly increased the number of microglia in the CA1 region, CA2/3 region, and dentate gyrus and the density of activated microglia in the CA2/3 region and dentate gyrus and significantly decreased the endpoints of microglial branches and process length of microglia in the dentate gyrus, while 4 weeks of injections with GW3965 reversed these changes. These findings suggest that regulating the number, activated state, and morphology of microglia in hippocampal subregions might be an important basis for the antidepressant effects of LXRs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The integrated stress response remodels the microtubule organizing center to clear unfolded proteins following proteotoxic stress</a></h4>

              
                Cells encountering stressful situations activate the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway to limit protein synthesis and redirect translation to better cope. The ISR has also been implicated in cancers, but redundancies in the stress-sensing kinases that trigger the ISR have posed hurdles to dissecting physiological relevance. To overcome this challenge, we targeted the regulatory node of these kinases, namely the S51 phosphorylation site of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α and genetically replaced eIF2α with eIF2α-S51A in mouse squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) stem cells of skin. While inconsequential under normal growth conditions, the vulnerability of this ISR-null state was unveiled when SCC stem cells experienced proteotoxic stress. Seeking mechanistic insights into the protective roles of the ISR, we combined ribosome profiling and functional approaches to identify and probe the functional importance of translational differences between ISR-competent and ISR-null SCC stem cells when exposed to proteotoxic stress. In doing so, we learned that the ISR redirects translation to centrosomal proteins that orchestrate the microtubule dynamics needed to efficiently concentrate unfolded proteins at the microtubule organizing center so that they can be cleared by the perinuclear degradation machinery. Thus, rather than merely maintaining survival during proteotoxic stress, the ISR also functions in promoting cellular recovery once the stress has subsided. Remarkably, this molecular program is unique to transformed skin stem cells hence exposing a vulnerability in cancer that could be exploited therapeutically.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Integration of visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback during head stabilization in hawkmoths</a></h4>

              
                During flight maneuvers, insects exhibit compensatory head movements which are essential for stabilizing the visual field on their retina, reducing motion blur, and supporting visual self-motion estimation. In Diptera, such head movements are mediated <i>via</i> visual feedback from their compound eyes that detect retinal slip, as well as rapid mechanosensory feedback from their halteres - the modified hindwings that sense the angular rates of body rotations. Because non-Dipteran insects lack halteres, it is not known if mechanosensory feedback about body rotations plays any role in their head stabilization response. Diverse non-Dipteran insects are known to rely on visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback for flight control. In hawkmoths, for instance, reduction of antennal mechanosensory feedback severely compromises their ability to control flight. Similarly, when the head movements of freely-flying moths are restricted, their flight ability is also severely impaired. The role of compensatory head movements as well as multimodal feedback in insect flight raises an interesting question: in insects that lack halteres, what sensory cues are required for head stabilization? Here, we show that in the nocturnal hawkmoth <i>Daphnis nerii</i>, compensatory head movements are mediated by combined visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback. We subjected tethered moths to open-loop body roll rotations under different lighting conditions, and measured their ability to maintain head angle in the presence or absence of antennal mechanosensory feedback. Our study suggests that head stabilization in moths is mediated primarily by visual feedback during roll movements at lower frequencies, whereas antennal mechanosensory feedback is required when roll occurs at higher frequency. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that control of head angle results from a multimodal feedback loop that integrates both visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback, <i>albeit</i> at different latencies. At adequate light levels, visual feedback is sufficient for head stabilization primarily at low frequencies of body roll. However, under dark conditions, antennal mechanosensory feedback is essential for the control of head movements at high of body roll.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phosphoregulation of DSB-1 mediates control of meiotic double-strand break activity</a></h4>

              
                In the first meiotic cell division, proper segregation of chromosomes in most organisms depends on chiasmata, exchanges of continuity between homologous chromosomes that originate from the repair of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the Spo11 endonuclease. Since DSBs can lead to irreparable damage in germ cells, while chromosomes lacking DSBs also lack chiasmata, the number of DSBs must be carefully regulated to be neither too high nor too low. Here, we show that in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, meiotic DSB levels are controlled by the phosphoregulation of DSB-1, a homolog of the yeast Spo11 cofactor Rec114, by the opposing activities of PP4<sup>PPH-4.1</sup> phosphatase and ATR<sup>ATL-1</sup> kinase. Increased DSB-1 phosphorylation in <i>pph-4.1</i> mutants correlates with reduction in DSB formation, while prevention of DSB-1 phosphorylation drastically increases the number of meiotic DSBs both in <i>pph-4.1</i> mutants as well as in the wild type background. <i>C. elegans</i> and its close relatives also possess a diverged paralog of DSB-1, called DSB-2, and loss of <i>dsb-2</i> is known to reduce DSB formation in oocytes with increasing age. We show that the proportion of the phosphorylated, and thus inactivated, form of DSB-1 increases with age and upon loss of DSB-2, while non-phosphorylatable DSB-1 rescues the age-dependent decrease in DSBs in <i>dsb-2</i> mutants. These results suggest that DSB-2 evolved in part to compensate for the inactivation of DSB-1 through phosphorylation, to maintain levels of DSBs in older animals. Our work shows that PP4<sup>PPH-4.1</sup>, ATR<sup>ATL-1</sup>, and DSB-2 act in concert with DSB-1 to promote optimal DSB levels throughout the reproductive lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transferrin receptor 1-mediated iron uptake regulates bone mass in mice via osteoclast mitochondria and cytoskeleton</a></h4>

              
                Increased intracellular iron spurs mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration to satisfy high-energy demand during osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorbing activities. Transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) mediates cellular iron uptake through endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin and its expression increases during osteoclast differentiation. Nonetheless, the precise functions of Tfr1 and Tfr1-mediated iron uptake in osteoclast biology and skeletal homeostasis remain incompletely understood. To investigate the role of Tfr1 in osteoclast lineage cells <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, we crossed <i>Tfrc </i>(encoding Tfr1)-floxed mice with <i>Lyz2 (LysM)-</i>Cre and <i>Cathepsin K</i> (<i>Ctsk)</i>-Cre mice to generate <i>Tfrc</i> conditional knockout mice in myeloid osteoclast precursors (Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup>) or differentiated osteoclasts (Tfr1<sup>ΔCtsk</sup>), respectively. Skeletal phenotyping by µCT and histology unveiled a significant increase in trabecular bone mass with normal osteoclast number in long bones of 10-week-old young and 6-month-old adult female but not male Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice. Although high trabecular bone volume in long bones was observed in both male and female Tfr1<sup>ΔCtsk</sup> mice, this phenotype was more pronounced in female knockout mice. Consistent with this gender-dependent phenomena, estrogen-deficiency induced by ovariectomy decreased trabecular bone mass in Tfr1<sup>ΔLysM</sup> mice. Mechanistically, disruption of Tfr1 expression attenuated mitochondrial metabolism and cytoskeletal organization in mature osteoclasts <i>in vitro </i>by attenuating mitochondrial respiration and activation of the Src-Rac1-WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) axis, respectively, leading to decreased bone resorption with little impact on osteoclast differentiation. These results indicate that Tfr1-mediated iron uptake is specifically required for osteoclast function and is indispensable for bone remodeling in a gender-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cystathionine-β-synthase is essential for AKT-induced senescence and suppresses the development of gastric cancers with PI3K/AKT activation</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactivation of oncogenic pathways downstream of RAS and PI3K/AKT in normal cells induces a senescence-like phenotype that acts as a tumor-suppressive mechanism that must be overcome during transformation. We previously demonstrated that AKT-induced senescence (AIS) is associated with profound transcriptional and metabolic changes. Here, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts undergoing AIS display upregulated cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) expression and enhanced uptake of exogenous cysteine, which lead to increased hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and glutathione (GSH) production, consequently protecting senescent cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death. CBS depletion allows AIS cells to escape senescence and re-enter the cell cycle, indicating the importance of CBS activity in maintaining AIS. Mechanistically, we show this restoration of proliferation is mediated through suppressing mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by reducing mitochondrial localized CBS while retaining antioxidant capacity of transsulfuration pathway. These findings implicate a potential tumor-suppressive role for CBS in cells with aberrant PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Consistent with this concept, in human gastric cancer cells with activated PI3K/AKT signaling, we demonstrate that CBS expression is suppressed due to promoter hypermethylation. CBS loss cooperates with activated PI3K/AKT signaling in promoting anchorage-independent growth of gastric epithelial cells, while CBS restoration suppresses the growth of gastric tumors in vivo. Taken together, we find that CBS is a novel regulator of AIS and a potential tumor suppressor in PI3K/AKT-driven gastric cancers, providing a new exploitable metabolic vulnerability in these cancers.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global cellular response to chemical perturbation of PLK4 activity and abnormal centrosome number</a></h4>

              
                Centrosomes act as the main microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in metazoans. Centrosome number is tightly regulated by limiting centriole duplication to a single round per cell cycle. This control is achieved by multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of the protein kinase PLK4, the most upstream facilitator of centriole duplication. Altered centrosome numbers in mouse and human cells cause p53-dependent growth arrest through poorly defined mechanisms. Recent work has shown that the E3 ligase TRIM37 is required for cell cycle arrest in acentrosomal cells. To gain additional insights into this process, we undertook a series of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify factors important for growth arrest triggered by treatment with centrinone B, a selective PLK4 inhibitor. We found that TRIM37 is a key mediator of growth arrest after partial or full PLK4 inhibition. Interestingly, PLK4 cellular mobility decreased in a dose-dependent manner after centrinone B treatment. In contrast to recent work, we found that growth arrest after PLK4 inhibition correlated better with PLK4 activity than with mitotic length or centrosome number. These data provide insights into the global response to changes in centrosome number and PLK4 activity and extend the role for TRIM37 in regulating the abundance, localization, and function of centrosome proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells using defined extracellular matrix proteins reveals essential role of fibronectin</a></h4>

              
                Research and therapeutic applications using human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) require robust differentiation strategies. Efforts to improve hPSC-CM differentiation have largely overlooked the role of extracellular matrix (ECM). The present study investigates the ability of defined ECM proteins to promote hPSC cardiac differentiation. Fibronectin (FN), laminin-111, and laminin-521 enabled hPSCs to attach and expand. However, only addition of FN promoted cardiac differentiation in response to growth factors Activin A, BMP4, and bFGF in contrast to the inhibition produced by laminin-111 or laminin-521. hPSCs in culture produced endogenous FN which accumulated in the ECM to a critical level necessary for effective cardiac differentiation. Inducible shRNA knockdown of FN prevented Brachyury<sup>+</sup> mesoderm formation and subsequent hPSC-CM generation. Antibodies blocking FN binding integrins α4β1 or αVβ1, but not α5β1, inhibited cardiac differentiation. Furthermore, inhibition of integrin-linked kinase led to a decrease in phosphorylated AKT, which was associated with increased apoptosis and inhibition of cardiac differentiation. These results provide new insights into defined matrices for culture of hPSCs that enable production of FN-enriched ECM which is essential for mesoderm formation and efficient cardiac differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-electron tomography of Birbeck granules reveals the molecular mechanism of langerin lattice formation</a></h4>

              
                Langerhans cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells localized within the epidermis and mucosal epithelium. Upon contact with Langerhans cells, pathogens are captured by the C-type lectin langerin and internalized into a structurally unique vesicle known as a Birbeck granule. Although the immunological role of Langerhans cells and Birbeck granules have been extensively studied, the mechanism by which the characteristic zippered membrane structure of Birbeck granules is formed remains elusive. In this study, we observed isolated Birbeck granules using cryo-electron tomography and reconstructed the 3D structure of the repeating unit of the honeycomb lattice of langerin at 6.4 Å resolution. We found that the interaction between the two langerin trimers was mediated by docking the flexible loop at residues 258-263 into the secondary carbohydrate-binding cleft. Mutations within the loop inhibited Birbeck granule formation and the internalization of HIV pseudovirus. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for membrane zippering during Birbeck granule biogenesis and provide insight into the role of langerin in the defense against viral infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse thermosensory receptors and neurons mediate the neural coding of oral cooling in the mouse trigeminothalamic tract</a></h4>

              
                Different sets of peripheral and medullary trigeminal neurons respond across a cooling gradient applied to intraoral skin. Here we applied electrophysiology to anesthetized mice to study if different types of cool-driven trigeminothalamic neurons convey oral cooling information to the thalamus. We monitored spiking responses to oral stimulation with cold ([&le;]13{degrees}C), cool (21{degrees}C to 28{degrees}C), neutral (35{degrees}C), and warm/hot ([&ge;]40{degrees}C) water in single trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Vc) neurons physiologically tested for projections to the thalamus. We also recorded oral thermal responses from Vc neurons in mice gene deficient for the cooling and menthol receptor TRPM8 to study afferent mechanisms of central oral thermosensory activity. We found that thalamic-projecting Vc neurons that respond to oral cooling comprise heterogeneous cell types. These cell types showed unique temporal response kinetics across cool and cold temperatures, with tuning to select ranges of a cooling gradient. The combined thermal activity of multiple, differently tuned types of trigeminothalamic cooling neurons offered greater contrast between cold, cool, and warm temperatures in multivariate analysis than the responses of the individual neural types alone, agreeing with a neural population code for cooling information. Compared to control, TRPM8 deficient mice demonstrated a loss of Vc neurons tuned to mild oral cooling, but maintained Vc cells responsive to intense cold. Notably, distinctions between Vc population responses to mild cool and warm temperatures were impaired in TRPM8 deficient mice, suggesting a role for TRPM8 in oral warmth recognition. Diverse receptors and neurons mediate oral cooling signals carried by the trigeminothalamic pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis promotes cell survival in human stem cell derived retinal ganglion cells of the central nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction has been the primary suspect for central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as glaucoma, Parkinsons disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is still unclear the fundamental mitochondrial quality control (MQC) step that could be improved for developing CNS neuroprotection. Here, we used human stem cell differentiated retinal ganglion cells (hRGCs) of CNS which are the neurons most sensitive towards mitochondrial dysfunction, to identify mechanism of improving MQC. We found hRGCs are highly efficient in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, a critical step of MQC to compensate for the loss of damaged mitochondria. Pharmacological activation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK resulted in increased mitochondrial biogenesis and energy homeostasis as revealed by biochemical, imaging, metabolic and ultrastructure analysis. This led to enhanced cell survival for both the wild-type and glaucomatous (OPTN-E50K) hRGCs providing a foundation for developing neuroprotection for broad range of optic neuropathies and CNS disorders irrespective of genetic mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological properties of neurons in the intermediate thoracolumbar spinal cord mediating proprioception.</a></h4>

              
                Animals must know where their body is in relationship to their environment to move appropriately. Proprioception, the sense of limb and body position, is required to produce feedforward predictions of future movement as well as provide feedback information during movement to update the system. How proprioception is processed at the level of the spinal cord is not well understood. Most work has focused on Clarkes column (CC) neurons, a component of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT). CC neurons receive hindlimb proprioceptive information and send it directly to the cerebellum with no axon collaterals to other neurons in the spinal cord. In contrast to CC neurons, we previously found that a subset of thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons also receives proprioceptive afferent inputs, but project locally within the spinal cord including synapsing on motor neurons. We set out to understand how CC and Atoh1-lineage neurons in the thoracolumbar spinal cord respond to electrical activity. Using in vitro acute spinal cord slices and whole-cell patch clamp, we characterized the passive and active electrical properties of CC and thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons. We find that most CC neurons increase their action potential firing frequency linearly upon increased current injection up to high frequencies likely due to a hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih). In contrast, most Atoh1-lineage neurons do not have an Ih current and therefore, their firing frequency fades with increasing current injection. Interestingly, although Atoh1-lineage neurons are classically subdivided into a contralaterally-projecting Medial and ipsilaterally-projecting Lateral population, we find no obvious electrophysiological signatures that could distinguish these spatially distinct populations. Finally, we set out to determine the organization of the inputs to CC and Atoh1-lineage neurons. In a hemisected spinal cord preparation, while recording from neurons in the lower thoracic to upper lumbar segments, we find that CC neurons receive low threshold inputs (proprioceptive or low threshold mechanoreceptor) from lumbar 2 to 4 dorsal roots, while Atoh1-lineage Medial neurons do not. This raises the possibility that Atoh1-lineage Medial neurons receive proprioceptive inputs from more local dorsal roots. Altogether, we find that CC and Atoh1-lineage neurons have distinct membrane properties and sensory input organization even though they are both reported to receive proprioceptive information and are in close proximity in lamina V-VII of the thoracolumbar spinal cord.

	<p>Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is an intractable neuropathic pain that can occur following central nervous system injuries. Spino-thalamo-cortical pathway damage contributes to CPSP development. However, brain regions involved in CPSP are unknown and previous studies were limited to supratentorial strokes with cortical lesion involvement. We analyzed the brain metabolism changes associated with CPSP following pontine hemorrhage. Thirty-two patients with isolated pontine hemorrhage were examined; 14 had CPSP, while 18 did not. Brain glucose metabolism was evaluated using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography images. Additionally, regions revealing metabolic correlation with CPSP severity were analyzed. Patients with CPSP showed changes in the brain metabolism in the cerebral cortices and cerebellum. Compared with the control group, the CPSP group showed significant hypometabolism in the contralesional rostral anterior cingulum and ipsilesional primary motor cortex (Puncorrected &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). However, increased brain metabolism was observed in the ipsilesional cerebellum (VI) and contralesional cerebellum (lobule VIIB) (Puncorrected &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, increased pain intensity correlated with decreased metabolism in the ipsilesional supplementary motor area and contralesional angular gyrus. This study emphasizes the role of the many different areas of the cortex that are involved in affective and cognitive processing in the development of CPSP.</p>

	<p>In recent years, the potential of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for the therapeutic effect of post-stroke spasticity has been explored. There are various NIBS methods depending on the stimulation modality, site and parameters. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of NIBS on spasticity in patients after stroke. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PUBMED (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) were searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before December 2021. Two independent researchers screened relevant articles and extracted data. This meta-analysis included 14 articles, and all included articles included 18 RCT datasets. The results showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.40, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;0.56 to &amp;amp;minus;0.25, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) had a significant effect on improving spasticity, in which low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.51, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;0.78 to &amp;amp;minus;0.24, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.58, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;0.80 to &amp;amp;minus;0.36, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) were beneficial on Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in patients with post-stroke spasticity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.65, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;1.07 to &amp;amp;minus;0.22, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) also had a significant impact on post-stroke rehabilitation, with anodal stimulation (MD = &amp;amp;minus;0.74, [95% CI]: &amp;amp;minus;1.35 to &amp;amp;minus;0.13, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) being more effective in improving spasticity in patients. This meta-analysis revealed moderate evidence that NIBS reduces spasticity after stroke and may promote recovery in stroke survivors. Future studies investigating the mechanisms of NIBS in addressing spasticity are warranted to further support the clinical application of NIBS in post-stroke spasticity.</p>

                Chen et al. find that BET inactivation, by suppressing antiviral responses, enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. This effect is phenocopied by the viral envelope (E) protein that is acetylated in cells and has evolved to antagonize the induction of the interferon response by binding and inhibiting BET proteins through their bromodomains.

                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto-immune inflammatory disorder affecting the central nervous system. The cause of the disease is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the pathogenesis. We derived cerebral organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of healthy control subjects as well as from primary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients to better understand the pathologic basis of the varied clinical phenotypic expressions of MS. In MS organoids, most notably in PPMS, we observed a decrease of proliferation marker Ki67 and a reduction of the SOX2+ stem cell pool associated with an increased expression of neuronal markers CTIP2 and TBR1. This dysregulation of the stem cell pool is associated with a decreased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Our findings show that the genetic background of a patient can directly alter stem cell function. This study also provides new insights on the innate cellular dysregulation in MS and identifies p21 pathway as a new potential target for therapeutic strategies in MS.

                The impact of overnutrition early in life is not restricted to the onset of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but also affects critical brain functions related to cognition. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between peripheral metabolic and bioenergetic changes induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and their impact on hippocampal cognitive functions in juvenile mice. To this purpose, three-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received a HFD or control diet for seven weeks, associated with two low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) or vehicle, to accelerate the metabolic dysfunction. HFD induced metabolic changes in mice, particularly related to glucose metabolism, in spite of the absence of obesity and changes in lipid profile. HFD exposure starting from weaning impaired recognition and spatial memories in mice, without inducing a depressive-like behavior. Increased immunoreactivity for GFAP and a trend towards a decrease in NeuN staining were verified in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice. HFD caused a bioenergetic impairment in the hippocampus, characterized by a decrease in both O2 consumption related to ATP production and in the maximum respiratory capacity. The thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue was impaired by HFD, here verified through the absence of a decrease in O2 consumption after UCP-1 inhibition and increase in the reserve respiratory capacity. Impaired mitochondria function was also observed in the liver of HFD mice, while no changes were verified in O2 consumption in the heart of juvenile mice. These results indicate that the introduction of a HFD early in life has a detrimental impact on bioenergetic and mitochondrial function of tissues with metabolic and thermogenic activities, which is likely related to hippocampal metabolic changes and cognitive impairment.

                The brain can be characterized by an intrinsic hierarchy in its topography which, as recently shown for the uni-transmodal distinction of core and periphery, converges with its dynamics. Does such intrinsic hierarchical organization in both topography and dynamic also apply to the brain's inner core itself and its higher-order cognitive functions like self? Applying multiple fMRI data sets, we show how the recently established three-layer topography of self (internal, external, mental) is already present during the resting state and carried over to task states including both task-specific and -unspecific effects. Moreover, the topographic hierarchy converges with corresponding dynamic changes (measured by power-law exponent, autocorrelation window, median frequency, sample entropy, complexity) during both rest and task states. Finally, analogous to the topographic hierarchy, we also demonstrate hierarchy among the different dynamic measures themselves according to background and foreground. Finally, we show task-specific- and un-specific effects in the hierarchies of both dynamics and topography. Together, we demonstrate the existence of an intrinsic topographic hierarchy of self and its convergence with dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An action-observation network in the common marmoset identified by ultra-high field fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Thirty years have passed since the first description of neurons in Old World macaque monkeys that fire both during the execution and observation of goal-directed actions. Since then, these so-called mirror neurons have been shown to play important roles in understanding the actions of others, learning by imitation, and social cognition in macaques and humans. In contrast to Old World primates, an action-observation network has not yet been identified in New World primates. Here we used ultra-high field fMRI at 9.4T in awake common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) while they watched videos depicting the upper-limb of marmosets performing goal-directed (grasping food) or non-goal-directed actions. We found that the observation of goal-directed actions, compared to non-goal directed ones, activated a frontotemporoparietal network, including areas 6 and 45 in premotor and prefrontal cortices, and areas PGa-IPa, FST, and the TE complex in temporoparietal regions. These results demonstrate the existence of an evolutionarily conserved action observation network in primates that likely predates the separation of Old and New World monkeys.

                Identifying genetic variants associated with nicotine-motivated behavioral traits is an important strategy to understand the fundamental mechanisms underpinning smoking and tobacco abuse. For suitable emulation of behavioral phenotype with the full advantage of this invertebrate model, we newly established a worm model of nicotine seeking by Conditioned Cue Preference (CCP). We demonstrated that C. elegans also exhibited pivotal features of nicotine-motivated behaviors as in mammals. First, we identified the nicotine-elicited cue preference is mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in worms. Additionally, we exhibited dopamine is also required for the development of CCP. Subsequently, we identified the nAChRs subunits associated with the facilitation of nicotine preference. Accordingly, we validated human GWAS candidates associated with nicotine dependence involved in the role of those nAChR subunits. we addressed the cross-species functional validation to determine the GWAS candidate genes have authentic roles in nicotine seeking associated with tobacco abuse. The loss of function strain of CACNA2D3 orthologue, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 3, was tested for CCP. We also tested the knock-out (KO) strain of the CACNA2D2 orthologue, calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 2, which is closely related to CACNA2D3 in the same family and shared the human smoking phenotypes. Our orthogonal test suggests the functional conservation of the 2{delta} subunit of calcium channel in nicotine motivated behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Replicable multivariate BWAS with moderate sample sizes</a></h4>

              
                Brain-Wide Association Studies (BWAS) have become a dominant method for linking mind and brain over the past 30 years. Univariate models test tens to hundreds of thousands of brain voxels individually, whereas multivariate models ('multivariate BWAS') integrate signals across brain regions into a predictive model. Numerous problems have been raised with univariate BWAS, including lack of power and reliability and an inability to account for pattern-level information embedded in distributed neural circuits. Multivariate predictive models address many of these concerns, and offer substantial promise for delivering brain-based measures of behavioral and clinical states and traits. In their recent paper, Marek et al. evaluated the effects of sample size on univariate and multivariate BWAS in three large-scale neuroimaging dataset and came to the general conclusion that "BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals". We applaud their comprehensive analysis, and we agree that (a) large samples are needed when conducting univariate BWAS of individual differences in trait measures, and (b) multivariate BWAS reveal substantially larger effects and are therefore more highly powered. However, we disagree with Marek et al.'s claims that multivariate BWAS provide "inflated in-sample associations" that often fail to replicate (i.e., are underpowered), and that multivariate BWAS consequently require thousands of participants when predicting trait-level individual differences. Here we substantiate that (i) with appropriate methodology, the reported in-sample effect size inflation in multivariate BWAS can be entirely eliminated, and (ii) in most cases, multivariate BWAS effects are replicable with substantially smaller sample sizes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Graph Representation Learning Algorithms and Deep Neural Network, Based on fMRI Signals</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we are going to apply graph representation learning algorithms to identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients within a large brain imaging dataset. Since ASD is characterized by social deficits and repetitive behavioral symptoms, it is mainly identified by brain functional connectivity patterns. Attempts to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from ASD are the essence of ASD classification. We claim that considering the connectivity patterns of the brain can be appropriately executed by graph representation learning methods. These methods can capture the whole structure of the brain, both local and global properties. The investigation is done for the brain imaging worldwide multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange). The classifier adapted to the features embedded in graphs is a LeNet deep neural network. Among different graph representation techniques, we used AWE, Node2vec, Struct2vec, multi node2vec, and Graph2Img. The best approach was Graph2Img, in which after extracting the feature vectors representative of the brain nodes, the PCA algorithm is applied to the matrix of feature vectors. Although we could not outperform the previous 70% accuracy of 10-fold cross-validation in the identification of ASD versus control patients in the dataset, for leave-one-site-out cross-validation, we could obtain better results (our accuracy: 80%). It is evident that the effect of graph embedding methods is making the connectivity matrix more suitable for applying to a deep network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural circuits underlying habituation of visually evoked escape behaviors in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Larval zebrafish that are exposed repeatedly to dark looming stimuli will quickly habituate to these aversive signals and cease to respond with their stereotypical escape swims. A dark looming stimulus can be separated into two independent components: one that is characterized by an overall spatial expansion, where overall luminance is maintained at the same level, and a second, that represents an overall dimming within the whole visual field in the absence of any motion energy. Using specific stimulation patterns that isolate these independent components, we first extracted the behavioral algorithms that dictate how these separate information channels interact with each other and across the two eyes during the habituation process. Concurrent brain wide imaging experiments then permitted the construction of circuit models that suggest the existence of three separate neural pathways. The first is a looming channel which responds specifically to concentrically expanding edges and relays that information to the brain stem escape network to generate directed escapes. The second is a dimming specific channel that serves to support and amplify the looming pathway. While the looming channel operates in a purely monocular fashion where stimuli are relayed exclusively to the contralateral hemisphere, dimming responses are processed in both monocular and binocular pathways. Finally, we identify a third, separate and largely monocular, dimming channel that appears to specifically inhibit escape responses when activated. We propose that, unlike the first two channels, this third channel is under strong contextual modulation and that it is primarily responsible for the incremental silencing of successive dark looming evoked escapes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The polycomb repressor complex 2 and Enhancer of Zeste 2 regulate glial reactivity and are required for the formation of Muller glia-derived progenitor cells in the retina</a></h4>

              
                EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste 2), a key component of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), is required for the differentiation of Muller glia (MG) during retinal development. However, nothing is known about the roles of EZH2 and PRC2 in mature or damaged retinas. Herein, we investigate the expression of PRC2-related factors and roles during the formation of Muller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the chick and mouse retinas. In chick, EZH2, PRC2-related factors, and EZH2-activators, JARID2 and AEBP1, are dynamically expressed by MG and MGPCs in damaged retinas. Inhibition of EZH2, EED or JARID2 blocks the formation of MGPCs. Similarly, inhibition of EZH2 suppresses the proliferation of progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone. By using a combination of single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq, we find significant changes in gene expression and chromatin access in MG with EZH2 inhibition and NMDA-treatment, and many of these genes are associated with glial and neuronal differentiation. Correlation across gene expression, chromatin access and transcription factor motif access in MG was observed for transcription factors known to covey glial identity and promote retinal development. In the mouse retina, components of the PRC2 complex are downregulated in MG in damaged retinas and inhibition of EZH2 has no effect upon the formation of neuron-like cells from Ascl1-overexpressing MG. We conclude that in the chick, but not mouse, the activity of EZH2 is required for the reprogramming of MG into MGPCs by regulating chromatin access to transcription factors associated with glial differentiation and retinal development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explicitly Nonlinear Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity In Resting-State fMRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Most dynamic functional connectivity in fMRI data is focused on linear correlations, and to our knowledge, no study has studied whole brain explicitly nonlinear dynamic relationships within the data. While some approaches have attempted to study overall connectivity more generally using flexible models, we are particularly interested in whether the non-linear relationships, above and beyond linear, are capturing unique information. This study thus proposes an approach to assess the explicitly nonlinear dynamic functional network 2 connectivity derived from the relationship among independent component analysis time courses. Linear relationships were removed at each time point to evaluate, typically ignored, explicitly nonlinear dFNC using normalized mutual information. Simulations showed the proposed method accurately estimated NMI over time, even within relatively short windows of data. Results on fMRI data included 151 schizophrenia patients, and 163 healthy controls showed three unique, highly structured, mostly long-range, functional states that also showed significant group differences. This analysis identifies a higher level of explicitly nonlinear dependencies in transient connectivity within the visual network in healthy controls compared to schizophrenia patients. In particular, nonlinear relationships tend to be more widespread than linear ones. We also find highly significant differences in the relative co-occurrence of linear and explicitly nonlinear states in HC and SZ, suggesting these may be an important aspect of the disorder. Overall, this work suggests that quantifying nonlinear dependencies of dynamic functional connectivity may provide a complementary and potentially valuable tool for studying brain function by exposing relevant variation that is typically ignored.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">To share or not to share? iEEG evidence for state-dependent inequity encoding in the human OFC</a></h4>

              
                Social decision-making requires the integration of reward valuation and social cognition systems, both dependent on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). How these two OFC functions interact is largely unknown. We recorded intracranial activity from the OFC of ten patients making choices in the context of different types of inequity (disadvantageous vs. advantageous). We found that high-frequency activity (70-150 HZ) encoded the amount of self-reward, consistent with previous reports. We also observed novel evidence for encoding in human OFC of the social counterpart's reward as well as the type of inequity being experienced. Additionally, we find social context modulates reward encoding: depending on inequity type, reward encoding was switched on and off rapidly within electrodes, across trials. These results provide direct evidence for explicit encoding of self- and other- rewards in the human OFC, and for rapid and reversible changes in encoding schemes driven by socially relevant contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The tau oligomer antibody APNmAb005 detects early-stage pathological tau enriched at synapses and rescues neuronal loss in long-term treatments</a></h4>

              
                Numerous tau immunotherapies are being developed against Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it has been challenging to specifically target early-stage tau aggregates using conformation-dependent antibodies. Here, we report a monoclonal antibody, APNmAb005, that recognized a conformational epitope associated with tau oligomers. In AD brain extracts, mAb005 preferentially recognized oligomeric tau in the synapse over monomeric tau in the cytosol. In the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, mAb005 immunoreactivity was strongly present in early-stage AD but surprisingly diminished in late-stage AD (Braak stage VI). mAb005 also recognized aggregates in 3R tauopathies (Pick's disease) and 4R tauopathies (corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy), including those in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In rTg4510 mice (P301L tau), mAb005 immunoreactivity first appeared in distal neurites but much later in neuronal somas. Thus, the mAb005 epitope appears to be associated with early-stage oligomers of tau (esoTau) that accumulate around synapses in AD, which is also detectable in both 3R and 4R tauopathies. In cellular uptake models of tauopathy transmission, mAb005 blocked the formation of intracellular inclusions induced by incubation with rTg4510 mouse brain extracts. Long-term treatments with mAb005 in rTg4510 mice partially rescued synaptic and neuronal loss in the hippocampus without promoting overall tau clearance. Our data suggest that immunotherapies targeting esoTau enriched around synaptic sites may alleviate tau toxicity against synapses and neurons, which may be a promising treatment strategy against AD.

                Sensory cortex amplifies relevant features of external stimuli. This sensitivity and selectivity arise through the transformation of inputs by cortical circuitry. We characterize the circuit mechanisms and dynamics of cortical amplification by making large-scale simultaneous measurements of single cells in awake primates and by testing computational models. By comparing network activity in both driven and spontaneous states with models, we identify the circuit as operating in a regime of balanced amplification. Incoming inputs are strongly but transiently amplified by recurrent excitation. Inhibition acts to counterbalance this excitation by rapidly quenching responses, thereby permitting tracking of time-varying stimuli.

                k-core percolation on the scale-free static brain connectivity revealed hierarchical structure of inter-voxel correlations, which was successfully visualized by hyperbolic disc embedding on resting-state fMRI. In static study, flagplots and brain rendered kmax-core display showed the changes of hierarchical structures of voxels belonging to functional independent components (IC). In this dynamic sliding-window study, temporal progress of hierarchical structure of voxels were investigated in individuals and in sessions of an individual. kmax-core and coreness k values characterizing time-varying core voxels were visualized on animated stacked-histogram/flagplots and animated brain-rendered images. Resting-state fMRI of Human Connectome Project and of Kirby weekly revealed the slow progress and multiple abrupt state transitions of the voxels of coreness k and at the uppermost hierarchy, representing their correlative time-varying mental states in individuals and in sessions. We suggest this characteristic core voxels-IC compositions on dynamic study fingerprint the time-varying resting states of human minds.

                The cerebrovasculature plays an essential role in neurovascular and homeostatic functions in health and disease conditions. Many efforts have been made for developing vascular thrombosis methods to study vascular dysfunction in vivo, while technical challenges remain, such as accuracy and depth-selectivity to target single vessel in the cerebral cortex. Herein, we first demonstrates the evaluation and quantification of the feasibility and effects of Rose Bengal (RB)-induced photothrombosis with 720-1070 nm ultrafast lasers in raster scan. A flexible and reproducible approach is then proposed to employ a 1070 nm ultrafast laser with spiral scan for producing RB-induced occlusion, which is described as precision ultrafast laser-induced photothrombosis (PLP). Combine with two-photon microscopy imaging, this PLP displays highly precise and fast occlusion induction of various vessel types, sizes, and depths, which enhances the precision and power of the photothrombosis protocol. Overall, the PLP method provides a real-time, practical, precise, and depth-selected single-vessel photothrombosis technology in cerebral cortex with commercially available optical equipment, which is crucial for exploring brain vascular function with high spatial temporal resolution in brain.

                Studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) have identified the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to be an important early hub for a "parental instinct" in the brain. This complements the finding from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies linking reward, emotion regulation, empathy and mentalisation networks to the "parental brain". Here, we used MEG in 43 first-time mothers listening to infant and adult cry vocalisations to investigate the link with mother-infant postpartum bonding scores and their level of sleep deprivation (assessed using both actigraphy and sleep logs). We found significant differences 800-1000ms after onset of infant compared to adult cries in source-reconstructed brain activity in areas previously linked to the parental brain. Importantly, mothers with weaker bonding scores showed decreased brain responses to infant cries in the auditory cortex, middle and superior temporal gyrus, OFC, hippocampal areas, supramarginal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus at around 100-200ms after stimulus onset. In contrast, we did not find correlations with sleep deprivation scores. The significant changes in brain processing of infant distress signals could be a novel marker of weaker infant bonding in new mothers and should be investigated in vulnerable populations.

                The brain interprets sensory inputs to guide behavior, but behavior disrupts sensory inputs. In primates, saccadic eye movements displace visual images on the retina and yet the brain perceives visual stability, a process called active vision. We studied whether active vision is Bayesian. Humans and monkeys reported whether an image moved during saccades. We tested whether they used prior expectations to account for sensory uncertainty in a Bayesian manner. For continuous judgments, subjects were Bayesian. For categorical judgments, they were anti-Bayesian for uncertainty due to external, image noise but Bayesian for uncertainty due to internal, motor-driven noise. A discriminative learning model explained the anti-Bayesian effect. Therefore, active vision uses both Bayesian and discriminative models depending on task requirements (continuous vs. categorical) and the source of uncertainty (image noise vs. motor-driven noise), suggesting that active perceptual mechanisms are governed by the interaction of both models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scene-selective brain regions respond to embedded objects of a scene</a></h4>

              
                Objects are fundamental to scene understanding. Scenes are defined by embedded objects and how we interact with them. Paradoxically, scene processing in the brain is typically discussed in contrast to object processing. Using the BOLD5000 dataset (Chang et al., 2019), we examined whether objects within a scene predicted the neural representation of scenes, as measured by fMRI in humans. Stimuli included 1,179 unique scenes across 18 semantic categories. Object composition of scenes were compared across scene exemplars in different semantic categories, and separately, in exemplars of the same category. Neural representations in scene- and object- preferring brain regions were significantly related to which objects were in a scene, with the effect at times stronger in the scene-preferring regions. The object model accounted for more variance when comparing scenes within the same semantic category to scenes from different categories. Thus, the functional role of scene-preferring regions should include the processing of objects. This suggests visual processing regions may be better characterized with respect to which processes are engaged when interacting with the stimulus category, such as processing groups of objects in scenes, or processing a single object in our foreground, rather than the stimulus category itself.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scene-relative object motion biases depth percepts</a></h4>

              
                An important function of the visual system is to represent 3D scene structure from a sequence of 2D images projected onto the retinae. During observer translation, the relative image motion of stationary objects at different distances (motion parallax) provides potent depth information. However, if an object moves relative to the scene, this complicates the computation of depth from motion parallax since there will be an additional component of image motion related to scene-relative object motion. To correctly compute depth from motion parallax, only the component of image motion caused by self-motion should be used by the brain. Previous experimental and theoretical work on perception of depth from motion parallax has assumed that objects are stationary in the world. Thus, it is unknown whether perceived depth based on motion parallax is biased by object motion relative to the scene. Naive human subjects viewed a virtual 3D scene consisting of a ground plane and stationary background objects, while lateral self-motion was simulated by optic flow. A target object could be either stationary or moving laterally at different velocities, and subjects were asked to judge the depth of the object relative to the plane of fixation. Subjects showed a far bias when object and observer moved in the same direction, and a near bias when object and observer moved in opposite directions. This pattern of biases is expected if subjects confound image motion due to self-motion with that due to scene-relative object motion. These biases were large when the object was viewed monocularly, and were greatly reduced, but not eliminated, when binocular disparity cues were provided. Our findings establish that scene-relative object motion can confound perceptual judgements of depth during self-motion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MrgprA3-expressing pruriceptors drive pruritogen-induced alloknesis through mechanosensitive Piezo2 channel</a></h4>

              
                Although touch and itch are coded by distinct neuronal populations, light touch also provokes itch in the presence of exogenous pruritogens, resulting in a phenomenon called alloknesis. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of pruritogen-induced mechanical itch sensitization are poorly understood. Here we show that intradermal injections of histamine or chloroquine (CQ) provoke alloknesis through activation of TRPV1- and MrgprA3-expressing prurioceptors, and functional ablation of these neurons reverses pruritogen-induced alloknesis. Moreover, genetic ablation of mechanosensitive Piezo2 channel function from MrgprA3-expressing prurioceptors also dampens pruritogen-induced alloknesis. Mechanistically, histamine and CQ sensitize Piezo2 channel function through activation of the PLC-PKC{delta} signaling. Collectively, our data uncovered a TRPV1+/MrgprA3+ prurioceptor-Piezo2 signaling axis in the initiation of pruritogen-induced mechanical itch sensitization in the skin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Radiochemical Synthesis and Evaluation of 3-methyl-4-aminopyridine in Rodents and Non-Human Primates for Imaging Potassium Channels in the CNS</a></h4>

              
                Demyelination, the loss of the insulating sheath of neurons, causes failed or slowed neuronal conduction and contributes to the neurological symptoms in multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, stroke, and dementia. In demyelinated neurons, the axonal potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, normally under the myelin sheath, become exposed and upregulated. Imaging these channels using positron emission tomography can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis and monitoring. Here, we describe the novel tracer for Kv1 channels [11C]3-methyl-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3Me4AP). [11C]3Me4AP was efficiently synthesized via Pd(0)-Cu(I) co-mediated Stille cross-coupling of a stannyl precursor containing a free amino group. Evaluation of its imaging properties in rats and nonhuman primates showed that [11C]3Me4AP has moderate brain permeability and slow kinetics. Additional evaluation in monkeys showed that the tracer is metabolically stable and that regional brain time-activity curves can be accurately modeled by a 1-tissue compartment model. Compared to the related tracers [18F]3-fluoro-4-aminopyridine ([18F]3F4AP) and [11C]3-methoxy-4-aminopyridine ([11C]3MeO4AP), [11C]3Me4AP shows lower initial brain uptake indicating reduced permeability to the blood-brain-barrier and slower kinetics suggesting higher binding affinity consistent with in vitro studies. While the slow kinetics and strong binding affinity are favorable attributes for its potential use as a therapeutic drug, our results suggest that [11C]3Me4AP is not as promising as its predecessors for PET imaging of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute inhibition of the STA3 signaling pathway during epileptogenesis prevent GABAergic cells loss and imprinting of epileptic state: an in-vitro proof</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy, the condition of recurrent unprovoked seizures resulting from a wide variety of causes, is one of the worlds most prominent brain syndrome. Seizures which are an expression of neuronal network dysfunction occur in a positive feedback loop of concomitant factors where seizures generate more seizures, including also neuro-inflammatory responses. Among other pathways involved in inflammatory responses, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway has been proposed to prevent epilepsy. In this work we tested on a model of temporal lobe epilepsy in-vitro, the hypothesis that acute inhibition of STAT3-phosphorylation - during epileptogenesis, can prevent structural damages in the hippocampal circuits, and the imprinting both of neural epileptic activity and inflammatory glial states. We performed calcium imaging of spontaneous circuits dynamics in organotypic hippocampal slices previously exposed to hyper-excitable conditions through the blockage of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Epileptogenic conditions lead to imprinted epileptic dynamics in the circuits in terms of higher frequency of neuronal firing and circuits synchronizations, higher correlated activity in neuronal pairs and decreased complexity in synchronization patterns. Acute inhibition of the STAT3-phosphorylation during epileptogenesis, prevented the imprinting of epileptic activity patterns, general cell loss, GABAergic cells loss and the persistence of inflammatory reactive glial states. This work provides further evidence that inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway under epileptogenesis can prevent patho-topological reorganization of neuro-glial circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Thermal Pain and Detection Threshold Modulation in Augmented Reality</a></h4>

              
                Augmented Reality (AR) overlays computer-generated visual, auditory or other sensory information on the real world. Due to recent advancements in AR it can be difficult for the user to differentiate between sensory information coming from real and virtual objects, leading to interesting phenomena. For example, an AR experience in which users can experience their own hands in flames has been shown to elicit heat illusions on the affected hands. In this study, we investigate the potential that AR has for top-down modulation of pain and thermal perception. We assessed thermal pain and detection thresholds on the participant's right hand when they experienced that hand covered in virtual flames in AR. We compared that experience to a baseline condition with no additional stimuli as well to a control condition that sees the hand covered by unrealistic blue flames to compensate the distraction factor. We found that experiencing a burning hand in AR induced analgesic and hyperalgesic effects as participants began to feel heat related pain on lower temperatures and cold related pain on higher temperatures. That experience also significantly changed the lowest temperature at which participants started perceiving warmth. These results demonstrate that pain and thermal perception can be manipulated by altering the perception of our body in AR.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is essential for hearing by regulating cholesterol distribution in hair bundles</a></h4>

              
                Unbiased genetic screens implicated a number of uncharacterized genes in hearing loss, suggesting some biological processes required for auditory function remain unexplored. Loss of Kiaa1024L/Minar2, a previously understudied gene, caused deafness in mice, but how it functioned in hearing was unclear. Here we show that disruption of kiaa1024L/minar2 causes hearing loss in the zebrafish. Defects in mechanotransduction, longer and thinner hair bundles, and enlarged apical lysosomes in hair cells are observed in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. In cultured cells, Kiaa1024L/Minar2 is mainly localized to lysosomes and its overexpression recruits cholesterol and increases cholesterol labeling. Strikingly, an accessible pool of cholesterol is highly enriched in the hair bundle membrane, and loss of kiaa1024L/minar2 reduces cholesterol localization to the hair bundles. Decreasing cholesterol levels aggravates, while increasing cholesterol levels rescues hair cell defects in kiaa1024L/minar2 mutant. Therefore cholesterol plays an essential role in the hair bundles, and Kiaa1024L/Minar2 regulates cholesterol distribution and homeostasis to ensure normal hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automatically annotated motion tracking identifies a distinct social behavioral profile following chronic social defeat stress</a></h4>

              
                Severe stress exposure is a global problem with long-lasting negative behavioral and physiological consequences, which increases the risk of stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD). An essential characteristic of MDD is the impairment of social functioning and lack of social motivation. Chronic social defeat stress is an established animal model for MDD research, which induces a cascade of physiological and social behavioral changes. The current developments of markerless pose estimation tools allow for more complex and socially relevant behavioral tests, but the application of these tools to social behavior remains to be explored. Here, we introduce the open-source tool DeepOF to investigate the individual and social behavioral profile in mice by providing supervised and unsupervised pipelines using DeepLabCut-annotated pose estimation data. The supervised pipeline relies on pre-trained classifiers to detect defined traits for both single and dyadic animal behaviors. Subsequently, the unsupervised pipeline explores the behavioral repertoire of the animals without label priming, which has the potential of pointing towards previously unrecognized motion motifs that are systematically different across conditions. We here provide evidence that the DeepOF supervised and unsupervised pipelines detect a distinct stress-induced social behavioral pattern, which was particularly observed at the beginning of a novel social encounter. The stress-induced social behavior shows a state of arousal that fades with time due to habituation. In addition, while the classical social avoidance task does identify the stress-induced social behavioral differences, both DeepOF behavioral pipelines provide a clearer and more detailed profile. DeepOF aims to facilitate reproducibility and unification of behavioral classification of social behavior by providing an open-source tool, which can significantly advance the study of rodent individual and social behavior, thereby enabling novel biological insights and subsequent drug development for psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Binge alcohol drinking alters the differential control of cholinergic interneurons over nucleus accumbens D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ventral striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) play a central role in basal ganglia function by regulating associative learning and reward processing. In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ChIs regulate glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission. However, it is unclear how ChIs orchestrate the control of these neurotransmitters to determine the excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. Additionally, the effects of binge alcohol drinking on ChIs-mediated modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in NAc MSNs are also undefined. Methods: We optogenetically stimulated ChIs while recording evoked and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in D1- and D2-MSN of ChAT.ChR2.eYFPxDrd1.tdtomato mice. To determine the effect of ChIs on mouse behavior and alcohol consumption, we implanted ChAT.ChR2.eYFP mice with fiber optic cannulas and stimulated ChIs while mice were allowed to drink 20% alcohol using the binge alcohol drinking-in-the-dark (DID) paradigm. Results: We demonstrated that NAc ChIs decrease the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in both D1- and D2-MSNs. While inhibition of D1-MSNs glutamate release by ChIs depends on dopamine release, that of D2-MSNs results from a direct interactions between ChIs and glutamatergic terminals. Interestingly, after two weeks of binge alcohol drinking, the effect of ChIs stimulation on glutamate release was reversed in D1-MSNs, while its effect on D2-MSNs remained unchanged. Finally, in vivo optogenetic stimulation of NAc ChIs significantly increased alcohol consumption. Conclusions: These results identify ChIs as a key target for the regulation of NAc circuitry and as a potential treatment of alcohol addiction.

                The encoding of acoustic signals in the cochlea depends on -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs), but relatively little is known about their reliance on specific pore-forming subunits. With 5-week-old male GluA3KO mice, we determined cochlear function, synapse ultrastructure, and AMPAR subunit molecular anatomy at ribbon synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). GluA3KO and wild-type (GluA3WT) mice reared in ambient sound pressure level (SPL) of 55-75 dB had similar ABR thresholds, wave-1 amplitudes, and latencies. Ultrastructurally, the IHC modiolar-pillar differences in presynaptic ribbon size and shape, and synaptic vesicle size seen in GluA3WT were diminished or reversed in GluA3KO. The quantity of paired synapses (presynaptic ribbons juxtaposed with postsynaptic GluA2 and GluA4) was similar, however, GluA2-lacking synapses (ribbons paired with GluA4 but not GluA2) were observed only in GluA3KO. SGNs of GluA3KO mice had AMPAR arrays of smaller overall volume, containing less GluA2 and greater GluA4 immunofluorescence intensity relative to GluA3WT (3-fold difference in mean GluA4:GluA2 ratio). The expected modiolar-pillar gradient in ribbon volume was observed in IHCs of GluA3WT but not GluA3KO. Unexpected modiolar-pillar gradients in GluA2 and GluA4 volume were present in GluA3KO. GluA3 is essential to the morphology and molecular composition of IHC-ribbon synapses. We propose the hearing loss seen in older male GluA3KO mice results from progressive synaptopathy evident in 5-week-old mice as increased abundance of GluA2-lacking, GluA4 monomeric, Ca2+- permeable AMPARs.

                Representation of the context in which events occur is essential for episodic memory. Yet context is also important for other cognitive processes including, for example, making decisions, sequencing behavior, and associative learning. The rodent postrhinal cortex and its primate homolog, the parahippocampal cortex, are thought to preferentially process visuospatial information in order to represent the spatial features of contexts and scenes. An open question, however, is whether the postrhinal cortex is also involved in representing non-spatial contexts. Here, we used electrophysiology in behaving rats to show that postrhinal contextual representations extend to the non-spatial domain. Based on the pattern of results, we suggest that postrhinal representations of context, whether spatial or nonspatial, behave like occasion setters by modulating the meaning of other items in the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pop-in: the inversion of pop-out for a feature dimension during visual search in area V4 of the monkey cortex</a></h4>

              
                During visual search, it is important to reduce the interference of distracting objects in the scene. The neuronal responses elicited by the search target stimulus are typically enhanced. However, it is equally important to suppress the representations of distracting stimuli, especially if they are salient and capture attention. We trained monkeys to make an eye movement to a unique 'pop-out' shape stimulus among an array of distracting stimuli. One of these distractors had a salient color that varied across trials and differed from the color of the other stimuli, causing it to also pop-out. The monkeys were able to select the pop-out shape target with high accuracy and actively avoided the pop-out color distractor. This behavioral pattern was reflected in the activity of neurons in area V4. Responses to the shape targets were enhanced, while the activity evoked by the pop-out color distractor was only briefly enhanced, directly followed by a sustained period of pronounced suppression. These behavioral and neuronal results demonstrate a cortical selection mechanism that rapidly inverts a pop-out signal to 'pop-in' for an entire feature dimension thereby facilitating goal-directed visual search in the presence of salient distractors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Penetratin inhibits α-synuclein fibrillation and improves locomotor functions in mice model of Parkinsons disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The presence of lewy bodies, primarily consisting of -synuclein (-syn) aggregates is one of the common features seen in the substantia nigra region of the brain in PD patients. The disease remains incurable and only symptomatic relief is available. We screened various cell-penetrating peptides and reveal that penetratin is a potent inhibitor of -syn aggregation in-vitro, and significantly improved locomotor coordination in mice models of PD in-vivo. The peptide inhibits -syn aggregation in vitro as well as in yeast, and C.elegans models. We further made a cyclic derivative of penetratin by disulfide coupling of N- and C-terminal cysteine residues. Both penetratin and its cyclized derivative interact with -syn. NMR studies show that both linear as well as cyclic derivative interact at the acidic C-terminal tail of the protein. Similar to penetratin, its cyclic derivative inhibited -syn aggregation in the C.elegans model of Parkinsons disease, and also improved worm motility. Molecular Dynamics studies show that penetratin interacts with -synuclein and prevents its conformational transition from disordered into {beta}-sheet rich structure. The therapeutic efficacy of penetratin was further confirmed in a transgenic mice model of the disease, wherein penetratin treatment over a period of 90 days improved locomotor coordination, and halted disease progression. Overall, the present work provides a potent therapeutic agent that could be further explored in the management of PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precise overlapping neural representations between feeling and seeing touch in people with high tactile empathy</a></h4>

              
                Empathy allows us to understand and sometimes vicariously experience what someone else is feeling1,2. For some people this extends to tactile sensations, with reports of feeling touch when seeing others being touched3,4. Major theories claim that tactile empathy relies on overlapping neural representations between feeling and seeing touch5-8. Here we test this using time-resolved decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data collected while participants felt touch to the fingers or watched videos of touch to another person's fingers. A classifier trained and tested on brain activation patterns during tactile trials could distinguish touch to the thumb versus little finger, demonstrating remarkable sensitivity to small neural differences. In people with high tactile empathy, who report feeling touch when watching videos of touch, these tactile classifiers cross-generalised to visual trials. These data show that representations of feeling and seeing touch overlap, including fine-grained information about touch location on the hand. The timing suggests that early visual predictions of touch location involve later (high-level) tactile representations. Our results demonstrate that EEG decoding can extract precise neural signatures for location of touch and suggest that shared neural representations underpin tactile empathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Opioid suppression of an excitatory pontomedullary respiratory circuit by convergent mechanisms.</a></h4>

              
                Opioids depress breathing by inhibition of inter-connected respiratory nuclei in the pons and medulla. Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists directly hyperpolarize a population of neurons in the dorsolateral pons, particularly the Kolliker-Fuse (KF) nucleus, that are key mediators of opioid-induced respiratory depression. However, the projection target and synaptic connections of MOR-expressing KF neurons is unknown. Here, we used retrograde labeling and brain slice electrophysiology to determine that MOR-expressing KF neurons project to respiratory nuclei in the ventrolateral medulla, including the pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC) and rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG). These medullary projecting, MOR-expressing dorsolateral pontine neurons express FoxP2 and are distinct from calcitonin gene-related peptide-expressing lateral parabrachial neurons. Furthermore, dorsolateral pontine neurons release glutamate onto excitatory preBotC and rVRG neurons via monosynaptic projections, which is inhibited by presynaptic opioid receptors. The excitatory preBotC and rVRG neurons receiving MOR-sensitive glutamatergic synaptic input from the dorsolateral pons are themselves hyperpolarized by opioids. Thus, opioids can synergistically inhibit this excitatory pontomedullary respiratory circuit by three distinct mechanisms--somatodendritic MORs on dorsolateral pontine and ventrolateral medullary neurons and presynaptic MORs on dorsolateral pontine neuron terminals in the ventrolateral medulla--all of which could contribute to opioid-induced respiratory depression.

	<p>Maternal and passionate love are both crucial for reproduction and involve attachment behaviors with high rewards. Neurobiological studies of attachment in animal and human neuroimaging studies have suggested that the coordination of oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic pathways, coupled with the dopaminergic reward system, contribute to the formation and maintenance of maternal and passionate love. In the present study, we carried out a quantitative meta-analysis of human neuroimaging to identify common and dissociable neural substrates associated with maternal and passionate love, using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. The ALE results showed significant activation of the brain regions in the left ventral tegmental area (VTA), right thalamus, left substantia nigra, and the left putamen for maternal love, but in the bilateral VTA for passionate love. The meta-analytic neuroimaging evidence suggests the greater involvement of cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;affective regulation in maternal attachment and the greater desire to combine liking and wanting in romantic love behaviors. The conjunction analysis highlights the functional convergence of the VTA across the two types of human love, indicating a shared neurobiological mechanism of maternal and passionate love with evolutionary roots. Our findings suggest that the processing of both maternal and passionate love involve the affective and motivational regulation associated with dopaminergic systems; our neuroimaging evidence supports the notion that maternal and passionate love share a common evolutionary origin and neurobiological basis in the human brain.</p>

	<p>Tic disorders (TDs) are a series of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by involuntary motor and/or vocal tics and commonly comorbid with several other psychopathological and/or behavioral disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder), which indeed aggravate clinical symptoms and complicate diagnosis and treatment. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) derived from small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have been recognized as novel circulating biomarkers of disease. To identify specific miRNAs derived from plasma sEVs for TDs&amp;amp;rsquo; diagnosis and prognosis, we used official EV isolation and purification methods to characterize the plasma-derived EV miRNAs from children with different types of TDs. Nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and immunoblot analysis of EV surface markers were applied to confirm the features and quality of sEVs. The RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach was adapted to identify novel circulating sEVs-derived miRNAs with altered expression levels in paired comparisons of TDs versus healthy controls (HCs), transient tic disorder (TTD) versus chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD), and TTD versus Tourette Syndrome (TS). GO term and KEGG pathway were performed for functional analysis and the receiver operator curve analysis was followed to test the diagnosis efficacy of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) derived from plasma sEVs among paired groups, namely, TDs versus HCs, TTD versus CTD, and TTD versus TS. As a result, 10 miRNAs (hsa-let-7a, hsa-let-7b, hsa-let-7c, hsa-let-7e, hsa-let-7f, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-125b-5p, and hsa-miR-1469) have demonstrated a significantly different expression signature in the TDs group compared to HCs with excellent area under curve (AUC) values of 0.99, 0.973, 0.997, 1, 0.99, 0.997, 0.987, 0.993, 0.977, and 0.997, respectively, and the diagnostic efficacy of miRNAs was also estimated for discriminating TTD from CTD or TS. In our research, we finally obtained several potential sEVs-derived miRNA biomarkers to assess the diagnosis and prognosis of TDs.</p>

	<p>Op art was created, in part, to produce illusions of movement. Given that dyslexics have been shown to have impaired visuo-postural axis deficits, it may be possible that dyslexics see illusions different than their non-dyslexic peers. To test this theory, we measured eye movement and posture in 47 dyslexic (18 female, 29 male; mean age 15.4) and 44 non dyslexic (22 female, 22 male; mean age 14.8) adolescents while they viewed three works of art by Op artist Bridget Riley. They then responded to a questionnaire about how they felt while viewing the artworks. Dyslexics demonstrated significantly slower saccades in terms of average velocity that was particularly disturbed in paintings that manipulated depth. Subjectively, dyslexics felt much more destabilized compared to their peers; however, there was not a significant difference in objective postural measurements between the two groups. The sensation of destabilization was positively correlated with appreciation in non-dyslexic adolescents. These subjective results suggest that dyslexics may be more sensitive to movement in depth, which could be related to the instability in vergence movements. Whereas this instability represents a hinderance in relation to reading, it could be an advantage while viewing paintings such as these.</p>

	<p>Depression is a common but easily misdiagnosed disease when using a self-assessment scale. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) provide an important reference and objective basis for the identification and diagnosis of depression. In order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of depression by using mainstream algorithms, a high-performance hybrid neural network depression detection method is proposed in this paper combined with deep learning technology. Firstly, a concatenating one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are employed to extract the local features and to determine the global features of the EEG signal. Secondly, the attention mechanism is introduced to form the hybrid neural network. The attention mechanism assigns different weights to the multi-dimensional features extracted by the network, so as to screen out more representative features, which can reduce the computational complexity of the network and save the training time of the model while ensuring high precision. Moreover, dropout is applied to accelerate network training and address the over-fitting problem. Experiments reveal that the 1D-CNN-GRU-ATTN model has more effectiveness and a better generalization ability compared with traditional algorithms. The accuracy of the proposed method in this paper reaches 99.33% in a public dataset and 97.98% in a private dataset, respectively.</p>

	<p>Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology has been shown to provide new communication possibilities, conveying brain information externally. BCI-based robot control has started to play an important role, especially in medically assistive robots but not only there. For example, a BCI-controlled robotic arm can provide patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases such as Locked-in syndrome (LIS), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and others with the ability to manipulate different objects. This study presents the optimization of the configuration parameters of a three-class Motor Imagery (MI) -based BCI for controlling a six Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm in a plane. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are recorded from 64 positions on the scalp according to the International 10-10 System. In terms of the resulting classification of error rates, we investigated twelve time windows for the spatial filter and classifier calculation and three time windows for the variance smoothing time. The lowest error rates were achieved when using a 3 s time window for creating the spatial filters and classifier, for a variance time window of 1.5 s.</p>

	<p>Many people who received amputation wear sEMG prostheses to assist in their daily lives. How these prostheses promote muscle growth and change neural activity remains elusive. We recruited a subject who had his left hand amputated for over 53 years to participate in a six-week rehabilitation training using an sEMG prosthesis. We tracked the muscle growth of his left forearm and changes in neural activity over six weeks. The subject showed an increase in fast muscle fiber in his left forearm during the training period. In an analysis of complex networks of neural activity, we observed that the &amp;amp;alpha;-band network decreased in efficiency but increased in its capability to integrate information. This could be due to an expansion of the network to accommodate new movements enabled by rehabilitation training. Differently, we found that in the &amp;amp;beta;-band network, a band frequency related to motor functions, the efficiency of the network initially decreased but started to increase after approximately three weeks. The ability to integrate network information showed an opposite trend compared with its efficiency. rMT values, a measure that negatively correlates with cortical excitability, showed a sharp decrease in the first three weeks, suggesting an increase in cortical excitability. In the last three weeks, there was little to no change. These data indicate that rehabilitation training promoted fast muscle fiber growth and introduced neural activity changes in the subject during the first three weeks of training. Our study gave insights into how rehabilitation training with an sEMG prosthesis could lead to physiological and neural changes in amputees.</p>

	<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopment disorder that affects millions of children and typically persists into adulthood. It must be diagnosed efficiently and consistently to receive adequate treatment, otherwise, it can have a detrimental impact on the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s professional performance, mental health, and relationships. In this work, motor activity data of adults suffering from ADHD and clinical controls has been preprocessed to obtain 788 activity-related statistical features. Afterwards, principal component analysis has been carried out to obtain significant features for accurate classification. These features are then fed into six different machine learning algorithms for classification, which include C4.5, kNN, Random Forest, LogitBoost, SVM, and Naive Bayes. The detailed evaluation of the results through 10-fold cross-validation reveals that SVM outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 98.43%, F-measure of 98.42%, sensitivity of 98.33%, specificity of 98.56% and AUC of 0.983. Thus, a PCA-based SVM approach appears to be an effective choice for accurate identification of ADHD patients among other clinical controls using real-time analysis of activity data.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal identity defines a-synuclein and tau toxicity</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic a-synuclein and tau are critical drivers of neurodegeneration and their mutations cause neuronal loss in patients. Whether the underlying preferential neuronal vulnerability is a cell-type intrinsic property or a consequence of increased expression levels is an open question. Here, we explore cell-type specific a-synuclein and tau expression in human brain datasets and use deep phenotyping as well as brain-wide single-cell RNA sequencing of >200 live neuron types in fruit flies to ask which cellular environments react most to a-synuclein or tau toxicity. We detect phenotypic and transcriptomic evidence of differential neuronal vulnerability independent of a-synuclein or tau expression levels. Comparing vulnerable with resilient neurons enabled us to identify molecular signatures associated with these differential responses. We used these to verify, and then predict resilient and vulnerable neuron subtypes in human brains. This confirms substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to be sensitive to a-synuclein, and we predict pathogenic tau vulnerable and protected cortical neuron subtypes. Our work indicates that cellular determinants confer selective vulnerability to specific types of amyloid toxicity, thus paving the way to leverage neuronal identity to uncover modifiers of neurodegeneration-associated toxic proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological characterization of medial preoptic neurons in lactating rats and its modulation by hypocretin-1</a></h4>

              
                The medial preoptic area (mPOA) undergoes through neuroanatomical changes across the postpartum period, during which its neurons play a critical role in the regulation of maternal behavior. In addition, this area is also crucial for sleep-wake regulation. We have previously shown that hypocretins (HCRT) within the mPOA facilitate active maternal behaviors in postpartum rats, while the blockade of endogenous HCRT in this area promotes nursing and sleep. To explore the mechanisms behind these HCRT actions, we aimed to evaluate the effects of juxta-cellular HCRT-1 administration on mPOA neurons in urethane-anesthetized postpartum and virgin female rats. We recorded mPOA single units and the electroencephalogram (EEG) and applied HCRT-1 juxta-cellular by pressure pulses. Our main results show that the electrophysiological characteristics of the mPOA neurons and their relationship with the EEG of postpartum rats did not differ from virgin rats. Additionally, neurons that respond to HCRT-1 had a slower firing rate than those that did not. In addition, administration of HCRT increased the activity in one group of neurons while decreasing it in another, both in postpartum and virgin rats. The mechanisms by which HCRT modulate functions controlled by the mPOA involve different cell populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gender and comorbidity moderate the relationship between mood disorder symptoms and effortful avoidance performance</a></h4>

              
                We must often decide how much effort to exert or withhold to avoid undesirable outcomes or obtain rewards. In depression and anxiety, levels of avoidance tend to be excessive and reward-seeking is reduced. Yet outstanding questions remain about the links between motivated action/inhibition and anxiety and depression symptoms, and whether they differ between men and women. Here we examined the relationship between anxiety and depression symptoms and performance on effortful active and inhibitory avoidance (Study 1) and reward seeking (Study 2) in humans. Undergraduates and paid online workers (NAvoid = 545, NReward = 310; NFemale = 368, NMale = 450, MAge = 22.58, RangeAge = 17-62) were assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and performed an instructed online avoidance or reward-seeking task. Participants had to make multiple presses on active trials and withhold presses on inhibitory trials to avoid an unpleasant sound (Study 1) or obtain points towards a monetary reward (Study 2). Overall, men deployed more effort than women in both avoidance and reward-seeking, and anxiety symptoms were negatively associated with active reward-seeking accuracy. Gender moderated the relationship between anxiety symptoms and inhibitory avoidance, such that women with higher anxiety showed reduced inhibitory avoidance accuracy. Anxiety symptoms predicted poorer active avoidance performance for those high in depression symptoms only. Our results illuminate effects of gender and symptom comorbidity in the relationship between mood disorder symptoms and the motivation to actively and effortfully respond to obtain positive and avoid negative outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tilt Aftereffect Spreads Across the Visual Field</a></h4>

              
                The tilt aftereffect (TAE) is observed when adaptation to a tilted contour alters the perceived tilt of a subsequently presented contour. Thus far, the TAE has been treated as a local aftereffect observed only at the location of the adapter. Whether and how TAE spreads to other locations in the visual field has not been systematically studied. Here we sought an answer to this question by measuring TAE magnitudes at locations including but not limited to the adapter location. The adapter was a tilted grating presented at the same peripheral location throughout an experimental session. In a single trial, participants indicated the perceived tilt of a test grating presented after the adapter at one of fifteen locations in the same hemifield as the adapter. We found non-zero TAE magnitudes in all locations tested, showing that the effect spreads across the tested visual hemifield. Next, to establish a link between neuronal activity and the behavioral results, and to predict possible origins of the spread, we built a model based on known characteristics of neuronal responses in the visual cortex. Simulation results showed that the model can successfully capture the pattern of the behavioral results. Furthermore, the pattern of the optimized receptive field sizes suggests that mid-level visual areas, for example V4, could be critically involved in TAE and its spread across the visual field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-redundant odorant detection in a locust</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory coding, from insects to humans, is canonically considered to involve considerable across-fiber coding already at the peripheral level, thereby allowing recognition of very large numbers of odor compounds. Here we show that the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, has evolved an alternative strategy built on highly specific odorant receptors feeding into a complex primary processing center in the brain. By collecting odors from food and different life stages of the locust, we identified 208 ecologically relevant odorants, which we used to deorphanize 48 locust olfactory receptors via ectopic expression in Drosophila. Contrary to the often broadly tuned olfactory receptors of other insects, almost all locust receptors were found to be narrowly tuned to one ligand and most of these best ligands exclusively excited only one receptor. Knocking out a single receptor using CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in an abolished physiological and behavioral response to the corresponding ligand. We conclude that the locust olfactory system, with an apparent lack of redundancy among most olfactory receptors, differs from so-far described olfactory systems.

                The ability to flexibly adjust beliefs about other people is crucial for human social functioning. Dopamine has been proposed to regulate the precision of beliefs, but direct behavioural evidence of this is lacking. We investigated how a relatively high dose of the selective D2/D3 dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride impacts learning about other people's prosocial attitudes in a repeated trust game. Using a Bayesian model of belief updating, we show that sulpiride increased the volatility of beliefs, which led to higher precision-weights on prediction errors. This effect was entirely driven by participants with genetically conferring higher dopamine availability (Taq1a polymorphism). Higher precision weights were reflected in higher reciprocal behaviour in the repeated trust game but not in single-round trust games. This finding suggests that antipsychotic medication might acutely reduce rigidity of pathological beliefs.

                Past studies have linked differences in white matter tissue properties to reading skills. However, these studies have reported a range of, sometimes conflicting, results. Some studies suggest that white matter properties act as individual-level traits predictive of reading skill, whereas others suggest that reading skill and white matter develop as a function of an individual's educational context. In the present study, we tested two hypotheses: a) that diffusion properties of the white matter reflect stable brain characteristics that relate to reading skills over development or b) that white matter plays a part in a dynamic system, linked with learning over time. To answer these questions, we examined the relationship between white matter and reading in a series of large-scale, single-observation datasets and a four-year longitudinal dataset. We find that gains in reading skill correspond to longitudinal changes in the white matter. However, in the single-observation datasets, we find no evidence for the hypothesis that individual differences in white matter predict reading skill. These findings highlight the link between dynamic processes in the white matter and learning.

                Backpropagation has been used to train neural networks for many years, allowing them to solve a wide variety of tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning tasks. But the biological plausibility of backpropagation as a mechanism of neural learning has been questioned. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) has been proposed as a more biologically plausible alternative and achieves comparable accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image classification task. This study proposes the first EP-based reinforcement learning architecture: an actor-critic architecture with the actor network trained by EP. We show that this model can solve the basic control tasks often used as benchmarks for BP-based models. Interestingly, our trained model demonstrates more consistent high-reward behavior than a comparable model trained exclusively by backpropagation.

	<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep bruxism (SB) may appear concomitantly. Data on the relationship between OSA and SB are limited. It was shown that in a population with an increased risk of OSA, OSA was dependently correlated with SB on the degree of OSA severity only in mild and moderate cases of OSA. We aimed to confirm this relationship and affecting factors in a group of dental office patients in a prospective, observational study. Adult patients (n = 119) were evaluated using respiratory polygraphy. The risk of OSA was assessed using a STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ). The episodes of bruxism and respiratory events were scored according to the standards of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The prevalence of OSA and SB was found to be 63.02% and 41.17%, respectively. The bruxism episode index (BEI) was increased in the group with a higher risk of OSA (SBQ &amp;amp;ge; 3) compared to the group with a lower risk of OSA (3.49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.63 vs. 2.27 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.50, p = 0.03). The sensitivity and specificity of the SBQ were not sufficient to predict SB. A positive linear correlation between AHI and BEI in the group with AHI &amp;amp;lt; 23/h was found. The study confirmed that OSA was associated with SB in the group of patients with OSA and/or SB risk. The relationship between OSA and SB depended on the degree of severity of OSA and occurred in mild and moderate cases of OSA.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment associated with synaptic dysfunction and dendritic spine loss and the pathologic hallmarks of &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles. 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family of proteins whose functions include regulation of protein folding, neuronal architecture, and synaptic function. Additionally, 14-3-3s interact with both A&beta; and tau, and reduced levels of 14-3-3s have been shown in the brains of AD patients and in AD mouse models. Here, we examine the neuroprotective potential of the 14-3-3 isoform in AD models. We demonstrate that 14-3-3 overexpression is protective and 14-3-3 inhibition is detrimental against oligomeric A&beta;-induced neuronal death in primary cortical cultures. Overexpression of 14-3-3 using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector failed to improve performance on behavioral tests, improve A&beta; pathology, or affect synaptic density in the J20 AD mouse model. Similarly, crossing a second AD mouse model, the <I>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></I> knock-in (APP KI) mouse, with 14-3-3 transgenic mice failed to rescue behavioral deficits, reduce A&beta; pathology, or impact synaptic density in the APP KI mouse model. 14-3-3 is likely partially insolubilized in the APP models, as demonstrated by proteinase K digestion. These findings do not support increasing 14-3-3 expression as a therapeutic approach for AD.</p>

                Background: HIV/AIDS is still a major public health issue around the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where this has resulted in unquantifiable human suffering, social and cultural disruption, and enormous economic losses. Methods: This study aims to assess women’s knowledge and attitude toward HIV/AIDS and its prevention in Ghana. To perform an analytic cross-sectional study, this study used data (the women in reproductive age 15-49 years dataset) from the Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2017/18. Bivariate analysis was done using chi-square and predictor variables were identified using binary logistics regression. Results: This study recorded good HIV knowledge and attitude levels of 81.9% and 10.5%. Factors that predicted only good HIV knowledge levels were ethnicity, and disability status. Also, predictors of only good attitude level were type of residence and marital status. Factors implicated in the prediction of both good knowledge and attitude levels were age, educational status, region of orientation, health insurance status, economic status, and media exposure. Conclusions: This study recorded a good HIV knowledge level among the majority of the women, but recorded most respondents having a poor attitude toward HIV.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of non-pharmacologic strategies on prevention or management of intensive care unit delirium: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Post-operative delirium is a common complication among adult patients in the intensive care unit. Current literature does not support the use of pharmacologic measures to manage this condition, and several studies explore the potential for the use of non-pharmacologic methods such as early mobility plans or environmental modifications. The aim of this systematic review is to examine and report on recently available literature evaluating the relationship between non-pharmacologic management strategies and the reduction of delirium in the intensive care unit. Methods: Six major research databases were systematically searched for articles analyzing the efficacy of non-pharmacologic delirium interventions in the past five years. Search results were restricted to adult human patients aged 18 years or older in the intensive care unit setting, excluding terminally ill subjects and withdrawal-related delirium. Following title, abstract, and full text review, 27 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Results: The 27 reviewed articles consist of 12 interventions with a single-component investigational approach, and 15 with multi-component bundled protocols. Delirium incidence was the most commonly assessed outcome followed by duration. Family visitation was the most effective individual intervention while mobility interventions were the least effective. Two of the three family studies significantly reduced delirium incidence, while one in five mobility studies did the same. Multi-component bundle approaches were the most effective of all; of the reviewed studies, eight of 11 bundles significantly improved delirium incidence and seven of eight bundles decreased the duration of delirium. Conclusions: Multi-component, bundled interventions were more effective at managing intensive care unit delirium than those utilizing an approach with a single interventional element. Although better management of this condition suggests a decrease in resource burden and improvement in patient outcomes, comparative research should be performed to identify the importance of specific bundle elements.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The level of community behaviour towards hearing loss in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hearing loss is the most common disability in the world, with a prevalence of 5% of the world's population of 466 million people. Knowledge about noise exposure and hearing protection equipment is related to hearing loss. Health is associated with a person's healthy lifestyle behaviour. This study aimed to determine the level of community behaviour towards hearing loss. Methods: This study used a descriptive analytical approach with a cross-sectional study design. The population in this study was Indonesian people who were not healthcare workers aged 17 years and over. The sample inclusion criteria included individuals who were not healthcare workers (such as doctors, nurses and midwives etc.), aged 17 years and over, and willing to participate in the study. The sampling method in this study was consecutive sampling. Results: Based on the distribution of patients, there were more female participants (1484, 61.6%) than male participants. Diploma-3 (D3) was the most common education type, with as many as 1095 people (45.4%), while the least common education type was not in school (eight, 0.3%). Most participants were in the ‘employee’ profession, namely 509 people (21.1%), while the lowest number of participants was in the Police profession (20, 0.8%). There were significant relationships between the respondent's knowledge and action about hearing loss, and the respondent’s knowledge and attitudes regarding hearing loss (p=0.000). Conclusions: There were significant relationships between the respondent's knowledge and actions about hearing loss and the respondent's knowledge and attitude, while there was no significant relationship between the respondent's attitude and actions regarding hearing loss.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MaxHiC: A robust background correction model to identify biologically relevant chromatin interactions in Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Rassa Ghavami Modegh, Hamid R. Rabiee, Ehsan Ramezani Sarbandi, Narges Rezaie, Kin Tung Tam, Alistair R. R. Forrest</p>

Hi-C is a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture technology that detects interactions between pairs of genomic regions and exploits higher order chromatin structures. Conceptually Hi-C data counts interaction frequencies between every position in the genome and every other position. Biologically functional interactions are expected to occur more frequently than transient background and artefactual interactions. To identify biologically relevant interactions, several background models that take biases such as distance, GC content and mappability into account have been proposed. Here we introduce MaxHiC, a background correction tool that deals with these complex biases and robustly identifies statistically significant interactions in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C experiments. MaxHiC uses a negative binomial distribution model and a maximum likelihood technique to correct biases in both Hi-C and capture Hi-C libraries. We systematically benchmark MaxHiC against major Hi-C background correction tools including Hi-C significant interaction callers (SIC) and Hi-C loop callers using published Hi-C, capture Hi-C, and Micro-C datasets. Our results demonstrate that 1) Interacting regions identified by MaxHiC have significantly greater levels of overlap with known regulatory features (e.g. active chromatin histone marks, CTCF binding sites, DNase sensitivity) and also disease-associated genome-wide association SNPs than those identified by currently existing models, 2) the pairs of interacting regions are more likely to be linked by eQTL pairs and 3) more likely to link known regulatory features including known functional enhancer-promoter pairs validated by CRISPRi than any of the existing methods. We also demonstrate that interactions between different genomic region types have distinct distance distributions only revealed by MaxHiC. MaxHiC is publicly available as a python package for the analysis of Hi-C, capture Hi-C and Micro-C data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evidence for influenza and RSV interaction from 10 years of enhanced surveillance in Nha Trang, Vietnam, a modelling study</a></h4>

Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) interact within their host posing the concern for impacts on heterologous viruses following vaccination. We aimed to estimate the population level impact of their interaction. We developed a dynamic age-stratified two-pathogen mathematical model that includes pathogen interaction through competition for infection and enhanced severity of dual infections. We used parallel tempering to fit its parameters to 11 years of enhanced hospital-based surveillance for acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in children under 5 years old in Nha Trang, Vietnam. The data supported either a 41% (95%CrI: 36–54) reduction in susceptibility following infection and for 10.0 days (95%CrI 7.1–12.8) thereafter, or no change in susceptibility following infection. We estimate that co-infection increased the probability for an infection in <2y old children to be reported 7.2 fold (95%CrI 5.0–11.4); or 16.6 fold (95%CrI 14.5–18.4) in the moderate or low interaction scenarios. Absence of either pathogen was not to the detriment of the other. We find stronger evidence for severity enhancing than for acquisition limiting interaction. In this setting vaccination against either pathogen is unlikely to have a major detrimental effect on the burden of disease caused by the other.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A pipeline for the reconstruction and evaluation of context-specific human metabolic models at a large-scale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vítor Vieira, Jorge Ferreira, Miguel Rocha</p>

Constraint-based (CB) metabolic models provide a mathematical framework and scaffold for <i>in silico</i> cell metabolism analysis and manipulation. In the past decade, significant efforts have been done to model human metabolism, enabled by the increased availability of multi-omics datasets and curated genome-scale reconstructions, as well as the development of several algorithms for context-specific model (CSM) reconstruction. Although CSM reconstruction has revealed insights on the deregulated metabolism of several pathologies, the process of reconstructing representative models of human tissues still lacks benchmarks and appropriate integrated software frameworks, since many tools required for this process are still disperse across various software platforms, some of which are proprietary. In this work, we address this challenge by assembling a scalable CSM reconstruction pipeline capable of integrating transcriptomics data in CB models. We combined omics preprocessing methods inspired by previous efforts with in-house implementations of existing CSM algorithms and new model refinement and validation routines, all implemented in the <i>Troppo</i> Python-based open-source framework. The pipeline was validated with multi-omics datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), also including reference fluxomics measurements for the MCF7 cell line. We reconstructed over 6000 models based on the Human-GEM template model for 733 cell lines featured in the CCLE, using MCF7 models as reference to find the best parameter combinations. These reference models outperform earlier studies using the same template by comparing gene essentiality and fluxomics experiments. We also analysed the heterogeneity of breast cancer cell lines, identifying key changes in metabolism related to cancer aggressiveness. Despite the many challenges in CB modelling, we demonstrate using our pipeline that combining transcriptomics data in metabolic models can be used to investigate key metabolic shifts. Significant limitations were found on these models ability for reliable quantitative flux prediction, thus motivating further work in genome-wide phenotype prediction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unmet contraceptive needs and unintended pregnancies among adolescent girls amid COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa and the importance of accurate, reliable and real-time data [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has had a significant negative impact on issues such as the reproductive health of young girls. One of the consequences of the pandemic is a shortage of contraceptives and devices due to supply chain disruptions. The concern is that due to a lack of data, it is unclear how much these restrictions have impacted contraceptive use among youth from sub-Saharan Africa during COVID-19. Thousands of Kenyan schoolgirls have become pregnant due to the lockdown. It was recently reported from Gauteng, one of the South African provinces, that between April 2020 and March 2021 there were over 23,000 teenage pregnancies, with 934 girls aged 10 to 14 giving birth. This opinion piece aims to stimulate discussion on these issues while also addressing the issue of the importance of data for studying contraceptive use and teenage pregnancy in the face of hard-hit pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">“Ependymal‐in” gradient of thalamic damage in progressive multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Leptomeningeal and perivenular infiltrates are important contributors to cortical grey matter damage and disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). While perivenular inflammation induces vasculocentric lesions, leptomeningeal involvement follows a subpial ‘surface-in’ gradient. To determine whether similar gradient of damage occurs in deep grey matter nuclei, we examined the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei and CSF samples from 41 post-mortem secondary progressive MS cases compared to 5 non-neurological controls and 12 controls with other neurological diseases. CSF/ependyma-oriented gradient of reduction in NeuN+ neuron density was present in MS thalamic lesions compared to controls, greatest (26%) in subventricular locations at the ependyma/CSF boundary and least with increasing distance (12% at 10mm). Concomitant graded reduction in SMI31+ axon density was observed, greatest (38%) at 2mm from the ependyma/CSF boundary and least at 10mm (13%). Conversely, gradient of MHC-II+ microglia density increased by over 50% at 2 mm at the ependyma/CSF boundary and only by 15% at 10mm and this gradient inversely correlated with the neuronal (R=-0.91,p&lt;0.0001) and axonal (R=-0.79,p&lt;0.0001) thalamic changes. Observed gradients were also detected in normal-appearing thalamus and were associated with: rapid/severe disease progression; presence of leptomeningeal tertiary lymphoid-like structures; large subependymal infiltrates, enriched in CD20+ B cells and occasionally containing CXCL13+CD35+ follicular dendritic cells; and high CSF protein expression of a complex pattern of soluble inflammatory/neurodegeneration factors, including chitinase-3-like-1, TNFR-1, parvalbumin, neurofilament-light-chains and TNF. Substantial “ependymal-in” gradient of pathological cell alterations, accompanied by presence of intrathecal inflammation, compartmentalized either in sub-ependymal lymphoid perivascular infiltrates or in CSF, may play a key role in MS progression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Polygenic Resilience Modulates the Penetrance of Parkinson Disease Genetic Risk Factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the current study is to understand why some individuals avoid developing Parkinson disease (PD) despite being at relatively high genetic risk, using the largest datasets of individual-level genetic data available.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We calculated polygenic risk score to identify controls and matched PD cases with the highest burden of genetic risk for PD in the discovery cohort (International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, 7,204 PD cases and 9,412 controls) and validation cohorts (Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease, 8,968 cases and 7,598 controls; UK Biobank, 2,639 PD cases and 14,301 controls; Accelerating Medicines Partnership–Parkinson's Disease Initiative, 2,248 cases and 2,817 controls). A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, and performed multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (β = −0.054, standard error [SE] = 0.022, <i>p</i> = 0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated <i>TBCA</i> as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (<i>h</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, SE = 0.035, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as a potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metformin abrogates pathological TNF-α-producing B cells through mTOR-dependent metabolic reprogramming in polycystic ovary syndrome</a></h4>

              
                B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Clinically, metformin is used to treat PCOS, but it is unclear whether metformin exerts its therapeutic effect by regulating B cells. Here, we showed that the expression level of TNF-α in peripheral blood B cells from PCOS patient was increased. Metformin used <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> was able to reduce the production of TNF-α in B cells from PCOS patient. Administration of metformin improved mouse PCOS phenotypes induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and also inhibited TNF-α expression in splenic B cells. Further, metformin induced metabolic reprogramming of B cells in PCOS patients, including the alteration in mitochondrial morphology, the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production and glucose uptake. In DHEA-induced mouse PCOS model, metformin altered metabolic intermediates in splenic B cells. Moreover, the inhibition of TNF-α expression and metabolic reprogramming in B cells of PCOS patients and mouse model by metformin were associated with decreased mTOR phosphorylation. Together, TNF-α-producing B cells are involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and metformin inhibits mTOR phosphorylation and affects metabolic reprogramming, thereby inhibiting TNF-α expression in B cells, which may be a new mechanism of metformin in the treatment of PCOS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The molecular mechanism of load adaptation by branched actin networks</a></h4>

              
                Branched actin networks are self-assembling molecular motors that move biological membranes and drive many important cellular processes, including phagocytosis, endocytosis, and pseudopod protrusion. When confronted with opposing forces, the growth rate of these networks slows and their density increases, but the stoichiometry of key components does not change. The molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood, so we used single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Although load forces are observed to increase the density of growing filaments, we find that they actually decrease the rate of filament nucleation due to inhibitory interactions between actin filament ends and nucleation promoting factors. The force-induced increase in network density turns out to result from an exponential drop in the rate constant that governs filament capping. The force dependence of filament capping matches that of filament elongation and can be explained by expanding Brownian Ratchet theory to cover both processes. We tested a key prediction of this expanded theory by measuring the force-dependent activity of engineered capping protein variants and found that increasing the size of the capping protein increases its sensitivity to applied forces. In summary, we find that Brownian Ratchets underlie not only the ability of growing actin filaments to generate force but also the ability of branched actin networks to adapt their architecture to changing loads.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cd59 and inflammation regulate Schwann cell development</a></h4>

              
                Efficient neurotransmission is essential for organism survival and is enhanced by myelination. However, the genes that regulate myelin and myelinating glial cell development have not been fully characterized. Data from our lab and others demonstrates that <i>cd59</i>, which encodes for a small GPI-anchored glycoprotein, is highly expressed in developing zebrafish, rodent, and human oligodendrocytes (OLs) and Schwann cells (SCs), and that patients with CD59 dysfunction develop neurological dysfunction during early childhood. Yet, the function of Cd59 in the developing nervous system is currently undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that <i>cd59</i> is expressed in a subset of developing SCs. Using <i>cd59</i> mutant zebrafish, we show that developing SCs proliferate excessively and nerves may have reduced myelin volume, altered myelin ultrastructure, and perturbed node of Ranvier assembly. Finally, we demonstrate that complement activity is elevated in <i>cd59</i> mutants and that inhibiting inflammation restores SC proliferation, myelin volume, and nodes of Ranvier to wildtype levels. Together, this work identifies Cd59 and developmental inflammation as key players in myelinating glial cell development, highlighting the collaboration between glia and the innate immune system to ensure normal neural development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structure-based electron-confurcation mechanism of the Ldh-EtfAB complex</a></h4>

              
                Lactate oxidation with NAD<sup>+</sup> as electron acceptor is a highly endergonic reaction. Some anaerobic bacteria overcome the energetic hurdle by flavin-based electron bifurcation/confurcation (FBEB/FBEC) using a lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) in concert with the electron-transferring proteins EtfA and EtfB. The electron cryo-microscopically characterized (Ldh-EtfAB)<sub>2</sub> complex of <i>Acetobacterium woodii</i> at 2.43 Å resolution consists of a mobile EtfAB shuttle domain located between the rigid central Ldh and the peripheral EtfAB base units. The FADs of Ldh and the EtfAB shuttle domain contact each other thereby forming the D (dehydrogenation-connected) state. The intermediary Glu37 and Glu139 may harmonize the redox potentials between the FADs and the pyruvate/lactate pair crucial for FBEC. By integrating Alphafold2 calculations a plausible novel B (bifurcation-connected) state was obtained allowing electron transfer between the EtfAB base and shuttle FADs. Kinetic analysis of enzyme variants suggests a correlation between NAD<sup>+</sup> binding site and D-to-B-state transition implicating a 75° rotation of the EtfAB shuttle domain. The FBEC inactivity when truncating the ferredoxin domain of EtfA substantiates its role as redox relay. Lactate oxidation in Ldh is assisted by the catalytic base His423 and a metal center. On this basis, a comprehensive catalytic mechanism of the FBEC process was proposed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Amoxicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae can be resensitized by targeting the mevalonate pathway as indicated by sCRilecs-seq</a></h4>

              
                Antibiotic resistance in the important opportunistic human pathogen <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> is on the rise. This is particularly problematic in the case of the β-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin, which is the first-line therapy. It is therefore crucial to uncover targets that would kill or resensitize amoxicillin-resistant pneumococci. To do so, we developed a genome-wide, single-cell based, gene silencing screen using CRISPR interference called sCRilecs-seq (subsets of CRISPR interference libraries extracted by fluorescence activated cell sorting coupled to next generation sequencing). Since amoxicillin affects growth and division, sCRilecs-seq was used to identify targets that are responsible for maintaining proper cell size. Our screen revealed that downregulation of the mevalonate pathway leads to extensive cell elongation. Further investigation into this phenotype indicates that it is caused by a reduced availability of cell wall precursors at the site of cell wall synthesis due to a limitation in the production of undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), the lipid carrier that is responsible for transporting these precursors across the cell membrane. The data suggest that, whereas peptidoglycan synthesis continues even with reduced Und-P levels, cell constriction is specifically halted. We successfully exploited this knowledge to create a combination treatment strategy where the FDA-approved drug clomiphene, an inhibitor of Und-P synthesis, is paired up with amoxicillin. Our results show that clomiphene potentiates the antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin and that combination therapy resensitizes amoxicillin-resistant <i>S. pneumoniae</i>. These findings could provide a starting point to develop a solution for the increasing amount of hard-to-treat amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcal infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tongue immune compartment analysis reveals spatial macrophage heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                The tongue is a unique muscular organ situated in the oral cavity where it is involved in taste sensation, mastication, and articulation. As a barrier organ, which is constantly exposed to environmental pathogens, the tongue is expected to host an immune cell network ensuring local immune defence. However, the composition and the transcriptional landscape of the tongue immune system are currently not completely defined. Here, we characterised the tissue-resident immune compartment of the murine tongue during development, health and disease, combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with in situ immunophenotyping. We identified distinct local immune cell populations and described two specific subsets of tongue-resident macrophages occupying discrete anatomical niches. <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages were located specifically in the highly innervated lamina propria beneath the tongue epidermis and at times in close proximity to fungiform papillae. <i>Folr2</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages were detected in deeper muscular tissue. In silico analysis indicated that the two macrophage subsets originate from a common proliferative precursor during early postnatal development and responded differently to systemic LPS in vivo. Our description of the under-investigated tongue immune system sets a starting point to facilitate research on tongue immune-physiology and pathology including cancer and taste disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oscillatory movement of a dynein-microtubule complex crosslinked with DNA origami</a></h4>

              
                Bending of cilia and flagella occurs when axonemal dynein molecules on one side of the axoneme produce force and move toward the microtubule (MT) minus end. These dyneins are then pulled back when the axoneme bends in the other direction, meaning oscillatory back and forth movement of dynein during repetitive bending of cilia/flagella. There are various factors that may regulate the dynein activity, e.g. the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, radial spokes, and central apparatus. In order to understand the basic mechanism of dynein’s oscillatory movement, we constructed a simple model system composed of MTs, outer-arm dyneins, and crosslinks between the MTs made of DNA origami. Electron microscopy (EM) showed pairs of parallel MTs crossbridged by patches of regularly arranged dynein molecules bound in two different orientations, depending on which of the MTs their tails bind to. The oppositely oriented dyneins are expected to produce opposing forces when the pair of MTs have the same polarity. Optical trapping experiments showed that the dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex actually oscillates back and forth after photolysis of caged ATP. Intriguingly, the complex, when held at one end, showed repetitive bending motions. The results show that a simple system composed of ensembles of oppositely oriented dyneins, MTs, and inter-MT crosslinkers, without any additional regulatory structures, has an intrinsic ability to cause oscillation and repetitive bending motions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Zebrafish fin regeneration involves generic and regeneration-specific osteoblast injury responses</a></h4>

              
                Successful regeneration requires the coordinated execution of multiple cellular responses to injury. In amputated zebrafish fins, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate, migrate towards the injury and form proliferative osteogenic blastema cells. We show that osteoblast migration is preceded by cell elongation and alignment along the proximodistal axis, which require actomyosin, but not microtubule turnover. Surprisingly, osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration can be uncoupled. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we found that NF-ĸB and retinoic acid signalling regulate dedifferentiation without affecting migration, while the complement system and actomyosin dynamics affect migration but not dedifferentiation. Furthermore, by removing bone at two locations within a fin ray, we established an injury model containing two injury sites. We found that osteoblasts dedifferentiate at and migrate towards both sites, while accumulation of osteogenic progenitor cells and regenerative bone formation only occur at the distal-facing injury. Together, these data indicate that osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration represent generic injury responses that are differentially regulated and can occur independently of each other and of regenerative growth. We conclude that successful fin bone regeneration appears to involve the coordinated execution of generic and regeneration-specific responses of osteoblasts to injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Predictive Coding: A New Model of Hierarchical Sequence Learning and Prediction in the Cortex</a></h4>

              
                We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a new hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the cortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using precision-weighted prediction errors. We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation is implemented as a low-dimensional mixture of possible temporal dynamics. When trained on natural videos, the first-level neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those found in simple cells of the primary visual cortex. The second-level responses spanned longer timescales and showed more stability than those at the first level, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. After adapting to a repeated visual sequence, the model displayed full recall of the sequence given only the beginning of the sequence, similar to sequence recall in the visual cortex. Our results suggest that sequence learning and temporal prediction in the cortex can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical generative model of input sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CaMKII binding to GluN2B flips a β-adrenergic switch from synaptic depression to potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Learning, memory and cognition are thought to require forms of synaptic plasticity such as hippocampal long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), and such plasticity can be modulated by {beta}-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol or norepinephrine. For instance, LTP versus LTD is induced by high-versus low-frequency stimulation (HFS versus LFS) but, stimulating {beta}-adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs) enables LTP induction also by LFS. In contrast to HFS-LTP, such {beta}AR-LTP requires signaling by L-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels, not NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Surprisingly, we found that {beta}AR-LTP still required a non-ionotropic NMDAR function: the stimulus-induced binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) that mediates CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses. In hippocampal neurons, {beta}-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol transformed LTD-type CaMKII movement to LTP-type movement, resulting in CaMKII movement to excitatory instead of inhibitory synapses. Additionally, isoproterenol enabled induction of a major cell-biological feature of LTP in response to LTD stimuli: increased SEP-GluA1 surface expression. Like for the {beta}AR-LTP in hippocampal slices, the effects of isoproterenol on CaMKII movement and SEP-GluA1 surface expression involved L-type Ca2+-channels. Taken together, these results indicate that isoproterenol transforms LTD stimuli to LTP signals by switching CaMKII movement and GluN2B binding to LTP mode.

One Sentence SummaryBuonarati et al. show that {beta}-adrenergic stimulation enables LTP induction in response to LTD stimuli by switching synaptic CaMKII movement to LTP mode.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhancing NeuroD1 Expression to Convert Lineage-Traced Astrocytes into Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Regenerating functional new neurons in adult mammalian brains has been proven a difficult task for decades. Recent advancement in direct glia-to-neuron conversion in vivo opens a new field for neural regeneration and repair. However, this emerging new field is facing serious challenges from misuse of viral vectors to misinterpretation of conversion data. Here, we employ a variety of AAV vectors with different promoters and enhancers to demonstrate that astrocytes can be converted into neurons in a NeuroD1 dose-dependent manner in both wildtype (WT) and transgenic mice. Notably, astrocytes in WT mice were relatively easy to convert with higher conversion efficiency, whereas lineage-traced astrocytes in Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice showed high resistance to reprogramming but were still converted into neurons after enhancing NeuroD1 expression with CMV enhancer. Furthermore, under two-photon microscope, we observed direct astrocyte-to-neuron conversion within 3 weeks of serial live imaging in the mouse cortex. We also demonstrated that high titre AAV reaching 1013 GC/ml caused severe neuronal leakage using a variety of AAV GFAP::GFP vectors, highlighting the necessity to inject low titre AAV into healthy brains to avoid artifactual results. Together, our studies suggest that lineage-traced astrocytes can be converted into neurons but require stronger conversion force such as enhanced NeuroD1 expression. Failure to recognize the difference between WT astrocytes and lineage-traced astrocytes in terms of conversion barrier will lead to misinterpretation of data.

                Germinal zone (GZ) exit is at the top of a cascade of events promoting the maturation of neurons and their assembly into neuronal circuits. Developing neurons and their progenitors must interpret varied niche signals like morphogens, guidance molecules, extracellular matrix, or adhesive cues to navigate GZ occupancy. How newborn neurons integrate multiple cell-extrinsic niche cues with their cell-intrinsic machinery in exiting a GZ is unknown. We establish cooperation between cell polarity-regulated adhesion and Netrin-1 signaling comprises a coincidence detection circuit repelling maturing neurons from their GZ. In this circuit, the Partitioning defective 3 (Pard3) polarity protein and Junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) adhesion protein promote, while the Seven in absentia 2 (Siah2) ubiquitin ligase inhibits, Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) receptor surface recruitment to gate differentiation linked repulsion to GZ Netrin-1. These results demonstrate cell polarity as a central integrator of adhesive- and guidance cues cooperating to spur GZ exit.

                Regeneration of myelin in the CNS is being pursued as a potential therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis. Several labs have reported small molecules that promote oligodendrocyte formation and remyelination in vivo. Recently, we reported that many such molecules function by inhibiting a narrow window of enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Here we describe a new high-throughput screen of 1,836 bioactive molecules and a thorough re-analysis of more than 60 molecules previously-identified as promoting oligodendrocyte formation from human, rat, or mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). These studies highlight that an overwhelming fraction of validated screening hits, including several molecules being evaluated clinically for remyelination, inhibit cholesterol pathway enzymes like EBP. To rationalize these findings, we suggest a model that relies on the high druggability of sterol-metabolizing enzymes and the ability of cationic amphiphiles to mimic the transition state of EBP. These studies further establish cholesterol pathway inhibition as a dominant mechanism among screening hits that enhance human, rat, or mouse oligodendrocyte formation.
