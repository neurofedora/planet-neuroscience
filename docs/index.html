<p>A common view on the brain learning processes proposes that the three classic
learning paradigms -- unsupervised, reinforcement, and supervised -- take place
in respectively the cortex, the basal-ganglia, and the cerebellum. However,
dopamine outbursts, usually assumed to encode reward, are not limited to the
basal ganglia but also reach prefrontal, motor, and higher sensory cortices. We
propose that in the cortex the same reward-based trial-and-error processes
might support not only the acquisition of motor representations but also of
sensory representations. In particular, reward signals might guide
trial-and-error processes that mix with associative learning processes to
support the acquisition of representations better serving downstream action
selection. We tested the soundness of this hypothesis with a computational
model that integrates unsupervised learning (Contrastive Divergence) and
reinforcement learning (REINFORCE). The model was tested with a task requiring
different responses to different visual images grouped in categories involving
either colour, shape, or size. Results show that a balanced mix of unsupervised
and reinforcement learning processes leads to the best performance. Indeed,
excessive unsupervised learning tends to under-represent task-relevant features
while excessive reinforcement learning tends to initially learn slowly and then
to incur in local minima. These results stimulate future empirical studies on
category learning directed to investigate similar effects in the extrastriate
visual cortices. Moreover, they prompt further computational investigations
directed to study the possible advantages of integrating unsupervised and
reinforcement learning processes.

<p>Neurons in the nervous system are submitted to distinct sources of noise,
such as ionic-channel and synaptic noise, which introduces variability in their
responses to repeated presentations of identical stimuli. This motivates the
use of stochastic models to describe neuronal behavior. In this work, we
characterize an intrinsically stochastic neuron model based on a
voltage-dependent spike probability function. We determine the effect of the
intrinsic noise in single neurons by measuring the spike time reliability and
study the stochastic resonance phenomenon. The model was able to show increased
reliability for non-zero intrinsic noise values, according to what is known
from the literature, and the addition of intrinsic stochasticity in it enhanced
the region in which stochastic resonance is present. We proceeded to the study
at the network level where we investigated the behavior of a random network
composed of stochastic neurons. In this case, the addition of an extra
dimension, represented by the intrinsic noise, revealed dynamic states of the
system that could not be found otherwise. Finally, we propose a method to
estimate the spike probability curve from in vitro electrophysiological data.

<p>One-shot learning can be achieved by algorithms and animals, but how the
latter do it is poorly understood as most of the algorithms are not
biologically plausible. Experiments studying one-shot learning in rodents have
shown that after initial gradual learning of associations between cues and
locations, new associations can be learned with just a single exposure to each
new cue-location pair. Foster, Morris and Dayan (2000) developed a hybrid
temporal difference - symbolic model that exhibited one-shot learning for dead
reckoning to displaced single locations. While the temporal difference rule for
learning the agent's actual coordinates was biologically plausible, the model's
symbolic mechanism for learning target coordinates was not, and one-shot
learning for multiple target locations was not addressed. Here we extend the
model by replacing the symbolic mechanism with a reservoir of recurrently
connected neurons resembling cortical microcircuitry. Biologically plausible
learning of target coordinates was achieved by subjecting the reservoir's
output weights to synaptic plasticity governed by a novel 4-factor variant of
the exploratory Hebbian (EH) rule. As with rodents, the reservoir model
exhibited one-shot learning for multiple paired associations.

<p>Noninvasive medical neuroimaging has yielded many discoveries about the brain
connectivity. Several substantial techniques mapping morphological, structural
and functional brain connectivities were developed to create a comprehensive
road map of neuronal activities in the human brain -namely brain graph. Relying
on its non-Euclidean data type, graph neural network (GNN) provides a clever
way of learning the deep graph structure and it is rapidly becoming the
state-of-the-art leading to enhanced performance in various network
neuroscience tasks. Here we review current GNN-based methods, highlighting the
ways that they have been used in several applications related to brain graphs
such as missing brain graph synthesis and disease classification. We conclude
by charting a path toward a better application of GNN models in network
neuroscience field for neurological disorder diagnosis and population graph
integration. The list of papers cited in our work is available at

<p>The relationship of network structure and dynamics is one of most extensively
investigated problems in the theory of complex systems of the last years.
Understanding this relationship is of relevance to a range of disciplines --
from Neuroscience to Geomorphology. A major strategy of investigating this
relationship is the quantitative comparison of a representation of network
architecture (structural connectivity) with a (network) representation of the
dynamics (functional connectivity). Analysing such SC/FC relationships has over
the past years contributed substantially to our understanding of the functional
role of network properties, such as modularity, hierarchical organization, hubs
and cycles.
</p>
<p>Here, we show that one can distinguish two classes of functional connectivity
-- one based on simultaneous activity (co-activity) of nodes the other based on
sequential activity of nodes. We delineate these two classes in different
categories of dynamical processes -- excitations, regular and chaotic
oscillators -- and provide examples for SC/FC correlations of both classes in
each of these models. We expand the theoretical view of the SC/FC
relationships, with conceptual instances of the SC and the two classes of FC
for various application scenarios in Geomorphology, Freshwater Ecology, Systems
Biology, Neuroscience and Social-Ecological Systems.
</p>
<p>Seeing the organization of a dynamical processes in a network either as
governed by co-activity or by sequential activity allows us to bring some order
in the myriad of observations relating structure and function of complex
networks.

<p>Visual search is a ubiquitous and often challenging daily task, exemplified
by looking for the car keys at home or a friend in a crowd. An intriguing
property of some classical search tasks is an asymmetry such that finding a
target A among distractors B can be easier than finding B among A. To elucidate
the mechanisms responsible for asymmetry in visual search, we propose a
computational model that takes a target and a search image as inputs and
produces a sequence of eye movements until the target is found. The model
integrates eccentricity-dependent visual recognition with target-dependent
top-down cues. We compared the model against human behavior in six paradigmatic
search tasks that show asymmetry in humans. Without prior exposure to the
stimuli or task-specific training, the model provides a plausible mechanism for
search asymmetry. We hypothesized that the polarity of search asymmetry arises
from experience with the natural environment. We tested this hypothesis by
training the model on an augmented version of ImageNet where the biases of
natural images were either removed or reversed. The polarity of search
asymmetry disappeared or was altered depending on the training protocol. This
study highlights how classical perceptual properties can emerge in neural
network models, without the need for task-specific training, but rather as a
consequence of the statistical properties of the developmental diet fed to the
model. All source code and stimuli are publicly available

<p>Multi-regional interaction among neuronal populations underlies the brain's
processing of rich sensory information in our daily lives. Recent neuroscience
and neuroimaging studies have increasingly used naturalistic stimuli and
experimental design to identify such realistic sensory computation in the
brain. However, existing methods for cross-areal interaction analysis with
dimensionality reduction, such as reduced-rank regression and canonical
correlation analysis, have limited applicability and interpretability in
naturalistic settings because they usually do not appropriately 'demix' neural
interactions into those associated with different types of task parameters or
stimulus features (e.g., visual or audio). In this paper, we develop a new
method for cross-areal interaction analysis that uses the rich task or stimulus
parameters to reveal how and what types of information are shared by different
neural populations. The proposed neural demixed shared component analysis
combines existing dimensionality reduction methods with a practical neural
network implementation of functional analysis of variance with latent
variables, thereby efficiently demixing nonlinear effects of continuous and
multimodal stimuli. We also propose a simplifying alternative under the
assumptions of linear effects and unimodal stimuli. To demonstrate our methods,
we analyzed two human neuroimaging datasets of participants watching
naturalistic videos of movies and dance movements. The results demonstrate that
our methods provide new insights into multi-regional interaction in the brain
during naturalistic sensory inputs, which cannot be captured by conventional
techniques.

<p>In real-world applications of influence maximization (IM), the network
structure is often unknown. In this case, we may identify the most influential
seed nodes by exploring only a part of the underlying network given a small
budget for node queries. Motivated by the fact that collecting node metadata is
more cost-effective than investigating the relationship between nodes via
queried nodes, we develop IM-META, an end-to-end solution to IM in networks
with unknown topology by retrieving information from both queries and node
metadata. However, using such metadata to aid the IM process is not without
risk due to the noisy nature of metadata and uncertainties in connectivity
inference. To tackle these challenges, we formulate an IM problem that aims to
find two sets, i.e., seed nodes and queried nodes. We propose an effective
method that iteratively performs three steps: 1) we learn the relationship
between collected metadata and edges via a Siamese neural network model, 2) we
select a number of inferred influential edges to construct a reinforced graph
used for discovering an optimal seed set, and 3) we identify the next node to
query by maximizing the inferred influence spread using a topology-aware
ranking strategy. By querying only 5% of nodes, IM-META reaches 93% of the
upper bound performance.

<p>Modern drug discovery is often time-consuming, complex and cost-ineffective
due to the large volume of molecular data and complicated molecular properties.
Recently, machine learning algorithms have shown promising results in virtual
screening of automated drug discovery by predicting molecular properties. While
emerging learning methods such as graph neural networks and recurrent neural
networks exhibit high accuracy, they are also notoriously computation-intensive
and memory-intensive with operations such as feature embeddings or deep
convolutions. In this paper, we propose a viable alternative to neural network
classifiers. We present MoleHD, a method based on brain-inspired
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for molecular property prediction. We first
transform the SMILES presentation of molecules into feature vectors by SMILE-PE
tokenizers pretrained on the ChEMBL database. Then, we develop HDC encoders to
project such features into high-dimensional vectors that are used for training
and inference. We perform an extensive evaluation using 30 classification tasks
from 3 widely-used molecule datasets and compare MoleHD with 10 baseline
methods including 6 SOTA neural network classifiers. Results show that MoleHD
is able to outperform all the baseline methods on average across 30
classification tasks with significantly reduced computing cost. To the best of
our knowledge, we develop the first HDC-based method for drug discovery. The
promising results presented in this paper can potentially lead to a novel path
in drug discovery research.

<p>The duality of sensory inference and optimal control was known since 1960s
and has recently been recognized as common computations required for posterior
distributions in dynamic Bayesian inference and value functions in optimal
control. Meanwhile, an intriguing question about the brain is why entire
neocortex shares a canonical six-layer architecture, while its posterior and
anterior halves are engaged in sensory processing and motor control,
respectively. Here we consider a hypothesis that the anterior and posterior
cortical circuits evolved for dual computations for sensory inference and
optimal control, or perceptual and value-based decision making, respectively.
We explore how different types of cortical neurons may represent different
variables, such as prior and posterior distributions and value functions, and
what cortical dynamics may realize required computations. We further discuss
experimental and computational approaches are required for scrutinizing this
dual cortical circuit hypothesis.

<p>Deep neural networks excel at image classification, but their performance is
far less robust to input perturbations than human perception. In this work we
explore whether this shortcoming may be partly addressed by incorporating
brain-inspired recurrent dynamics in deep convolutional networks. We take
inspiration from a popular framework in neuroscience: 'predictive coding'. At
each layer of the hierarchical model, generative feedback 'predicts' (i.e.,
reconstructs) the pattern of activity in the previous layer. The reconstruction
errors are used to iteratively update the network's representations across
timesteps, and to optimize the network's feedback weights over the natural
image dataset-a form of unsupervised training. We show that implementing this
strategy into two popular networks, VGG16 and EfficientNetB0, improves their
robustness against various corruptions. We hypothesize that other feedforward
networks could similarly benefit from the proposed framework. To promote
research in this direction, we provide an open-sourced PyTorch-based package
called Predify, which can be used to implement and investigate the impacts of
the predictive coding dynamics in any convolutional neural network.

<p>People differ in how they attend to, interpret, and respond to their
surroundings. Convergent processing of the world may be one factor that
contributes to social connections between individuals. We used neuroimaging and
network analysis to investigate whether the most central individuals in their
communities (as measured by in-degree centrality, a notion of popularity)
process the world in a particularly normative way. More central individuals had
exceptionally similar neural responses to their peers and especially to each
other in brain regions associated with high-level interpretations and social
cognition (e.g., in the default-mode network), whereas less-central individuals
exhibited more idiosyncratic responses. Self-reported enjoyment of and interest
in stimuli followed a similar pattern, but accounting for these data did not
change our main results. These findings suggest an "Anna Karenina principle" in
social networks: Highly-central individuals process the world in exceptionally
similar ways, whereas less-central individuals process the world in
idiosyncratic ways.

<p>The adaptive changes in synaptic efficacy that occur between spiking neurons
have been demonstrated to play a critical role in learning for biological
neural networks. Despite this source of inspiration, many learning focused
applications using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) retain static synaptic
connections, preventing additional learning after the initial training period.
Here, we introduce a framework for simultaneously learning the underlying
fixed-weights and the rules governing the dynamics of synaptic plasticity and
neuromodulated synaptic plasticity in SNNs through gradient descent. We further
demonstrate the capabilities of this framework on a series of challenging
benchmarks, learning the parameters of several plasticity rules including BCM,
Oja's, and their respective set of neuromodulatory variants. The experimental
results display that SNNs augmented with differentiable plasticity are
sufficient for solving a set of challenging temporal learning tasks that a
traditional SNN fails to solve, even in the presence of significant noise.
These networks are also shown to be capable of producing locomotion on a
high-dimensional robotic learning task, where near-minimal degradation in
performance is observed in the presence of novel conditions not seen during the
initial training period.

<p>Deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present optimization difficulties for
gradient-based approaches due to discrete binary activation and complex
spatial-temporal dynamics. Considering the huge success of ResNet in deep
learning, it would be natural to train deep SNNs with residual learning.
Previous Spiking ResNet mimics the standard residual block in ANNs and simply
replaces ReLU activation layers with spiking neurons, which suffers the
degradation problem and can hardly implement residual learning. In this paper,
we propose the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in
deep SNNs. We prove that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping
and overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet. We
evaluate our SEW ResNet on ImageNet and DVS Gesture datasets, and show that SEW
ResNet outperforms the state-of-the-art directly trained SNNs in both accuracy
and time-steps. Moreover, SEW ResNet can achieve higher performance by simply
adding more layers, providing a simple method to train deep SNNs. To our best
knowledge, this is the first time that directly training deep SNNs with more
than 100 layers becomes possible.

<p>Recording brain activity during speech production using magnetoencephalography (MEG) can help us to understand the dynamics of speech production. However, these measurements are challenging due to the induced artifacts coming from several sources such as facial muscle activity, lower jaw and head movements. Here, we aimed to characterize speech-related artifacts, focusing on head movements, and subsequently present an approach to remove these artifacts from MEG data. We recorded MEG from 11 healthy participants while they pronounced various syllables in different loudness. Head positions/orientations were extracted during speech production to investigate its role in MEG distortions. Finally, we present an artifact rejection approach using the combination of regression analysis and signal space projection (SSP) in order to correct the induced artifact from MEG data. Our results show that louder speech leads to stronger head movements and stronger MEG distortions. Our proposed artifact rejection approach could successfully remove the speech-related artifact and retrieve the underlying neurophysiological signals. As the presented artifact rejection approach was shown to remove artifacts arising from head movements, induced by overt speech in the MEG, it will facilitate research addressing the neural basis of speech production with MEG.</p>

Aim<p>In PET imaging, the different types of radiotracers and accumulations, as well as the diversity of disease patterns, make the analysis of molecular imaging data acquired in vivo challenging. Here, we evaluate and validate a semi-automated MRI template-based data analysis tool that allows preclinical PET images to be aligned to a self-created PET template. Based on the user-defined volume-of-interest (VOI), image data can then be evaluated using three different semi-quantitative parameters: normalized activity, standardized uptake value, and uptake ratio.</p>Materials and Methods<p>The nuclear medicine Data Processing Analysis tool (NU_DPA) was implemented in Matlab. Testing and validation of the tool was performed using two types of radiotracers in different kinds of stroke-related brain diseases in rat models. The radiotracers used are 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG), a metabolic tracer with symmetrical distribution in brain, and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, a target-selective radioligand specifically binding to p-selectin. After manual image import, the NU_DPA tool automatically creates an averaged PET template out of the acquired PET images, to which all PET images are then aligned onto. The added MRI template-based information, resized to the lower PET resolution, defines the VOI and also allows a precise subdivision of the VOI into individual sub-regions. The aligned PET images can then be evaluated semi-quantitatively for all regions defined in the MRI atlas. In addition, a statistical analysis and evaluation of the semi-quantitative parameters can then be performed in the NU_DPA tool.</p>Results<p>Using ischemic stroke data in Wistar rats as an example, the statistical analysis of the tool should be demonstrated. In this [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET experiment, three different experimental states were compared: healthy control state, ischemic stroke without electrical stimulation, ischemic stroke with electrical stimulation. Thereby, statistical data evaluation using the NU_DPA tool showed that the glucose metabolism in a photothrombotic lesion can be influenced by electrical stimulation.</p>Conclusion<p>Our NU_DPA tool allows a very flexible data evaluation of small animal PET data in vivo including statistical data evaluation. Using the radiotracers [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG and [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-Fucoidan, it was shown that the semi-automatic MRI-template based data analysis of the NU_DPA tool is potentially suitable for both metabolic radiotracers as well as target-selective radiotracers.</p>

<p>Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) is a key factor to obtain good surgical outcome for refractory epilepsy patients. However, no technique, so far, can precisely locate the EZ, and there are barely any reports on the combined application of multiple technologies to improve the localization accuracy of the EZ. In this study, we aimed to explore the use of a multimodal method combining PET-MRI, fluid and white matter suppression (FLAWS)—a novel MRI sequence, and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) automated analysis to delineate EZ. We retrospectively collected 15 patients with refractory epilepsy who underwent surgery and used the above three methods to detect abnormal brain areas of all patients. We compared the PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFO results with traditional methods to evaluate their diagnostic value. The sensitivities, specificities of locating the EZ, and marking extent removed versus not removed [RatioChann(ev)] of each method were compared with surgical outcome. We also tested the possibility of using different combinations to locate the EZ. The marked areas in every patient established using each method were also compared to determine the correlations among the three methods. The results showed that PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs can provide more information about potential epileptic areas than traditional methods. When detecting the EZs, the sensitivities of PET-MRI, FLAWS, and HFOs were 68.75, 53.85, and 87.50%, and the specificities were 80.00, 33.33, and 100.00%. The RatioChann(ev) of HFO-marked contacts was significantly higher in patients with good outcome than those with poor outcome (p&lt; 0.05). When intracranial electrodes covered all the abnormal areas indicated by neuroimaging with the overlapping EZs being completely removed referred to HFO analysis, patients could reach seizure-free (p &lt; 0.01). The periphery of the lesion marked by neuroimaging may be epileptic, but not every lesion contributes to seizures. Therefore, approaches in multimodality can detect EZ more accurately, and HFO analysis may help in defining real epileptic areas that may be missed in the neuroimaging results. The implantation of intracranial electrodes guided by non-invasive PET-MRI and FLAWS findings as well as HFO analysis would be an optimized multimodal approach for locating EZ.</p>

Background<p>Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating motor deficit in a subset of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients that is poorly responsive to levodopa or deep brain stimulation (DBS) of established PD targets. The proposal of a DBS target in the midbrain, known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), to address FOG was based on its observed neuropathology in PD and its hypothesized involvement in locomotor control as a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). Initial reports of PPN DBS were met with enthusiasm; however, subsequent studies reported mixed results. A closer review of the MLR basic science literature, suggests that the closely related cuneiform nucleus (CnF), dorsal to the PPN, may be a superior site to promote gait. Although suspected to have a conserved role in the control of gait in humans, deliberate stimulation of a homolog to the CnF in humans using directional DBS electrodes has not been attempted.</p>Methods<p>As part of an open-label Phase 1 clinical study, one PD patient with predominantly axial symptoms and severe FOG refractory to levodopa therapy was implanted with directional DBS electrodes (Boston Science Vercise Cartesia<sup>TM</sup>) targeting the CnF bilaterally. Since the CnF is a poorly defined reticular nucleus, targeting was guided both by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and anatomical landmarks. Intraoperative stimulation and microelectrode recordings were performed near the targets with leg EMG surface recordings in the subject.</p>Results<p>Post-operative imaging revealed accurate targeting of both leads to the designated CnF. Intraoperative stimulation near the target at low thresholds in the awake patient evoked involuntary electromyography (EMG) oscillations in the legs with a peak power at the stimulation frequency, similar to observations with CnF DBS in animals. Oscillopsia was the primary side effect evoked at higher currents, especially when directed posterolaterally. Directional DBS could mitigate oscillopsia.</p>Conclusion<p>DTI-based targeting and intraoperative stimulation to evoke limb EMG activity may be useful methods to help target the CnF accurately and safely in patients. Long term follow-up and detailed gait testing of patients undergoing CnF stimulation will be necessary to confirm the effects on FOG.</p>Clinical Trial Registration<p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04218526.</p>

Objectives<p>To investigate the improvement effect of occipital repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with escitalopram oxalate tablets on pre-attentive processing in patients with first-episode, medication-naive depression.</p>Methods<p>Patients who were hospitalized between January and December 2019 were selected. They were randomly allocated to real occipital rTMS stimulation group with 27 cases receiving intermittent theta-burst (iTBS) and sham stimulation group with 24 cases over 20 days. The rTMS treatment target is located at the Oz point of the occipital region. Both groups took escitalopram oxalate tablets, and the average daily drug dose was 15.294 ± 5.041 mg. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess the symptoms of depression before and after treatment, and mismatch negativity (MMN) was used to assess the improvement of pre-attentive processing before and after treatment.</p>Results<p>After 20 days of treatment, the total score of HAMD (13.495 ± 3.700) in both groups was significantly lower than that before treatment [21.910 ± 3.841, F(1, 49) = 46, 3.690, p &lt; 0.001]. After treatment, the latency of MMN in the real stimulation group (182.204 ± 31.878 ms) was significantly lower than that in the sham stimulation group (219.896 ± 42.634 ms, p &lt; 0.001), and the amplitude of MMN in the real stimulation group (−7.107 ± 3.374 ms) was significantly higher than that in the sham stimulation group (−2.773 ± 3.7 32 ms, p &lt; 0.001).</p>Conclusion<p>Occipital rTMS treatment can enhance the early therapeutic effect and effectively improve the pre-attentive processing of patients with depression and provide a scientific basis for the new target of rTMS therapy in clinical patients with depression.</p>

<p>Essential tremor (ET) is a highly prevalent neurological disorder characterized by action-induced tremors involving the hand, voice, head, and/or face. Importantly, hand tremor is present in nearly all forms of ET, resulting in impaired fine motor skills and diminished quality of life. To advance early diagnostic approaches for ET, automated handwriting tasks and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer an opportunity to develop early essential clinical biomarkers. In this study, we present a novel approach for the early clinical diagnosis and monitoring of ET based on integrating handwriting and neuroimaging analysis. We demonstrate how the analysis of fine motor skills, as measured by an automated Archimedes’ spiral task, is correlated with neuroimaging biomarkers for ET. Together, we present a novel modeling approach that can serve as a complementary and promising support tool for the clinical diagnosis of ET and a large range of tremors.</p>

<p>Ocular activity is known to be sensitive to variations in mental workload, and recent studies have successfully related the distribution of eye fixations to the mental load. This study aimed to verify the effectiveness of the spatial distribution of fixations as a measure of mental workload and its sensitivity to different types of demands imposed by the task: mental, temporal, and physical. To test the research hypothesis, two experimental studies were run: Experiment 1 evaluated the sensitivity of an index of spatial distribution (Nearest Neighbor Index; NNI) to changes in workload. A sample of 30 participants participated in a within-subject design with different types of task demands (mental, temporal, physical) applied to Tetris game; Experiment 2 investigated the accuracy of the index through the analysis of 1-min epochs during the execution of a visual-spatial task (the “spot the differences” puzzle game). Additionally, NNI was compared to a better-known ocular mental workload index, the entropy rate. The data analysis showed a relation between the NNI and the different workload levels imposed by the tasks. In particular: Experiment 1 demonstrated that increased difficulty, due to higher temporal demand, led to a more dispersed pattern with respect to the baseline, whereas the mental demand led to a more grouped pattern of fixations with respect to the baseline; Experiment 2 indicated that the entropy rate and the NNI show a similar pattern over time, indicating high mental workload after the first minute of activity. That suggests that NNI highlights the greater presence of fixation groups and, accordingly, the entropy indicates a more regular and orderly scanpath. Both indices are sensitive to changes in workload and they seem to anticipate the drop in performance. However, the entropy rate is limited by the use of the areas of interest, making it impossible to apply it in dynamic contexts. Conversely, NNI works with the entire scanpath and it shows sensitivity to different types of task demands. These results confirm the NNI as a measure applicable to different contexts and its potential use as a trigger in adaptive systems implemented in high-risk settings, such as control rooms and transportation systems.</p>

<p>High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples 80–250 Hz, fast ripples 250–500 Hz) are biomarkers of epileptic tissue. They are most commonly observed over areas generating seizures and increase in occurrence during the ictal compared to the interictal period. It has been hypothesized that their rate correlates with the severity of epilepsy and seizure in affected individuals. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate whether the HFO count mirrors the observed behavioral seizure severity using a kainate rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizures were selected during the chronic epilepsy phase of this model and classified by behavioral severity according to the Racine scale. Seizures with Racine scale 5&amp;6 were considered generalized and severe. HFOs were marked in 24 seizures during a preictal, ictal, and postictal EEG segment. The duration covered by the HFO during these different segments was analyzed and compared between mild and severe seizures. HFOs were significantly increased during ictal periods (p &lt; 0.001) and significantly decreased during postictal periods (p &lt; 0.03) compared to the ictal segment. Ictal ripples (p = 0.04) as well as fast ripples (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in severe seizures compared to mild seizures. The present study demonstrates that ictal HFO occurrence mirrors seizure severity in a chronic focal epilepsy model in rats. This is similar to recent observations in patients with refractory mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, postictal HFO decrease might reflect postictal inhibition of epileptic activity. Overall results provide additional evidence that HFOs can be used as biomarkers for measuring seizure severity in epilepsy.</p>

<p>Illusions give intriguing insights into perceptual and neural dynamics. In the auditory continuity illusion, two brief tones separated by a silent gap may be heard as one continuous tone if a noise burst with appropriate characteristics fills the gap. This illusion probes the conditions under which listeners link related sounds across time and maintain perceptual continuity in the face of sudden changes in sound mixtures. Conceptual explanations of this illusion have been proposed, but its neural basis is still being investigated. In this work we provide a dynamical systems framework, grounded in principles of neural dynamics, to explain the continuity illusion. We construct an idealized firing rate model of a neural population and analyze the conditions under which firing rate responses persist during the interruption between the two tones. First, we show that sustained inputs and hysteresis dynamics (a mismatch between tone levels needed to activate and inactivate the population) can produce continuous responses. Second, we show that transient inputs and bistable dynamics (coexistence of two stable firing rate levels) can also produce continuous responses. Finally, we combine these input types together to obtain neural dynamics consistent with two requirements for the continuity illusion as articulated in a well-known theory of auditory scene analysis: responses persist through the noise-filled gap if noise provides sufficient evidence that the tone continues and if there is no evidence of discontinuities between the tones and noise. By grounding these notions in a quantitative model that incorporates elements of neural circuits (recurrent excitation, and mutual inhibition, specifically), we identify plausible mechanisms for the continuity illusion. Our findings can help guide future studies of neural correlates of this illusion and inform development of more biophysically-based models of the auditory continuity illusion.</p>

<p>The microbiota plays important roles in host metabolism and immunity, and its disruption affects adult brain physiology and behavior. Although such findings have been attributed to altered neurodevelopment, few studies have actually examined microbiota effects on the developing brain. This review focuses on developmental effects of the earliest exposure to microbes. At birth, the mammalian fetus enters a world teeming with microbes which colonize all body sites in contact with the environment. Bacteria reach the gut within a few hours of birth and cause a measurable response in the intestinal epithelium. In adults, the gut microbiota signals to the brain via the vagus nerve, bacterial metabolites, hormones, and immune signaling, and work in perinatal rodents is beginning to elucidate which of these signaling pathways herald the very first encounter with gut microbes in the neonate. Neural effects of the microbiota during the first few days of life include changes in neuronal cell death, microglia, and brain cytokine levels. In addition to these effects of direct exposure of the newborn to microbes, accumulating evidence points to a role for the maternal microbiota in affecting brain development via bacterial molecules and metabolites while the offspring is still in utero. Hence, perturbations to microbial exposure perinatally, such as through C-section delivery or antibiotic treatment, alter microbiota colonization and may have long-term neural consequences. The perinatal period is critical for brain development and a close look at microbiota effects during this time promises to reveal the earliest, most primary effects of the microbiota on neurodevelopment.</p>

<p>The striatum participates in numerous important behaviors. Its principal projection neurons use GABA and peptides as neurotransmitters and interact extensively with interneurons, including cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) that are tonically active. Dissecting the interactions between projection neurons and ChIs is important for uncovering the role and mechanisms of the striatal microcircuits. Here, by combining several optogenetic tools with cell type-specific electrophysiological recordings, we uncovered direct electrical coupling between D1-type projection neurons and ChIs, in addition to the chemical transmission between these two major cell types. Optogenetic stimulation or inhibition led to bilateral current exchanges between D1 neurons and ChIs, which can be abolished by gap junction blockers. We further confirmed the presence of gap junctions through paired electrophysiological recordings and dye microinjections. Finally, we found that activating D1 neurons promotes basal activity of ChIs via gap junctions. Collectively, these results reveal the coexistence of the chemical synapse and gap junctions between D1 neurons and ChIs, which contributes to maintaining the tonically active firing patterns of ChIs.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases. However, the impact of ischemic stroke on human cerebral tissue remains largely unknown due to a lack of ischemic human brain samples. In this study, we applied cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to evaluate the effect of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Pathway analysis showed the relationships between vitamin digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, and complement and coagulation cascades. Combinational verification with transcriptome and gene expression analysis of different cell types revealed fatty acids-related PPAR signaling pathway and pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) as key markers of neuronal cells in response to OGD/R. These findings suggest that, although there remain some limitations to be improved, our ischemic stroke model using human cerebral organoids would be a potentially useful tool when combined with other conventional two-dimensional (2D) mono-culture systems.</p>

<p>Early life stress has profound effects on the development of the central nervous system. We exposed 9-day-old rat pups to a 24 h maternal deprivation (MD) and sacrificed them as young adults (60-day-old), with the aim to study the effects of early stress on forebrain circuitry. We estimated numbers of various immunohistochemically defined interneuron subpopulations in several neocortical regions and in the hippocampus. MD rats showed reduced numbers of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex, compared with controls. Numbers of reelin-expressing and calretinin-expressing interneurons were also reduced in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, but unaltered in the neocortex of MD rats. The number of calbinin-expressing interneurons in the neocortex was similar in the MD rats compared with controls. We analyzed cell death in 15-day-old rats after MD and found no difference compared to control rats. Thus, our results more likely reflect the downregulation of markers than the actual loss of interneurons. To investigate synaptic activity in the hippocampus we immunostained for glutamatergic and inhibitory vesicular transporters. The number of inhibitory synapses was decreased in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in MD rats, with the normal number of excitatory synapses. Our results indicate complex, cell type-specific, and region-specific alterations in the inhibitory circuitry induced by maternal deprivation. Such alterations may underlie symptoms of MD at the behavioral level and possibly contribute to mechanisms by which early life stress causes neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and morbidity. In recent years, reperfusion treatments based on thrombolytic and thrombectomy are major managements for ischemic stroke patients, and the recanalization time window has been extended to over 24 h. However, with the extension of the time window, the risk of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury following reperfusion therapy becomes a big challenge for patient outcomes. I/R injury leads to neuronal death due to the imbalance in metabolic supply and demand, which is usually related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitophagy is a type of selective autophagy referring to the process of specific autophagic elimination of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria to prevent the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent cell death. Recent advances have implicated the protective role of mitophagy in cerebral ischemia is mainly associated with its neuroprotective effects in I/R injury. This review discusses the involvement of mitochondria dynamics and mitophagy in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and I/R injury in particular, focusing on the therapeutic potential of mitophagy regulation and the possibility of using mitophagy-related interventions as an adjunctive approach for neuroprotective time window extension after ischemic stroke.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the complex interaction of multiple mechanisms. Recent studies examining the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the AD phenotype have demonstrated a significant influence on both inflammation and cognition. However, different studies on the effect of high-fat diet on AD pathology have reported conflicting conclusions. To explore the involvement of HFD in AD, we investigated phenotypic and metabolic changes in an AD mouse model in response to HFD. The results indicated there was no significant effect on Aβ levels or contextual memory due to HFD treatment. Of note, HFD did moderate neuroinflammation, despite spurring inflammation and increasing cholesterol levels in the periphery. In addition, diet affected gut microbiota symbiosis, altering the production of bacterial metabolites. HFD created a favorable microenvironment for bile acid alteration and arachidonic acid metabolism in APP/PS1 mice, which may be related to the observed improvement in LXR/PPAR expression. Our previous research demonstrated that Huanglian Jiedu decoction (HLJDD) significantly ameliorated impaired learning and memory. Furthermore, HLJDD may globally suppress inflammation and lipid accumulation to relieve cognitive impairment after HFD intervention. It was difficult to define the effect of HFD on AD progression because the results were influenced by confounding factors and biases. Although there was still obvious damage in AD mice treated with HFD, there was no deterioration and there was even a slight remission of neuroinflammation. Moreover, HLJDD represents a potential AD drug based on its anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects.</p>

<p>MAP2K5, a member of the MAPK family, is associated with central nervous system disorders. However, neural functional of Map2k5 from animal models were not well examined so far. Here, we established a Map2k5-targeted knockout mouse model to investigate the behavior phenotypes and its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results showed that female Map2k5 mutant mice manifested decreased circadian-dependent ambulatory locomotion, coordination, and fatigue. Male Map2k5 mutant mice displayed impairment in open field exploration and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle response (ASR) when compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, Map2k5 mutant mice showed a decreased dopaminergic cell survival and tyrosine hydroxylase levels in nigrostriatal pathway, indicating a crucial role of MAP2K5 in regulating dopamine system in the central nervous system. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that Map2k5 mutant mice displayed phenotypes by disturbing the dopamine system in the central nervous system, implicating Map2k5 mutant mouse as a promising model for many dopamine related disorders.</p>

<p>by Gonca Erdemci-Tandogan, M. Lisa Manning</p>

Large-scale tissue deformation during biological processes such as morphogenesis requires cellular rearrangements. The simplest rearrangement in confluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells, called a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must execute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion molecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time compared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this idea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1 transitions, which we call the “T1 delay time”. We study how variations in T1 delay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of tissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based timescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show that the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale collective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two. We extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent extension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1 delay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and rosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a more elastic-like—and less fluid-like—tissue response. Our work suggests that molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen global tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6fEXLvSFyso" width="1" />

Divisive normalization (DN) is a prominent computational building block in the brain that has been proposed as a canonical cortical operation. Numerous experimental studies have verified its importance for capturing nonlinear neural response properties to simple, artificial stimuli, and computational studies suggest that DN is also an important component for processing natural stimuli. However, we lack quantitative models of DN that are directly informed by measurements of spiking responses in the brain and applicable to arbitrary stimuli. Here, we propose a DN model that is applicable to arbitrary input images. We test its ability to predict how neurons in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) respond to natural images, with a focus on nonlinear response properties within the classical receptive field. Our model consists of one layer of subunits followed by learned orientation-specific DN. It outperforms linear-nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations and makes a significant step towards the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Unlike deep CNNs, our compact DN model offers a direct interpretation of the nature of normalization. By inspecting the learned normalization pool of our model, we gained insights into a long-standing question about the tuning properties of DN that update the current textbook description: we found that within the receptive field oriented features were normalized preferentially by features with similar orientation rather than non-specifically as currently assumed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YVhoXxf95tQ" width="1" />

Adaptive cognitive-control involves a hierarchical cortico-striatal gating system that supports selective updating, maintenance, and retrieval of useful cognitive and motor information. Here, we developed a task that independently manipulates selective gating operations into working-memory (input gating), from working-memory (output gating), and of responses (motor gating) and tested the neural dynamics and computational principles that support them. Increases in gating demands, captured by gate switches, were expressed by distinct EEG correlates at each gating level that evolved dynamically in partially overlapping time windows. Further, categorical representations of specific maintained items and of motor responses could be decoded from EEG when the corresponding gate was switching, thereby linking gating operations to prioritization. Finally, gate switching at all levels was related to increases in the motor decision threshold as quantified by the drift diffusion model. Together these results support the notion that cognitive gating operations scaffold on top of mechanisms involved in motor gating.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v7U_RTY-wRA" width="1" />

<p>Modularity of neural networks -- both biological and artificial -- can be
thought of either structurally or functionally, and the relationship between
these is an open question. We show that enforcing structural modularity via
sparse connectivity between two dense sub-networks which need to communicate to
solve the task leads to functional specialization of the sub-networks, but only
at extreme levels of sparsity. With even a moderate number of interconnections,
the sub-networks become functionally entangled. Defining functional
specialization is in itself a challenging problem without a universally agreed
solution. To address this, we designed three different measures of
specialization (based on weight masks, retraining and correlation) and found
them to qualitatively agree. Our results have implications in both neuroscience
and machine learning. For neuroscience, it shows that we cannot conclude that
there is functional modularity simply by observing moderate levels of
structural modularity: knowing the brain's connectome is not sufficient for
understanding how it breaks down into functional modules. For machine learning,
using structure to promote functional modularity -- which may be important for
robustness and generalization -- may require extremely narrow bottlenecks
between modules.

objective, GAN remains one of the least understood deep learning models. In
this work, we formally study how GANs can efficiently learn certain
hierarchically generated distributions that are close to the distribution of
images in practice. We prove that when a distribution has a structure that we
refer to as Forward Super-Resolution, then simply training generative
adversarial networks using gradient descent ascent (GDA) can indeed learn this
distribution efficiently, both in terms of sample and time complexities. We
also provide concrete empirical evidence that not only our assumption "forward
super-resolution" is very natural in practice, but also the underlying learning
mechanisms that we study in this paper (to allow us efficiently train GAN via
GDA in theory) simulates the actual learning process of GANs in practice on
real-world problems.

<p>We derive gain-tuning rules for the positive and negative spatial-feedback
loops of a spatially-distributed filter to change the resolution of its spatial
band-pass characteristic accordingly to a wavelet zoom, while preserving
temporal stability. The filter design is inspired by the canonical spatial
feedback structure of the primary visual cortex and is motivated by
understanding attentional control of visual resolution. Besides biology, our
control-theoretical design strategy is relevant for the development of
neuromorphic multiresolution distributed sensors through the feedback
interconnection of elementary spatial transfer functions and gain tuning.

<p>The tremendous energy consumption of deep neural networks (DNNs) has become a
serious problem in deep learning. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic
the operations in the human brain, have been studied as prominent
energy-efficient neural networks. Due to their event-driven and
spatiotemporally sparse operations, SNNs show possibilities for
energy-efficient processing. To unlock their potential, deep SNNs have adopted
temporal coding such as time-to-first-spike (TTFS)coding, which represents the
information between neurons by the first spike time. With TTFS coding, each
neuron generates one spike at most, which leads to a significant improvement in
energy efficiency. Several studies have successfully introduced TTFS coding in
deep SNNs, but they showed restricted efficiency improvement owing to the lack
of consideration for efficiency during training. To address the aforementioned
issue, this paper presents training methods for energy-efficient deep SNNs with
TTFS coding. We introduce a surrogate DNN model to train the deep SNN in a
feasible time and analyze the effect of the temporal kernel on training
performance and efficiency. Based on the investigation, we propose
stochastically relaxed activation and initial value-based regularization for
the temporal kernel parameters. In addition, to reduce the number of spikes
even further, we present temporal kernel-aware batch normalization. With the
proposed methods, we could achieve comparable training results with
significantly reduced spikes, which could lead to energy-efficient deep SNNs.

<p>Artificial Neural networks are mathematical models at their core. This
truismpresents some fundamental difficulty when networks are tasked with
Natural Language Processing. A key problem lies in measuring the similarity or
distance among vectors in NLP embedding space, since the mathematical concept
of distance does not always agree with the linguistic concept. We suggest that
the best way to measure linguistic distance among vectors is by employing the
Language Model (LM) that created them. We introduce Language Model Distance
(LMD) for measuring accuracy of vector transformations based on the
Distributional Hypothesis ( LMD Accuracy ). We show the efficacy of this metric
by applying it to a simple neural network learning the Procrustes algorithm for
bilingual word mapping.

<p>We propose a novel strategy for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) based on
Bregman iterations. Starting from a sparse neural network our gradient-based
one-shot algorithm gradually adds relevant parameters in an inverse scale space
manner. This allows the network to choose the best architecture in the search
space which makes it well-designed for a given task, e.g., by adding neurons or

instance, residual autoencoders for denoising, deblurring, and classification
tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/TimRoith/BregmanLearning.

<p>Over the years motor deficit in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients was largely
studied, however, no consistent pattern of relations between quantitative
electroencephalography (qEEG) and motor scales emerged. There is a general lack
of information on the relation between EEG changes and scales related to
specific motor deficits. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the relation
between brain oscillatory activity alterations (EEG power bands) and most used
PD-related motor deficit scales. A positive correlation was found between the
freezing of the gait questionnaire (FOGQ) and delta spectral power band
(rho=0.67; p=0.008), while a negative correlation with the same scale was
observed in the alpha spectral power band (rho=-0.59, p=0.027). Additionally,
motor scores measure by motor part of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) correlated directly with theta (rho=0.55, p=0.040) and inversely with
beta EEG power band (rho=-0.77, p=0.001). No significant correlation was found
between spectral powers and Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y), BERG (Berg K. et. al. 1995),
Modified Parkinson Activity Scale (MPAS), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and Timed
Up and Go Test (TUG). In conclusion, our study supports the earlier findings
suggesting a link between EEG slowing and motor decline, providing more insight
into the relation between EEG alteration and deficits in different motor
domains. These findings indicate that EEG assessment may be a useful biomarker
for objective monitoring of progression and neurophysiological effect of
rehabilitation approaches in PD's.

<p>This work tackles the problem of temporally coherent face anonymization in
natural video streams.We propose JaGAN, a two-stage system starting with
detecting and masking out faces with black image patches in all individual
frames of the video. The second stage leverages a privacy-preserving Video
Generative Adversarial Network designed to inpaint the missing image patches
with artificially generated faces. Our initial experiments reveal that image
based generative models are not capable of inpainting patches showing temporal
coherent appearance across neighboring video frames. To address this issue we
introduce a newly curated video collection, which is made publicly available
for the research community along with this paper. We also introduce the
Identity Invariance Score IdI as a means to quantify temporal coherency between
neighboring frames.

<p>We present a novel framework for designing multiplierless kernel machines
that can be used on resource-constrained platforms like intelligent edge
devices. The framework uses a piecewise linear (PWL) approximation based on a
margin propagation (MP) technique and uses only addition/subtraction, shift,
comparison, and register underflow/overflow operations. We propose a
hardware-friendly MP-based inference and online training algorithm that has
been optimized for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. Our FPGA
implementation eliminates the need for DSP units and reduces the number of
LUTs. By reusing the same hardware for inference and training, we show that the
platform can overcome classification errors and local minima artifacts that
result from the MP approximation. Using the FPGA platform, we also show that
the proposed multiplierless MP-kernel machine demonstrates superior performance
in terms of power, performance, and area compared to other comparable
implementations.

<p>The peaky behavior of CTC models is well known experimentally. However, an
understanding about why peaky behavior occurs is missing, and whether this is a
good property. We provide a formal analysis of the peaky behavior and gradient
descent convergence properties of the CTC loss and related training criteria.
Our analysis provides a deep understanding why peaky behavior occurs and when
it is suboptimal. On a simple example which should be trivial to learn for any
model, we prove that a feed-forward neural network trained with CTC from
uniform initialization converges towards peaky behavior with a 100% error rate.
Our analysis further explains why CTC only works well together with the blank
label. We further demonstrate that peaky behavior does not occur on other
related losses including a label prior model, and that this improves
convergence.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Learning and memory are one of those frontier areas of neurobiology which attract us to investigate the intricacy of this process. Here, we aimed to investigate the general mechanism of “Behavioural Tagging and Capture” in long term memory (LTM) formation and to find the key factors playing role in consolidation of LTM. In this study, we’ve shown that not only plasticity related proteins (PRPs) but neurotransmitters and immediate early genes (IEGs) also play an important role in memory formation process. It’s very well evident that memory traces can last longer if close in time novelty is introduced around memory encoding. Here our results point out that this novelty exploration acts as a modulator in memory consolidation by providing PRPs such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), enhancing neurotransmitters (Dopamine), IEGs (cFos) and some enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO), sodium–potassium ATPase (Na<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>K<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-ATPase). Therefore, by using a Novel Object Recognition task (NOR) in combination with novel task exposure, we evaluated the role of molecular markers in memory consolidation employing a behavioural tagging model. The purpose of the current study was first to evaluate the effect of novelty exposure around a single trail of NOR task in a critical time window on memory consolidation in rats after 24 h and second to determine the expression of BDNF, CREB, c-fos, AChE, MAO, Na<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>K<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-ATPase as potential markers in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during memory formation. In the present study, to identify and validate the role of these molecular signatures in memory consolidation, infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor Anisomycin (Ani) was done around the training session that causes a deficit in the formation of LTM when tested 24 h after weak encoding. Altogether, here we are providing the first comprehensive set of evidences indicating that BDNF, CREB, dopamine, some enzymes and c-fos role in modulating LTM by employing behavioural tagging model.</p>

<p>The purinergic 2X<sub>7</sub> (P2X<sub>7</sub>) receptor expressed in satellite glial cells (SGCs) is involved in the inflammatory response, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in the process of neurogenic inflammation, such as that in diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) and peripheral neuralgia. The main purpose of this study was to explore the role of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor in DNP hypersensitivity mediated by TRPV1 in the rat and its possible mechanism. A rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related neuropathic pain (NPP) named the DNP rat model was established in this study. The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of DNP rats were increased after intrathecal injection of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonist A438079, and the mRNA and protein levels of TRPV1 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) were decreased in DNP rats treated with A438079 compared to untreated DNP rats; in addition, A438079 also decreased the phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the DNP group. Based on these results, the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor might be involved in DNP mediated by TRPV1.</p>

<p>With the arrival of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the challenges arising from Big Data, neuromorphic chip concepts are seen as key solutions for coping with the massive amount of unstructured data streams by moving the computation closer to the sensors, the so-called “edge computing.” Augmenting these chips with emerging memory technologies enables these edge devices with non-volatile and adaptive properties which are desirable for low power and online learning operations. However, an energy- and area-efficient realization of these systems requires disruptive hardware changes. Memristor-based solutions for these concepts are in the focus of research and industry due to their low-power and high-density online learning potential. Specifically, the filamentary-type valence change mechanism (VCM memories) have shown to be a promising candidate In consequence, physical models capturing a broad spectrum of experimentally observed features such as the pronounced cycle-to-cycle (c2c) and device-to-device (d2d) variability are required for accurate evaluation of the proposed concepts. In this study, we present an in-depth experimental analysis of d2d and c2c variability of filamentary-type bipolar switching HfO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>x</sub> nano-sized crossbar devices and match the experimentally observed variabilities to our physically motivated JART VCM compact model. Based on this approach, we evaluate the concept of parallel operation of devices as a synapse both experimentally and theoretically. These parallel synapses form a synaptic array which is at the core of neuromorphic chips. We exploit the c2c variability of these devices for stochastic online learning which has shown to increase the effective bit precision of the devices. Finally, we demonstrate that stochastic switching features for a pattern classification task that can be employed in an online learning neural network.</p>

<p>In patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy, electrical stimulation from intracranial electrodes is frequently used for the localization of seizure onset zones and related pathological networks. The ability of electrically stimulated tissue to generate beta and gamma range oscillations, called rapid-discharges, is a frequent indication of an epileptogenic zone. However, a limit of intracranial stimulation is the fixed physical location and number of implanted electrodes, leaving numerous clinically and functionally relevant brain regions unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an alternative technique relying exclusively on non-penetrating surface electrodes, namely an orientation-tunable form of temporally interfering (TI) electric fields to target the CA3 of the mouse hippocampus which focally evokes seizure-like events (SLEs) having the characteristic frequencies of rapid-discharges, but without the necessity of the implanted electrodes. The orientation of the topical electrodes with respect to the orientation of the hippocampus is demonstrated to strongly control the threshold for evoking SLEs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Pulse-width-modulation of square waves as an alternative to sine waves for TI stimulation. An orientation-dependent analysis of classic implanted electrodes to evoke SLEs in the hippocampus is subsequently utilized to support the results of the minimally invasive temporally interfering fields. The principles of orientation-tunable TI stimulation seen here can be generally applicable in a wide range of other excitable tissues and brain regions, overcoming several limitations of fixed electrodes which penetrate tissue and overcoming several limitations of other non-invasive stimulation methods in epilepsy, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</p>

<p>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) coupled to robotic assistive devices have shown promise for the rehabilitation of stroke patients. However, little has been reported that compares the clinical and physiological effects of a BCI intervention for upper limb stroke rehabilitation with those of conventional therapy. This study assesses the feasibility of an intervention with a BCI based on electroencephalography (EEG) coupled to a robotic hand orthosis for upper limb stroke rehabilitation and compares its outcomes to conventional therapy. Seven subacute and three chronic stroke patients (M = 59.9 ± 12.8) with severe upper limb impairment were recruited in a crossover feasibility study to receive 1 month of BCI therapy and 1 month of conventional therapy in random order. The outcome measures were comprised of: Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), hand dynamometry, and EEG. Additionally, BCI performance and user experience were measured. All measurements were acquired before and after each intervention. FMA-UE and ARAT after BCI (23.1 ± 16; 8.4 ± 10) and after conventional therapy (21.9 ± 15; 8.7 ± 11) were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.017) compared to baseline (17.5 ± 15; 4.3 ± 6) but were similar between therapies (p &gt; 0.017). Via TMS, corticospinal tract integrity could be assessed in the affected hemisphere of three patients at baseline, in five after BCI, and four after conventional therapy. While no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) was found in patients’ affected hand strength, it was higher after the BCI therapy. EEG cortical activations were significantly higher over motor and non-motor regions after both therapies (p &lt; 0.017). System performance increased across BCI sessions, from 54 (50, 70%) to 72% (56, 83%). Patients reported moderate mental workloads and excellent usability with the BCI. Outcome measurements implied that a BCI intervention using a robotic hand orthosis as feedback has the potential to elicit neuroplasticity-related mechanisms, similar to those observed during conventional therapy, even in a group of severely impaired stroke patients. Therefore, the proposed BCI system could be a suitable therapy option and will be further assessed in clinical trials.</p>

<p>The presence of iron is an important factor for normal brain functions, whereas excessive deposition of iron may impair normal cognitive function in the brain and lead to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). MRI has been widely applied to characterize brain structural and functional changes caused by AD. However, the effectiveness of using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for the analysis of brain iron deposition is still unclear, especially within the context of early AD diagnosis. Thus, in this study, we aim to explore the relationship between brain iron deposition measured by SWI with the progression of AD using various feature selection and classification methods. The proposed model was evaluated on a 69-subject SWI imaging dataset consisting of 24 AD patients, 21 mild cognitive impairment patients, and 24 normal controls. The identified AD progression-related regions were then compared with the regions reported from previous genetic association studies, and we observed considerable overlap between these two. Further, we have identified a new potential AD-related gene (MEF2C) closely related to the interaction between iron deposition and AD progression in the brain.</p>

<p>With the development of electrical stimulation technology, traditional transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) technology has been found to have the drawback of not targeting a specific area accurately. Studies have shown that optimizing the number and position of electrodes during electrical stimulation has a very good effect on enhancing brain stimulation accuracy. At present, an increasing number of laboratories have begun to optimize tACS. However, there has been no study summarizing the optimization methods of tACS. Determining whether different optimization methods are effective and the optimization approach could provide information that could guide future tACS research. We describe the results of recent research on tACS optimization and integrate the optimization approaches of tACS in recent research. Optimization approaches can be classified into two groups: high-definition electrical stimulation and interference modulation electrical stimulation. The optimization methods can be divided into five categories: high-definition tACS, phase-shifted tACS, amplitude-modulated tACS, the temporally interfering (TI) method, and the intersectional short pulse (ISP) method. Finally, we summarize the latest research on hardware useful for tACS improvement and outline future directions.</p>

<p>An expansion of the corticothalamic transfer function into eigenmodes and resonant poles is used to derive a simple formula for evoked response potentials (ERPs) in various states of arousal. The transfer function corresponds to the cortical response to an external stimulus, which encodes all the information and properties of the linear system. This approach links experimental observations of resonances and characteristic timescales in brain activity with physically based neural field theory (NFT). The present work greatly simplifies the formula of the analytical ERP, and separates its spatial part (eigenmodes) from the temporal part (poles). Within this framework, calculations involve contour integrations that yield an explicit expression for ERPs. The dominant global mode is considered explicitly in more detail to study how the ERP varies with time in this mode and to illustrate the method. For each arousal state in sleep and wake, the resonances of the system are determined and it is found that five poles are sufficient to study the main dynamics of the system in waking eyes-open and eyes-closed states. Similarly, it is shown that six poles suffice to reproduce ERPs in rapid-eye movement sleep, sleep state 1, and sleep state 2 states, whereas just four poles suffice to reproduce the dynamics in slow wave sleep. Thus, six poles are sufficient to preserve the main global ERP dynamics of the system for all states of arousal. These six poles correspond to the dominant resonances of the system at slow-wave, alpha, and beta frequencies. These results provide the basis for simplified analytic treatment of brain dynamics and link observations more closely to theory.</p>

<p>The nature of phonological representations has been extensively studied in phonology and psycholinguistics. While full specification is still the norm in psycholinguistic research, underspecified representations may better account for perceptual asymmetries. In this paper, we report on a mismatch negativity (MMN) study with Dutch listeners who took part in a passive oddball paradigm to investigate when the brain notices the difference between expected and observed vowels. In particular, we tested neural discrimination (indicating perceptual discrimination) of the tense mid vowel pairs /o/-/ø/ (place contrast), /e/-/ø/ (labiality or rounding contrast), and /e/-/o/ (place and labiality contrast). Our results show (a) a perceptual asymmetry for place in the /o/-/ø/ contrast, supporting underspecification of [CORONAL] and replicating earlier results for German, and (b) a perceptual asymmetry for labiality for the /e/-/ø/ contrast, which was not reported in the German study. A labial deviant [ø] (standard /e/) yielded a larger MMN than a deviant [e] (standard /ø/). No asymmetry was found for the two-feature contrast. This study partly replicates a similar MMN study on German vowels, and partly presents new findings indicating cross-linguistic differences. Although the vowel inventory of Dutch and German is to a large extent comparable, their (morpho)phonological systems are different, which is reflected in processing.</p>

<p>Brain–computer interface (BCI) has developed rapidly over the past two decades, mainly due to advancements in machine learning. Subjects must learn to modulate their brain activities to ensure a successful BCI. Feedback training is a practical approach to this learning process; however, the commonly used classifier-dependent approaches have inherent limitations such as the need for calibration and a lack of continuous feedback over long periods of time. This paper proposes an online data visualization feedback protocol that intuitively reflects the EEG distribution in Riemannian geometry in real time. Rather than learning a hyperplane, the Riemannian geometry formulation allows iterative learning of prototypical covariance matrices that are translated into visualized feedback through diffusion map process. Ten subjects were recruited for MI-BCI (motor imagery-BCI) training experiments. The subjects learned to modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to centralize the points within one category and to separate points belonging to different categories. The results show favorable overall training effects in terms of the class distinctiveness and EEG feature discriminancy over a 3-day training with 30% learners. A steadily increased class distinctiveness in the last three sessions suggests that the advanced training protocol is effective. The optimal frequency band was consistent during the 3-day training, and the difference between subjects with good or low MI-BCI performance could be clearly observed. We believe that the proposed feedback protocol has promising application prospect.</p>

<p>We quantified the electroencephalogram signals associated with the selective attention processing of experienced simultaneous interpreters and calculated the phase-locked responses evoked by a 40-Hz auditory steady-state response (40-Hz ASSR) and the values of robust inter-trial coherence (ITC) for environmental changes. Since we assumed that an interpreter's attention ability improves with an increase in the number of years of experience of simultaneous interpretation, we divided the participants into two groups based on their simultaneous interpretation experience: experts with more than 15 years of experience (E group; n = 7) and beginners with &lt;1 year (B group; n = 15). We also compared two conditions: simultaneous interpretation (SI) and shadowing (SH). We found a significant interaction in the ITC between years of SI experience (E and B groups) and tasks (SI and SH). This result demonstrates that the number of years of SI experience influences selective attention during interpretation.</p>

<p>Our aim is to use neurophysiological sleep-related consolidation (SRC) phenomena to identify putative pathophysiological mechanisms in CECTS linked to diffuse neurocognitive deficits. We argue that there are numerous studies on the association between seizure aspects and neurocognitive functioning but not as many on interictal variables and neurocognitive deficits. We suggest two additional foci. First, the interictal presentation in CECTS and second, neuronal oscillations involved in SRC processes. Existing data on mechanisms through which interictal epileptiform spikes (IES) impact upon SRC indicate that they have the potential to: (a) perturb cross-regional coupling of neuronal oscillations, (b) mimic consolidation processes, (c) alter the precision of the spatiotemporal coupling of oscillations, and (d) variably impact upon SRC performance. Sleep spindles merit systematic study in CECTS in order to clarify: (a) the state of the slow oscillations (SOs) with which they coordinate, (b) the precision of slow oscillation-spindle coupling, and (c) whether their developmental trajectories differ from those of healthy children. We subsequently review studies on the associations between IES load during NREM sleep and SRC performance in childhood epilepsy. We then use sleep consolidation neurophysiological processes and their interplay with IES to help clarify the diffuse neurocognitive deficits that have been empirically documented in CECTS. We claim that studying SRC in CECTS will help to clarify pathophysiological mechanisms toward diverse neurocognitive deficits. Future developments could include close links between the fields of epilepsy and sleep, as well as new therapeutic neurostimulation targets. At the clinical level, children diagnosed with CECTS could benefit from close monitoring with respect to epilepsy, sleep and neurocognitive functions.</p>

<p>The apparent stochastic nature of neuronal activity significantly affects the reliability of neuronal coding. To quantify the encountered fluctuations, both in neural data and simulations, the notions of variability and randomness of inter-spike intervals have been proposed and studied. In this article we focus on the concept of the instantaneous firing rate, which is also based on the spike timing. We use several classical statistical models of neuronal activity and we study the corresponding probability distributions of the instantaneous firing rate. To characterize the firing rate variability and randomness under different spiking regimes, we use different indices of statistical dispersion. We find that the relationship between the variability of interspike intervals and the instantaneous firing rate is not straightforward in general. Counter-intuitively, an increase in the randomness (based on entropy) of spike times may either decrease or increase the randomness of instantaneous firing rate, in dependence on the neuronal firing model. Finally, we apply our methods to experimental data, establishing that instantaneous rate analysis can indeed provide additional information about the spiking activity.</p>

<p>Recent research suggests that in vitro neural networks created from dissociated neurons may be used for computing and performing machine learning tasks. To develop a better artificial intelligent system, a hybrid bio-silicon computer is worth exploring, but its performance is still inferior to that of a silicon-based computer. One reason may be that a living neural network has many intrinsic properties, such as random network connectivity, high network sparsity, and large neural and synaptic variability. These properties may lead to new design considerations, and existing algorithms need to be adjusted for living neural network implementation. This work investigates the impact of neural variations and random connections on inference with learning algorithms. A two-layer hybrid bio-silicon platform is constructed and a five-step design method is proposed for the fast development of living neural network algorithms. Neural variations and dynamics are verified by fitting model parameters with biological experimental results. Random connections are generated under different connection probabilities to vary network sparsity. A multi-layer perceptron algorithm is tested with biological constraints on the MNIST dataset. The results show that a reasonable inference accuracy can be achieved despite the presence of neural variations and random network connections. A new adaptive pre-processing technique is proposed to ensure good learning accuracy with different living neural network sparsity.</p>

<p>Astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) must adapt to several environmental challenges including microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and isolation while performing highly controlled movements with complex equipment. Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) is an analog used to study spaceflight factors including body unloading and headward fluid shifts. We recently reported how HDBR with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub>) affects visuomotor adaptation. Here we expand upon this work and examine the effects of HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub> on brain activity during visuomotor adaptation. Eleven participants (34 ± 8 years) completed six functional MRI (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post-HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub>. During fMRI, participants completed a visuomotor adaptation task, divided into baseline, early, late and de-adaptation. Additionally, we compare brain activity between this NASA campaign (30-day HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub>) and a different campaign with a separate set of participants (60-day HDBR with normal atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, n = 8; 34.25 ± 7.9 years) to characterize the specific effects of CO<sub>2</sub>. Participants were included by convenience. During early adaptation across the HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub> intervention, participants showed decreasing activation in temporal and subcortical brain regions, followed by post- HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub> recovery. During late adaptation, participants showed increasing activation in the right fusiform gyrus and right caudate nucleus during HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub>; this activation normalized to baseline levels after bed rest. There were no correlations between brain changes and adaptation performance changes from pre- to post HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub>. Also, there were no statistically significant differences between the HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub> group and the HDBR controls, suggesting that changes in brain activity were due primarily to bed rest rather than elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Five HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub> participants presented with optic disc edema, a sign of Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). An exploratory analysis of HDBR+CO<sub>2</sub> participants with and without signs of SANS revealed no group differences in brain activity during any phase of the adaptation task. Overall, these findings have implications for spaceflight missions and training, as ISS missions require individuals to adapt to altered sensory inputs over long periods in space. Further, this is the first study to verify the HDBR and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> effects on the neural correlates of visuomotor adaptation.</p>

<p>The locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem nucleus, is the primary source of the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) in the brain. The LC receives input from widespread brain regions, and projects throughout the forebrain, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. LC neurons release NE to control arousal, but also in the context of a variety of sensory-motor and behavioral functions. Despite its brain-wide effects, much about the role of LC-NE in behavior and the circuits controlling LC activity is unknown. New evidence suggests that the modular input-output organization of the LC could enable transient, task-specific modulation of distinct brain regions. Future work must further assess whether this spatial modularity coincides with functional differences in LC-NE subpopulations acting at specific times, and how such spatiotemporal specificity might influence learned behaviors. Here, we summarize the state of the field and present new ideas on the role of LC-NE in learned behaviors.</p>

<p>Astroglia display a wide range of spontaneous and behavioral state-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. During heightened vigilance, noradrenergic signaling leads to quasi-synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations encompassing soma and processes across the brain-wide astroglia network. Distinct from this vigilance-associated global Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise are apparently spontaneous fluctuations within spatially restricted microdomains. Over the years, several strategies have been pursued to shed light on the physiological impact of these signals including deletion of endogenous ion channels or receptors and reduction of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through buffering, extrusion or inhibition of release. Some experiments that revealed the most compelling behavioral alterations employed chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to modify astroglia Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. However, there is considerable contrast between these findings and the comparatively modest effects of inhibiting endogenous sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In this review, we describe the underlying mechanisms of various forms of astroglia Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as well as the functional consequences of their inhibition. We then discuss how the effects of exogenous astroglia Ca<sup>2+</sup> modification combined with our knowledge of physiological mechanisms of astroglia Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation could guide further refinement of behavioral paradigms that will help elucidate the natural Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent function of astroglia.</p>

<p>The glial cells astrocytes have long been recognized as important neuron-supporting elements in brain development, homeostasis, and metabolism. After the discovery that the reciprocal communication between astrocytes and neurons is a fundamental mechanism in the modulation of neuronal synaptic communication, over the last two decades astrocytes became a hot topic in neuroscience research. Crucial to their functional interactions with neurons are the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations that mediate gliotransmission. Large attention has been posed to the so-called Ca<sup>2+</sup>microdomains, dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes spatially restricted to fine astrocytic processes including perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). With presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic neuronal membranes, PAPs compose the tripartite synapse. The distinct spatial-temporal features and functional roles of astrocyte microdomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity remain poorly defined. However, thanks to the development of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs), advanced microscopy techniques, and innovative analytical approaches, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in astrocyte microdomains were recently studied in unprecedented detail. These events have been observed to occur much more frequently (∼50–100-fold) and dynamically than somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations with mechanisms that likely involve both IP<sub>3</sub>-dependent and -independent pathways. Further progress aimed to clarify the complex, dynamic machinery responsible for astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity at microdomains is a crucial step in our understanding of the astrocyte role in brain function and may also reveal astrocytes as novel therapeutic targets for different brain diseases. Here, we review the most recent studies that improve our mechanistic understanding of the essential features of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains.</p>

Background<p>Intraventricular penetration is rare in glioblastoma (GBM). Whether the ependymal region including the ependyma and subventricular zone (SVZ) can prevent GBM invasion remains unclear.</p>Methods<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining were performed to evaluate the size and anatomical locations of GBM. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between tumor-ependyma contact, ventricle penetration and clinical characteristics. Cell migration and invasion were assessed via Transwell assays and an orthotopic transplantation model.</p>Results<p>Among 357 patients with GBM, the majority (66%) showed ependymal region contact, and 34 patients (10%) showed ventricle penetration of GBM. GBM cells were spread along the ependyma in the orthotopic transplantation model. The longest tumor diameter was an independent risk factor for GBM-ependymal region contact, as demonstrated by univariate (OR = 1.706, p &lt; 0.0001) and multivariate logistic regression analyses (OR = 1.767, p &lt; 0.0001), but was not associated with ventricle penetration. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could significantly induce tumor cell migration (p &lt; 0.0001), and GBM could grow in CSF. Compared with those from the cortex, cells from the ependymal region attenuated the invasion of C6 whether cocultured with C6 or mixed with Matrigel (p = 0.0054 and p = 0.0488). Immunofluorescence analysis shows a thin gap with GFAP expression delimiting the tumor and ependymal region.</p>Conclusion<p>The ependymal region might restrict GBM cells from entering the ventricle via a non-mechanical force. Further studies in this area may reveal mechanisms that occur in GBM patients and may enable the design of new therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) continue to be the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in the U.S., Europe, and in endemic areas, such as the Western Cape region of South Africa. Arithmetic is highly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to play a critical role in number processing. In this study, we investigate whether smaller IPS volumes play a role in the number-processing deficits observed in children with PAE. Participants were 52 9- to 14-year-old children from a historically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, who are participating in our ongoing studies on the effects of PAE on the brain. The IPS was manually parcellated into its medial (MIPS) and lateral (LIPS) walls on magnetic resonance images. The study aimed to examine: (1) the effects of PAE on IPS regional volumes and asymmetry, (2) whether IPS regional volumes are related to number processing performance and, if so, whether these relations are moderated by PAE and (3) potential mediation by regional IPS volumes of the relation between PAE and number processing performance. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was associated with volumes in all regions except the right LIPS. Both left MIPS and left LIPS volumes were significantly smaller in children in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS) group compared to controls. The finding in the left LIPS remained significant after controlling for potential confounders and after adjustment for the smaller overall brain size of the children in the FAS/PFAS group. Smaller left LIPS volumes in the FAS/PFAS group may account for the absence of left-right asymmetry in the LIPS in children with FAS/PFAS compared to controls and nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) children. Bilaterally, larger MIPS volumes were associated with better WISC IQ Arithmetic scores. These effects, however, were not moderated by the degree of PAE, and regional IPS volumes did not mediate the effect of PAE on WISC Arithmetic scores. Although we found that certain regions of the IPS were smaller in children with FAS and PFAS, these PAE-induced changes in IPS volume did not mediate the alcohol-related deficits in arithmetic.</p>

Background<p>Acute medical illnesses, surgical interventions, or admissions to hospital in older individuals are frequently associated with a delirium. In this cohort study, we investigated the impact of specific cognitive domains and depression before the occurrence of delirium symptoms in an 8-year observation of older non-hospitalized individuals.</p>Methods<p>In total, we included 807 participants (48–83 years). Deficits in specific cognitive domains were measured using the CERAD test battery, and depressive symptoms were measured using Beck Depression Inventory and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) before the onset of a delirium. Delirium symptoms were retrospectively assessed by a questionnaire based on the established Nursing Delirium Screening Scale.</p>Results<p>Fifty-eight of eight hundred seven participants (7.2%) reported delirium symptoms over the 8-year course of the study. Sixty-nine percent (n = 40) of reported delirium symptoms were related to surgeries. In multivariate regression analysis, impaired executive function was an independent risk factor (p = 0.034) for the occurrence of delirium symptoms. Furthermore, age (p = 0.014), comorbidities [captured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)] (p &lt; 0.001), and depression (p = 0.012) were significantly associated with reported delirium symptoms.</p>Conclusion<p>Especially prior to elective surgery or medical interventions, screening for impaired executive function and depression could be helpful to identify patients who are at risk to develop delirium symptoms.</p>

<p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) frequently occurs in the elderly as a severe postoperative complication and is characterized by a decline in cognitive function that impairs memory, attention, and other cognitive domains. Currently, the exact pathogenic mechanism of PND is multifaceted and remains unclear. The glymphatic system is a newly discovered glial-dependent perivascular network that subserves a pseudo-lymphatic function in the brain. Recent studies have highlighted the significant role of the glymphatic system in the removal of harmful metabolites in the brain. Dysfunction of the glymphatic system can reduce metabolic waste removal, leading to neuroinflammation and neurological disorders.

<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in geriatric population. At present, no effective treatments exist to reverse the progress of AD, however, early diagnosis and intervention might delay its progression. The search for biomarkers with good safety, repeatable detection, reliable sensitivity and community application is necessary for AD screening and early diagnosis and timely intervention. Electroencephalogram (EEG) examination is a non-invasive, quantitative, reproducible, and cost-effective technique which is suitable for screening large population for possible AD. The power spectrum, complexity and synchronization characteristics of EEG waveforms in AD patients have distinct deviation from normal elderly, indicating these EEG features can be a promising candidate biomarker of AD. However, current reported deviation results are inconsistent, possibly due to multiple factors such as diagnostic criteria, sample sizes and the use of different computational measures. In this study, we collected two neurological tests scores (MMSE and MoCA) and the resting-state EEG of 30 normal control elderly subjects (NC group) and 30 probable AD patients confirmed by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) inspection (AD group). We calculated the power spectrum, spectral entropy and phase synchronization index features of these two groups’ EEG at left/right frontal, temporal, central and occipital brain regions in 4 frequency bands: δ oscillation (1–4 Hz), θ oscillation (4–8 Hz), α oscillation (8–13 Hz), and β oscillation (13–30 Hz). In most brain areas, we found that the AD group had significant differences compared to NC group: (1) decreased α oscillation power and increased θ oscillation power; (2) decreased spectral entropy in α oscillation and elevated spectral entropy in β oscillation; and (3) decrease phase synchronization index in δ, θ, and β oscillation. We also found that α oscillation spectral power and β oscillation phase synchronization index correlated well with the MMSE/MoCA test scores in AD groups. Our study suggests that these two EEG features might be useful metrics for population screening of probable AD patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68181">Spatially displaced excitation contributes to the encoding of interrupted motion by a retinal direction-selective circuit</a></h4>

Spatially distributed excitation and inhibition collectively shape a visual neuron's receptive field (RF) properties. In the direction-selective circuit of the mammalian retina, the role of strong null-direction inhibition of On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (On-Off DSGCs) on their direction selectivity is well-studied. However, how excitatory inputs influence the On-Off DSGC's visual response is underexplored. Here, we report that On-Off DSGCs have a spatially displaced glutamatergic receptive field along their horizontal preferred-null motion axes. This displaced receptive field contributes to DSGC null-direction spiking during interrupted motion trajectories. Theoretical analyses indicate that population responses during interrupted motion may help populations of On-Off DSGCs signal the spatial location of moving objects in complex, naturalistic visual environments. Our study highlights that the direction-selective circuit exploits separate sets of mechanisms under different stimulus conditions, and these mechanisms may help encode multiple visual features.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66917">Temporally delayed linear modelling (TDLM) measures replay in both animals and humans</a></h4>

There are rich structures in off-task neural activity which are hypothesised to reflect fundamental computations across a broad spectrum of cognitive functions. Here, we develop an analysis toolkit – Temporal Delayed Linear Modelling (TDLM) for analysing such activity. TDLM is a domain-general method for finding neural sequences that respect a pre-specified transition graph. It combines nonlinear classification and linear temporal modelling to test for statistical regularities in sequences of task-related reactivations. TDLM is developed on the non-invasive neuroimaging data and is designed to take care of confounds and maximize sequence detection ability. Notably, as a linear framework, TDLM can be easily extended, without loss of generality, to capture rodent replay in electrophysiology, including in continuous spaces, as well as addressing second-order inference questions, e.g., its temporal and spatial varying pattern. We hope TDLM will advance a deeper understanding of neural computation and promote a richer convergence between animal and human neuroscience.

Traditionally, research unraveling seasonal neuroplasticity in songbirds has focused on the male song control system and testosterone. We longitudinally monitored the song behavior and neuroplasticity in male and female starlings during multiple photoperiods using Diffusion Tensor and Fixel-Based techniques. These exploratory data-driven whole-brain methods resulted in a population-based tractogram confirming microstructural sexual dimorphisms in the song control system. Furthermore, male brains showed hemispheric asymmetries in the pallium, whereas females had higher interhemispheric connectivity, which could not be attributed to brain size differences. Only females with large brains sing but differ from males in their song behavior by showing involvement of the hippocampus. Both sexes experienced multisensory neuroplasticity in the song control, auditory and visual system, and cerebellum, mainly during the photosensitive period. This period with low gonadal hormone levels might represent a 'sensitive window' during which different sensory and motor systems in the cerebrum and cerebellum can be seasonally re-shaped in both sexes.

Recent pertussis resurgence in numerous countries may be driven by asymptomatic infections. Most pertussis surveillance studies are cross-sectional and cannot distinguish asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic infections. Longitudinal surveillance could overcome this barrier, providing more information about the true burden of pertussis at the population level. Here we analyze 17,442 nasopharyngeal samples from a longitudinal cohort of 1320 Zambian mother/infant pairs. Our analysis has two elements. First, we demonstrate that the full range of IS481 qPCR CT values provides insight into pertussis epidemiology, showing concordance of low and high CT results over time, within mother/infant pairs, and in relation to symptomatology. Second, we exploit these full-range qPCR data to demonstrate a high incidence of asymptomatic pertussis, including among infants. Our results demonstrate a wider burden of pertussis infection than we anticipated in this population, and expose key limitations of threshold-based interpretation of qPCR results in infectious disease surveillance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63807">RAL GTPases mediate EGFR-driven intestinal stem cell proliferation and tumourigenesis</a></h4>

RAS-like (RAL) GTPases function in Wnt signalling-dependent intestinal stem cell proliferation and regeneration. Whether RAL proteins work as canonical RAS effectors in the intestine, and the mechanisms of how they contribute to tumourigenesis remain unclear. Here, we show that RAL GTPases are necessary and sufficient to activate EGFR/MAPK signalling in the intestine, via induction of EGFR internalisation. Knocking down <i>Drosophila</i> <i>RalA</i> from intestinal stem and progenitor cells leads to increased levels of plasma membrane-associated EGFR and decreased MAPK pathway activation. Importantly, in addition to impacting stem cell proliferation during damage-induced intestinal regeneration, this role of RAL GTPases impacts on EGFR-dependent tumorigenic growth in the intestine and in human mammary epithelium. However, the effect of oncogenic RAS in the intestine is independent from RAL function. Altogether, our results reveal previously unrecognised cellular and molecular contexts where RAL GTPases become essential mediators of adult tissue homeostasis and malignant transformation.

Closed-loop neurostimulation is a promising therapy being tested and clinically implemented in a growing number of neurological and psychiatric indications. This therapy is enabled by chronically implanted, bidirectional devices including the Medtronic Summit RC+S system. In order to successfully optimize therapy for patients implanted with these devices, analyses must be conducted offline on the recorded neural data, in order to inform optimal sense and stimulation parameters. The file format, volume, and complexity of raw data from these device necessitate conversion, parsing, and time reconstruction ahead of time-frequency analyses and modeling common to standard neuroscientific analyses. Here, we provide an open-source toolbox written in Matlab which takes raw files from the Summit RC+S and transforms these data into a standardized format amenable to conventional analyses. Furthermore, we provide a plotting tool which can aid in the visualization of multiple data streams and sense, stimulation, and therapy settings. Finally, we describe an analysis module which replicates RC+S on-board power computations, functionality which can accelerate biomarker discovery. This toolbox aims to accelerate the research and clinical advances made possible by longitudinal neural recordings and adaptive neurostimulation in people with neurological and psychiatric illnesses.

High-frequency oscillatory events, termed ripples, represent synchrony of neural activity in the brain1. Experiments in animal models have characterized ripples during quiescent and sleep states1 and to a lesser degree during active behavior2-4. Converging evidence from these animal studies5,computational modeling6, and recent examinations in human participants support a link between hippocampal7-9 or medial temporal lobe (MTL)10,11 ripples and memory retrieval. Analyzing direct MTL recordings from 219 neurosurgical participants performing episodic recall tasks, we ask whether ripples specifically reflect the reinstatement of contextual information12-14, a defining property of episodic memory12,15, and are not just a recapitulation of recently-experienced stimuli7,10. Here we find that the rate of hippocampal ripples rises just prior to the free recall of recently-formed memories. This pre-recall ripple effect appears most strongly in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of hippocampus--regions critical for episodic memory16-18. Neighboring entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices exhibit a significantly weaker effect. The pre-recall ripple effect is strongest prior to the retrieval of semantically- and/or temporally-related recalls, indicating the involvement of ripples in contextual reinstatement, thereby specifically linking ripples with retrieval of episodic memories.

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly popular technique in basic and clinical neuroscience. One promising application is to combine diffusion MRI with myelin maps from complementary MRI techniques such as multi-parameter mapping (MPM) to produce g-ratio maps that represent the relative myelination of axons and predict their conduction velocity. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) can process both diffusion data and MPMs, making SPM the only widely accessible software that contains all the processing steps required to perform group analyses of g-ratio data in a common space. However, limitations have been identified in its method for reducing susceptibility-related distortion in diffusion data. More generally, susceptibility-related image distortion is often corrected by combining oppositely phase-encoded images (blip-up and blip-down) using the arithmetic mean (AM), however, this can lead to blurred images. In this study we sought to (1) improve the susceptibility-related distortion correction for diffusion MRI data in SPM; (2) deploy an alternative approach to the AM to reduce image blurring in diffusion MRI data when combining blip-up and blip-down EPI data after susceptibility-related distortion correction; and (3) assess the benefits of these changes for g-ratio mapping. We found that the new processing pipeline, called consecutive HySCO, improved distortion correction when compared to the standard approach in the ACID toolbox for SPM. Moreover, using a weighted average (WA) method to combine the distortion corrected data from each phase-encoding polarity achieved greater overlap of diffusion and more anatomically faithful structural white matter probability maps derived from minimally distorted multi-parameter maps as compared to the AM. Third, we showed that the consecutive HySCO WA performed better than the AM method when combined with multi-parameter maps to perform g-ratio mapping. These improvements mean that researchers can conveniently access a wide range of diffusion-related analysis methods within one framework because they are now available within the open-source ACID toolbox as part of SPM, which can be easily combined with other SPM toolboxes, such as the hMRI toolbox, to facilitate computation of myelin biomarkers that are necessary for g-ratio mapping.

Exercise has been shown to be an effective neuroprotective intervention that preserves retinal function and structure in several animal models of retinal degeneration. However, retinal cell morphology and cell types governing exercise-induced retinal neuroprotection remain elusive. Previously, we found that the protective effects of exercise in animal models of retinal disease were accompanied by increased levels of circulating and retinal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and required intact signal transduction with its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB). Studies of neurodegenerative diseases in the brain demonstrate that neurons and astrocytes express BDNF and TrkB. Additionally, astrocytes have been shown to alter their morphology in response to exercise. Here, we have investigated the role of retinal astrocytes as mediators of exercise-induced retinal neuroprotection in a light-induced retinal degeneration mouse model (LIRD). We found that treadmill exercise in both our dim (control maintenance light levels) and LIRD groups promote increased retinal astrocytic population, GFAP expression, branching and endpoints, dendritic complexity, and promotes BDNF-astrocyte interaction. In contrast, LIRD animals that were inactive had significant reductions in all measured parameters. Our findings indicate that exercise is sufficient to rescue retinal astrocyte morphology in a LIRD model maintaining branching and dendritic arborization similar to retinal astrocytes that are not undergoing degeneration. These studies provide essential information to current knowledge gaps in regards to exercise-induced neuroprotection and will additionally provide knowledge in exercise intervention optimization as a rehabilitative method.

Hearing spoken words can enhance visual object recognition, detection and discrimination. Yet, the mechanism underlying this facilitation is incompletely understood. On one account, words would not bias visual processes at early levels, but rather interact at later decision-making stages. More recent proposals posit that words can alter visual processes at early stages by activating category-specific priors in sensory regions. A prediction of this account is that top-down priors evoke changes in occipital areas before the presentation of visual stimuli. Here, we tested the hypothesis that neural oscillations can serve as a mechanism to activate language-mediated visual priors. Participants performed a cue-picture matching task where cues were either spoken words, in their native or second language, or natural sounds, while EEG and reaction times were recorded. Behaviorally, we replicated the previously reported label-advantage effect, with images cued by words being recognized faster than those cued by natural sounds. A time-frequency analysis of cue-target intervals revealed that this label-advantage was associated with enhanced power in posterior alpha (9-11 Hz) and beta oscillations (17-19 Hz), both of which were larger when the image was preceded by a word compared to a natural sound. Prestimulus alpha and beta rhythms were correlated with reaction time performance, yet they appeared to operate in different ways. Reaction times were faster when alpha power increased, but slowed down with enhancement of beta oscillations. These results suggest that alpha and beta rhythms work in tandem to support language-mediated visual object recognition, while showing an inverse relationship to behavioral performance.

Early-life adversity (ELA) causes long-lasting structural and functional changes to the brain, rendering affected individuals vulnerable to the development of psychopathologies later in life. Immediate-early genes (IEGs) provide a potential marker for the observed alterations, bridging the gap between activity-regulated transcription and long-lasting effects on brain structure and function. Several heterogeneous studies have used IEGs to identify differences in cellular activity after ELA; systematically investigating the literature is therefore crucial for comprehensive conclusions. Here, we performed a systematic review on 39 pre-clinical studies in rodents to study the effects of ELA on IEG expression. Females and IEGs other than cFos were investigated in only a handful of publications. We meta-analyzed publications investigating specifically cFos expression. ELA increased cFos expression after an acute stressor only if the animals (control and ELA) had experienced multiple negative life events. At rest, ELA increased cFos expression irrespective of other life events, suggesting that ELA creates a phenotype similar to naive, acutely stressed animals. We present a conceptual theoretical framework to interpret the unexpected results. Overall, ELA likely alters IEG expression across the brain, especially in interaction with other negative life events. The present review highlights current knowledge gaps and provides guidance to aid the design of future studies.

The interruption of spinal circuitry following spinal cord injury disrupts neural activity and is followed by a failure to mount an effective regenerative gene expression response resulting in permanent neurological disability. Functional recovery requires the enhancement of axonal and synaptic plasticity of spared as well as injured fibres, which need to sprout and/or regenerate to form new connections. Here we will investigate whether the combined epigenetic stimulation of the regenerative gene expression program with neuronal activity-dependent enhancement of neuroplasticity and guidance can overcome the current inability to promote neurological recovery in severe and chronic spinal cord injury. This will be carried out by delivering the small molecule CBP/p300 activator CSP-TTK21 in combination with environmental enrichment. We will deliver the CBP/p300 activator CSP-TTK21 weekly between week twelve and twenty following a severe transection model of spinal cord injury in the mouse. Data analysis will assess modifications in regenerative signalling, in motor and sensory axon sprouting and regeneration, in synaptic plasticity as well as in neurological sensorimotor recovery. This approach will advance our mechanistic understanding of regenerative failure and provide insight of whether combining growth promoting strategies with enhancement of neural activity is an effective therapeutic strategy in chronic spinal cord injury.

Mitochondrial metabolism is critical for brain function. However, the mechanisms linking mitochondrial energy production to neuronal activity are elusive. Using whole-cell electrical recordings from Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in cortical slices and fluorescence imaging of cytosolic, mitochondrial Ca2+ indicators and endogenous NAD(P)H, we revealed ultra-fast, spike-evoked mitochondrial Ca2+ transients temporally similar to cytosolic Ca2+ elevations. We demonstrate that, whereas single or few spikes elicit the mitochondrial Ca2+ transients throughout the cell, their amplitude is differentially regulated in distinct neuronal compartments. Thus, these signals were prominent in the soma and apical dendrites and ~3 times smaller in basal dendrites and axons. The spike firing frequency had a subtle effect on the amplitude of the cytosolic Ca2+ elevations but dramatically affected mitochondrial Ca2+ transients and NAD(P)H oxidation and recovery rates. Moreover, while subthreshold EPSPs alone caused no detectable Ca2+ elevation in dendritic mitochondria, the Hebbian coincidence of unitary EPSP and postsynaptic spike produced a localized, single mitochondrial Ca2+ elevation. These findings suggest that neuronal mitochondria are uniquely capable of decoding firing frequency and EPSP-to-spike time intervals for tuning the metabolic rate and triggering changes in synaptic efficacy.

Generating astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells has been hampered by either prolonged differentiation -spanning over two months -or by shorter protocols that generate immature astrocytes, devoid of salient inflammation-associated astrocytic traits pivotal for CNS neuropathological modeling. We directed human neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to astrocytic commitment and maturity by orchestrating an astrocytic-tuned culturing environment. In under 28 days, the generated cells express canonical and mature astrocytic markers, denoted by the expression of AQP4 and, remarkably, the expression and functionality of glutamate transporter EAAT2. We also show that this protocol generates astrocytes that encompass traits critical in CNS disease modeling, such as glutathione synthesis and secretion, upregulation of ICAM-1 and a cytokine secretion profile which is on par with primary astrocytes. This protocol generates a multifaceted astrocytic model suitable for CNS in vitro disease modeling and personalized medicine through brain-on-chip technologies.

Translational research often requires the testing of experimental therapies in primates, but research in non-human primates is now stringently controlled by law around the world. Tissues fixed in formaldehyde without glutaraldehyde have been thought to be inappropriate for use in electron microscopic analysis, particularly those of the brain. Here we report the immunoelectron microscopic characterization of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-producing neurons in macaque hypothalamo-pituitary axis tissues fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stored at -25{degrees}C for several years. The size difference of dense-cored vesicles between magnocellular and parvocellular AVP neurons was detectable in their cell bodies and perivascular nerve endings located, respectively, in the posterior pituitary and median eminence. Furthermore, glutamate and the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 were colocalized with AVP in perivascular nerve endings of both the posterior pituitary and the external layer of the median eminence, suggesting that both magnocellular and parvocellular AVP neurons are glutamatergic in primates. Both ultrastructure and immunoreactivity can therefore be sufficiently preserved in macaque brain tissues stored long-term for light microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that this methodology could be applied to the human post-mortem brain and be very useful in translational research.

The static magnetic field of MRI scanners can induce a magneto-hydrodynamic stimulation of the vestibular organ (MVS). In common fMRI settings, this MVS effect leads to a vestibular ocular reflex (VOR). We asked whether - beyond inducing a VOR - putting a healthy subject in a 3T MRI scanner would also alter goal-directed spatial behavior, as is known from other types of vestibular stimulation. We investigated 17 healthy volunteers, all of which exhibited a rightward VOR inside the MRI-scanner as compared to outside-MRI conditions. More importantly, when probing the distribution of overt spatial attention inside the MRI using a visual search task, subjects scanned a region of space that was significantly shifted towards the right. An additional estimate of subjective straight-ahead orientation likewise exhibited an MVC-induced rightward shift. Hence, putting a subject in a 3T MRI-scanner induces a bias of spatial attention, which closely mimics that of stroke patients with spatial neglect.

Maternal separation (MS), a type of early life stress, has been associated with adverse socioemotional and behavioral outcomes throughout the lifespan across multiple species. Comprehensive longitudinal biobehavioral characterization of MS in rats is sparse and conflicting, warranting more studies. We conducted an MS paradigm involving 6-hour daily separation at unpredictable start times from P2 to P21. We hypothesized this severe form of MS would lead to developmentally emerging maladaptive biobehavioral consequences from juvenile through adult periods compared to Controls (C), especially in social behaviors. We tested: (1) own dam odor preference shortly after weaning; (2) juvenile and adult anxiety-like, sociability, and play behaviors using the light-dark test, three-chambered social interaction test, and video-coded juvenile play behavior; and (3) adult coping behaviors and neuroendocrine response using the forced swim test and blood corticosterone responses. Our results were mostly diametrically opposed to our initial hypothesis and show MS can, under certain circumstances, be protective against maladaptive biobehavioral outcomes. Recently weaned MS male rats had a stronger preference for their dam's odor. Juvenile MS females spent more time in rough-and-tumble play than C female rats. No differences in sociability were found in the juvenile or adult periods. MS promoted a decrease in anxiety-like behavior that persisted from juvenile to adult periods. Finally, MS led to deficits in coping behavior in male adults, but basal and reactive corticosterone levels were unaltered by MS. More studies are needed to validate our surprising findings and probe the neural mechanisms underlying these protective effects.

The PALB2 tumor suppressor plays key roles in DNA repair and has been implicated in redox homeostasis. Autophagy maintains mitochondrial quality, mitigates oxidative stress and suppresses neurodegeneration. Here we show that Palb2 deletion in the mouse brain leads to motor deficits and that co-deletion of Palb2 with the essential autophagy gene Atg7 accelerates and exacerbates neurodegeneration induced by ATG7 loss. Palb2 deletion leads to elevated DNA damage, oxidative stress and mitochondrial markers, especially in Purkinje cells, and co-deletion of Palb2 and Atg7 results in accelerated Purkinje cell loss. Further analyses suggest that the accelerated Purkinje cell loss and severe neurodegeneration in the double deletion mice are due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than DNA damage, and partially dependent on p53 activity. Our studies uncover a role of PALB2 in mitochondrial regulation and a cooperation between PALB2 and ATG7/autophagy in maintaining redox and mitochondrial homeostasis essential for neuronal survival.

Nociceptors are primary afferent neurons serving the reception of acute pain but also the transit into maladaptive pain disorders. Since native human nociceptors are hardly available for mechanistic functional research, and rodent models do not necessarily mirror human pathologies in all aspects, human iPSC-derived nociceptors (iDN) offer superior advantages as a human model system. Unbiased mRNA::microRNA co-sequencing, immunofluorescence staining and qPCR validations, revealed expression trajectories as well as miRNA target spaces throughout the transition of pluripotent cells into iDNs. mRNA and miRNA candidates emerged as regulatory hubs for neurite outgrowth, synapse development and ion channel expression. The exploratory data analysis tool NOCICEPTRA is provided as a containerized platform to retrieve experimentally determined expression trajectories, and to query custom gene sets for pathway and disease enrichments. Querying NOCICEPTRA for marker genes of cortical neurogenesis revealed distinct similarities and differences for cortical and peripheral neurons. The platform provides a public domain neuroresource to exploit the entire data sets and explore miRNA and mRNA as hubs regulating human nociceptor differentiation and function.

Microglia have been implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. The fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 regulates the activation of pathogenic microglia in models of MS and the human polymorphic CX3CR1I249/M280 (hCX3CR1I249/M280) variant increases MS disease progression. However, the role of hCX3CR1I249/M280 on microglial activation and central nervous system repair and regenerative mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, using transgenic mice expressing the hCX3CR1I249/M280 variant, we aimed to determine the contribution of defective CX3CR1 signaling to remyelination and neurogenesis in the cuprizone model of focal demyelination. Here, we report that mice expressing hCX3CR1I249/M280 exhibit marked demyelination and microgliosis follow acute cuprizone treatment. Cuprizone-treated CX3CR1-deficient and fractalkine-deficient mice displayed a comparable phenotype. Nanostring gene expression analysis in demyelinated lesions showed that hCX3CR1I249/M280 upregulates genes associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and disease-associated microglia. In addition, gene expression analysis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus in hCX3CR1I249/M280 mice was associated with a significant downregulation of gene networks linked to neurogenesis following acute demyelination. Confocal microscopy showed that hCX3CR1I249/M280 or loss of CX3CR1 signaling inhibits the generation of progeny from the neurogenic niche, including cells involved in myelin repair. These results provide evidence for the pathogenic capacity of hCX3CR1I249/M280 on microglia dysfunction and therapeutic targeting of CX3CR1 to promote CNS repair in MS.

We isolated gene modules whose products physically interact with environmental exposures related to autoimmunity, and analyzed their nominal statistical evidence of association with autoimmune and non-autoimmune diseases in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and other Herpesviruses interactomes emerged as specifically associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), possibly under common regulatory mechanisms. Analyses of MS blood and brain transcriptomes, cytofluorimetric studies of endogenous EBV-infected lymphoblastoid lines, and lesion immunohistochemistry, confirmed a dysregulation of MS-associated EBV interactors, suggesting their contribution to CD40 signaling alterations in MS. These interactors resulted enriched in modules from inherited axonopathies-causing genes, supporting a link between EBV and neurodegeneration in MS, in accord with the observed transcriptomic dysregulations in MS brains. They were also enriched with top-ranked pharmaceutical targets prioritized on a genetic basis. This study delineates a disease-specific influence of herpesviruses on MS biology.

The application of machine learning to intracranial signal analysis has the potential to revolutionize deep brain stimulation (DBS) by personalizing therapy to dynamic brain states, specific to symptoms and behaviors. Machine learning methods can allow behavioral states to be decoded accurately from intracranial local field potentials to trigger an adaptive DBS (aDBS) system, closing the loop between patients' needs and stimulation patterns. Most decoding pipelines for aDBS are based on single channel frequency domain features, neglecting spatial information available in multichannel recordings. Such features are extracted either from DBS lead recordings in the subcortical target and/or from electrocorticography (ECoG). To optimize the simultaneous use of both types of signals, we developed a supervised online-compatible decoding pipeline based on multichannel and multiple recording site recordings. We applied this pipeline to data obtained from 11 patients with Parkinson's disease performing a hand movement task during DBS surgery targeting the subthalamic nucleus, in which in addition a research temporary ECoG electrode was placed. Spectral and spatial features were extracted using filter-bank analysis and spatial pattern decomposition. The learned spatio-spectral features were used to train a generalized linear model with sparse regularized regression. We found that movement decoding was successful using 100 ms time windows, epoch time that is well-suited for aDBS applications. In addition, when 9 out of 16 features were selected, decoding performance was improved up to 15% when the multiple recording site features were used as compared to the single recording site approach. The prediction value was inversely correlated with both the UPDRS score and the distance of the ECoG electrode position to the hand knob motor cortex. Further evaluation of the selected features revealed that ECoG signals contribute more to decoding performance than subthalamic signals. This novel application of spatial filters to decode movement from combined cortical and subcortical recordings is an important step toward the use of machine learning for the construction of intelligent aDBS systems.

Mazes are a fundamental and widespread tool in behavior and systems neuroscience research in rodents. However, their form and inflexibility often restrict potential experimental paradigms that involve multiple or adaptive maze designs. Unique layouts often cost substantial engineering and time investments from trainee scientists. To alleviate these issues, we have developed an automated modular maze system that is flexible and scalable. This system will allow for experiments with multiple track configurations in rapid succession. Additionally, the flexibility can expedite prototyping of behaviors. Finally, the standardized componentry enhances experimental reproducibility and repeatability. This maze system presents advantages over current maze options and can facilitate novel behavior and systems neuroscience research.

Bioluminescence imaging has changed daily practice in preclinical research of cancers and other diseases in the last decades; however, it has been rarely applied in preclinical research of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this report, we demonstrated that bioluminescence imaging could be used to report the levels of amyloid beta (Abeta). Bioluminescence imaging has changed daily practice in preclinical research of cancers and other diseases in the last decades; however, it has been rarely applied in preclinical research of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this report, we demonstrated that bioluminescence imaging could be used to report the levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) species in vivo. We hypothesized that AkaLumine, a newly discovered substrate for luciferase, could bind to Abeta aggregates and plaques. We further speculated that the Abeta species have the reservoir capacity to sequester and release AkaLumine to control the bioluminescence intensity, which could be used to report the levels of Abetas. Our hypotheses have been validated via in vitro solution tests, mimic studies with brain tissues and mice, two-photon imaging with AD mice, and in vivo bioluminescence imaging using transgenic AD mice that were virally transduced with aka Luciferase (AkaLuc), a new luciferase that generates bioluminescence in the near infrared window. As expected, compared to the control group, we observed that the Abeta group showed lower bioluminescence intensity due to AkaLumine sequestering at early time points, while higher intensity due to AkaLumine releasing at later time points. Lastly, we demonstrated that this method could be used to monitor AD progression and therapeutic effectiveness of avagacestat, a well-studied gamma-secretase inhibitor. Importantly, a good correlation (R2 = 0.81) was established between in vivo bioluminescence signals and Abeta burdens of the tested AD mice. We believe that our approach can be easily implemented into daily imaging experiments and has tremendous potential to change daily practice of preclinical AD research.

A century-long debate on bodily states and emotions persists. While the involvement of bodily activity in emotion physiology is widely recognized, the specificity and causal role of such activity related to brain dynamics has not yet been demonstrated. We hypothesize that the peripheral neural monitoring and control of cardiovascular activity prompts and sustains brain dynamics during an emotional experience, so these afferent inputs are processed by the brain by triggering a concurrent efferent information transfer to the body. To this end, we investigated the functional brain-heart interplay under emotion elicitation in publicly-available data from 62 healthy participants using a computational model based on synthetic data generation of EEG and ECG signals. Our findings show that sympathovagal activity plays a leading and causal role in initiating the emotional response, in which ascending modulations from vagal activity precede neural dynamics and correlate to the reported level of arousal. The subsequent dynamic interplay observed between the central and autonomic nervous systems sustains emotional processing. These findings should be particularly revealing for the psychophysiology and neuroscience of emotions.

The pursuit system has the ability to perform predictive control of eye movements. Even when the target motion is unpredictable due to velocity or direction changes, preceding changes in eye velocity are generated based on weighted averaging of past stimulus timing. However, it is still uncertain whether behavioral history influences the control of predictive pursuit. Thus, we attempted to clarify the influences of stimulus and behavioral histories on predictive pursuit to randomized target velocity. We used alternating-ramp stimuli, where the rightward velocity was fixed while the leftward velocity was either fixed (predictable) or randomized (unpredictable). Predictive eye deceleration was observed regardless of whether the target velocity was predictable or not. In particular, the predictable condition showed that the predictive pursuit responses corresponded to future target velocity. The linear mixed-effects model showed that both stimulus and behavioral histories of the previous two or three trials had influences on the predictive pursuit responses to the unpredictable target velocity. Our results suggest that the predictive pursuit system allows to track randomized target motion using the information from previous several trials, and the information of sensory input (stimulus) and motor output (behavior) in the past time sequences have partially different influences on predictive pursuit.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive and widely used human neuroimaging method, is most known for its spatial precision. However, there is a growing interest in its temporal sensitivity. This is despite the temporal blurring of neuronal events by the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal, the peak of which lags neuronal firing by 4 to 6 seconds. Given this, the goal of this review is to answer a seemingly simple question - "What are the benefits of increased temporal sampling for fMRI?". To answer this, we have combined fMRI data collected at multiple temporal scales, from 323 to 1000 milliseconds, with a review of both historical and contemporary temporal literature. After a brief discussion of technological developments that have rekindled interest in temporal research, we next consider the potential statistical and methodological benefits. Most importantly, we explore how fast fMRI can uncover previously unobserved neuro-temporal dynamics - effects that are entirely missed when sampling at conventional 1 to 2 second rates. With the intrinsic link between space and time in fMRI, this temporal renaissance also delivers improvements in spatial precision. Far from producing only statistical gains, the array of benefits suggest that the continued temporal work is worth the effort.

A goal of visual perception is to provide stable representations of task-relevant scene properties (e.g. object reflectance) despite variation in task-irrelevant scene properties (e.g. illumination, reflectance of other nearby objects). To study such representational stability in the context of lightness representations in humans, we introduce a threshold-based psychophysical paradigm. We measure how thresholds for discriminating the achromatic reflectance of a target object (task-relevant property) in rendered naturalistic scenes are impacted by variation in the reflectance functions of background objects (task-irrelevant property). We refer to these thresholds as lightness discrimination thresholds. Our approach has roots in the equivalent noise paradigm. This paradigm relates signals to internal and external sources of noise and has been traditionally used to investigate contrast coding. For low variation in background reflectance, lightness discrimination thresholds were nearly constant, indicating that observers' internal noise determines threshold in this regime. As background object reflectance variation increases, its effects start to dominate performance. We report lightness discrimination thresholds as a function of the amount of variability in the background object reflectance to determine the equivalent noise - the smallest level of task-irrelevant (i.e. background reflectance) variation that substantially corrupts the visual representation (i.e. perceived object lightness) of the task-relevant variable (i.e. achromatic reflectance). A linear receptive field model, which employs a single center-surround receptive field tailored to our stimulus set, captures human behavior in this task. Our approach provides a method for characterizing the effect of task-irrelevant scene variations on the perceptual representation of a task-relevant scene property.

Aging-related cognitive decline is an emerging health crisis; however, no established unifying mechanism has been identified for the cognitive impairments seen in an aging population. A vascular hypothesis of cognitive decline has been proposed but is difficult to test given the contradictory radiologic needs of high-fidelity microvascular imaging resolution and a broad and deep brain imaging field of view. Super-resolution ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) offers a potential solution by exploiting circulating microbubbles to achieve a vascular resolution approaching the capillary scale without sacrificing imaging depth. In this report, we apply ULM imaging to a mouse model of aging and quantify differences in cerebral vascularity, blood velocity, and vessel tortuosity across several brain regions. We found significant decreases in blood velocity, and significant increases in vascular tortuosity, across all brain regions in the aged cohort, and significant decreases in blood volume in the cortex. These data provide the first-ever measurements of subcortical microvascular dynamics in vivo and reveal that aging has a major impact on these measurements.

Experiments on choice-predictive brain signals have played an important role in the debate on free will. In a seminal study, Benjamin Libet and colleagues found that a negative-going EEG signal, the readiness potential (RP), can be observed over motor-related brain regions already a few hundred ms before a participant makes a conscious decision to move. If the onset of the readiness potential is taken as an indicator of the "brain's decision to move" this could mean that this decision to move is made early, by unconscious brain activity, rather than later, at the time when the subject believes to be deciding. However, an alternative interpretation has recently been discussed, the stochastic decision model (SDM), that takes its inspiration from models of perceptual decision making. It suggests that the RP originates from an accumulation of stochastic internal fluctuations. In this view the decision happens only at a much later stage when an accumulated noise signal reaches a threshold. Here we address a number of confusions regarding both the evidence for the stochastic decision model as well as its interpretation. We will show: (a) that the evidence for the role of stochastic fluctuations is highly indirect; (b) that there is little direct support for the SDM from animal studies; (c) that deterministic (non-random) processes can explain the data in a similar way; (d) that the relative components of the model have been mischaracterized leading to an over-emphasis on the role of random fluctuations and an under-emphasis of deterministic aspects of the model; (e) that there is confusion regarding the role of "urgency" and "evidence" in the SDM and its link to perceptual decision making; (f) that the question whether the decision happens early or late depends on the nature of the noise fluctuations, specifically, whether they reflect "absolute" or "epistemic" randomness; (g) finally, that the model does not explain the temporal relationship between conscious decision and neural decision. Our aim is not to rehabilitate the role of RPs in the free will debate. Rather we aim to address some confusions and premature conclusions regarding the evidence for accumulators playing a role in these preparatory brain processes.

Background: Cortical excitability changes across conscious states, being higher in unconsciousness compared to normal wakefulness. Anaesthesia offers controlled manipulation to investigate conscious processes and underlying brain dynamics. Among commonly used anaesthetic agents, dexmedetomidine (DEX) effects are not completely known. In this study, we investigated cortical excitability as a function of DEX sedation depth. Methods: Transcranial magnetic stimulation coupled with electroencephalography was recorded in 20 healthy subjects undergoing DEX sedation in four conditions (baseline, light sedation, deep sedation, recovery). Frontal and parietal cortices were stimulated using a neuronavigation system. Cortical excitability was inferred by slope, amplitude, positive and negative peak latencies of the first component (0-30 ms) of the TMS-evoked potential. Four Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to test the effect of condition and brain region over cortical excitability. Results: Dexmedetomidine modulated amplitude (P&lt;0.001), slope (P=0.0001) and positive peak (P=0.042), while the targeted brain region affected amplitude (P&lt;0.001), slope (P&lt;0.001), and negative peak (P=0.001). The interaction between dexmedetomidine and region had an effect over amplitude (P=0.004), and slope (P=0.009) such that cortical excitability was higher during all conditions where DEX was present as compared to the baseline. Conclusions: Cortical excitability changes non-linearly as a function of the depth of DEX sedation, with a paradoxical non dose-dependent increase. The effect is region-specific, being present in the frontal but not in the parietal region. Future research should extend the current results with other anaesthetics to better understand the link between cortical excitability and depth of sedation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.04.447048v1?rss=1">Interpersonal Comparison of Utility by Measuring Neural Activity</a></h4>

Aggregating welfare across individuals to reach collective decisions is one of the most fundamental problems in our society. Interpersonal comparison of utility is pivotal and inevitable for welfare aggregation, because if each person's utility is not interpersonally comparable, there is no rational aggregation procedure that simultaneously satisfies even some very mild conditions for validity (Arrow's impossibility theorem). However, scientific methods for interpersonal comparison of utility have thus far not been available. Here, we have developed a method for interpersonal comparison of utility based on brain signals, by measuring the neural activity of participants performing gambling tasks. We found that activity in the medial frontal region was correlated with changes in expected utility, and that, for the same amount of money, the activity evoked was larger for participants with lower household incomes than for those with higher household incomes. Furthermore, we found that the ratio of neural signals from lower-income participants to those of higher-income participants coincided with estimates of their psychological pleasure by "impartial spectators", i.e. disinterested third-party participants satisfying specific conditions. Finally, we derived a decision rule based on aggregated welfare from our experimental data, and confirmed that it was applicable to a distribution problem. These findings suggest that our proposed method for interpersonal comparison of utility enables scientifically reasonable welfare aggregation by escaping from Arrow's impossibility and has implications for the fair distribution of economic goods. Our method can be further applied for evidence-based policy making in nations that use cost-benefit analyses or optimal taxation theory for policy evaluation.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A cognitive assessment within a few days of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was performed in patients consecutively admitted to a stroke unit over 14 months by means of the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B).</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Out of 191 stroke survivors who were non-demented at baseline, 168 attended at least one follow-up visit. At follow-up (mean duration ± SD 12.8 ± 8.7 months), 28 (18.9%) incident cases of MCI and 27 (18%) cases of dementia were recorded. In comparison with patients who remained cognitively stable at follow-up, these patients were older, less educated, had more comorbidities, a higher score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission, more severe cerebral atrophy, and lower MoCA-B and CDT scores at baseline. In multi-adjusted (for age, education, comorbidities score, NIHSS at admission and atrophy score) model, a pathological score on baseline CDT (&lt; 6.55) was associated with a higher risk of PSCI at follow-up (HR 2.022; 95% CI 1.025–3.989, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05) with respect to non-pathological scores. A pathological baseline score on MoCA-B (&lt; 24) did not predict increased risk of cognitive decline at follow-up nor increased predictivity of stand-alone CDT.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.06.447281v1?rss=1">The role of the cannabinoid system in fear memory and extinction in male and female mice</a></h4>

The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is higher in women than in men. Among both humans and mice, females exhibit higher resistance to fear extinction than males, suggesting that differences between sexes in processes of fear extinction are involved in the pathophysiology of such fear-related diseases. Sex differences in molecular mechanisms for fear memory and extinction are unclear. The cannabinoid (CB) system is well known to be involved in fear memory and extinction, but this involvement is based mainly on experiments using male rodents. It has been unclear whether there are sex differences in the role of the CB system in fear memory and extinction. To explore the possibility of such differences, we investigated the effects of pharmacological manipulations of the CB system on the retrieval and extinction of contextual fear memory in male and female mice. WIN55,212-2, a CB receptor (CBR) agonist, augmented the retrieval of fear memory in both sexes, but SR141716 (a CB1R antagonist) did not affect it in either sex. An enhancement of 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG, one of the two major endocannabinoids) via JZL184 [an inhibitor of the 2-AG hydrolase monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL)], augmented the retrieval of fear memory through the activation of CB1R but not CB2R in female mice. In contrast, the enhancement of N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA, the other major endocannabinoid) via URB597, an inhibitor of an AEA hydrolase (fatty acid amide hydrolase-1) did not show any effects on the retrieval or extinction of fear memory in either sex. WIN55,212-2, SR141716, and JZL184 inhibited fear extinction irrespective of sex. These results suggest that although the role of CB1R in the retrieval and extinction of contextual fear memory is common among males and females, the effects of an increase in the 2-AG level on the retrieval of contextual fear memory differ between the sexes.

Understanding the visual world is a constructive process. Whilst a frontal-hippocampal circuit is known to be essential for this task, little is known about the associated neuronal computations. Visual understanding appears superficially distinct from other known functions of this circuit, such as spatial reasoning and model-based planning, but recent models suggest deeper computational similarities. Here, using fMRI, we show that representations of a simple visual scene in these brain regions are relational and compositional - key computational properties theorised to support rapid construction of hippocampal maps. Using MEG, we show that rapid sequences of representations, akin to replay in spatial navigation and planning problems, are also engaged in visual construction. Whilst these sequences have previously been proposed as mechanisms to plan possible futures or learn from the past, here they are used to understand the present. Replay sequences form constructive hypotheses about possible scene configurations. These hypotheses play out in an optimal order for relational inference, progressing from predictable to uncertain scene elements, gradually constraining possible configurations, and converging on the correct scene configuration. Together, these results suggest a computational bridge between apparently distinct functions of hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry, and a role for generative replay in constructive inference and hypothesis testing.

Development in late childhood has been associated with microstructural changes in white matter (WM) that are hypothesized to underpin concurrent changes in cognitive and behavioral function. Restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) is a framework for modelling diffusion-weighted imaging that can probe microstructural changes within hindered and restricted compartments providing greater specificity than diffusion tensor imaging for characterizing intracellular diffusion. Using RSI, we modelled voxelwise restricted isotropic, N0, and anisotropic, ND, diffusion across the brain and measured cross-sectional and longitudinal age associations in a large sample (n=8,039) aged 9-13 years from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) StudySM. Participants showed global increases in N0 and ND across WM with age. When controlling for global RSI measures (averaged across WM), we found smaller age-related associations in frontal regions, reflective of more protracted development of frontal WM. Moreover, variability in the development of restricted diffusion in subcortical regions and along particular gray-white matter boundaries was independent of the global developmental effect. Using the ABCD sample, we have unprecedented statistical power to estimate developmental effects with high precision. Our analyses reveal spatially-varying maturational changes for different regions, independent of global changes. This non-uniformity may reflect age-dependent development of distinct cognitive and behavioral processes.

Objective
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients on 2 molecular scales, specifically BBB's permeability to water and albumin molecules.


Methods
Fifty‐five elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new magnetic resonance imaging technique, water extraction with phase contrast arterial spin tagging. BBB permeability to albumin was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain‐specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.


Results
Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.


Interpretation
These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2021

Objective
Precursors of peptide hormones undergo posttranslational modifications within the trans‐Golgi network (TGN). Dysfunction of proteins involved at different steps of this process cause several complex syndromes affecting the central nervous system (CNS). We aimed to clarify the genetic cause in a group of patients characterized by hypopituitarism in combination with brain atrophy, thin corpus callosum, severe developmental delay, visual impairment, and epilepsy.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing was performed in seven individuals of six unrelated families with these features. Postmortem histopathological and HID1 expression analysis of brain tissue and pituitary gland were conducted in one patient. Functional consequences of the homozygous HID1 variant p.R433W were investigated by Seahorse XF Assay in fibroblasts of two patients.


Results
Bi‐allelic variants in the gene HID1 domain‐containing protein 1 (HID1) were identified in all patients. Postmortem examination confirmed cerebral atrophy with enlarged lateral ventricles. Markedly reduced expression of pituitary hormones was found in pituitary gland tissue. Colocalization of HID1 protein with the TGN was not altered in fibroblasts of patients compared to controls, while the extracellular acidification rate upon stimulation with potassium chloride was significantly reduced in patient fibroblasts compared to controls.


Interpretation
Our findings indicate that mutations in HID1 cause an early infantile encephalopathy with hypopituitarism as the leading presentation, and expand the list of syndromic CNS diseases caused by interference of TGN function. ANN NEUROL 2021

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor pathway plays an essential role in posttranslational modification of proteins to facilitate proper membrane anchoring and trafficking to lipid rafts, which is critical for many cell functions, including embryogenesis and neurogenesis. GPI biosynthesis is a multi-step process requiring the activity of over 25 distinct genes, most of them belonging to the phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG) family and associated with rare neurodevelopmental disorders. <em class="a-plus-plus">PIGQ</em> encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan class Q protein and is part of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase complex that initiates GPI biosynthesis from phosphatidylinositol (PI) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Pathogenic variants in the <em class="a-plus-plus">PIGQ</em> gene have been previously reported in 10 patients with congenital hypotonia, early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy, and premature death occurring in more than half cases. We detected a novel homozygous variant in <em class="a-plus-plus">PIGQ</em> (NM_004204.5: c.1631dupA; p.Tyr544fs*79) by WES trio-analysis of a male patient with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by nonprogressive congenital ataxia, intellectual disability, generalized epilepsy, and cerebellar atrophy. Flow cytometry confirmed deficiency of several GPI-anchored proteins on leukocytes (CD14, FLAER). Clinical features of this case broaden the phenotypic spectrum of <em class="a-plus-plus">PIGQ</em>-related GPI deficiency, outlining the importance of glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor pathway in the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxia.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The widely cited Haken–Kelso–Bunz (HKB) model of motor coordination is used in an enormous range of applications. In this paper, we show analytically that the weakly damped, weakly coupled HKB model of two oscillators depends on only two dimensionless parameters; the ratio of the linear damping coefficient and the linear coupling coefficient and the ratio of the combined nonlinear damping coefficients and the combined nonlinear coupling coefficients. We illustrate our results with a mechanical analogue. We use our analytic results to predict behaviours in arbitrary parameter regimes and show how this led us to explain and extend recent numerical continuation results of the full HKB model. The key finding is that the HKB model contains a significant amount of behaviour in biologically relevant parameter regimes not yet observed in experiments or numerical simulations. This observation has implications for the development of virtual partner interaction and the human dynamic clamp, and potentially for the HKB model itself.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Locomotor adaptations, as required for community walking, rely heavily on the sense of vision. Little is known, however, about gaze behavior during pedestrian interactions while ambulating in the community. Our objective was to characterize gaze behavior while walking in a community environment and interacting with pedestrians of different locations and directions. Twelve healthy young individuals were assessed as they walked in a shopping mall from a pre-set location to a goal located 20 m ahead. Eye movements were recorded with a binocular eye-tracker and temporal distance factors were assessed using wearable sensors from a full-body motion capture system. Participants exhibited more numerous and longer gaze episodes on pedestrians (GEP) that were walking in the same direction as themselves vs. those that were in the opposite direction. The relative durations of GEPs, however, showed no significant differences between pedestrians walking in the same vs. opposite direction. Longer durations of GEPs were also observed for centrally located pedestrians compared to those located on either side, but this was the case only for pedestrians that were walking in the same direction as participants. In addition, pedestrians in the centre, and even more so those on the right, were fixated at farther distances compared to those on the left. Results indicate that healthy young individuals modulate their gaze behavior as a function of the location and direction of pedestrians when ambulating in a community environment. The observed modulation is interpreted as being caused by an interplay between collision risk, pedestrian visibility, presence of leaders and social conventions (right-sided circulation). Present results also establish baseline measures for the quantification of defective visuomotor strategies in individuals with mobility disorders.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Motor learning interacts with and shapes experience-dependent cerebral plasticity. In stroke patients with paresis of the upper limb, motor recovery was proposed to reflect a process of re-learning the lost/impaired skill, which interacts with rehabilitation. However, to what extent stroke patients with hemiparesis may retain the ability of learning with their affected limb remains an unsolved issue, that was addressed by this study. Nineteen patients, with a cerebrovascular lesion affecting the right or the left hemisphere, underwent an explicit motor learning task (finger tapping task, FTT), which was performed with the paretic hand. Eighteen age-matched healthy participants served as controls. Motor performance was assessed during the learning phase (i.e., online learning), as well as immediately at the end of practice, and after 90 min and 24 h (i.e., retention). Results show that overall, as compared to the control group, stroke patients, regardless of the side (left/right) of the hemispheric lesion, do not show a reliable practice-dependent improvement; consequently, no retention could be detected in the long-term (after 90 min and 24 h). The motor learning impairment was associated with subcortical damage, predominantly affecting the basal ganglia; conversely, it was not associated with age, time elapsed from stroke, severity of upper-limb motor and sensory deficits, and the general neurological condition. This evidence expands our understanding regarding the potential of post-stroke motor recovery through motor practice, suggesting a potential key role of basal ganglia, not only in implicit motor learning as previously pointed out, but also in explicit finger tapping motor tasks.</p>

Abstract
The wide variety of cell types and their biophysical complexities pose a challenge in our ability to understand oscillatory activities produced by cellular‐based computational network models. This challenge stems from their high‐dimensional and multiparametric natures. To overcome this, we implement a solution by linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits that generate intrahippocampal (3–12 Hz) theta rhythms. We leverage insights from minimal models to guide explorations of more detailed models and obtain a cellular perspective of theta generation. Our findings distinguish the pyramidal cells as the theta rhythm initiators and reveal that their activity is regularized by the inhibitory cell populations, supporting a proposed hypothesis of an “inhibition‐based tuning” mechanism. We find a strong correlation between input current to the pyramidal cells and the resulting local field potential theta frequency, indicating that intrinsic pyramidal cell properties underpin network frequency characteristics. This work provides a cellular‐based foundation from which in vivo theta activities can be explored.

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical regulators of cellular function acting via heterotrimeric G proteins as their primary transducers with individual GPCRs capable of pleiotropic coupling to multiple G proteins. Structural features governing G protein selectivity and promiscuity are currently unclear. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of the cholecystokinin (CCK) type 1 receptor (CCK1R) bound to the CCK peptide agonist, CCK-8 and 2 distinct transducer proteins, its primary transducer Gq, and the more weakly coupled Gs. As seen with other Gq/11–GPCR complexes, the Gq–α5 helix (αH5) bound to a relatively narrow pocket in the CCK1R core. Surprisingly, the backbone of the CCK1R and volume of the G protein binding pocket were essentially equivalent when Gs was bound, with the Gs αH5 displaying a conformation that arises from “unwinding” of the far carboxyl-terminal residues, compared to canonically Gs coupled receptors. Thus, integrated changes in the conformations of both the receptor and G protein are likely to play critical roles in the promiscuous coupling of individual GPCRs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pYiyanK0KHY" width="1" />

Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) complex are heterogeneous and vary in dendritic morphology, cell shape, spine and axon presence, soma size, and orientation to surrounding fibers. An example of 7, Golgi‐stained neurons with five primary dendrites and their location (inset) in this composite sagittal section illustrates a spectrum of dendritic arbors and these other features. Arrows point to the direction of fibers in the TRN. Greatest soma length (L) is indicated. Neurons in the inset, enlarged views of neurons, and enclosed boxes are coded with similar colors.







Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical structure influencing information transfer to the forebrain. In crocodilians, the TRN shares many features with its mammalian counterpart. One area that has not been explored is how individual neurons in the crocodilian TRN compare with those found in mammals. In mammals, TRN neurons are aligned parallel to the external border of the dorsal thalamus, have their dendrites oriented perpendicular to the fibers in the internal capsule, have fine, filamentous dendritic appendages, are either bipolar or multipolar, and are commonly considered to be a homogeneous morphological population of cells. To investigate the cellular morphology of the TRN complex, a Golgi analysis was undertaken in Alligator mississippiensis. This study examined features that have been used in mammals. In Alligator, the four TRN divisions are the dorsal peduncular nucleus, the perireticular nucleus, the interstitial nucleus, and the neurons in the medial forebrain bundle associated with the interstitial nucleus. In crocodilians, the dorsal peduncular nucleus is homologous to the TRN of mammals. From the 1787 drawn neuron profiles in the traditional three planes of section, the following were concluded. First, neurons in each part of the TRN complex in Alligator were similar in morphology. Second, each part of the TRN complex of Alligator contained a heterogenous population of cells. These variations between the cellular morphology of the dorsal peduncular nucleus of crocodilians and the TRN of mammals are speculated to partly result from differences in forebrain organization.

Abstract
Research innovation that leads to discovery in the battle against neurological disease and disorders requires diverse ideas. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes of Health's 27 institutes and centers, strives to reduce the burden of neurological disease and disorders. The National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke is very interested in increasing the diversity of researchers by addressing the existing barriers responsible for the low numbers of underrepresented populations from traditionally minority‐serving institutions (MSIs) and non‐minority serving institutions (non‐MSIs). This commentary provides insight on the persistent underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities entering neuroscience research careers paths, focusing on multiples levels within the scientific academy and the supportive role that both MSIs and non‐MSIs play in increasing diversity in the biomedical research workforce.

Comparison of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial activity in neuronal membrane systems. In the last years, literature reports that the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) machinery is expressed not only on the inner mitochondrial membrane but also on other membranous structures. In order to highlight the similarities and differences between these two entities, in this work, we compared the activity of mitochondrial OxPhos with that expressed in isolated myelin and rod outer segments.

Abstract
The nervous system displays high energy consumption, apparently not fulfilled by mitochondria, which are underrepresented therein. The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity, a mitochondrial process that aerobically provides ATP, has also been reported also in the myelin sheath and the rod outer segment (OS) disks. Thus, commonalities and differences between the extra‐mitochondrial and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism were evaluated in bovine isolated myelin (IM), rod OS, and mitochondria‐enriched fractions (MIT). The subcellular fraction quality and the absence of contamination fractions have been estimated by western blot analysis. Oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were stimulated by conventional (pyruvate + malate or succinate) and unconventional (NADH) substrates, observing that oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis by IM and rod OS are more efficient than by MIT, in the presence of both kinds of respiratory substrates. Mitochondria did not utilize NADH as a respiring substrate. When ATP synthesis by either sample was assayed in the presence of 10–100 µM ATP in the assay medium, only in IM and OS it was not inhibited, suggesting that the ATP exportation by the mitochondria is limited by extravesicular ATP concentration. Interestingly, IM and OS but not mitochondria appear able to synthesize ATP at a later time with respect to exposure to respiratory substrates, supporting the hypothesis that the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain is buffered by membrane phospholipids. The putative transfer mode of the OxPhos molecular machinery from mitochondria to the extra‐mitochondrial structures is also discussed, opening new perspectives in the field of neurophysiology.

<p>Enzyme is the major workhorse to carry out the diverse cellular functions. It
catalyzes the biological reactions with a high specificity, with its topology
playing a crucial role. For ecologically safe production of numerous
bioproducts including drugs and chemicals, we have been striving to design the
industrially useful enzyme molecules with highly improved catalytic capability.
As the sequence space is enormous for an enzyme, its quick and effective
exploration is quite improbable for the mutagenesis studies whose accuracy is
greatly reliant on the prior information of the mutated sites and the extent of
rigorous screening of the mutant libraries. Although directed evolution methods
significantly aid the construction of a functionally improved molecule, their
credibility depends on the successful excavation of the functionally similar
sequence space in the available databases, encompassing billions of proteins.
As deep learning methods aid us to extensively uncover the underlying network
of all the key catalytic positions without any experimental data, their
implementation has reliably increased the accuracy of directed evolution. The
chapter comprehensively explains data mining and deep learning methods to
further showcase their importance in enzyme engineering methods. The key
biological and algorithmic limitations of these deep learning methodologies are
lastly highlighted.

<p>In the crowded environment of bio-inspired population-based meta-heuristics,
the Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO) algorithm recently appeared and immediately
gained a lot of momentum. Inspired by the peculiar spatial arrangement of salp
colonies, which are displaced in long chains following a leader, this algorithm
seems to provide interesting optimization performances. However, the original
work was characterized by some conceptual and mathematical flaws, which
influenced all ensuing papers on the subject. In this manuscript, we perform a
critical review of SSO, highlighting all the issues present in the literature
and their negative effects on the optimization process carried out by the
algorithm. We also propose a mathematically correct version of SSO, named
Amended Salp Swarm Optimizer (ASSO) that fixes all the discussed problems.
Finally, we benchmark the performance of ASSO on a set of tailored experiments,
showing it achieves better results than the original SSO.

<p>A long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence is lifelong learning. In
lifelong learning, many tasks are presented in sequence and learners must
efficiently transfer knowledge between tasks while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting over long lifetimes. On these problems, policy reuse and other
multi-policy reinforcement learning techniques can learn many tasks. However,
they can generate many temporary or permanent policies, resulting in memory
issues. Consequently, there is a need for lifetime-scalable methods that
continually refine a policy library of a pre-defined size. This paper presents
a first approach to lifetime-scalable policy reuse. To pre-select the number of
policies, a notion of task capacity, the maximal number of tasks that a policy
can accurately solve, is proposed. To evaluate lifetime policy reuse using this
method, two state-of-the-art single-actor base-learners are compared: 1) a
value-based reinforcement learner, Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Deep Recurrent
Q-Network (DRQN); and 2) an actor-critic reinforcement learner, Proximal Policy
Optimisation (PPO) with or without Long Short-Term Memory layer. By selecting
the number of policies based on task capacity, D(R)QN achieves near-optimal
performance with 6 policies in a 27-task MDP domain and 9 policies in an
18-task POMDP domain; with fewer policies, catastrophic forgetting and negative
transfer are observed. Due to slow, monotonic improvement, PPO requires fewer
policies, 1 policy for the 27-task domain and 4 policies for the 18-task
domain, but it learns the tasks with lower accuracy than D(R)QN. These findings
validate lifetime-scalable policy reuse and suggest using D(R)QN for larger and
PPO for smaller library sizes.

<p>Emotions(like fear,anger,sadness,happiness etc.) are the fundamental features
of human behavior and governs his/her mental health. The subtlety of emotional
fluctuations can be examined through perturbation in conversations or speech.
Analysis of emotional state of a person from acoustical features of speech
signal leads to discovery of vital cues determining his or her mental health.
Hence, it's an important field of research in the area of Human Computer
Interaction(HCI). In a recent work we have shown that how the contrast in
Hurst-Exponent calculated from the non-stationary and nonlinear aspects of
"angry" and "sad" speech(spoken in English language) recordings in the
Toronto-Emotional-Speech-Set(TESS) can be used for early detection and
diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. In this work we have extended the work and
extracted Hurst-exponent for the speech-signals of similar emotions but spoken
in German language. It has been observed that the Hurst-exponent efficiently
segregates the contrasting emotions of "anger" and "sadness" in the speech
spoken in German language, in similar fashion it has been doing for English
speech. Hence it can be concluded that the Hurst-exponent can differentiate
among speech spoken out of different emotions in language-independent manner.
We propose algorithm for a language-independent application for early
non-invasive detection of various severe neurocognitive-disorders like
Alzheimer's Disease, MND(motor-neuron-disorder), ASD(autism-spectrum-disorder),
depression, suicidal-tendency etc. which is not possible with the state of the
art medical science.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01683">Rich dynamics caused by known biological brain network features resulting in stateful networks. (arXiv:2106.01683v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The mammalian brain could contain dense and sparse network connectivity
structures, including both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but is without
any clearly defined output layer. The neurons have time constants, which mean
that the integrated network structure has state memory. The network structure
contains complex mutual interactions between the neurons under different
conditions, which depend on the internal state of the network. The internal
state can be defined as the distribution of activity across all individual
neurons across the network. Therefore, the state of a neuron/network becomes a
defining factor for how information is represented within the network. Towards
this study, we constructed a fully connected (with dense/sparse coding
strategies) recurrent network comprising of both excitatory and inhibitory
neurons, driven by pseudo-random inputs of varying frequencies. In this study
we assessed the impact of varying specific intrinsic parameters of the neurons
that enriched network state dynamics, such as initial neuron activity, amount
of inhibition in combination with thresholded neurons and conduction delays.
The impact was assessed by quantifying the changes in mutual interactions
between the neurons within the network for each given input. We found such
effects were more profound in sparsely connected networks than in densely
connected networks. However, also densely connected networks could make use of
such dynamic changes in the mutual interactions between neurons, as a given
input could induce multiple different network states.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The cerebral atlas of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance image (DT-MRI, shorted as DTI) is one of the key issues in neuroimaging research. It is crucial for comparisons of neuronal structural integrity and connectivity across populations. Usually, the atlas is constructed by iteratively averaging the registered individual image. In tradition, the fuzzy group average image is easily generated in the initial stage, which is harmful to providing clear guidance for subsequent registration, to the performance of the final atlas. To solve this problem, an improved unbiased DTI atlas construction algorithm based on adaptive weights is proposed in this paper. The adaptive weighted strategy based on diffeomorphic deformable tensor registration is introduced. At the same time, the distance measure for tensors is used as a constraint condition, which ensures the unbiasedness of the atlas. Then, using 77 DTIs from the dataset in <a class="a-plus-plus" href="http://www.brain-development.org">http://www.brain-development.org</a>, three study-specific atlases, i.e. the constructed atlases of the proposed algorithm and two open-sourced algorithms (DTIAtlasBuilder and DTI-TK), are compared with two standardized atlases (IIT v. 4.1 and NTU-DSI-122-DTI). The performances of the atlases were evaluated in spatial normalization way with six region-based criteria (including Euclidean distances between diffusion tensors, Euclidean distances of the deviatoric tensors, standard deviation, overlaps of eigenvalue-eigenvector, cross-correlations and three sets angles of eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs between diffusion tensors) and three fiber-based criteria (including distances between fiber bundles, angles between fiber bundles and fiber property profile-based criteria). The experimental results showed that the overall performances of the study-specific atlases are better than those of the standardized atlases for specific datasets, and the comprehensive performance of the improved algorithm proposed in this paper is the best.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Egocentric representations allow us to describe the external world as experienced from an individual’s bodily location. We recently developed a novel method of quantifying the weight given to different body parts in egocentric judgments (the <em class="a-plus-plus">Misalignment Paradigm</em>). We found that both head and torso contribute to simple alter-egocentric spatial judgments. We hypothesised that artificial stimulation of the vestibular system would provide a head-related signal, which might affect the weighting given to the head in egocentric spatial judgments. Bipolar Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) was applied during the Misalignment Paradigm. A Sham stimulation condition was also included to control for non-specific effects. Our data show that the weight given to the head was increased during left anodal and right cathodal GVS, compared to the opposite GVS polarity (right anodal and left cathodal GVS) and Sham stimulation. That is, the polarity of GVS, which preferentially activates vestibular areas in the right cerebral hemisphere, influenced the relative weightings of head and torso in egocentric spatial judgments.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.620558">Dynamically Optimizing Network Structure Based on Synaptic Pruning in the Brain</a></h4>

<p>Most neural networks need to predefine the network architecture empirically, which may cause over-fitting or under-fitting. Besides, a large number of parameters in a fully connected network leads to the prohibitively expensive computational cost and storage overhead, which makes the model hard to be deployed on mobile devices. Dynamically optimizing the network architecture by pruning unused synapses is a promising technique for solving this problem. Most existing pruning methods focus on reducing the redundancy of deep convolutional neural networks by pruning unimportant filters or weights, at the cost of accuracy drop. In this paper, we propose an effective brain-inspired synaptic pruning method to dynamically modulate the network architecture and simultaneously improve network performance. The proposed model is biologically inspired as it dynamically eliminates redundant connections based on the synaptic pruning rules used during the brain's development. Connections are pruned if they are not activated or less activated multiple times consecutively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on classification tasks of different complexity with the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experimental results reveal that even for a compact network, the proposed method can also remove up to 59–90% of the connections, with relative improvement in learning speed and accuracy.</p>

<p>Use of chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin is associated with painful peripheral neuropathy that is exacerbated by cold. Remodeling of ion channels including TRP channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contribute to the sensory hypersensitivity following oxaliplatin treatment in animal models. However, it has not been studied if TRP channels and membrane depolarization of DRG neurons serve as the initial ionic/membrane drives (such as within an hour) that contribute to the development of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the current study, we studied in mice (1) in vitro acute effects of oxaliplatin on the membrane excitability of IB4<sup>+</sup> and IB4<sup>–</sup> subpopulations of DRG neurons using a perforated patch clamping, (2) the preventative effects of a membrane-hyperpolarizing drug retigabine on oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, and (3) the preventative effects of TRP channel antagonists on the oxaliplatin-induced membrane hyperexcitability and sensory hypersensitivity. We found (1) IB4<sup>+</sup> and IB4<sup>–</sup> subpopulations of small DRG neurons displayed previously undiscovered, substantially different membrane excitability, (2) oxaliplatin selectively depolarized IB4<sup>–</sup> DRG neurons, (3) pretreatment of retigabine largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity, (4) antagonists of TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels prevented oxaliplatin-induced membrane depolarization, and (5) the antagonist of TRPM8 largely prevented oxaliplatin-induced sensory hypersensitivity. These results suggest that oxaliplatin depolarizes IB4<sup>–</sup> neurons through TRPM8 channels to drive the development of neuropathic pain and targeting the initial drives of TRPM8 and/or membrane depolarization may prevent oxaliplatin-induce neuropathic pain.</p>

<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is recognized as a valuable non-invasive clinical method for localization of the epileptogenic zone and critical functional areas, as part of a pre-surgical evaluation for patients with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. MEG is also useful in localizing functional areas as part of pre-surgical planning for tumor resection. MEG is usually performed in an outpatient setting, as one part of an evaluation that can include a variety of other testing modalities including 3-Tesla MRI and inpatient video-electroencephalography monitoring. In some clinical circumstances, however, completion of the MEG as an inpatient can provide crucial ictal or interictal localization data during an ongoing inpatient evaluation, in order to expedite medical or surgical planning. Despite well-established clinical indications for performing MEG in general, there are no current reports that discuss indications or considerations for completion of MEG on an inpatient basis. We conducted a retrospective institutional review of all pediatric MEGs performed between January 2012 and December 2020, and identified 34 cases where MEG was completed as an inpatient. We then reviewed all relevant medical records to determine clinical history, all associated diagnostic procedures, and subsequent treatment plans including epilepsy surgery and post-surgical outcomes. In doing so, we were able to identify five indications for completing the MEG on an inpatient basis: (1) super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), (2) intractable epilepsy with frequent electroclinical seizures, and/or frequent or repeated episodes of status epilepticus, (3) intractable epilepsy with infrequent epileptiform discharges on EEG or outpatient MEG, or other special circumstances necessitating inpatient monitoring for successful and safe MEG data acquisition, (4) MEG mapping of eloquent cortex or interictal spike localization in the setting of tumor resection or other urgent neurosurgical intervention, and (5) international or long-distance patients, where outpatient MEG is not possible or practical. MEG contributed to surgical decision-making in the majority of our cases (32 of 34). Our clinical experience suggests that MEG should be considered on an inpatient basis in certain clinical circumstances, where MEG data can provide essential information regarding the localization of epileptogenic activity or eloquent cortex, and be used to develop a treatment plan for surgical management of children with complicated or intractable epilepsy.</p>

<p>In most mammals, retinal ganglion cell axons from each retina project to both sides of the brain. The segregation of ipsi and contralateral projections into eye-specific territories in their main brain targets—the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus—is critical for the processing of visual information. The investigation of the developmental mechanisms contributing to the wiring of this binocular map in mammals identified competitive mechanisms between axons from each retina while interactions between axons from the same eye were challenging to explore. Studies in vertebrates lacking ipsilateral retinal projections demonstrated that competitive mechanisms also exist between axons from the same eye. The development of a genetic approach enabling the differential manipulation and labeling of neighboring retinal ganglion cells in a single mouse retina revealed that binocular map development does not only rely on axon competition but also involves a cooperative interplay between axons to stabilize their terminal branches. These recent insights into the developmental mechanisms shaping retinal axon connectivity in the brain will be discussed here.</p>

<p>This study explored the effects of septal glutamatergic transmission on septal-hippocampal theta activity via intraseptal microinjection of antagonist at AMPA receptors (AMPAR). The current results showed that microinjection of AMPAR antagonist, NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 20 μg/μl, 0.5 μl), evoked a decrease in the frequency of theta activity evoked by various means in anesthetized and behaving rat. Theta wave activity was induced on: (a) intraseptal microinjection of carbachol, an agonist at cholinergic receptors, (b) reticular stimulation, (c) exploration in novel open field (OF), and (d) hind paw (HP) injection of the algogen, formalin. The effect on frequency in the formalin test was observed in an early period on injection of formalin, which was novel to the animal, but not in the later more sustained phase of the formalin test. The effect of NBQX, being seen in both anesthetized and behaving animals, suggests that the modulation of theta wave frequency, including in novelty, is a function of AMPAR in MS. The effect of the antagonist on theta power was less apparent, being observed only in anesthetized animals. In addition to theta power and frequency, intraseptal NBQX also attenuated suppression of CA1 population spike (PS) induced by intraseptal carbachol, thus suggesting that septal glutamate neurotransmission is involved in the spectrum of MS-mediated network responses. Indeed, in the context of behavior, formalin injection induced an increase in the level of septal glutamate, while NBQX attenuated nociceptive behaviors. Notably, MS is involved in the modulation of formalin nociception. These findings suggest that AMPA receptors are a key modulator of septal physiological function.</p>

<p>The fine processes of single astrocytes can contact many thousands of synapses whose function they can modulate through bi-directional signaling. The spatial arrangement of astrocytic processes and neuronal structures is relevant for such interactions and for the support of neuronal signaling by astrocytes. At the same time, the geometry of perisynaptic astrocyte processes is variable and dynamically regulated. Studying these fine astrocyte processes represents a technical challenge, because many of them cannot be fully resolved by diffraction-limited microscopy. Therefore, we have established two indirect parameters of astrocyte morphology, which, while not fully resolving local geometry by design, provide statistical measures of astrocyte morphology: the fraction of tissue volume that astrocytes occupy and the density of resolvable astrocytic processes. Both are straightforward to obtain using widely available microscopy techniques. We here present the approach and demonstrate its robustness across various experimental conditions using mainly two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy in acute slices and in vivo as well as modeling. Using these indirect measures allowed us to analyze the morphology of relatively large populations of astrocytes. Doing so we captured the heterogeneity of astrocytes within and between the layers of the hippocampal CA1 region and the developmental profile of astrocyte morphology. This demonstrates that volume fraction (VF) and segment density are useful parameters for describing the structure of astrocytes. They are also suitable for online monitoring of astrocyte morphology with widely available microscopy techniques.</p>

<p>To investigate the effect of choline alfoscerate (CA) on hearing amplification in patients with age related hearing loss, we performed a prospective case-control observational study from March 2016 to September 2020. We assessed patients with bilateral word recognition score (WRS) &lt;50% using monosyllabic words. The patients were 65–85 years old, without any history of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, parkinsonism, or depression. After enrollment, all patients started using hearing aids (HA). The CA group received a daily dose of 800 mg CA for 11 months. We performed between-group comparisons of audiological data, including pure tone audiometry, WRS, HA fitting data obtained using real-ear measurement (REM), and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid benefit scores after treatment. After CA administration, the WRS improved significantly in the CA group (4.2 ± 8.3%), but deteriorated in the control group (−0.6 ± 8.1%, p = 0.035). However, there was no significant between-group difference in the change in pure tone thresholds and aided speech intelligibility index calculated from REM. These findings suggest that the difference in WRS was relevant to central speech understanding rather than peripheral audibility. Therefore, administering oral CA could effectively enrich listening comprehension in older HA users.</p>

<p>Balance and gait impairments, and consequently, mobility restrictions and falls are common in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Various cognitive deficits are also common in PD and are associated with increased fall risk. These mobility and cognitive deficits are limiting factors in a person’s health, ability to perform activities of daily living, and overall quality of life. Community ambulation involves many dual-task (DT) conditions that require processing of several cognitive tasks while managing or reacting to sudden or unexpected balance challenges. DT training programs that can simultaneously target balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive functions are important to consider in rehabilitation and promotion of healthy active lives. In the proposed multi-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT), novel behavioral positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging methods are used to evaluate the molecular basis and neural underpinnings of: (a) the decline of mobility function in PD, specifically, balance, gait, visuomotor, and cognitive function, and (b) the effects of an engaging, game-based DT treadmill walking program on mobility and cognitive functions. Both the interactive cognitive game tasks and treadmill walking require continuous visual attention, and share spatial processing functions, notably to minimize any balance disturbance or gait deviation/stumble. The ability to “walk and talk” normally includes activation of specific regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basal ganglia (site of degeneration in PD). The PET imaging analysis and comparison with healthy age-matched controls will allow us to identify areas of abnormal, reduced activity levels, as well as areas of excessive activity (increased attentional resources) during DT-walking. We will then be able to identify areas of brain plasticity associated with improvements in mobility functions (balance, gait, and cognition) after intervention. We expect the gait-cognitive training effect to involve re-organization of PFC activity among other, yet to be identified brain regions. The DT mobility-training platform and behavioral PET brain imaging methods are directly applicable to other diseases that affect gait and cognition, e.g., cognitive vascular impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in aging.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/69594">Punishment insensitivity in humans is due to failures in instrumental contingency learning</a></h4>

Punishment maximises the probability of our individual survival by reducing behaviours that cause us harm, and also sustains trust and fairness in groups essential for social cohesion. However, some individuals are more sensitive to punishment than others and these differences in punishment sensitivity have been linked to a variety of decision-making deficits and psychopathologies. The mechanisms for why individuals differ in punishment sensitivity are poorly understood, although recent studies of conditioned punishment in rodents highlight a key role for punishment contingency detection (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2019). Here, we applied a novel ‘Planets and Pirates’ conditioned punishment task in humans, allowing us to identify the mechanisms for why individuals differ in their sensitivity to punishment. We show that punishment sensitivity is bimodally distributed in a large sample of normal participants. Sensitive and insensitive individuals equally liked reward and showed similar rates of reward-seeking. They also equally disliked punishment and did not differ in their valuation of cues that signalled punishment. However, sensitive and insensitive individuals differed profoundly in their capacity to detect and learn volitional control over aversive outcomes. Punishment insensitive individuals did not learn the instrumental contingencies, so they could not withhold behaviour that caused punishment and could not generate appropriately selective behaviours to prevent impending punishment. These differences in punishment sensitivity could not be explained by individual differences in behavioural inhibition, impulsivity, or anxiety. This bimodal punishment sensitivity and these deficits in instrumental contingency learning are identical to those dictating punishment sensitivity in non-human animals, suggesting that they are general properties of aversive learning and decision-making.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67315">Canonical NF-κB signaling maintains corneal epithelial integrity and prevents corneal aging via retinoic acid</a></h4>

Disorders of the transparent cornea affect millions of people worldwide. However, how to maintain and/or regenerate this organ remains unclear. Here, we show that <i>Rela </i>(encoding a canonical NF-kB subunit) ablation in K14<sup>+</sup> corneal epithelial stem cells not only disrupts corneal regeneration but also results in age-dependent epithelial deterioration, which triggers aberrant wound healing processes including stromal remodeling, neovascularization, epithelial metaplasia, and plaque formation at the central cornea. These anomalies are largely recapitulated in normal mice that age naturally. Mechanistically, <i>Rela </i>deletion suppresses expression of Aldh1a1, an enzyme required for retinoic acid synthesis from vitamin A. Retinoic acid administration blocks development of ocular anomalies in <i>Krt14-Cre; Rela<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice and naturally aged mice. Moreover, epithelial metaplasia and plaque formation are preventable by inhibition of angiogenesis. This study thus uncovers major mechanisms governing corneal maintenance, regeneration and aging and identifies the NF-kB-retinoic acid pathway as a therapeutic target for corneal disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66057">Differential dopaminergic modulation of spontaneous cortico–subthalamic activity in Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

Pathological oscillations including elevated beta activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and between STN and cortical areas are a hallmark of neural activity in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Oscillations also play an important role in normal physiological processes and serve distinct functional roles at different points in time. We characterised the effect of dopaminergic medication on oscillatory whole-brain networks in PD in a time-resolved manner by employing a hidden Markov model on combined STN local field potentials and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 17 PD patients. Dopaminergic medication led to coherence within the medial and orbitofrontal cortex in the delta/theta frequency range. This is in line with known side effects of dopamine treatment such as deteriorated executive functions in PD. In addition, dopamine caused the beta band activity to switch from an STN-mediated motor network to a frontoparietal-mediated one. In contrast, dopamine did not modify local STN–STN coherence in PD. STN–STN synchrony emerged both on and off medication. By providing electrophysiological evidence for the differential effects of dopaminergic medication on the discovered networks, our findings open further avenues for electrical and pharmacological interventions in PD.

Neuroendocrine systems in animals maintain organismal homeostasis and regulate stress response. Although a great deal of work has been done on the neuropeptides and hormones that are released and act on target organs in the periphery, the synaptic inputs onto these neuroendocrine outputs in the brain are less well understood. Here, we use the transmission electron microscopy reconstruction of a whole central nervous system in the <i>Drosophila</i> larva to elucidate the sensory pathways and the interneurons that provide synaptic input to the neurosecretory cells projecting to the endocrine organs. Predicted by network modeling, we also identify a new carbon dioxide-responsive network that acts on a specific set of neurosecretory cells and that includes those expressing corazonin (Crz) and diuretic hormone 44 (Dh44) neuropeptides. Our analysis reveals a neuronal network architecture for combinatorial action based on sensory and interneuronal pathways that converge onto distinct combinations of neuroendocrine outputs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65118">Cortical entrainment to hierarchical contextual rhythms recomposes dynamic attending in visual perception</a></h4>

Temporal regularity is ubiquitous and essential to guiding attention and coordinating behavior within a dynamic environment. Previous researchers have modeled attention as an internal rhythm that may entrain to first-order regularity from rhythmic events to prioritize information selection at specific time points. Using the attentional blink paradigm, here we show that higher-order regularity based on rhythmic organization of contextual features (pitch, color, or motion) may serve as a temporal frame to recompose the dynamic profile of visual temporal attention. Critically, such attentional reframing effect is well predicted by cortical entrainment to the higher-order contextual structure at the delta band as well as its coupling with the stimulus-driven alpha power. These results suggest that the human brain involuntarily exploits multiscale regularities in rhythmic contexts to recompose dynamic attending in visual perception, and highlight neural entrainment as a central mechanism for optimizing our conscious experience of the world in the time dimension.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64140">Short and long sleeping mutants reveal links between sleep and macroautophagy</a></h4>

Sleep is a conserved and essential behavior, but its mechanistic and functional underpinnings remain poorly defined. Through unbiased genetic screening in <i>Drosophila</i>, we discovered a novel short-sleep mutant we named <i>argus</i>. Positional cloning and subsequent complementation, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out, and RNAi studies identified Argus as a transmembrane protein that acts in adult peptidergic neurons to regulate sleep. <i>argus</i> mutants accumulate undigested Atg8a(+) autophagosomes, and genetic manipulations impeding autophagosome formation suppress <i>argus</i> sleep phenotypes, indicating that autophagosome accumulation drives <i>argus</i> short-sleep. Conversely, a <i>blue cheese</i> neurodegenerative mutant that impairs autophagosome formation was identified independently as a gain-of-sleep mutant, and targeted RNAi screens identified additional genes involved in autophagosome formation whose knockdown increases sleep. Finally, autophagosomes normally accumulate during the daytime and nighttime sleep deprivation extends this accumulation into the following morning, while daytime gaboxadol feeding promotes sleep and reduces autophagosome accumulation at nightfall. In sum, our results paradoxically demonstrate that wakefulness increases and sleep decreases autophagosome levels under unperturbed conditions, yet strong and sustained upregulation of autophagosomes decreases sleep, whereas strong and sustained downregulation of autophagosomes increases sleep. The complex relationship between sleep and autophagy suggested by our findings may have implications for pathological states including chronic sleep disorders and neurodegeneration, as well as for integration of sleep need with other homeostats, such as under conditions of starvation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62917">The critical role of Hedgehog-responsive mesenchymal progenitors in meniscus development and injury repair</a></h4>

Meniscal tears are associated with a high risk of osteoarthritis but currently have no disease-modifying therapies. Using a Gli1 reporter line, we found that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to the development of meniscus horns from 2 weeks of age. In adult mice, Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells resided at the superficial layer of meniscus and expressed known mesenchymal progenitor markers. In culture, meniscal Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells possessed high progenitor activities under the control of Hh signal. Meniscus injury at the anterior horn induced a quick expansion of <i>Gli1-lineage</i> cells. Normally, meniscal tissue healed slowly, leading to cartilage degeneration. Ablation of Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells further hindered this repair process. Strikingly, intra-articular injection of Gli1<sup>+</sup> meniscal cells or an Hh agonist right after injury accelerated the bridging of the interrupted ends and attenuated signs of osteoarthritis. Taken together, our work identified a novel progenitor population in meniscus and proposes a new treatment for repairing injured meniscus and preventing osteoarthritis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62320">Multiplexed proteomics of autophagy-deficient murine macrophages reveals enhanced antimicrobial immunity via the oxidative stress response</a></h4>

Defective autophagy is strongly associated with chronic inflammation. Loss-of-function of the core autophagy gene <i>Atg16l1</i> increases risk for Crohn’s disease in part by enhancing innate immunity through myeloid cells such as macrophages. However, autophagy is also recognized as a mechanism for clearance of certain intracellular pathogens. These divergent observations prompted a re-evaluation of ATG16L1 in innate antimicrobial immunity. In this study, we found that loss of <i>Atg16l1</i> in myeloid cells enhanced the killing of virulent <i>Shigella flexneri (S.flexneri)</i>, a clinically relevant enteric bacterium that resides within the cytosol by escaping from membrane-bound compartments. Quantitative multiplexed proteomics of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages revealed that ATG16L1 deficiency significantly upregulated proteins involved in the glutathione-mediated antioxidant response to compensate for elevated oxidative stress, which simultaneously promoted <i>S.flexneri</i> killing. Consistent with this, myeloid-specific deletion of <i>Atg16l1</i> in mice accelerated bacterial clearance in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Pharmacological induction of oxidative stress through suppression of cysteine import enhanced microbial clearance by macrophages. Conversely, antioxidant treatment of macrophages permitted <i>S.flexneri</i> proliferation. These findings demonstrate that control of oxidative stress by ATG16L1 and autophagy regulates antimicrobial immunity against intracellular pathogens.

The composition of gut-associated microbial communities changes during intestinal inflammation, including an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae populations. The mechanisms underlying microbiota changes during inflammation are incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed previously published metagenomic datasets with a focus on microbial hydrogen metabolism. The bacterial genomes in the inflamed murine gut and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease contained more genes encoding predicted hydrogen-utilizing hydrogenases compared to communities found under non-inflamed conditions. To validate these findings, we investigated hydrogen metabolism of <i>Escherichia coli,</i> a representative Enterobacteriaceae, in mouse models of colitis. <i>E. coli</i> mutants lacking hydrogenase-1 and hydrogenase-2 displayed decreased fitness during colonization of the inflamed cecum and colon. Utilization of molecular hydrogen was in part dependent on respiration of inflammation-derived electron acceptors. This work highlights the contribution of hydrogenases to alterations of the gut microbiota in the context of non-infectious colitis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58342">Cytoplasmic mRNA decay represses RNA polymerase II transcription during early apoptosis</a></h4>

RNA abundance is generally sensitive to perturbations in decay and synthesis rates, but crosstalk between RNA polymerase II transcription and cytoplasmic mRNA degradation often leads to compensatory changes in gene expression. Here, we reveal that widespread mRNA decay during early apoptosis represses RNAPII transcription, indicative of positive (rather than compensatory) feedback. This repression requires active cytoplasmic mRNA degradation, which leads to impaired recruitment of components of the transcription preinitiation complex to promoter DNA. Importin a/b-mediated nuclear import is critical for this feedback signaling, suggesting that proteins translocating between the cytoplasm and nucleus connect mRNA decay to transcription. We also show that an analogous pathway activated by viral nucleases similarly depends on nuclear protein import. Collectively, these data demonstrate that accelerated mRNA decay leads to the repression of mRNA transcription, thereby amplifying the shutdown of gene expression. This highlights a conserved gene regulatory mechanism by which cells respond to threats.

Classic reinforcement learning (RL) theories cannot explain human behavior in the absence of external reward or when the environment changes. Here, we employ a deep sequential decision-making paradigm with sparse reward and abrupt environmental changes. To explain the behavior of human participants in these environments, we show that RL theories need to include surprise and novelty, each with a distinct role. While novelty drives exploration before the first encounter of a reward, surprise increases the rate of learning of a world-model as well as of model-free action-values. Even though the world-model is available for model-based RL, we find that human decisions are dominated by model-free action choices. The world-model is only marginally used for planning, but it is important to detect surprising events. Our theory predicts human action choices with high probability and allows us to dissociate surprise, novelty, and reward in EEG signals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XynWQ8GORzc" width="1" />

<p>by Zhong Li, Kaiyancheng Jiang, Shengwei Qin, Yijun Zhong, Arne Elofsson</p>

Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in human diseases, indicating that miRNAs might be a potential pathogenic factor for various diseases. Therefore, figuring out the relationship between miRNAs and diseases plays a critical role in not only the development of new drugs, but also the formulation of individualized diagnosis and treatment. As the prediction of miRNA-disease association via biological experiments is expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have a positive effect on revealing the association. In this study, a novel prediction model integrating GCN, CNN and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (GCSENet) was constructed for the identification of miRNA-disease association. The model first captured features by GCN based on a heterogeneous graph including diseases, genes and miRNAs. Then, considering the different effects of genes on each type of miRNA and disease, as well as the different effects of the miRNA-gene and disease-gene relationships on miRNA-disease association, a feature weight was set and a combination of miRNA-gene and disease-gene associations was added as feature input for the convolution operation in CNN. Furthermore, the squeeze and excitation blocks of SENet were applied to determine the importance of each feature channel and enhance useful features by means of the attention mechanism, thus achieving a satisfactory prediction of miRNA-disease association. The proposed method was compared against other state-of-the-art methods. It achieved an AUROC score of 95.02% and an AUPR score of 95.55% in a 10-fold cross-validation, which led to the finding that the proposed method is superior to these popular methods on most of the performance evaluation indexes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bSi9U-j4N0Y" width="1" />

<p>by Jan Huertas, Hans Robert Schöler, Vlad Cojocaru</p>

Genomic DNA is packaged in chromatin, a dynamic fiber variable in size and compaction. In chromatin, repeating nucleosome units wrap 145–147 DNA basepairs around histone proteins. Genetic and epigenetic regulation of genes relies on structural transitions in chromatin which are driven by intra- and inter-nucleosome dynamics and modulated by chemical modifications of the unstructured terminal tails of histones. Here we demonstrate how the interplay between histone H3 and H2A tails control ample nucleosome breathing motions. We monitored large openings of two genomic nucleosomes, and only moderate breathing of an engineered nucleosome in atomistic molecular simulations amounting to 24 μs. Transitions between open and closed nucleosome conformations were mediated by the displacement and changes in compaction of the two histone tails. These motions involved changes in the DNA interaction profiles of clusters of epigenetic regulatory aminoacids in the tails. Removing the histone tails resulted in a large increase of the amplitude of nucleosome breathing but did not change the sequence dependent pattern of the motions. Histone tail modulated nucleosome breathing is a key mechanism of chromatin dynamics with important implications for epigenetic regulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rBnNLN6ARqA" width="1" />

<p>by Gidon Eshel</p>

Beef is the most resource intensive of all commonly used food items. Disproportionate synthetic fertilizer use during beef production propels a vigorous one-way factory-to-ocean nutrient flux, which alternative agriculture models strive to rectify by enhancing in-farm biogeochemical cycling. Livestock, especially cattle, are central to these models, which advocates describe as the context most likely to overcome beef’s environmental liabilities. Yet the dietary potential of such models is currently poorly known. Here, I thus ask whether nitrogen-sparing agriculture (NSA) can offer a viable alternative to the current US food system. Focusing on the most common eutrophication-causing element, N, I devise a specific model of mixed-use NSA comprising numerous small farms producing human plant-based food and forage, the latter feeding a core intensive beef operation that forgoes synthetic fertilizer and relies only on locally produced manure and N fixers. Assuming the model is deployed throughout the high-quality, precipitation-rich US cropland (delimiting approximately 100 million ha, less than half of today’s agricultural land use) and neglecting potential macroeconomic obstacles to wide deployment, I find that NSA could produce a diverse, high-quality nationwide diet distinctly better than today’s mean US diet. The model also permits 70%–80% of today’s beef consumption, raises today’s protein delivery by 5%–40%, and averts approximately 60% of today’s fertilizer use and approximately 10% of today’s total greenhouse gas emissions. As defined here, NSA is thus potentially a viable, scalable environmentally superior alternative to the current US food system, but only when combined with the commitment to substantially enhance our reliance on plant food.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YBfN0hYrX1E" width="1" />

Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke with cancer.


Methods
We conducted a prospective cross‐sectional study from 2016 to 2020 at 2 hospitals. We enrolled 3 groups of 50 adult participants each. The main group included patients with active solid tumor cancer and acute ischemic stroke. The control groups included patients with acute ischemic stroke only or active cancer only. The patients with stroke‐only and patients with cancer‐only were matched to the patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke by age, sex, and cancer type, if applicable. The outcomes were prespecified hematological biomarkers and transcranial Doppler microemboli detection. Hematological biomarkers included markers of coagulation (D‐dimer and thrombin‐antithrombin), platelet function (P‐selectin), and endothelial integrity (thrombomodulin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 [sICAM‐1], and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule‐1 [sVCAM‐1]). Hematological biomarkers were compared between groups using the Kruskal‐Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank‐Sum tests. In multivariable linear regression models, we adjusted for race, number of stroke risk factors, smoking, stroke severity, and antithrombotic use. Transcranial Doppler microemboli presence was compared between groups using chi‐square tests.


Results
Levels of all study biomarkers were different between groups. In univariate between‐group comparisons, patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke had higher levels of D‐dimer, sICAM‐1, sVCAM‐1, and thrombomodulin than both control groups; higher levels of thrombin‐antithrombin than patients with cancer‐only; and higher levels of P‐selectin than patients with stroke‐only. Findings were similar in multivariable analyses. Transcranial Doppler microemboli were detected in 32% of patients with cancer‐plus‐stroke, 16% of patients with stroke‐only, and 6% of patients with cancer‐only (p = 0.005).


Interpretation
Patients with cancer‐related stroke have higher markers of coagulation, platelet, and endothelial dysfunction, and more circulating microemboli, than matched controls. ANN NEUROL 2021

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This is a secondary analysis using data from the ongoing MAAESTRO study, in which stroke patients with atrial fibrillation electronically monitor their adherence to DOAC treatment. Eligible patients for this analysis had at least four weeks of adherence data prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The analysis included eight patients (median age 81.5 years, IQR 74.8–84.5).

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Overall, 166 patients presented to the ED with AMS. Metabolic encephalopathy was diagnosed as the cause in 154 (92.8%), with 118 (71.1%) categorized as multifactorial ME and 36 (21.7%) with single-cause ME. Hypoxia 103 (62.0%) and renal failure 75 (45.2%) were the most common underlying mechanisms. Neurological causes of AMS occurred in a total 20 patients (12%) and as the sole factor in 5 (3.0%); 10 (6.0%) cases were seizure related and 10 (6.0%) were cerebrovascular events. Of the 7 patients with indeterminant causes, only 1 was suspicious for encephalitis (0.6%). Age, pre-existing dementia and cerebrovascular disease, and impaired renal function were independent predictors of AMS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">When reaching to targets within arm’s reach, intentional trunk motion must be neutralized by compensatory motion of the upper limb (UL). Advanced age has been associated with deterioration in the coordination of multi-joint UL movements. In the current study, we looked to determine if older adults also have difficulties modifying their UL movements (i.e., coordination between the shoulder and elbow joints), during a complex reaching task when trunk motion is manipulated. Two groups of healthy participants were recruited: 18 young (mean age = 24.28 ± 2.89 years old) and 18 older (mean age = 72.11 ± 2.39 years old) adults. Participants reached to a target with their eyes closed, while simultaneously moving the trunk forward. In 40% of trials, the trunk motion was unexpectedly blocked. Participants performed the task with both their dominant and non-dominant arms, and at a preferred and fast speed. All participants were able to coordinate motion at the elbow and shoulder joints in a similar manner and modify this coordination in accordance with motion at the trunk, regardless of the hand used or speed of movement. Specifically, in reaches that involved forward trunk motion (free-trunk trials), all participants demonstrated increased elbow flexion (i.e., less elbow extension) compared to blocked-trunk trials. In contrast, when trunk motion was blocked (blocked-trunk trials), all reaching movements were accompanied by increased shoulder horizontal adduction. While coordination of UL joints was similar across older and young adults, the extent of changes at the elbow and shoulder was smaller and less consistent in older adults compared to young participants, especially when trunk motion was involved. These results suggest that older adults can coordinate their UL movements based on task requirements, but that their performance is not as consistent as young adults.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">This study investigated the effects of mental fatigue (MF) induced by a 90-min AX-continuous performance test (AX-CPT) on balance control by addressing the issue of the heterogeneity of individuals’ responses. Twenty healthy young active participants were recruited. They had to carry out two balance tasks (sway as little as possible on a stable support with the eyes open and closed) when standing on a force platform before and after performing a 90-min AX-CPT. The NASA-TLX test was used to assess the subjective manifestations of MF. Objective cognitive performance was measured using results from the AX-CPT. Inter-individual differences in behavioral deterioration due to MF were analyzed with a hierarchical cluster analysis, which categorizes participants’ behaviors into subgroups with similar characteristics. The cluster analysis revealed that the achievement of the AX-CPT induced various levels of MF and balance impairments within the whole sample. A significant relationship between the level of MF and the degree of balance disturbance was observed only when participants stood with the eyes open, thus suggesting that inter-individual differences in vulnerability to MF could stem from differences between subjects in the level of engagement of visual attention and/or from differences in field dependency for balance control. These findings show that the completion of the same prolonged demanding cognitive task induces a strong heterogeneity in subjects’ responses, with marked individual differences in MF vulnerability that affect balance control differently according to the sensory context.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">This study aimed to verify whether visual-motor illusion changes the functional connectivity during kinesthetic motor imagery and the vividness of kinesthetic motor imagery. Twelve right-handed healthy adults participated in this study. All participants randomly performed both the illusion and observation conditions in 20 min, respectively. Illusion condition was induced kinesthetic illusion by viewing own finger movement video. Observation condition was observed own finger movement video. Before and after each condition, the brain activity of kinesthetic motor imagery was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The measure of brain activity under kinesthetic motor imagery was executed in five sets using block design. Under the kinesthetic motor imagery, participants were asked to imagine the movement of their right finger. Functional connectivity was analyzed during the kinesthetic motor imagery. In addition, after performing the task under kinesthetic motor imagery, the vividness of the kinesthetic motor imagery was measured using a visual analog scale. Furthermore, after each condition, the degree of kinesthetic illusion and sense of body ownership measured based on a seven-point Likert scale. Our results indicated that the functional connectivity during kinesthetic motor imagery was changed in the frontal-parietal network of the right hemisphere. The vividness of the kinesthetic motor imagery was significantly higher with the illusion condition compared with the observation condition. The degree of kinesthetic illusion and sense of body ownership were significantly higher with the illusion condition compared with the observation condition. In conclusion, the visual-motor illusion changes the functional connectivity during kinesthetic motor imagery and influences the vividness of kinesthetic motor imagery. The visual-motor illusion provides evidence that it improves motor imagery ability. VMI may be used in patients with impaired motor imagery.</p>

<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus (HIPP) are two key brain regions associated with pain and pain-related affective processing. However, whether and how pelvic pain alters the neural activity and connectivity of the ACC and HIPP under baseline and during social pain, and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with electrophysiology and biochemistry, we show that pelvic pain, particularly, primary dysmenorrhea (PDM), causes an increase in the functional connectivity between ACC and HIPP in resting-state fMRI, and a smaller reduction in connectivity during social exclusion in PDM females with periovulatory phase. Similarly, model rats demonstrate significantly increased ACC-HIPP synchronization in the gamma band, associating with reduced modulation by ACC-theta on HIPP-gamma and increased levels of receptor proteins and excitation. This study brings together human fMRI and animal research and enables improved therapeutic strategies for ameliorating pain and pain-related affective processing.</p>

<p>Synapse degeneration in the striatum has been associated with the early stages of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases (PD and HD). However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger synaptic dysfunction and loss are not fully understood. Increasing evidence suggests that deficiency in Wnt signaling triggers synapse degeneration in the adult brain and that this pathway is affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Wnt signaling is essential for the integrity of a subset of inhibitory synapses on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We found that inducible expression of the specific Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) in the adult striatum leads to the loss of inhibitory synapses on MSNs and affects the synaptic transmission of D2-MSNs. We also discovered that re-activation of the Wnt pathway by turning off Dkk1 expression after substantial loss of synapses resulted in the complete recovery of GABAergic and dopamine synapse number. Our results also show that re-activation of the Wnt pathway leads to a recovery of amphetamine response and motor function. Our studies identify the Wnt signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for restoring neuronal circuits after synapse degeneration.</p>

<p>The mechanisms of synaptic plasticity differ in distinct local circuits. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) at apical dendrites in stratum radiatum and basal dendrites in stratum oriens involve different molecular cascades. For instance, participation of nitric oxide in LTP induction was shown to be necessary only for apical dendrites. This phenomenon may play a key role in information processing in CA1, and one of the reasons for this difference may be differing synaptic characteristics in these regions. Here, we compared the synaptic responses to stimulation of apical and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons and found a difference in the current–voltage characteristics of these inputs, which is presumably due to a distinct contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors to synaptic transmission. In addition, we obtained data that indicate the presence of these receptors in pyramidal dendrites in both stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. We also demonstrated that inhibition of NO synthase reduced the contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors at apical but not basal dendrites, and inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase did not affect this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Neurodevelopment in humans is a long, elaborate, and highly coordinated process involving three trimesters of prenatal development followed by decades of postnatal development and maturation. Throughout this period, the brain is highly sensitive and responsive to the external environment, which may provide a range of inputs leading to positive or negative outcomes. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Although the molecular mechanisms of FASD are not fully characterized, they involve alterations to the regulation of gene expression via epigenetic marks. As in the prenatal stages, the postnatal period of neurodevelopment is also sensitive to environmental inputs. Often this sensitivity is reflected in children facing adverse conditions, such as maternal separation. This exposure to early life stress (ELS) is implicated in the manifestation of various behavioral abnormalities. Most FASD research has focused exclusively on the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure in isolation. Here, we review the research into the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure and ELS, with a focus on the continuum of epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations. Interestingly, a select few experiments have assessed the cumulative effect of prenatal alcohol and postnatal maternal separation stress. Regulatory regions of different sets of genes are affected by both treatments independently, and a unique set of genes are affected by the combination of treatments. Notably, epigenetic and gene expression changes converge at the clustered protocadherin locus and oxidative stress pathway. Functional studies using epigenetic editing may elucidate individual contributions of regulatory regions for hub genes and further profiling efforts may lead to the development of non-invasive methods to identify children at risk. Taken together, the results favor the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes by epigenetic management of children born with FASD using favorable postnatal conditions with or without therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>It is well established that CNS axons fail to regenerate, undergo retrograde dieback, and form dystrophic growth cones due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We sought to investigate the role of axonal mitochondria in the axonal response to injury. A viral vector (AAV) containing a mitochondrially targeted fluorescent protein (mitoDsRed) as well as fluorescently tagged LC3 (GFP-LC3), an autophagosomal marker, was injected into the primary motor cortex, to label the corticospinal tract (CST), of adult rats. The axons of the CST were then injured by dorsal column lesion at C4-C5. We found that mitochondria in injured CST axons near the injury site are fragmented and fragmentation of mitochondria persists for 2 weeks before returning to pre-injury lengths. Fragmented mitochondria have consistently been shown to be dysfunctional and detrimental to cellular health. Inhibition of Drp1, the GTPase responsible for mitochondrial fission, using a specific pharmacological inhibitor (mDivi-1) blocked fragmentation. Additionally, it was determined that there is increased mitophagy in CST axons following Spinal cord injury (SCI) based on increased colocalization of mitochondria and LC3. In vitro models revealed that mitochondrial divalent ion uptake is necessary for injury-induced mitochondrial fission, as inhibiting the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) using RU360 prevented injury-induced fission. This phenomenon was also observed in vivo. These studies indicate that following the injury, both in vivo and in vitro, axonal mitochondria undergo increased fission, which may contribute to the lack of regeneration seen in CNS neurons.</p>

<p>Neurite atrophy with loss of neuronal polarity is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. While there is substantial agreement that disruption of intracellular vesicle trafficking is associated with axonal pathology in AD, comparatively less is known regarding its role in dendritic atrophy. This is a significant gap of knowledge because, unlike axons, dendrites are endowed with the complete endomembrane system comprising endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), Golgi apparatus, post-Golgi vesicles, and a recycling-degradative route. In this study, using live-imaging of pGOLT-expressing vesicles, indicative of Golgi outposts and satellites, we investigate how amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers affect the trafficking of Golgi-like organelles in the different dendritic compartments of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We found that short-term (4 h) treatment with Aβ led to a decrease in anterograde trafficking of Golgi vesicles in dendrites of both resting and stimulated (with 50 mM KCl) neurons. We also characterized the ability of mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic tetracyclic antidepressant (NaSSA), to rescue Golgi dynamics in dendrites. Mirtazapine treatment (10 μM) increased the number and both anterograde and retrograde motility, reducing the percentage of static Golgi vesicles. Finally, mirtazapine reverted the neurite atrophy induced by 24 h treatment with Aβ oligomers, suggesting that this drug is able to counteract the effects of Aβ by improving the dendritic trafficking of Golgi-related vesicles.</p>

<p>SK, HCN, and M channels are medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP)-mediating ion channels. The three channels co-express in various brain regions, and their collective action strongly influences cellular excitability. However, significant diversity exists in the expression of channel isoforms in distinct brain regions and various subcellular compartments, which contributes to an equally diverse set of specific neuronal functions. The current review emphasizes the collective behavior of the three classes of mAHP channels and discusses how these channels function together although they play specialized roles. We discuss the biophysical properties of these channels, signaling pathways that influence the activity of the three mAHP channels, various chemical modulators that alter channel activity and their therapeutic potential in treating various neurological anomalies. Additionally, we discuss the role of mAHP channels in the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases and how their modulation can alleviate some of the symptoms.</p>

<p>The pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the formation of multifocal demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of innate receptors has been shown to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an MS-like disease in mice. Specifically, targeting Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and NOD-like receptor 2 (NOD2) significantly reduced disease severity. In the present work we have developed a novel focal EAE model to further study the effect of innate signaling on demyelinating pathology. Focal lesions were induced by stereotactic needle insertion into the corpus callosum (CC) of mice previously immunized for EAE. This resulted in focal pathology characterized by infiltration and demyelination in the CC. We find that intrathecal delivery of MIS416, a TLR9 and NOD2 bispecific innate ligand, into the cerebrospinal fluid reduced focal lesions in the CC. This was associated with upregulation of type I and II interferons, interleukin-10, arginase-1, CCL-2 and CXCL-10. Analysis of draining cervical lymph nodes showed upregulation of type II interferons and interleukin 10. Moreover, intrathecal MIS416 altered the composition of early CNS infiltrates, increasing proportions of myeloid and NK cells and reducing T cells at the lesion site. This study contributes to an increased understanding of how innate immune responses can play a protective role, which in turn may lead to additional therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of demyelinating pathologies.</p>

<p>At present, lots of studies have tried to apply machine learning to different electroencephalography (EEG) measures for diagnosing schizophrenia (SZ) patients. However, most EEG measures previously used are either a univariate measure or a single type of brain connectivity, which may not fully capture the abnormal brain changes of SZ patients. In this paper, event-related potentials were collected from 45 SZ patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) during a learning task, and then a combination of partial directed coherence (PDC) effective and phase lag index (PLI) functional connectivity were used as features to train a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation for classification of SZ from HCs. Our results indicated that an excellent classification performance (accuracy = 95.16%, specificity = 94.44%, and sensitivity = 96.15%) was obtained when the combination of functional and effective connectivity features was used, and the corresponding optimal feature number was 15, which included 12 PDC and three PLI connectivity features. The selected effective connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal/central and visual/parietal lobes, and the selected functional connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal and visual cortexes of the right hemisphere. In addition, most of the selected effective connectivity abnormally enhanced in SZ patients compared with HCs, whereas all the selected functional connectivity features decreased in SZ patients. The above results showed that our proposed method has great potential to become a tool for the auxiliary diagnosis of SZ.</p>

Purpose<p>To extract texture features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of patients with brain tumors and use them to train a classification model for supporting an early diagnosis.</p>Methods<p>Two groups of regions (control and tumor) were selected from MRI scans of 40 patients with meningioma or glioma. These regions were analyzed to obtain texture features. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 20.0), including the Shapiro–Wilk test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which were used to test significant differences in each feature between the tumor and healthy regions. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was used to visualize the data distribution so as to avoid tumor selection bias. The Gini impurity index in random forests (RFs) was used to select the top five out of all features. Based on the five features, three classification models were built respectively with three machine learning classifiers: RF, support vector machine (SVM), and back propagation (BP) neural network.</p>Results<p>Sixteen of the 25 features were significantly different between the tumor and healthy areas. Through the Gini impurity index in RFs, standard deviation, first-order moment, variance, third-order absolute moment, and third-order central moment were selected to build the classification model. The classification model trained using the SVM classifier achieved the best performance, with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 94.04%, 92.3%, and 0.932, respectively.</p>Conclusion<p>Texture analysis with an SVM classifier can help differentiate between brain tumor and healthy areas with high speed and accuracy, which would facilitate its clinical application.</p>

<p>Accurate neuron morphologies are paramount for computational model simulations of realistic neural responses. Over the last decade, the online repository NeuroMorpho.Org has collected over 140,000 available neuron morphologies to understand brain function and promote interaction between experimental and computational research. Neuron morphologies describe spatial aspects of neural structure; however, many of the available morphologies do not contain accurate diameters that are essential for computational simulations of electrical activity. To best utilize available neuron morphologies, we present a set of equations that predict dendritic diameter from other morphological features. To derive the equations, we used a set of NeuroMorpho.org archives with realistic neuron diameters, representing hippocampal pyramidal, cerebellar Purkinje, and striatal spiny projection neurons. Each morphology is separated into initial, branching children, and continuing nodes. Our analysis reveals that the diameter of preceding nodes, Parent Diameter, is correlated to diameter of subsequent nodes for all cell types. Branching children and initial nodes each required additional morphological features to predict diameter, such as path length to soma, total dendritic length, and longest path to terminal end. Model simulations reveal that membrane potential response with predicted diameters is similar to the original response for several tested morphologies. We provide our open source software to extend the utility of available NeuroMorpho.org morphologies, and suggest predictive equations may supplement morphologies that lack dendritic diameter and improve model simulations with realistic dendritic diameter.</p>

<p>This article extends a recent methodological workflow for creating realistic and computationally efficient neuron models whilst capturing essential aspects of single-neuron dynamics. We overcome the intrinsic limitations of the extant optimization methods by proposing an alternative optimization component based on multimodal algorithms. This approach can natively explore a diverse population of neuron model configurations. In contrast to methods that focus on a single global optimum, the multimodal method allows directly obtaining a set of promising solutions for a single but complex multi-feature objective function. The final sparse population of candidate solutions has to be analyzed and evaluated according to the biological plausibility and their objective to the target features by the expert. In order to illustrate the value of this approach, we base our proposal on the optimization of cerebellar granule cell (GrC) models that replicate the essential properties of the biological cell. Our results show the emerging variability of plausible sets of values that this type of neuron can adopt underlying complex spiking characteristics. Also, the set of selected cerebellar GrC models captured spiking dynamics closer to the reference model than the single model obtained with off-the-shelf parameter optimization algorithms used in our previous article. The method hereby proposed represents a valuable strategy for adjusting a varied population of realistic and simplified neuron models. It can be applied to other kinds of neuron models and biological contexts.</p>

<p>Background and Objectives: Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have difficulty learning motor skills, which can affect their participation in activities of daily living and psychosocial well-being. Over 50% of children with DCD also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which further exacerbates their motor problems and impact on quality of life. A rehabilitation approach known as Cognitive Orientation to Occupational Performance uses problem-solving strategies to help children learn motor skills they wish to achieve. While this cognitive approach has been effective for children with DCD, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this approach for children with co-occurring ADHD. Further, the underlying mechanism and neural basis of this intervention are largely unknown.</p><p>Methods: In this randomized waitlist-controlled trial, we used MRI to examine white matter microstructure after intervention in 8–12-year-old children with DCD (n = 28) and with DCD and co-occurring ADHD (n = 25). Children in both groups were randomized to either a treatment group or waitlist group at their first MRI. The treatment group began the intervention after their MRI scan and returned for a post-treatment scan at 3 months, and follow-up scan at 6 months; the waitlist group waited 3 months before their second MRI, received the intervention, and then had a post-treatment scan. Each child received intervention once weekly for 10 weeks. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to acquire white matter diffusion parameters and was analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).</p><p>Results and Conclusion: Children with DCD showed significant improvement in white matter microstructure in the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral sensorimotor tract, bilateral cingulum, fornix, splenium and body of corpus callosum, right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and white matter pathways to bilateral inferior gyri, right middle frontal gyrus, frontal medial cortex, and left cuneus. We suggest that these rehabilitation-induced neural changes in children with DCD occurred in regions associated with attention, self-regulation, motor planning, and inter-hemispheric communication, which positively affected brain connectivity and motor function. In contrast, children with DCD and co-occurring ADHD did not show any brain changes following the intervention. Modifications to the treatment protocol might help address the attentional and self-regulatory needs of children with a dual diagnosis.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02597751.</p>

<p>Complex simultaneous neuropsychophysiological mechanisms are responsible for the processing of the information to be transmitted and for the neuromotor planning of the articulatory organs involved in speech. The nature of this set of mechanisms is closely linked to the clinical state of the subject. Thus, for example, in populations with neurodevelopmental deficits, these underlying neuropsychophysiological procedures are deficient and determine their phonation. Most of these cases with neurodevelopmental deficits are due to a genetic abnormality, as is the case in the population with Smith–Magenis syndrome (SMS). SMS is associated with neurodevelopmental deficits, intellectual disability, and a cohort of characteristic phenotypic features, including voice quality, which does not seem to be in line with the gender, age, and complexion of the diagnosed subject. The phonatory profile and speech features in this syndrome are dysphonia, high f0, excess vocal muscle stiffness, fluency alterations, numerous syllabic simplifications, phoneme omissions, and unintelligibility of speech. This exploratory study investigates whether the neuromotor deficits in children with SMS adversely affect phonation as compared to typically developing children without neuromotor deficits, which has not been previously determined. The authors compare the phonatory performance of a group of children with SMS (N = 12) with a healthy control group of children (N = 12) matched in age, gender, and grouped into two age ranges. The first group ranges from 5 to 7 years old, and the second group goes from 8 to 12 years old. Group differences were determined for two forms of acoustic analysis performed on repeated recordings of the sustained vowel /a/ F1 and F2 extraction and cepstral peak prominence (CPP). It is expected that the results will enlighten the question of the underlying neuromotor aspects of phonation in SMS population. These findings could provide evidence of the susceptibility of phonation of speech to neuromotor disturbances, regardless of their origin.</p>

<p>Transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation (tSCS) is an emerging technology that targets to restore functionally integrated neuromuscular control of gait. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a novel filtering method, Artifact Component Specific Rejection (ACSR), for removing artifacts induced by tSCS from surface electromyogram (sEMG) data for investigation of muscle response during walking when applying spinal stimulation. Both simulated and real tSCS contaminated sEMG data from six stroke survivors were processed using ACSR and notch filtering, respectively. The performance of the filters was evaluated with data collected in various conditions (e.g., simulated artifacts contaminating sEMG in multiple degrees, various tSCS intensities in five lower-limb muscles of six participants). In the simulation test, after applying the ACSR filter, the contaminated-signal was well matched with the original signal, showing a high correlation (r = 0.959) and low amplitude difference (normalized root means square error = 0.266) between them. In the real tSCS contaminated data, the ACSR filter showed superior performance on reducing the artifacts (96% decrease) over the notch filter (25% decrease). These results indicate that ACSR filtering is capable of eliminating artifacts from sEMG collected during tSCS application, improving the precision of quantitative analysis of muscle activity.</p>

<p>The first years of life might be critical for encouraging independent walking in children with cerebral palsy (CP). We sought to identify mechanisms that may underlie the impaired development of walking in three young children with early brain lesions, at high risk of CP, via comprehensive instrumented longitudinal assessments of locomotor patterns and muscle activation during walking. We followed three children (P1–P3) with early brain lesions, at high risk of CP, during five consecutive gait analysis sessions covering a period of 1 to 2 years, starting before the onset of independent walking, and including the session during the first independent steps. In the course of the study, P1 did not develop CP, P2 was diagnosed with unilateral and P3 with bilateral CP. We monitored the early development of locomotor patterns over time via spatiotemporal gait parameters, intersegmental coordination (estimated via principal component analysis), electromyography activity, and muscle synergies (determined from 11 bilateral muscles via nonnegative matrix factorization). P1 and P2 started to walk independently at the corrected age of 14 and 22 months, respectively. In both of them, spatiotemporal gait parameters, intersegmental coordination, muscle activation patterns, and muscle synergy structure changed from supported to independent walking, although to a lesser extent when unilateral CP was diagnosed (P2), especially for the most affected leg. The child with bilateral CP (P3) did not develop independent walking, and all the parameters did not change over time. Our exploratory longitudinal study revealed differences in maturation of locomotor patterns between children with divergent developmental trajectories. We succeeded in identifying mechanisms that may underlie impaired walking development in very young children at high risk of CP. When verified in larger sample sizes, our approach may be considered a means to improve prognosis and to pinpoint possible targets for early intervention.</p>

<p>Migraine is a symptomatically heterogeneous condition, of which headache is just one manifestation. Migraine is a disorder of altered sensory thresholding, with hypersensitivity among sufferers to sensory input. Advances in functional neuroimaging have highlighted that several brain areas are involved even prior to pain onset. Clinically, patients can experience symptoms hours to days prior to migraine pain, which can warn of impending headache. These symptoms can include mood and cognitive change, fatigue, and neck discomfort. Some epidemiological studies have suggested that migraine is associated in a bidirectional fashion with other disorders, such as mood disorders and chronic fatigue, as well as with other pain conditions such as fibromyalgia. This review will focus on the literature surrounding alterations in fatigue, mood, and cognition in particular, in association with migraine, and the suggested links to disorders such as chronic fatigue syndrome and depression. We hypothesize that migraine should be considered a neural disorder of brain function, in which alterations in aminergic networks integrating the limbic system with the sensory and homeostatic systems occur early and persist after headache resolution and perhaps interictally. The associations with some of these other disorders may allude to the inherent sensory sensitivity of the migraine brain and shared neurobiology and neurotransmitter systems rather than true co-morbidity.</p>

<p>Behavioral studies examining vowel perception in infancy indicate that, for many vowel contrasts, the ease of discrimination changes depending on the order of stimulus presentation, regardless of the language from which the contrast is drawn and the ambient language that infants have experienced. By adulthood, linguistic experience has altered vowel perception; analogous asymmetries are observed for non−native contrasts but are mitigated for native contrasts. Although these directional effects are well documented behaviorally, the brain mechanisms underlying them are poorly understood. In the present study we begin to address this gap. We first review recent behavioral work which shows that vowel perception asymmetries derive from phonetic encoding strategies, rather than general auditory processes. Two existing theoretical models–the Natural Referent Vowel framework and the Native Language Magnet model–are invoked as a means of interpreting these findings. Then we present the results of a neurophysiological study which builds on this prior work. Using event-related brain potentials, we first measured and assessed the mismatch negativity response (MMN, a passive neurophysiological index of auditory change detection) in English and French native-speaking adults to synthetic vowels that either spanned two different phonetic categories (/y/vs./u/) or fell within the same category (/u/). Stimulus presentation was organized such that each vowel was presented as standard and as deviant in different blocks. The vowels were presented with a long (1,600-ms) inter-stimulus interval to restrict access to short-term memory traces and tap into a “phonetic mode” of processing. MMN analyses revealed weak asymmetry effects regardless of the (i) vowel contrast, (ii) language group, and (iii) MMN time window. Then, we conducted time-frequency analyses of the standard epochs for each vowel. In contrast to the MMN analysis, time-frequency analysis revealed significant differences in brain oscillations in the theta band (4–8 Hz), which have been linked to attention and processing efficiency. Collectively, these findings suggest that early-latency (pre-attentive) mismatch responses may not be a strong neurophysiological correlate of asymmetric behavioral vowel discrimination. Rather, asymmetries may reflect differences in neural processing efficiency for vowels with certain inherent acoustic-phonetic properties, as revealed by theta oscillatory activity.</p>

<p>Feedback outcomes are generally classified into positive and negative feedback. People often predict a feedback outcome with information that is based on both objective facts and uncertain subjective information, such as a mood. For example, if an action leads to good results consecutively, people performing the action overestimate the behavioral result of the next action. In electroencephalogram measurements, negative feedback evokes negative potential, called feedback negativity, and positive feedback evokes positive potential, called reward positivity. The present study investigated the relationship between the degree of the mood caused by the feedback outcome and the error-related brain potentials. We measured the electroencephalogram activity while the participants played a virtual reality shooting game. The experimental task was to shoot down a cannonball flying toward the player using a handgun. The task difficulty was determined from the size and curve of the flying cannonball. These gaming parameters affected the outcome probability of shooting the target in the game. We also implemented configurations in the game, such as the player’s life points and play times. These configurations affected the outcome magnitude of shooting the target in the game. Moreover, we used the temporal accuracy of shooting in the game as the parameter of the mood. We investigated the relationship between these experimental features and the event-related potentials using the single-trial-based linear mixed-effects model analysis. The feedback negativity was observed at an error trial, and its amplitude was modulated with the outcome probability and the mood. Conversely, reward positivity was observed at hit trials, but its amplitude was modulated with the outcome probability and outcome magnitude. This result suggests that feedback negativity is enhanced according to not only the feedback probability but also the mood that was changed depending on the temporal gaming outcome.</p>

<p>Holometabolic organisms undergo extensive remodelling of their neuromuscular system during metamorphosis. Relatively, little is known whether or not the embryonic guidance of molecules and axonal growth mechanisms are re-activated for the innervation of a very different set of adult muscles. Here, we show that the axonal attractant Sidestep (Side) is re-expressed during Drosophila metamorphosis and is indispensable for neuromuscular wiring. Mutations in side cause severe innervation defects in all legs. Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) show a reduced density or are completely absent at multi-fibre muscles. Misinnervation strongly impedes, but does not completely abolish motor behaviours, including walking, flying, or grooming. Overexpression of Side in developing muscles induces similar innervation defects; for example, at indirect flight muscles, it causes flightlessness. Since muscle-specific overexpression of Side is unlikely to affect the central circuits, the resulting phenotypes seem to correlate with faulty muscle wiring. We further show that mutations in beaten path Ia (beat), a receptor for Side, results in similar weaker adult innervation and locomotion phenotypes, indicating that embryonic guidance pathways seem to be reactivated during metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Bacterial meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges which covers and protects the brain and the spinal cord. Such inflammation is mostly caused by blood-borne bacteria that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and finally invade the brain parenchyma. Pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae are the main etiological causes of bacterial meningitis. After trafficking across the BBB, bacterial pathogens in the brain interact with neurons, the fundamental units of Central Nervous System, and other types of glial cells. Although the specific molecular mechanism behind the interaction between such pathogens with neurons is still under investigation, it is clear that bacterial interaction with neurons and neuroinflammatory responses within the brain leads to neuronal cell death. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown indications of meningitis-caused dementia; and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease are characterized by the loss of neurons, which, unlike many other eukaryotic cells, once dead or damaged, they are seldom replaced. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the knowledge on how bacterial pathogens in the brain damage neurons through direct and indirect interactions, and how the neuronal damage caused by bacterial pathogen can, in the long-term, influence the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Altered structure, expression, and regulation of the presynaptic serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) have been associated with multiple neurobehavioral disorders, including mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Opportunities to investigate mechanistic links supporting these associations were spurred with the identification of multiple, rare human SERT coding variants in a study that established a male-specific linkage of ASD to a linkage marker on chromosome 17 which encompassed the location of the SERT gene (SLC6A4). We have explored the most common of these variants, SERT Ala56, in vitro and in vivo. Results support a tonic elevation of 5-HT transport activity in transfected cells and human lymphoblasts by the variant in vitro that leads to an increased 5-HT clearance rate in vivo when studied in the SERT Ala56 mouse model, along with altered sensitivity to SERT regulatory signaling pathways. Importantly, hyperserotonemia, or an elevated whole blood 5-HT, level, was found in SERT Ala56 mice, reproducing a well-replicated trait observed in a significant fraction of ASD subjects. Additionally, we found multiple biochemical, physiological, and behavioral alterations in the SERT Ala56 mice that can be analogized to those observed in ASD and its medical comorbidities. The similarity of the functional impact of the SERT Ala56 variant to the consequences of p38α MAPK activation, ascribed to the induction of a biased conformation of the transporter toward an outward-facing conformation, has resulted in successful efforts to restore normal behavioral and bowel function via pharmacological and genetic p38α MAPK targeting. Moreover, the ability of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to enhance SERT activity via a p38α MAPK-dependent pathway suggests that the SERT Ala56 conformation mimics that of a chronic inflammatory state, supporting findings in ASD of elevated inflammatory cytokine levels. In this report, we review studies of the SERT Ala56 variant, discussing opportunities for continued insight into how chronically altered synaptic 5-HT homeostasis can drive reversible, functional perturbations in 5-HT sensitive pathways in the brain and periphery, and how targeting the SERT regulome, particularly through activating pathways such as those involving IL-1β/p38α MAPK, may be of benefit for neurobehavioral disorders, including ASD.</p>

<p>Administration of 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) has been demonstrated to alleviate infarction following ischemic stroke. Reportedly, the main effect of AUDA is exerting anti-inflammation and neovascularization via the inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase. However, the major contribution of this anti-inflammation and neovascularization effect in the acute phase of stroke is not completely elucidated. To investigate the neuroprotective effects of AUDA in acute ischemic stroke, we combined laser speckle contrast imaging and optical intrinsic signal imaging techniques with the implantation of a lab-designed cranial window. Forepaw stimulation was applied to assess the functional changes via measuring cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) that accompany neural activity. The rats that received AUDA in the acute phase of photothrombotic ischemia stroke showed a 30.5 ± 8.1% reduction in the ischemic core, 42.3 ± 15.1% reduction in the ischemic penumbra (p &lt; 0.05), and 42.1 ± 4.6% increase of CMRO<sub>2</sub> in response to forepaw stimulation at post-stroke day 1 (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the control group (N = 10 for each group). Moreover, at post-stroke day 3, increased functional vascular density was observed in AUDA-treated rats (35.9 ± 1.9% higher than that in the control group, p &lt; 0.05). At post-stroke day 7, a 105.4% ± 16.4% increase of astrocytes (p &lt; 0.01), 30.0 ± 10.9% increase of neurons (p &lt; 0.01), and 65.5 ± 15.0% decrease of microglia (p &lt; 0.01) were observed in the penumbra region in AUDA-treated rats (N = 5 for each group). These results suggested that AUDA affects the anti-inflammation at the beginning of ischemic injury and restores neuronal metabolic rate of O<sub>2</sub> and tissue viability. The neovascularization triggered by AUDA restored CBF and may contribute to ischemic infarction reduction at post-stroke day 3. Moreover, for long-term neuroprotection, astrocytes in the penumbra region may play an important role in protecting neurons from apoptotic injury.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a unique regulated cell death defined by the intracellular iron overload and distinct biological features compared with other well-known programmed cell death. Ferroptosis can be triggered by many causes including decreased expression of glutathione (GSH), inhibition of the function of glutathione-dependent peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and system x<sub>c</sub><sup>–</sup>, all of which finally lead to the over-accumulation of lipid peroxides in the cell. Ferroptosis has been reported to play an important role in the pathophysiological process of various cancers. In recent years, much evidence also proved that ferroptosis is involved in the progress of cerebral stroke. In this review, we summarized the characteristics of ferroptosis and the potential relationship between ferroptosis and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, to provide new targets and ideas for the therapy of stroke.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, and it is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as well as the presence of intracellular inclusions with α-synuclein as the main component in surviving DA neurons. Emerging evidence suggests that the imbalance of proteostasis is a key pathogenic factor for PD. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, two major pathways for maintaining proteostasis, play important roles in PD pathology and are considered as attractive therapeutic targets for PD treatment. However, although ER stress/UPR and autophagy appear to be independent cellular processes, they are closely related to each other. In this review, we focused on the roles and molecular cross-links between ER stress/UPR and autophagy in PD pathology. We systematically reviewed and summarized the most recent advances in regulation of ER stress/UPR and autophagy, and their cross-linking mechanisms. We also reviewed and discussed the mechanisms of the coexisting ER stress/UPR activation and dysregulated autophagy in the lesion regions of PD patients, and the underlying roles and molecular crosslinks between ER stress/UPR activation and the dysregulated autophagy in DA neurodegeneration induced by PD-associated genetic factors and PD-related neurotoxins. Finally, we indicate that the combined regulation of ER stress/UPR and autophagy would be a more effective treatment for PD rather than regulating one of these conditions alone.</p>

<p>It has previously been demonstrated that short-term foreign language learning can lead to structural brain changes in younger adults. Experience-dependent brain plasticity is known to be possible also in older age, but the specific effect of foreign language learning on brain structure in language-and memory-relevant regions in the old brain remains unknown. In the present study, 160 older Swedish adults (65–75 years) were randomized to complete either an entry-level Italian course or a relaxation course, both with a total duration of 11 weeks. Structural MRI scans were conducted before and after the intervention in a subset of participants to test for differential change in gray matter in the two groups in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the hippocampus, and in white matter microstructure in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the hippocampal (HC) section of the cingulum. The study found no evidence for differential structural change following language training, independent of achieved vocabulary proficiency. However, hippocampal volume and associative memory ability before the intervention were found to be robust predictors of vocabulary proficiency at the end of the language course. The results suggest that having greater hippocampal volume and better associative memory ability benefits vocabulary learning in old age but that the very initial stage of foreign language learning does not trigger detectable changes in brain morphometry in old age.</p>

<p>The spectrum of health complications instigated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been diverse and complex. Besides the evident pulmonary and cardiovascular threats, accumulating clinical data points to several neurological complications, which are more common in elderly COVID-19 patients. Recent pieces of evidence have marked events of neuro infection and neuroinvasion, producing several neurological complications in COVID-19 patients; however, a systematic understanding of neuro-pathophysiology and manifested neurological complications, more specifically in elderly COVID-19 patients is largely elusive. Since the elderly population gradually develops neurological disorders with aging, COVID-19 inevitably poses a higher risk of neurological manifestations to the aged patients. In this report, we reviewed SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in neurological manifestations with an emphasis on the elderly population. We reviewed neuropathological events including neuroinfection, neuroinvasion, and their underlying mechanisms affecting neuromuscular, central- and peripheral- nervous systems. We further assessed the imminent neurological challenges in the COVID-19 exposed population, post-SARS-CoV-2-infection. Given the present state of clinical preparedness, the emerging role of AI and machine learning was also discussed concerning COVID-19 diagnostics and its management. Taken together, the present review summarizes neurological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications, specifically in elderly patients, and underlines the need for their clinical management in advance.</p>

<p>Intracellular amyloid β (Aβ) injection suppresses the large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium (BK) channel in cortical pyramidal cells from wild-type (WT) mice. In 3xTg Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model mice, intraneuronal Aβ is genetically programed to accumulate, which suppresses the BK channel. However, the mode of BK channel suppression remained unclarified. The present report revealed that only one (11A1) of the three anti-Aβ-oligomer antibodies that we examined, but not anti-monomer-Aβ-antibodies, was effective in recovering BK channel activity in 3xTg neurons. Antibodies against amyloid precursor protein (APP) were also found to be effective, suggesting that APP plays an essential part in this Aβ-oligomer-induced BK channel suppression in 3xTg neurons. In WT neurons, by contrast, APP suppressed BK channels by itself, which suggests that either APP or Aβ is sufficient to block BK channels, thus pointing to a different co-operativity of Aβ and APP in WT and 3xTg neurons. To clarify this difference, we relied on our previous finding that the scaffold protein Homer1a reverses the BK channel blockade in both WT and 3xTg neurons. In cortical neurons from 3xTg mice that bear Homer1a knockout (4xTg mice), neither anti-APP antibodies nor 11A1, but only the 6E10 antibody that binds both APP and Aβ, rescued the BK channel suppression. Given that Homer1a expression is activity dependent and 3xTg neurons are hyperexcitable, Homer1a is likely to be expressed sufficiently in 3xTg neurons, thereby alleviating the suppressive influence of APP and Aβ on BK channel. A unique way that APP modifies Aβ toxicity is thus proposed.</p>

<p>Background: Other than its direct impact on cardiopulmonary health, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection affects additional body systems, especially in older adults. Several studies have reported acute neurological symptoms that present at onset or develop during hospitalisation, with associated neural injuries. Whilst the acute neurological phase is widely documented, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on neurocognitive functioning remain unknown. Although an evidence-based framework describing the disease chronic phase is premature, it is important to lay the foundations for future data-driven models. This systematic review aimed at summarising the literature on neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older over-60 patients with COVID-19 following a cognitive neuroscientific perspective, to clarify the most vulnerable brain areas and speculate on the possible cognitive consequences.</p><p>Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant manuscripts published between 1st March 2020 and 31th December 2020. Outputs were screened and selected by two assessors. Relevant studies not detected by literature search were added manually.</p><p>Results: Ninety studies, mainly single cases and case series, were included. Several neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older patients with COVID-19 emerged from these studies, with cerebrovascular damage having a prominent role. Abnormalities (hyperintensities, hypoperfusion, inflammation, and cellular damage) were reported in most brain areas. The most consistent cross-aetiology findings were in white matter, brainstem and fronto-temporal areas. Viral DNA was detected mainly in olfactory, orbitofrontal and brainstem areas.</p><p>Conclusion: Studies on COVID-19 related neural damage are rich and diverse, but limited to description of hospitalised patients with fatal outcome (i.e., in neuropathological studies) or severe symptoms (i.e., in neuroimaging studies). The damage seen in this population indicates acute and largely irreversible dysfunction to neural regions involved in major functional networks that support normal cognitive and behavioural functioning. It is still unknown whether the long-term impact of the virus will be limited to chronic evolution of acute events, whether sub-clinical pathological processes will be exacerbated or whether novel mechanisms will emerge. Based on current literature, future theoretical frameworks describing the long-term impact of COVID-19 infection on mental abilities will have to factor in major trends of aetiological and topographic heterogeneity.</p>

<p>As a severe neurological deficit, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with overwhelming mortality. Subsequent oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction are likely to cause secondary brain injury. Therefore, this study sought to define the role of Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and underlying mechanism in oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction following ICH. An in vivo model of ICH was established in rats by injection of autologous blood, and an in vitro ICH cell model was developed in hippocampal neurons by oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) exposure. Next, gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed in vivo and in vitro to clarify the effect of KLF6 on neurological dysfunction and oxidative stress in ICH rats and neuronal apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in OxyHb-induced hippocampal neurons. KLF6, nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were highly expressed in hippocampal tissues of ICH rats, whereas sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) presented a poor expression. Mechanistically, KLF6 bound to the SIRT5 promoter and transcriptionally repressed SIRT5 to activate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. KLF6 silencing alleviated neurological dysfunction and oxidative stress in ICH rats and diminished oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in OxyHb-induced neurons, whereas SIRT5 overexpression negated its effect. To sum up, KLF6 silencing elevated SIRT5 expression to inactivate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thus attenuating oxidative stress and neurological dysfunction after ICH.</p>

<p>Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) manifests differently in males and females. However, the neuro-mechanism and influence factors are still unknown.</p><p>Objective: To explore sex differences in brain network topology during AD disease progression and its association with cognition and possible influencing factors.</p><p>Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and cognitive scores were collected from 82 AD patients (50 females), 56 amnestic mildly cognitive impaired patients (29 females), and 63 healthy controls (38 females). Global and regional topological network metrics and modular architecture were calculated. Two-way ANOVA was performed to explore group and sex interactions and their main effects. Mediation analysis was used to explore the relationship among education, inter/intra-network connectivity, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.</p><p>Results: Lower levels of education, lower MMSE scores, and a positive correlation between the level of education and MMSE scores were found in female AD patients (p = 0.024, r = 0.319). Significantly lower connectivity strength within the sensorimotor network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network (VAN), and between the sensorimotor and VAN were observed in male AD patients (p = 0.006, 0.028, 0.046, and 0.013, respectively). Group and sex interactions were also found in nodal properties, mainly in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, middle cingulum, precuneus, and postcentral gyrus. Several of the altered brain network properties were associated with cognitive behavior in male AD patients. Education regulated the MMSE score through the mediation of connection strength between the default mode and limbic networks (LN) in the patient group (aMCI and AD combined).</p><p>Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that sex differences exist at the brain network level in AD. Sex differences in network topology and education are correlated with sex differences in cognition during AD progression.</p>

<p>Impairment in spatial navigation (SN) and structural network topology is not limited to patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia and can be detected earlier in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We recruited 32 MCI patients (65.91 ± 11.33 years old) and 28 normal cognition patients (NC; 69.68 ± 10.79 years old), all of whom underwent a computer-based battery of SN tests evaluating egocentric, allocentric, and mixed SN strategies and diffusion-weighted and T<sub>1</sub>-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). To evaluate the topological features of the structural connectivity network, we calculated its measures such as the global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and shortest path length with GRETNA. We determined the correlation between SN accuracy and network topological properties. Compared to NC, MCI subjects demonstrated a lower egocentric navigation accuracy. Compared with NC, MCI subjects showed significantly decreased clustering coefficients in the left middle frontal gyrus, right rectus, right superior parietal gyrus, and right inferior parietal gyrus and decreased shortest path length in the left paracentral lobule. We observed significant positive correlations of the shortest path length in the left paracentral lobule with both the mixed allocentric–egocentric and the allocentric accuracy measured by the average total errors. A decreased clustering coefficient in the right inferior parietal gyrus was associated with a larger allocentric navigation error. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) did not affect the correlation between network properties and SN accuracy. This study demonstrated that structural connectivity network abnormalities, especially in the frontal and parietal gyri, are associated with a lower SN accuracy, independently of WMH, providing a new insight into the brain mechanisms associated with SN impairment in MCI.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68311">Tight nanoscale clustering of Fcγ receptors using DNA origami promotes phagocytosis</a></h4>

Macrophages destroy pathogens and diseased cells through Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-driven phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized targets. Phagocytosis requires activation of multiple FcγRs, but the mechanism controlling the threshold for response is unclear. We developed a DNA origami-based engulfment system that allows precise nanoscale control of the number and spacing of ligands. When the number of ligands remains constant, reducing ligand spacing from 17.5 nm to 7 nm potently enhances engulfment, primarily by increasing efficiency of the engulfment-initiation process. Tighter ligand clustering increases receptor phosphorylation, as well as proximal downstream signals. Increasing the number of signaling domains recruited to a single ligand-receptor complex was not sufficient to recapitulate this effect, indicating that clustering of multiple receptors is required. Our results suggest that macrophages use information about local ligand densities to make critical engulfment decisions, which has implications for the mechanism of antibody-mediated phagocytosis and the design of immunotherapies.

Consolation is a common response to the distress of others in humans and some social animals, but the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior are not well characterized. By using socially monogamous mandarin voles, we found that optogenetic or chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HTergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) or optogenetic inhibition of 5-HT terminals in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) significantly decreased allogrooming time in the consolation test and reduced sociability in the three-chamber test. The release of 5-HT within the ACC and the activity of DR neurons were significantly increased during allogrooming, sniffing and social approaching. Finally, we found that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the ACC was sufficient to reverse consolation and sociability deficits induced by the chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HTergic neurons in the DR. Our study provided first direct evidence that DR-ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit is implicated in consolation-like behaviors and sociability.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67489">Kinesin-6 Klp9 orchestrates spindle elongation by regulating microtubule sliding and growth</a></h4>

Mitotic spindle function depends on the precise regulation of microtubule dynamics and microtubule sliding. Throughout mitosis, both processes have to be orchestrated to establish and maintain spindle stability. We show that during anaphase B spindle elongation in <i>S. pombe</i>, the sliding motor Klp9 (kinesin-6) also promotes microtubule growth <i>in vivo.</i> <i>In vitro</i>, Klp9 can enhance and dampen microtubule growth, depending on the tubulin concentration. This indicates that the motor is able to promote and block tubulin subunit incorporation into the microtubule lattice in order to set a well-defined microtubule growth velocity. Moreover, Klp9 recruitment to spindle microtubules is dependent on its dephosphorylation mediated by XMAP215/Dis1, a microtubule polymerase, creating a link between the regulation of spindle length and spindle elongation velocity. Collectively, we unravel the mechanism of anaphase B, from Klp9 recruitment to the motors dual-function in regulating microtubule sliding and microtubule growth, allowing an inherent coordination of both processes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67024">Latent gammaherpesvirus exacerbates arthritis through modification of age-associated B cells</a></h4>

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults, though the nature of the relationship remains unknown. Herein, we examine the contribution of viral infection to the severity of arthritis in mice. We provide the first evidence that latent gammaherpesvirus infection enhances clinical arthritis, modeling EBV's role in RA. Mice latently infected with a murine analog of EBV, gammaherpesvirus 68 (gHV68), develop more severe collagen-induced arthritis and a Th1-skewed immune profile reminiscent of human disease. We demonstrate that disease enhancement requires viral latency and is not due to active virus stimulation of the immune response. Age-associated B cells (ABCs) are associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including arthritis, though their contribution to disease is not well understood. Using ABC knockout mice, we provide the first evidence that ABCs are mechanistically required for viral enhancement of disease, thereby establishing that ABCs are impacted by latent gammaherpesvirus infection and provoke arthritis.

<p>by Pengcheng Zeng, Zhixiang Lin</p>

Technological advances have enabled us to profile multiple molecular layers at unprecedented single-cell resolution and the available datasets from multiple samples or domains are growing. These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose <i>couple</i>CoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. <i>couple</i>CoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In <i>couple</i>CoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. <i>couple</i>CoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, <i>couple</i>CoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying <i>couple</i>CoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that <i>couple</i>CoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. <i>couple</i>CoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient.

Modern analytical techniques enable researchers to collect data about cellular states, before and after perturbations. These states can be characterized using analytical techniques, but the inference of regulatory interactions that explain and predict changes in these states remains a challenge. Here we present a generalizable, unsupervised approach to generate parameter-free, logic-based models of cellular processes, described by multiple discrete states. Our algorithm employs a Hamming-distance based approach to formulate, test, and identify optimized logic rules that link two states. Our approach comprises two steps. First, a model with no prior knowledge except for the mapping between initial and attractor states is built. We then employ biological constraints to improve model fidelity. Our algorithm automatically recovers the relevant dynamics for the explored models and recapitulates key aspects of the biochemical species concentration dynamics in the original model.

Nutrient-responsive protein kinases control the balance between anabolic growth and catabolic processes such as autophagy. Aberrant regulation of these kinases is a major cause of human disease. We report here that the vertebrate nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and N-terminal myristylation sites (SRMS) inhibits autophagy and promotes growth in a nutrient-responsive manner. Under nutrient-replete conditions, SRMS phosphorylates the PHLPP scaffold FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), disrupts the FKBP51-PHLPP complex, and promotes FKBP51 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This prevents PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of AKT, causing sustained AKT activation that promotes growth and inhibits autophagy. SRMS is amplified and overexpressed in human cancers where it drives unrestrained AKT signaling in a kinase-dependent manner. SRMS kinase inhibition activates autophagy, inhibits cancer growth, and can be accomplished using the FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. This illuminates SRMS as a targetable vulnerability in human cancers and as a new target for pharmacological induction of autophagy in vertebrates.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yxuJNnTVFxE" width="1" />

<p>by Alexander J. Barnett, Walter Reilly, Halle R. Dimsdale-Zucker, Eda Mizrak, Zachariah Reagh, Charan Ranganath</p>

Episodic memory depends on interactions between the hippocampus and interconnected neocortical regions. Here, using data-driven analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we identified the networks that interact with the hippocampus—the default mode network (DMN) and a “medial temporal network” (MTN) that included regions in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and precuneus. We observed that the MTN plays a critical role in connecting the visual network to the DMN and hippocampus. The DMN could be further divided into 3 subnetworks: a “posterior medial” (PM) subnetwork comprised of posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortices; an “anterior temporal” (AT) subnetwork comprised of regions in the temporopolar and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; and a “medial prefrontal” (MP) subnetwork comprised of regions primarily in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These networks vary in their functional connectivity (FC) along the hippocampal long axis and represent different kinds of information during memory-guided decision-making. Finally, a Neurosynth meta-analysis of fMRI studies suggests new hypotheses regarding the functions of the MTN and DMN subnetworks, providing a framework to guide future research on the neural architecture of episodic memory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KfoHmH-TZZg" width="1" />

Abstract
With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multi‐access problem‐solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high‐solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased non‐neuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin‐based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular (FI) cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the hippocampus dentate gyrus where high‐solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.

Abstract
The present review asks whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are able to define neural correlates of episodic memory within the hippocampus in Parkinson's disease (PD). Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE using search terms related to structural and functional MRI (fMRI), the hippocampus, episodic memory, and PD. Risk of bias was assessed for each study using the Newtown–Ottawa Scale. Thirty‐nine studies met inclusion criteria; eight fMRI, seven diffusion MRI (dMRI), and 24 structural MRI (14 exploring whole hippocampus and 10 exploring hippocampal subfields). Critical analysis of the literature revealed mixed evidence from functional and dMRI, but stronger evidence from sMRI of the hippocampus as a biomarker for episodic memory impairment in PD. Hippocampal subfield studies most often implicated CA1, CA3/4, and subiculum volume in episodic memory and cognitive decline in PD. Despite differences in imaging methodology, study design, and sample characteristics, MRI studies have helped elucidate an important neural correlate of episodic memory impairment in PD with both clinical and theoretical implications. Natural progression of this work encourages future research on hippocampal subfield function as a potential biomarker of, or therapeutic target for, episodic memory dysfunction in PD.

Spinal A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) activation by MRS5698 transiently restores morphine antinociception in opioid‐tolerant rats. Intrathecal injection of MRS5698 (“on”) on days 8, 9, 12, and 13 reinstates morphine antinociception. This response is blocked by A3AR antagonist MRS1523 and absent when intrathecal vehicle (“off”) is administered on days 10 and 11.

Abstract
Opioids are potent analgesics, but their pain‐relieving effects diminish with repeated use. The reduction in analgesic potency is a hallmark of opioid analgesic tolerance, which hampers opioid pain therapy. In the central nervous system, opioid analgesia is critically modulated by adenosine, a purine nucleoside implicated in the beneficial and detrimental actions of opioid medications. Here, we focus on the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) in opioid analgesic tolerance. Intrathecal administration of the A3AR agonist MRS5698 with daily systemic morphine in male rats attenuated the reduction in morphine antinociception over 7 days. In rats with established morphine tolerance, intrathecal MRS5698 partially restored the antinociceptive effects of morphine. However, when MRS5698 was discontinued, these animals displayed a reduced antinociceptive response to morphine. Our results suggest that MRS5698 acutely and transiently potentiates morphine antinociception in tolerant rats. By contrast, in morphine‐naïve rats MRS5698 treatment did not impact thermal nociceptive threshold or affect antinociceptive response to a single injection of morphine. Furthermore, we found that morphine‐induced adenosine release in cerebrospinal fluid was blunted in tolerant animals, but total spinal A3AR expression was not affected. Collectively, our findings indicate that spinal A3AR activation acutely potentiates morphine antinociception in the opioid tolerant state.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The incredible capability of the brain to quickly alter performance in response to ever-changing environment is rooted in the process of adaptation. The core aspect of adaptation is to fit an existing motor program to altered conditions. Adaptation to a visuomotor rotation or an external force has been well established as tools to study the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor adaptation. In this mini-review, we summarize recent findings from the field of visuomotor adaptation. We focus on the idea that the cerebellum plays a central role in the process of visuomotor adaptation and that interactions with cortical structures, in particular, the premotor cortex and the parietal cortex, may be crucial for this process. To this end, we cover a range of methodologies used in the literature that link cerebellar functions and visuomotor adaptation; behavioral studies in cerebellar lesion patients, neuroimaging and non-invasive stimulation approaches. The mini-review is organized as follows: first, we provide evidence that sensory prediction errors (SPE) in visuomotor adaptation rely on the cerebellum based on behavioral studies in cerebellar patients. Second, we summarize structural and functional imaging studies that provide insight into spatial localization as well as visuomotor adaptation dynamics in the cerebellum. Third, we discuss premotor — cerebellar interactions and how these may underlie visuomotor adaptation. And finally, we provide evidence from transcranial direct current and magnetic stimulation studies that link cerebellar activity, beyond correlational relationships, to visuomotor adaptation .</p>

Introduction<p>The brainstem is an important component in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although neuroimaging studies have shown multiple structural changes in ALS patients, few studies have investigated structural alterations in the brainstem. Herein, we compared the brainstem structure between patients with ALS and healthy controls.</p>Methods<p>A total of 33 patients with ALS and 33 healthy controls were recruited in this study. T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) scanner. Volumetric and vertex-wised approaches were implemented to assess the differences in the brainstem’s morphological features between the two groups. An atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed to compare the white matter integrity of the brainstem between the two groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between ALS clinical characteristics and structural features.</p>Results<p>Volumetric analyses showed no significant difference in the subregion volume of the brainstem between ALS patients and healthy controls. In the shape analyses, ALS patients had a local abnormal surface contraction in the ventral medulla oblongata and ventral pons. Compared with healthy controls, ALS patients showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left corticospinal tract (CST) and bilateral frontopontine tracts (FPT) at the brainstem level, and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in bilateral CST and left FPT at the brainstem level by ROI analysis in DTI. Correlation analysis showed that disease severity was positively associated with FA in left CST and left FPT.</p>Conclusion<p>These findings suggest that the brainstem in ALS suffers atrophy, and degenerative processes in the brainstem may reflect disease severity in ALS. These findings may be helpful for further understanding of potential neural mechanisms in ALS.</p>

<p>Scaling down technology demotes the parameters of AC-coupled neural amplifiers, such as increasing the low-cutoff frequency due to the short-channel effects. To improve the low-cutoff frequency, one solution is to increase the feedback capacitors' value. This solution is not desirable, as the input capacitors have to be increased to maintain the same gain, which increases the area and decreases the input impedance of the neural amplifier. We analytically analyze the small-signal behavior of the neural amplifier and prove that the main reason for the increase of the low-cutoff frequency in advanced CMOS technologies is the reduction of the input resistance of the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). We also show that the reduction of the input resistance of the OTA is due to the increase in the gate oxide leakage in the input transistors. In this paper, we explore this fact and propose two solutions to reduce the low-cutoff frequency without increasing the value of the feedback capacitor. The first solution is performed by only simulation and is called cross-coupled positive feedback that uses pseudoresistors to provide a negative resistance to increase the input resistance of the OTA. As an advantage, only standard CMOS transistors are used in this method. Simulation results show that a low-cutoff frequency of 1.5 Hz is achieved while the midband gain is 30.4 dB at 1 V. In addition, the power consumption is 0.6 μW. In the second method, we utilize thick-oxide MOS transistors in the input differential pair of the OTA. We designed and fabricated the second method in the 65 nm TSMC CMOS process. Measured results are obtained by in vitro recordings on slices of mouse brainstem. The measurement results show that the bandwidth is between 2 Hz and 5.6 kHz. The neural amplifier has 34.3 dB voltage gain in midband and consumes 3.63 μW at 1 V power supply. The measurement results show an input-referred noise of 6.1 μV<sub>rms</sub> and occupy 0.04 mm<sup>2</sup> silicon area.</p>

<p>This article proposes a multimode medical image fusion with CNN and supervised learning, in order to solve the problem of practical medical diagnosis. It can implement different types of multimodal medical image fusion problems in batch processing mode and can effectively overcome the problem that traditional fusion problems that can only be solved by single and single image fusion. To a certain extent, it greatly improves the fusion effect, image detail clarity, and time efficiency in a new method.

Goal<p>Brain functional networks (BFNs) constructed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have proven to be an effective way to understand aberrant functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients.

We investigate the effects of each BFN on performance and performed inter-network connectivity analysis between each pair of BFNs. We compared the performance of our CNN model with some state-of-the-art algorithms using functional connectivity features.</p>Results<p>We collected 79 ASD patients and 105 NCs from the ABIDE-I dataset. The mean accuracy of our classification algorithm was 77.74% for classification of ASD versus NCs.</p>Conclusion<p>The proposed model is able to integrate information from multiple BFNs to improve detection accuracy of ASD.</p>Significance<p>These findings suggest that large-scale BFNs is promising to serve as reliable biomarkers for diagnosis of ASD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674851">Effects of Bilateral Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Simultaneous Bimanual Handgrip Strength</a></h4>

<p>Although the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on contralateral unimanual movement have been well reported, its effects on coordinated multi-limb movements remain unclear. Because multi-limb coordination is often performed in daily activities and sports, clarifying the effects of tDCS on multi-limb coordination may have valuable implications. However, considering the neural crosstalk involved in bimanual movements, including the transcallosal pathway and ipsilateral motor pathway, the extent of tDCS-induced improvement may differ between unimanual and bimanual movement. We examined how tDCS affects simultaneous bimanual maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) by testing the effects of tDCS of the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) on unimanual and bimanual handgrip strength. Twenty-one right-handed healthy adults underwent three bilateral tDCS protocols (“RaLc,” with an anode on right M1 and a cathode on left M1, “RcLa,” with an anode on left M1 and a cathode on right M1, and “Sham”) in a randomized order. A 1.5 mA current was applied for 15 min during tDCS. Participants then performed maximal unimanual and bimanual handgrip tests. Bimanual handgrip force was higher in both hands in the RcLa condition than in the Sham condition. Similarly, unimanual handgrip force was higher in the RcLa condition than in the Sham condition. Stimulus responses were asymmetrical and were not observed in the RaLc condition. Our findings demonstrate that RcLa tDCS leads to neuromodulation that can produce greater unimanual and bimanual handgrip strength. This result provides basic evidence that tDCS may be useful in sports, particularly those involving bilateral coordination of upper limb movement.</p>

<p>Aims: This study aimed to investigate phoneme perception in patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) by using the event-related potential (ERP) technique. These ERP components might contribute to the diagnostic process of PPA and its clinical variants (NFV: nonfluent variant, SV: semantic variant, LV: logopenic variant) and reveal insights about phoneme perception processes in these patients.</p><p>Method: Phoneme discrimination and categorization processes were investigated by the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 in eight persons with early- and late-stage PPA (3 NFV, 2 LV, 2 SV, and 1 PPA-NOS; not otherwise specified) and 30 age-matched healthy adults. The mean amplitude, the onset latency, and the topographic distribution of both components in each patient were compared to the results of the control group.</p><p>Results: The MMN was absent or the onset latency of the MMN was delayed in the patients with the NFV, LV, and PPA-NOS in comparison to the control group. In contrast, no differences in mean amplitudes and onset latencies of the MMN were found between the patients with the SV and the control group. Concerning the P300, variable results were found in the patients with the NFV, SV, and PPA-NOS, but the P300 of both patients with the LV was delayed and prolonged with increased mean amplitude in comparison to the control group.</p><p>Conclusion: In this preliminary study, phoneme discrimination deficits were found in the patients with the NFV and LV, and variable deficits in phoneme categorization processes were found in all patients with PPA. In clinical practice, the MMN might be valuable to differentiate the SV from the NFV and the LV and the P300 to differentiate the LV from the NFV and the SV. Further research in larger and independent patient groups is required to investigate the applicability of these components in the diagnostic process and to determine the nature of these speech perception deficits in the clinical variants of PPA.</p>

<p>Each neuron in the central nervous system has many dendrites, which provide input information through impulses. Assuming that a neuron's decision to continue or stop firing is made by rules applied to the dendrites' inputs, we associate neuron activity with a quantum like-cellular automaton (QLCA) concepts. Following a previous study that related the CA description with entangled states, we provide a quantum-like description of neuron activity. After reviewing and presenting the entanglement concept expressed by QLCA terminology, we propose a model that relates quantum-like measurement to consciousness. Then, we present a toy model that reviews the QLCA theory, which is adapted to our terminology. The study also focuses on implementing QLCA formalism to describe a single neuron activity.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of the hippocampal structure is the diversity of inhibitory interneurons. These complex inhibitory interconnections largely contribute to the tight modulation of hippocampal circuitry, as well as to the formation and coordination of neuronal assemblies underlying learning and memory. Inhibitory interneurons provide more than a simple transitory inhibition of hippocampal principal cells (PCs). The synaptic plasticity of inhibitory neurons provides long-lasting changes in the hippocampal network and is a key component of memory formation. The dendrite targeting interneurons expressing the peptide somatostatin (SOM) are particularly interesting in this regard because they display unique long-lasting synaptic changes leading to metaplastic regulation of hippocampal networks. In this article, we examine the actions of the neuropeptide SOM on hippocampal cells, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. We address the different subtypes of hippocampal SOM interneurons. We describe the long-term synaptic plasticity that takes place at the excitatory synapses of SOM interneurons, its singular induction and expression mechanisms, as well as the consequences of these changes on the hippocampal network, learning, and memory. We also review evidence that astrocytes provide cell-specific dynamic regulation of inhibition of PC dendrites by SOM interneurons. Finally, we cover how, in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), dysfunction of plasticity of SOM interneuron excitatory synapses may also contribute to cognitive impairments in brain disorders.</p>

<p>Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are small secreted proteins that support the development, maturation and survival of neurons. NTFs injected into the brain rescue and regenerate certain neuronal populations lost in neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the potential of NTFs to cure the diseases rather than simply alleviating the symptoms. NTFs (as the vast majority of molecules) do not pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and therefore, are delivered directly into the brain of patients using costly and risky intracranial surgery. The delivery efficacy and poor diffusion of some NTFs inside the brain are considered the major problems behind their modest effects in clinical trials. Thus, there is a great need for NTFs to be delivered systemically thereby avoiding intracranial surgery. Nanoparticles (NPs), particles with the size dimensions of 1-100 nm, can be used to stabilize NTFs and facilitate their transport through the BBB. Several studies have shown that NTFs can be loaded into or attached onto NPs, administered systemically and transported to the brain. To improve the NP-mediated NTF delivery through the BBB, the surface of NPs can be functionalized with specific ligands such as transferrin, insulin, lactoferrin, apolipoproteins, antibodies or short peptides that will be recognized and internalized by the respective receptors on brain endothelial cells. In this review, we elaborate on the most suitable NTF delivery methods and envision “ideal” NTF for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and clinical trial thereof. We shortly summarize clinical trials of four NTFs, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), that were tested in PD patients, focusing mainly on GDNF and CDNF. We summarize current possibilities of NP-mediated delivery of NTFs to the brain and discuss whether NPs have impact in improving the properties of NTFs and delivery across the BBB. Emerging delivery approaches and future directions of NTF-based nanomedicine are also discussed.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant form of primary brain tumor with a median survival time of 14–16 months in GBM patients. Surgical treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may help increase survival by removing GBM from the brain. However, complete surgical resection to eliminate GBM is almost impossible due to its high invasiveness. When GBM cells migrate to the brain, they interact with various cells, including astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). They can also make their cell body shrink to infiltrate into narrow spaces in the brain; thereby, they can invade regions of the brain and escape from surgery. Brain tumor cells create an appropriate microenvironment for migration and invasion by modifying and degrading the ECM. During those processes, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway and other signaling cascades mediated by various ion channels contribute mainly to gene expression, motility, and invasion of GBM cells. Furthermore, GBM cells release glutamate, affecting migration via activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors in an autocrine manner. This review focuses on the cellular mechanisms of glioblastoma invasion and motility related to ECM, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, and glutamate. Finally, we discuss possible therapeutic interventions to inhibit invasion by GBM cells.</p>

The plant corepressor TOPLESS (TPL) is recruited to a large number of loci that are selectively induced in response to developmental or environmental cues, yet the mechanisms by which it inhibits expression in the absence of these stimuli is poorly understood. Previously, we had used the N-terminus of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> TPL to enable repression of a synthetic auxin response circuit in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (yeast). Here, we leveraged the yeast system to interrogate the relationship between TPL structure and function, specifically scanning for repression domains. We identified a potent repression domain in Helix 8 located within the CRA domain, which directly interacted with the Mediator middle module subunits Med21 and Med10. Interactions between TPL and Mediator were required to fully repress transcription in both yeast and plants. In contrast, we found that multimer formation, a conserved feature of many corepressors, had minimal influence on the repression strength of TPL.

During embryogenesis, Hox mRNA translation is tightly regulated by a sophisticated molecular mechanism that combines two RNA regulons located in their 5’UTR. First, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) enables cap-independent translation. The second regulon is a translation inhibitory element or TIE, which ensures concomitant cap-dependent translation inhibition. In this study, we deciphered the molecular mechanisms of mouse <i>Hoxa3</i> and <i>Hoxa11</i> TIEs. Both TIEs possess an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that is critical to inhibit cap-dependent translation. However, the molecular mechanisms used are different. In <i>Hoxa3</i> TIE, we identify an uORF which inhibits cap-dependent translation and we show the requirement of the non-canonical initiation factor eIF2D for this process. The mode of action of <i>Hoxa11</i> TIE is different, it also contains an uORF but it is a minimal uORF formed by an uAUG followed immediately by a stop codon, namely a ‘start-stop’. The ‘start-stop’ sequence is species-specific and in mice, is located upstream of a highly stable stem loop structure which stalls the 80S ribosome and thereby inhibits cap-dependent translation of <i>Hoxa11</i> main ORF.

The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump SERCA plays a critical role in the contraction-relaxation cycle of muscle. In cardiac muscle, SERCA is regulated by the inhibitor phospholamban. A new regulator, dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), has been reported to displace phospholamban from SERCA. Here, we show that DWORF is a direct activator of SERCA, increasing its turnover rate in the absence of phospholamban. Measurement of in-cell calcium dynamics supports this observation and demonstrates that DWORF increases SERCA-dependent calcium reuptake. These functional observations reveal opposing effects of DWORF activation and phospholamban inhibition of SERCA. To gain mechanistic insight into SERCA activation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments revealed that DWORF has a higher affinity for SERCA in the presence of calcium. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations provide a model for DWORF activation of SERCA, where DWORF modulates the membrane bilayer and stabilizes the conformations of SERCA that predominate during elevated cytosolic calcium.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59654">HNRNPM controls circRNA biogenesis and splicing fidelity to sustain cancer cell fitness</a></h4>

High spliceosome activity is a dependency for cancer cells, making them more vulnerable to perturbation of the splicing machinery compared to normal cells. To identify splicing factors important for prostate cancer (PCa) fitness, we performed pooled shRNA screens <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Our screens identified HNRNPM as a regulator of PCa cell growth. RNA- and eCLIP-sequencing identified HNRNPM binding to transcripts of key homeostatic genes. HNRNPM binding to its targets prevents aberrant exon inclusion and back-splicing events. In both linear and circular mis-spliced transcripts, HNRNPM preferentially binds to GU-rich elements in long flanking proximal introns. Mimicry of HNRNPM dependent linear splicing events using splice-switching-antisense-oligonucleotides (SSOs) was sufficient to inhibit PCa cell growth. This suggests that PCa dependence on HNRNPM is likely a result of mis-splicing of key homeostatic coding and non-coding genes. Our results have further been confirmed in other solid tumors. Taken together, our data reveal a role for HNRNPM in supporting cancer cell fitness. Inhibition of HNRNPM activity is therefore a potential therapeutic strategy in suppressing growth of PCa and other solid tumors.

Objective
Brain‐injured patients who are unresponsive at the bedside (ie, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome – VS/UWS) may present brain activity similar to patients in minimally conscious state (MCS). This peculiar condition has been termed “non‐behavioural MCS” or “MCS*”. In the present study we aimed to investigate the proportion and underlying brain characteristics of patients in MCS*.


Methods
Brain 18F‐fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG‐PET) was acquired on 135 brain‐injured patients diagnosed in prolonged VS/UWS (n = 48) or MCS (n = 87). From an existing database, relative metabolic preservation in the fronto‐parietal network (measured with standardized uptake value) was visually inspected by three experts. Patients with hypometabolism of the fronto‐parietal network were labelled “VS/UWS”, while its (partial) preservation either confirmed the behavioural diagnosis of “MCS” or, in absence of behavioural signs of consciousness, suggested a diagnosis of “MCS*”. Clinical outcome at 1‐year follow‐up, functional connectivity, grey matter atrophy, and regional brain metabolic patterns were investigated in the three groups (VS/UWS, MCS* and MCS).


Results
67% of behavioural VS/UWS presented a partial preservation of brain metabolism (ie, MCS*). Compared to VS/UWS patients, MCS* patients demonstrated a better outcome, global functional connectivity and grey matter preservation more compatible with the diagnosis of MCS. MCS* patients presented lower brain metabolism mostly in the posterior brain regions compared to MCS patients.

<p>by Alexander Zhigalov, Katharina Duecker, Ole Jensen</p>

The aim of this study is to uncover the network dynamics of the human visual cortex by driving it with a broadband random visual flicker. We here applied a broadband flicker (1–720 Hz) while measuring the MEG and then estimated the temporal response function (TRF) between the visual input and the MEG response. This TRF revealed an early response in the 40–60 Hz gamma range as well as in the 8–12 Hz alpha band. While the gamma band response is novel, the latter has been termed the alpha band perceptual echo. The gamma echo preceded the alpha perceptual echo. The dominant frequency of the gamma echo was subject-specific thereby reflecting the individual dynamical properties of the early visual cortex. To understand the neuronal mechanisms generating the gamma echo, we implemented a pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) model that produces gamma oscillations in the presence of constant input currents. Applying a broadband input current mimicking the visual stimulation allowed us to estimate TRF between the input current and the population response (akin to the local field potentials). The TRF revealed a gamma echo that was similar to the one we observed in the MEG data. Our results suggest that the visual gamma echo can be explained by the dynamics of the PING model even in the absence of sustained gamma oscillations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/88rEjoc00IA" width="1" />

<p>by Wenwen Min, Tsung-Hui Chang, Shihua Zhang, Xiang Wan</p>

Existing studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) is involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. Many efforts have been devoted to identify microRNAs as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic targets. With the rapid development of miRNA sequencing technology, a vast amount of miRNA expression data for multiple cancers has been collected. These invaluable data repositories provide new paradigms to explore the relationship between miRNAs and cancer. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore the complex cancer-related miRNA-gene patterns by integrating multi-omics data in a pan-cancer paradigm. In this study, we present a tensor sparse canonical correlation analysis (TSCCA) method for identifying cancer-related miRNA-gene modules across multiple cancers. TSCCA is able to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions and capture both the cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of TSCCA using a set of simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database. We uncover several dysfunctional miRNA-gene modules with important biological functions and statistical significance. These modules can advance our understanding of miRNA regulatory mechanisms of cancer and provide insights into miRNA-based treatments for cancer.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KF6Pqt_AyoU" width="1" />

<p>by Elena Camacho-Aguilar, Aryeh Warmflash, David A. Rand</p>

Increasing interest has emerged in new mathematical approaches that simplify the study of complex differentiation processes by formalizing Waddington’s landscape metaphor. However, a rational method to build these landscape models remains an open problem. Here we study vulval development in <i>C. elegans</i> by developing a framework based on Catastrophe Theory (CT) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to build data-fitted landscape models. We first identify the candidate qualitative landscapes, and then use CT to build the simplest model consistent with the data, which we quantitatively fit using ABC. The resulting model suggests that the underlying mechanism is a quantifiable two-step decision controlled by EGF and Notch-Delta signals, where a non-vulval/vulval decision is followed by a bistable transition to the two vulval states. This new model fits a broad set of data and makes several novel predictions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UhG6hhJfAHw" width="1" />

<p>by Ankur Sinha, Christoph Metzner, Neil Davey, Roderick Adams, Michael Schmuker, Volker Steuber</p>

Several homeostatic mechanisms enable the brain to maintain desired levels of neuronal activity. One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model of peripheral lesioning and accurately reproduced the characteristics of network repair after deafferentation that are reported in experiments to study the activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we model deafferentation in a biologically realistic balanced network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed structural plasticity growth rules and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network both contribute to the restoration of the network to pre-deafferentation stable activity levels.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yR-Sq_AD2TE" width="1" />

Shape is a defining feature of objects, and human observers can effortlessly compare shapes to determine how similar they are. Yet, to date, no image-computable model can predict how visually similar or different shapes appear. Such a model would be an invaluable tool for neuroscientists and could provide insights into computations underlying human shape perception. To address this need, we developed a model (‘ShapeComp’), based on over 100 shape features (e.g., area, compactness, Fourier descriptors). When trained to capture the variance in a database of &gt;25,000 animal silhouettes, ShapeComp accurately predicts human shape similarity judgments between pairs of shapes without fitting any parameters to human data. To test the model, we created carefully selected arrays of complex novel shapes using a Generative Adversarial Network trained on the animal silhouettes, which we presented to observers in a wide range of tasks. Our findings show that incorporating multiple ShapeComp dimensions facilitates the prediction of human shape similarity across a small number of shapes, and also captures much of the variance in the multiple arrangements of many shapes. ShapeComp outperforms both conventional pixel-based metrics and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, and can also be used to generate perceptually uniform stimulus sets, making it a powerful tool for investigating shape and object representations in the human brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Pi5uf5AhT7M" width="1" />

<p>by Long Luu, Alan A. Stocker</p>

Categorical judgments can systematically bias the perceptual interpretation of stimulus features. However, it remained unclear whether categorical judgments directly modify working memory representations or, alternatively, generate these biases via an inference process down-stream from working memory. To address this question we ran two novel psychophysical experiments in which human subjects had to reverse their categorical judgments about a stimulus feature, if incorrect, before providing an estimate of the feature. If categorical judgments indeed directly altered sensory representations in working memory, subjects’ estimates should reflect some aspects of their initial (incorrect) categorical judgment in those trials. We found no traces of the initial categorical judgment. Rather, subjects seemed to be able to flexibly switch their categorical judgment if needed and use the correct corresponding categorical prior to properly perform feature inference. A cross-validated model comparison also revealed that feedback may lead to selective memory recall such that only memory samples that are consistent with the categorical judgment are accepted for the inference process. Our results suggest that categorical judgments do not modify sensory information in working memory but rather act as top-down expectations in the subsequent sensory recall and inference process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACl1Niq_GPM" width="1" />

<p>by Lucas Rudelt, Daniel González Marx, Michael Wibral, Viola Priesemann</p>

Information processing can leave distinct footprints on the statistics of neural spiking. For example, efficient coding minimizes the statistical dependencies on the spiking history, while temporal integration of information may require the maintenance of information over different timescales. To investigate these footprints, we developed a novel approach to quantify history dependence within the spiking of a single neuron, using the mutual information between the entire past and current spiking. This measure captures how much past information is necessary to predict current spiking. In contrast, classical time-lagged measures of temporal dependence like the autocorrelation capture how long—potentially redundant—past information can still be read out. Strikingly, we find for model neurons that our method disentangles the <i>strength</i> and <i>timescale</i> of history dependence, whereas the two are mixed in classical approaches. When applying the method to experimental data, which are necessarily of limited size, a reliable estimation of mutual information is only possible for a coarse temporal binning of past spiking, a so-called past embedding. To still account for the vastly different spiking statistics and potentially long history dependence of living neurons, we developed an embedding-optimization approach that does not only vary the number and size, but also an exponential stretching of past bins. For extra-cellular spike recordings, we found that the strength and timescale of history dependence indeed can vary independently across experimental preparations. While hippocampus indicated strong and long history dependence, in visual cortex it was weak and short, while in vitro the history dependence was strong but short. This work enables an information-theoretic characterization of history dependence in recorded spike trains, which captures a footprint of information processing that is beyond time-lagged measures of temporal dependence. To facilitate the application of the method, we provide practical guidelines and a toolbox.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lJdScf-37tM" width="1" />

<p>by Melinda Liu Perkins</p>

The earliest models for how morphogen gradients guide embryonic patterning failed to account for experimental observations of temporal refinement in gene expression domains. Following theoretical and experimental work in this area, dynamic positional information has emerged as a conceptual framework to discuss how cells process spatiotemporal inputs into downstream patterns. Here, we show that diffusion determines the mathematical means by which bistable gene expression boundaries shift over time, and therefore how cells interpret positional information conferred from morphogen concentration. First, we introduce a metric for assessing reproducibility in boundary placement or precision in systems where gene products do not diffuse, but where morphogen concentrations are permitted to change in time. We show that the dynamics of the gradient affect the sensitivity of the final pattern to variation in initial conditions, with slower gradients reducing the sensitivity. Second, we allow gene products to diffuse and consider gene expression boundaries as propagating wavefronts with velocity modulated by local morphogen concentration. We harness this perspective to approximate a PDE model as an ODE that captures the position of the boundary in time, and demonstrate the approach with a preexisting model for Hunchback patterning in fruit fly embryos. We then propose a design that employs antiparallel morphogen gradients to achieve accurate boundary placement that is robust to scaling. Throughout our work we draw attention to tradeoffs among initial conditions, boundary positioning, and the relative timescales of network and gradient evolution. We conclude by suggesting that mathematical theory should serve to clarify not just our quantitative, but also our intuitive understanding of patterning processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mEXsX8U--kQ" width="1" />

<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is a human fungal pathogen that can cause devastating pulmonary infections, termed “aspergilloses,” in individuals suffering immune imbalances or underlying lung conditions. As rapid adaptation to stress is crucial for the outcome of the host–pathogen interplay, here we investigated the role of the versatile posttranslational modification (PTM) persulfidation for both fungal virulence and antifungal host defense. We show that an <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> mutant with low persulfidation levels is more susceptible to host-mediated killing and displays reduced virulence in murine models of infection. Additionally, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human gene encoding cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) causes a reduction in cellular persulfidation and correlates with a predisposition of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), as correct levels of persulfidation are required for optimal antifungal activity of recipients’ lung resident host cells. Importantly, the levels of host persulfidation determine the levels of fungal persulfidation, ultimately reflecting a host–pathogen functional correlation and highlighting a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of aspergillosis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OZifpfaWVlg" width="1" />

The glymphatic system plays an important role in clearing the amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins that are closely linked to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Glymphatic clearance, as well as Aβ accumulation, is highly dependent on sleep, but the sleep-dependent driving forces behind cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) movements essential to the glymphatic flux remain largely unclear. Recent studies have reported that widespread, high-amplitude spontaneous brain activations in the drowsy state and during sleep, which are shown as large global signal peaks in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), are coupled with CSF movements, suggesting their potential link to glymphatic flux and metabolite clearance. By analyzing multimodal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project, here we showed that the coupling between the global fMRI signal and CSF influx is correlated with AD-related pathology, including various risk factors for AD, the severity of AD-related diseases, the cortical Aβ level, and cognitive decline over a 2-year follow-up. These results provide critical initial evidence for involvement of sleep-dependent global brain activity, as well as the associated physiological modulations, in the clearance of AD-related brain waste.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lySWRRRKryk" width="1" />

Global biodiversity loss is a profound consequence of human activity. Disturbingly, biodiversity loss is greater than realized because of the unknown number of undocumented species. Conservation fundamentally relies on taxonomic recognition of species, but only a fraction of biodiversity is described. Here, we provide a new quantitative approach for prioritizing rigorous taxonomic research for conservation. We implement this approach in a highly diverse vertebrate group—Australian lizards and snakes. Of 870 species assessed, we identified 282 (32.4%) with taxonomic uncertainty, of which 17.6% likely comprise undescribed species of conservation concern. We identify 24 species in need of immediate taxonomic attention to facilitate conservation. Using a broadly applicable return-on-investment framework, we demonstrate the importance of prioritizing the fundamental work of identifying species before they are lost.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y9QlVuTXNHI" width="1" />

Tumor heterogeneity is a primary cause of treatment failure and acquired resistance in cancer patients. Even in cancers driven by a single mutated oncogene, variability in response to targeted therapies is well known. The existence of additional genomic alterations among tumor cells can only partially explain this variability. As such, nongenetic factors are increasingly seen as critical contributors to tumor relapse and acquired resistance in cancer. Here, we show that both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to targeted drug response variability in an experimental model of tumor heterogeneity. We observe significant variability to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition among and within multiple versions and clonal sublines of PC9, a commonly used EGFR mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. We resolve genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic components of this variability using a theoretical framework in which distinct genetic states give rise to multiple epigenetic “basins of attraction,” across which cells can transition driven by stochastic noise. Using mutational impact analysis, single-cell differential gene expression, and correlations among Gene Ontology (GO) terms to connect genomics to transcriptomics, we establish a baseline for genetic differences driving drug response variability among PC9 cell line versions. Applying the same approach to clonal sublines, we conclude that drug response variability in all but one of the sublines is due to epigenetic differences; in the other, it is due to genetic alterations. Finally, using a clonal drug response assay together with stochastic simulations, we attribute subclonal drug response variability within sublines to stochastic cell fate decisions and confirm that one subline likely contains genetic resistance mutations that emerged in the absence of drug treatment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-3GnOPaF4YY" width="1" />

Portacaval anastomosis (PCA) promoted spongiform degeneration at the cerebellar molecular layer. There was loss of Purkinje cells, microglia activation and increase expression of NLRP3 and aquaporin‐4. By NMR spectroscopy, there was reduction in osmolytes that can be cause the cellular edema. PCA rats showed a motor deficiency in rotarod test.

Abstract
The episodes of cerebral dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, are usually coincident with liver failure. The primary metabolic marker of liver diseases is the increase in blood ammonium, which promotes neuronal damage. In the present project, we used an experimental model of hepatic encephalopathy in male rats by portacaval anastomosis (PCA) surgery. Sham rats had a false operation. After 13 weeks of surgery, the most distinctive finding was vacuolar/spongiform neurodegeneration exclusively in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. This cerebellar damage was further characterized by metabolic, histopathological, and behavioral approaches. The results were as follows: (a) Cellular alterations, namely loss of Purkinje cells, morphological changes, such as swelling of astrocytes and Bergmann glia, and activation of microglia; (b) Cytotoxic edema, shown by an increase in aquaporin‐4 and N‐acetylaspartate and a reduction in taurine and choline‐derivate osmolytes; (c) Metabolic adjustments, noted by the elevation of circulating ammonium, enhanced presence of glutamine synthetase, and increase in glutamine and creatine/phosphocreatine; (d) Inflammasome activation, detected by the elevation of the marker NLRP3 and microglial activation; (e) Locomotor deficits in PCA rats as assessed by the Rotarod and open field tests. These results lead us to suggest that metabolic disturbances associated with PCA can generate the cerebellar damage that is similar to morphophysiological modifications observed in amyloidogenic disorders. In conclusion, we have characterized a distinctive cerebellar multi‐disruption accompanied by high levels of ammonium and associated with spongiform neurodegeneration in a model of hepatic hypofunctioning.

Glial cells of the cerebellum are still insufficiently classified. In this study we describe the subclassification of GLAST+ precursors in the prospective white matter using immunophenotyping, transcriptomics, and transplantation assays. A subclass of GLAST+ cells, which co‐express astrocyte cell surface antigen‐2 (ACSA‐2), generates only parenchymal astrocytes—as revealed by protein expression, their genetic signature and transplantation. The absence of the astrocyte marker (ACSA‐2) reveals GLAST+ cells to maintain a multipotent potential, giving rise to interneurons, glia, and Bergmann glia.

Abstract
The formation of the cerebellum is highly coordinated to obtain its characteristic morphology and all cerebellar cell types. During mouse postnatal development, cerebellar progenitors with astroglial‐like characteristics generate mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, a subset of astroglial‐like progenitors found in the prospective white matter (PWM) produces astroglia and interneurons. Characterizing these cerebellar astroglia‐like progenitors and distinguishing their developmental fates is still elusive. Here, we reveal that astrocyte cell surface antigen‐2 (ACSA‐2), lately identified as ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 2 polypeptide, is expressed by glial precursors throughout postnatal cerebellar development. In contrast to common astrocyte markers, ACSA‐2 appears on PWM cells but is absent on Bergmann glia (BG) precursors. In the adult cerebellum, ACSA‐2 is broadly expressed extending to velate astrocytes in the granular layer, white matter astrocytes, and to a lesser extent to BG. Cell transplantation and transcriptomic analysis revealed that marker staining discriminates two postnatal progenitor pools. One subset is defined by the co‐expression of ACSA‐2 and GLAST and the expression of markers typical of parenchymal astrocytes. These are PWM precursors that are exclusively gliogenic. They produce predominantly white matter and granular layer astrocytes. Another subset is constituted by GLAST positive/ACSA‐2 negative precursors that express neurogenic and BG‐like progenitor genes. This population displays multipotency and gives rise to interneurons besides all glial types, including BG. In conclusion, this work reports about ACSA‐2, a marker that in combination with GLAST enables for the discrimination and isolation of multipotent and glia‐committed progenitors, which generate different types of cerebellar astrocytes.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Inflammation contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) alleviates mitochondrial apoptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated PC-12 cells, and to further explore the mechanism involved. Prepared PC-12 cells were treated with IGF-1, Mdivi-1 (DRP1 blocker), LY294002 (PI3K blocker), betulinic acid (NF-κB activator) or their combinations. Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP generation were then measured to assess mitochondrial function. The rate of apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The expression of several apoptosis proteins (i.e. Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3) and signaling proteins (i.e. p-GSK3β, NF-κB and NLRP3) was measured using western blotting. Compared with the control cells, the LPS-treated cells showed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, increased apoptosis and upregulation of apoptosis proteins, which were significantly alleviated by Mdivi-1. These findings indicate that neuronal apoptosis was activated partly through the mitochondrial pathway. IGF-1 treatment inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in the LPS-treated cells. The reagent also increased the expression of p-GSK3β and decreased the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. Both LY294002 and betulinic acid reversed the protective effect of IGF-1. In addition, LY294002 affected the expression of the three signaling proteins, while betulinic acid only affected the expression of NF-κB and NLRP3. These findings indicated a GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway was existed and was involved in the protective mechanism of IGF-1. In conclusion, IGF-1 alleviated mitochondrial apoptosis through GSK3β/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway in LPS-treated PC-12 cells.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The existence of Gram-negative bacteria in the brain, regardless of underlying immune status has been demonstrated by recent studies. The colocalization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with Aβ<sub class="a-plus-plus">1-40/42</sub> in amyloid plaques supports the hypothesis that brain microbes may be the cause, triggering chronic neuroinflammation, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To investigate the behavioral changes induced by infectious neuroinflammation, we chose the third ventricle as the site of a single LPS injection (20 μg or 80 μg) in male Wistar rats to avoid mechanical injury to forebrain structures while inducing widespread inflammation throughout the brain. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by LPS resulted in depressive-like behaviors and the impairment of spatial learning; however, there was no evidence of the development of pathological hallmarks (e.g., the phosphorylation of tau) for 10 months following LPS injection. The acceleration of cholesterol metabolism via CYP46A1 and the retardation of cholesterol synthesis via HMGCR were observed in the hippocampus of rats treated with either low-dose or high-dose LPS. The rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol metabolism (CYP46A1) in SH-SY5Y cells and synthesis (HMGCR) in U251 cells were altered by inflammation stimulators, including LPS, IL-1β, and TNF-α, through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. The data suggest that chronic neuroinflammation provoked by the administration of LPS into the third ventricle may induce depressive-like symptoms and that the loss of cholesterol might be a biomarker of chronic neuroinflammation. The lack of pathological hallmarks of AD in our model indicates that Gram-negative bacteria infection might not be a single cause of AD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Twins studies indicate that many individual factors are associated with genetic polymorphisms in tobacco use, dependence vulnerability, and the ability to quit smoking. Opioid receptor delta-type 1 (OPRD1) is one of the most important genes in the opioid pathway. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the association of variants located in the intron 1 of the OPRD1 gene, including rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, with susceptibility to nicotine dependence among northern Iranians. DNA of 426 individuals, including 224 smokers and 202 healthy people, were extracted with the salting-out standard technique, qualified with Agarose gel, then quantified with Nanodrop, and finally genotyped by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR. All statistical analyses were performed by SNPAlyze version 8.1 and SPSS version 20. Results revealed no significant association of all three studied variants with the susceptibility to nicotine dependence in any models of inheritance. However, there were five haplotypes with an overall frequency higher than 0.05; no significant impact of any of them on nicotine dependence was observed. Altogether, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589 were not associated with nicotine dependence among northern Iranians.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To study the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on axon regeneration and secretion change of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) under oxidative stress after spinal cord injury (SCI), and further explore the effect of changes in DRG secretion caused by PBM on the polarization of macrophages. The PBM-DRG model was constructed to perform PBM on neurons under oxidative stress simulated in vitro. And the irradiation conditions were as follows: wavelength, 810 nm; power density, 2 mW/cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup>; irradiation area, 4.5 cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup>; and irradiation time, 440 s. Then resulted in an energy of 4 J (2 mW/cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup> × 4.5 cm<sup class="a-plus-plus">2</sup> × 440 s). About 100 μM H<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub>0<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> was added to the culture medium to simulate oxidative stress after SCI. An ROS (reactive oxygen species) assay kit was used to measure ROS contend in the DRG. The survival level of the neurons was measured using the CCK-8 method, and the axon regeneration of neurons was observed by using immunofluorescence. The secretion level of CCL2 from DRG was determined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. Further culturing macrophages of DRG-conditioned medium culture, the expression level of iNOS and Arg-1 in macrophages was assessed using Western blot analysis. The expression level of TNF-α and IL-1β was determined by ELISA. After adding the neutralizing antibody of CCL2 to the DRG neuron-conditioned medium following PBM irradiation to culture macrophages to observe the effects on macrophage polarization and secretion. PBM could reduce ROS levels in neurons, increase neuronal survival under oxidative stress, and promote neuronal axon regeneration. In addition, PBM could also promote CCL2 secretion by DRG under oxidative stress. By constructing a DRG supernatant-M1 macrophage adoptive culture model, we found that the supernatant of DRG after PBM intervention could reduce the expression level of iNOS and the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β in M1 macrophages; at the same time, it could also up-regulate the expression of Arg-1, one of the markers of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, these effects could be prevented by the addition of neutralizing antibodies of CCL2. PBM could promote survival and axonal regeneration of DRG under SCI oxidative stress, increase the secretion level of CCL2 by DRG, and this change can reduce the polarization of macrophages to M1, further indicating that PBM could promote spinal cord injury repair.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cypermethrin activates microglia, which is found to be decisive in neurodegeneration in the experimental rats. While the involvement of microglial activation in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration is reported, the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression of inflammatory proteins from the rat primary microglia is not yet properly understood. The study intended to delineate the effect of low concentration of cypermethrin on the expression and release of proteins from the microglia. Rat primary microglial cells were treated with cypermethrin to check the expression of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin-treated microglia conditioned media and cells were collected to measure the expression and release of inflammatory proteins. Cypermethrin augmented the protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and p42/44, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, and MMP-9 levels in the cell lysate and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels in the microglia conditioned media. Pre-treatment with minocycline, a microglial activation inhibitor or rottlerin, a PKC-δ inhibitor, notably reduced the release of TNF-α in the conditioned media and expression of iNOS protein in the microglia. Minocycline reduced the expression of PKC-δ, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins in the microglia. While cypermethrin-treated conditioned media induced the toxicity in the rat primary neurons, minocycline or rottlerin reduced the cypermethrin treated microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity. The outcomes of the present study suggest that cypermethrin activates microglia and releases TNF-α and IL-1β as well as up-regulates the expression of PKC-δ, iNOS, phosphorylated p38 and p42/44 MAPKs, MMP-3, and MMP-9 proteins, which could contribute to neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Golgi defects including Golgi fragmentation are pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). As a pathogenic factor in AD, amyloid precursor protein (APP) induces Golgi fragmentation in the soma. However, how APP regulates Golgi outposts (GOs) in dendrites remains unclear. Given that APP resides in and affects the movements of GOs, and in particular, reverses the distribution of multi-compartment GOs (mcGOs), we investigated the regulatory mechanism of mcGO movements in the Drosophila larvae. Knockdown experiments showed that the bidirectional mcGO movements were cooperatively controlled by the dynein heavy chain (Dhc) and kinesin heavy chain subunits. Notably, only Dhc mediated APP’s regulation of mcGO movements. Furthermore, by loss-of-function screening, the adaptor protein Sunday driver (Syd) was identified to mediate the APP-induced alteration of the direction of mcGO movements and dendritic defects. Collectively, by elucidating a model of bidirectional mcGO movements, we revealed the mechanism by which APP regulates the direction of mcGO movements. Our study therefore provides new insights into AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Measuring and identifying the specific level of sustained attention during continuous tasks is essential in many applications, especially for avoiding the terrible consequences caused by reduced attention of people with special tasks. To this end, we recorded EEG signals from 42 subjects during the performance of a sustained attention task and obtained resting state and three levels of attentional states using the calibrated response time. EEG-based dynamical complexity features and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier were proposed as the classification model, Complexity-XGBoost, to distinguish multi-level attention states with improved accuracy. The maximum average accuracy of Complexity-XGBoost were 81.39 ± 1.47% for four attention levels, 80.42 ± 0.84% for three attention levels, and 95.36 ± 2.31% for two attention levels in 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed method is compared with other models of traditional EEG features and different classification algorithms, the results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also found that the frontal EEG dynamical complexity measures were related to the changing process of response during sustained attention task. The proposed dynamical complexity approach could be helpful to recognize attention status during important tasks to improve safety and efficiency, and be useful for further brain-computer interaction research in clinical research or daily practice, such as the cognitive assessment or neural feedback treatment of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases which affect the sustained attention function.</p>

<p>The purpose of the current study was to examine the cortical correlates of imagery depending on instructional modality (guided vs. self-produced) using various sports-related scripts. According to the expert-performance approach, we took an idiosyncratic perspective analyzing the mental imagery of an experienced two-time Olympic athlete to verify whether different instructional modalities of imagery (i.e., guided vs. self-produced) and different scripts (e.g., training or competition environment) could differently involve brain activity. The subject listened to each previously recorded script taken from two existing questionnaires concerning imagery ability in sport and then was asked to imagine the scene for a minute. During the task, brain waves were monitored using EEG (32-channel g. Nautilus). Our findings indicate that guided imagery might induce higher high alpha and SMR (usually associated with selective attention), whereas self-produced imagery might facilitate higher low alpha (associated with global resting state and relaxation). Results are discussed in light of the neural efficiency hypothesis as a marker of optimal performance and transient hypofrontality as a marker of flow state. Practical mental training recommendations are presented.</p>

<p>Early life adversity (ELA), such as child maltreatment or child poverty, engenders problems with emotional and behavioral regulation. In the quest to understand the neurobiological sequelae and mechanisms of risk, the amygdala has been of major focus. While the basic functions of this region make it a strong candidate for understanding the multiple mental health issues common after ELA, extant literature is marked by profound inconsistencies, with reports of larger, smaller, and no differences in regional volumes of this area. We believe integrative models of stress neurodevelopment, grounded in “allostatic load,” will help resolve inconsistencies in the impact of ELA on the amygdala. In this review, we attempt to connect past research studies to new findings with animal models of cellular and neurotransmitter mediators of stress buffering to extreme fear generalization onto testable research and clinical concepts. Drawing on the greater impact of inescapability over unpredictability in animal models, we propose a mechanism by which ELA aggravates an exhaustive cycle of amygdala expansion and subsequent toxic-metabolic damage. We connect this neurobiological sequela to psychosocial mal/adaptation after ELA, bridging to behavioral studies of attachment, emotion processing, and social functioning. Lastly, we conclude this review by proposing a multitude of future directions in preclinical work and studies of humans that suffered ELA.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.660693">Synaptopathy Mechanisms in ALS Caused by C9orf72 Repeat Expansion</a></h4>

<p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of motor neurons (MNs). ALS pathogenic features include accumulation of misfolded proteins, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction at distal axon terminals, and neuronal cytoskeleton changes. Synergies between loss of C9orf72 functions and gain of function by toxic effects of repeat expansions also contribute to C9orf72-mediated pathogenesis. However, the impact of haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 on neurons and in synaptic functions requires further examination. As the motor neurons degenerate, the disease symptoms will lead to neurotransmission deficiencies in the brain, spinal cord, and neuromuscular junction. Altered neuronal excitability, synaptic morphological changes, and C9orf72 protein and DPR localization at the synapses, suggest a potential involvement of C9orf72 at synapses. In this review article, we provide a conceptual framework for assessing the putative involvement of C9orf72 as a synaptopathy, and we explore the underlying and common disease mechanisms with other neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we reflect on the major challenges of understanding C9orf72-ALS as a synaptopathy focusing on integrating mitochondrial and neuronal cytoskeleton degeneration as biomarkers and potential targets to treat ALS neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Noise exposure is the most important external factor causing acquired hearing loss in humans, and it is strongly associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cochlea. Several studies reported that the administration of various compounds with antioxidant effects can treat oxidative stress-induced hearing loss. However, traditional systemic drug administration to the human inner ear is problematic and has not been successful in a clinical setting. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop rescue treatment for patients with acute acoustic injuries. Hydrogen gas has antioxidant effects, rapid distribution, and distributes systemically after inhalation.The purpose of this study was to determine the protective efficacy of a single dose of molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) on cochlear structures. Guinea pigs were divided into six groups and sacrificed immediately after or at 1 or 2 weeks. The animals were exposed to broadband noise for 2 h directly followed by 1-h inhalation of 2% H<sub>2</sub> or room air. Electrophysiological hearing thresholds using frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) were measured prior to noise exposure and before sacrifice. ABR thresholds were significantly lower in H<sub>2</sub>-treated animals at 2 weeks after exposure, with significant preservation of outer hair cells in the entire cochlea. Quantification of synaptophysin immunoreactivity revealed that H<sub>2</sub> inhalation protected the cochlear inner hair cell synaptic structures containing synaptophysin. The inflammatory response was greater in the stria vascularis, showing increased Iba1 due to H<sub>2</sub> inhalation.Repeated administration of H<sub>2</sub> inhalation may further improve the therapeutic effect. This animal model does not reproduce conditions in humans, highlighting the need for additional real-life studies in humans.</p>

<p>Age-related decline in cognitive control and general slowing are prominent phenomena in aging research. These declines in cognitive functions have been shown to also involve age-related decline in brain structure. However, most evidence in support of these associations is based on cross-sectional data. Therefore, the aim of this study is to contrast cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to re-examine if the relationship between age-related brain structure and cognitive function are similar between the two approaches. One hundred and two participants completed two sessions with an average interval of 2 years. All participants were assessed by questionnaires, a series of cognitive tasks, and they all underwent neuroimaging acquisition. The main results of this study show that the majority of the conclusions regarding age effect in cognitive control function and processing speed in the literature can be replicated based on the cross-sectional data. Conversely, when we followed up individuals over an average interval of 2 years, then we found much fewer significant relationships between age-related change in gray matter structure of the cognitive control network and age-related change in cognitive control function. Furthermore, there was no “initial age” effect in the relationships between age-related changes in brain structure and cognitive function. This finding suggests that the “aging” relationship between brain structure and cognitive function over a short period of time are independent of “initial age” difference at time point 1. The result of this study warrants the importance of longitudinal research for aging studies to elucidate actual aging processes on cognitive control function.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/70394">Bacterial Death and TRADD-N domains help define novel apoptosis and immunity mechanisms shared by prokaryotes and metazoans</a></h4>

Several homologous domains are shared by eukaryotic immunity and programmed cell-death systems and poorly understood bacterial proteins. Recent studies show these to be components of a network of highly regulated systems connecting apoptotic processes to counter-invader immunity, in prokaryotes with a multicellular habit. However, the provenance of key adaptor domains, namely those of the Death-like and TRADD-N superfamilies, a quintessential feature of metazoan apoptotic systems, remained murky. Here, we use sensitive sequence analysis and comparative genomics methods to identify unambiguous bacterial homologs of the Death-like and TRADD-N superfamilies. We show the former to have arisen as part of a radiation of effector-associated α-helical adaptor domains that likely mediate homotypic interactions bringing together diverse effector and signaling domains in predicted bacterial apoptosis- and counter-invader systems. Similarly, we show that the TRADD-N domain defines a key, widespread signaling bridge that links effector deployment to invader-sensing in multicellular bacterial and metazoan counter-invader systems. TRADD-N domains are expanded in aggregating marine invertebrates and point to distinctive diversifying immune strategies probably directed both at RNA and retro- viruses and cellular pathogens that might infect such communities. These TRADD-N and Death-like domains helped identify several new bacterial and metazoan counter-invader systems featuring under-appreciated, common functional principles: the use of intracellular invader-sensing lectin-like (NPCBM and FGS), transcription elongation GreA/B-C, glycosyltransferase-4 family, inactive NTPase (serving as nucleic-acid-receptors) and invader-sensing GTPase switch domains. Finally, these findings point to the possibility of multicellular bacteria-stem metazoan symbiosis in the emergence of the immune/apoptotic systems of the latter.

A voucher is a permanently preserved specimen that is maintained in an accessible collection. In genomics, vouchers serve as the physical evidence for the taxonomic identification of genome assemblies. Unfortunately, the vast majority of vertebrate genomes stored in the Genbank database do not refer to voucher specimens. Here, we urge researchers generating new genome assemblies to deposit voucher specimens in accessible, permanent research collections, and to link these vouchers to publications, public databases, and repositories. We also encourage scientists to deposit voucher specimens in order to recognize the work of local field biologists and promote a diverse and inclusive knowledge base, and we recommend best practices to in voucher deposition to prevent taxonomic errors and ensure reproducibility and legality in genetic studies.

Reconstruction of nitrergic neurons (NNs) found in one section of the representation of the forepaw of the rat in different cortical compartments in somatosensory area S1 and motor area M1. NNs are more densely packed in the upper layers (I–III) and more sparsely distributed in Layer V. Scale bar: 100 μm.







Abstract
Nitrergic neurons (NNs) are inhibitory neurons capable of releasing nitric oxide (NO) that are labeled with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase histochemistry. The rat primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices are a favorable model to investigate NN populations by comparing their morphology, since these areas share the border of forepaw representation. The distribution of the Type I NN of the forepaw representation in the S1 and M1 cortices of the rat in different laminar compartments and the morphological parameters related to the cell body and dendritic arborization were measured and compared. We observed that the neuronal density in the S1 (130 NN/mm3) was higher than the neuronal density in the M1 (119 NN/mm3). Most NN neurons were multipolar (S1 with 58%; M1 with 69%), and a minority of the NN neurons were horizontal (S1 with 6%; M1 with 12%). NN found in S1 had a higher verticality index than NN found in M1, and no significant differences were observed for the other morphological parameters. We also demonstrated significant differences in most of the morphological parameters of the NN between different cortical compartments of S1 and M1. Our results indicate that the NN of the forepaw in S1 and M1 corresponds to a neuronal population, where the functionality is independent of the different types of sensory and motor processing. However, the morphological differences found between the cortical compartments of S1 and M1, as well as the higher density of NNs found in S1, indicate that the release of NO varies between the areas.

Abstract
Egg laying in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis is regulated by the photoperiod; long‐day conditions (16L8D) promote egg laying whereas medium‐day conditions (12L12D) suppress it. In this snail, a caudo‐dorsal cell hormone (CDCH) is produced by neurosecretory cells, CDCs in the cerebral ganglion (CG), and its release triggers ovulation and subsequent egg laying. However, the physiological basis for photoperiod‐dependent egg laying remains unraveled. Here, we compared electrophysiological properties of CDCs between 16L8D and 12L12D using intracellular recording, and found that CDC excitability is higher in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Striking differences are as follows: 1) A shallower resting membrane potential in 16L8D than in 12L12D, and 2) a smaller threshold voltage (minimum depolarization from rest to elicit action potentials) in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Switching of the excitability can be a physiological basis of a photoperiod‐dependent CDCH release. Simultaneous intracellular dye injection identified two morphological subtypes of CDCs, validating a previous report. Both types bear short lateral extensions in CG, some of which probably function as integration sites of photoperiodic inputs. In addition, we found two novel CDCH‐immunoreactive cell groups (CDCCOM and SCm) in the CG besides conventional CDCs and small cells expressing CDCH. The CDCCOM with cell bodies and fibers in the neurohemal commissure may be involved in triggering ovulation. Notably, the total number of CDCs is larger than that previously reported, the right CDC cluster with more cells than the left. Our findings are instructive in following the neurophysiology of photoperiodism in L. stagnalis.

Objective
We aimed to determine whether in relapsing multiple sclerosis intrathecal IgM and IgG synthesis are associated with outcomes reflecting inflammatory activity and chronic worsening.


Methods
We compared CSF analysis, clinical and MRI data, and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels at baseline and follow‐up in 530 patients with relapsing MS. Patients were categorized by presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB) and intrathecal synthesis of IgG and IgM (IgGIntrathecal Fraction (IF), IgMIF). Relations to time to first relapse, sNfL concentrations, T2w lesions, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and time to initiation of high efficacy therapy were analyzed in covariate adjusted statistical models.


Results
By categorical analysis, in patients with IgMIF median time to first relapse was 28 months shorter and MSSS was on average higher by 1.11 steps compared to those without intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Moreover, patients with IgMIF had higher sNfL concentrations, more new/enlarging T2w lesions and higher total T2w lesion counts (all p&lt;/= 0.01). These associations were absent, or equally smaller in patients who were only positive for OCGB or OCGB/IgGIF.
Furthermore, quantitative analyses revealed that in patients with IgMIF ≥ median, time to first relapse and to initiation of high efficacy therapy was shorter by 32 and by 203 months (both p &lt; 0.01), as compared to patients with IgMIF &lt; median; dose‐dependent associations were also found for IgMIF but not for IgGIF with MRI defined disease activity and sNfL.


Interpretation
This large study supports the value of intrathecal IgM synthesis as an independent biomarker of disease activity and severity in relapsing MS.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25193?af=R">A causal role for the pulvinar in coordinating task‐independent cortico–cortical interactions</a></h4>

Abstract
The pulvinar is the largest nucleus in the primate thalamus and has topographically organized connections with multiple cortical areas, thereby forming extensive cortico‐pulvino‐cortical input–output loops. Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico–cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task‐dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large‐scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (lateral intraparietal area [LIP]) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4–15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4–15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large‐scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.

<p>Beta oscillations have been predominantly observed in sensorimotor cortices and basal ganglia structures and they are thought to be involved in somatosensory processing and motor control. Although beta activity is a distinct feature of healthy and pathological sensorimotor processing, the role of this rhythm is still under debate. Here we review recent findings about the role of beta oscillations during experimental manipulations (i.e., drugs and brain stimulation) and their alteration in aging and pathology. We show how beta changes when learning new motor skills and its potential to integrate sensory input with prior contextual knowledge. We conclude by discussing a novel methodological approach analyzing beta oscillations as a series of transient bursting events.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.673740">A Skull-Removed Chronic Cranial Window for Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Imaging of the Rodent Brain</a></h4>

<p>Ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging are emerging as powerful tools to study brain structures and functions. The skull introduces significant distortion and attenuation of the ultrasound signals deteriorating image quality. For biological studies employing rodents, craniotomy is often times performed to enhance image qualities. However, craniotomy is unsuitable for longitudinal studies, where a long-term cranial window is needed to prevent repeated surgeries. Here, we propose a mouse model to eliminate sound blockage by the top portion of the skull, while minimum physiological perturbation to the imaged object is incurred. With the new mouse model, no craniotomy is needed before each imaging experiment. The effectiveness of our method was confirmed by three imaging systems: photoacoustic computed tomography, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic mesoscopy. Functional photoacoustic imaging of the mouse brain hemodynamics was also conducted. We expect new applications to be enabled by the new mouse model for photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging.</p>

<p>Miniaturized implantable devices play a crucial role in neural interfaces by monitoring and modulating neural activities on the peripheral and central nervous systems. Research efforts toward a compact wireless closed-loop system stimulating the nerve automatically according to the user's condition have been maintained. These systems have several advantages over open-loop stimulation systems such as reduction in both power consumption and side effects of continuous stimulation. Furthermore, a compact and wireless device consuming low energy alleviates foreign body reactions and risk of frequent surgical operations. Unfortunately, however, the miniaturized closed-loop neural interface system induces several hardware design challenges such as neural activity recording with severe stimulation artifact, real-time stimulation artifact removal, and energy-efficient wireless power delivery. Here, we will review recent approaches toward the miniaturized closed-loop neural interface system with integrated circuit (IC) techniques.</p>

Background<p>It is reported that radiomic features extracted from quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) had promising clinical value for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). We aimed to explore the usefulness of radiomics features based on magnitude images to distinguish PD from non-PD controls.</p>Methods<p>We retrospectively recruited PD patients and controls who underwent brain 3.0T MR including susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). A total of 396 radiomics features were extracted from the SN of 95 PD patients and 95 non-PD controls based on SWI. Intra-/inter-observer correlation coefficients (ICCs) were applied to measure the observer agreement for the radiomic feature extraction. Then the patients were randomly grouped into training and validation sets in a ratio of 7:3. In the training set, the maximum correlation minimum redundancy algorithm (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were conducted to filter and choose the optimized subset of features, and a radiomics signature was constructed. Moreover, radiomics signatures were constructed by different machine learning models. Area under the ROC curves (AUCs) were applied to evaluate the predictive performance of the models. Then correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between the optimized features and clinical factors.</p>Results<p>The intro-observer CC ranged from 0.82 to 1.0, and the inter-observer CC ranged from 0.77 to 0.99. The LASSO logistic regression model showed good prediction efficacy in the training set [AUC = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI, 0.74–0.88)] and the validation set [AUC = 0.81, 95% CI (0.68–0.91)]. One radiomic feature showed a moderate negative correlation with Hoehn-Yahr stage (r = −0.49, P = 0.012).</p>Conclusion<p>Radiomic predictive features based on SWI magnitude images could reflect the Hoehn-Yahr stage of PD to some extent.</p>

<p>Vision is the main entrance for environmental input to the human brain. Even if vision is our most used sensory modality, its importance is not limited to environmental exploration. Rather it has strong links to motor competences, further extending to cognitive and social aspects of human life. These multifaceted relationships are particularly important in developmental age and become dramatically evident in presence of complex deficits originating from visual aberrancies. The present review summarizes the available neuropsychological evidence on the development of visual competences, with a particular focus on the associated visuo-motor integration skills in health and disease. With the aim of supporting future research and interventional settings, the goal of the present review is to constitute a solid base to help the translation of neuropsychological hypotheses into straightforward empirical investigations and rehabilitation/training protocols. This approach will further increase the impact, ameliorate the acceptance, and ease the use and implementation of lab-derived intervention protocols in real-life situations.</p>

<p>Neuronal morphology is characterized by salient features such as complex axonal and dendritic arbors. In the mammalian brain, variations in dendritic morphology among cell classes, brain regions, and animal species are thought to underlie known differences in neuronal function. In this work, we obtained a large dataset from http://neuromorpho.org/ comprising layer III pyramidal cells in different cortical areas of the ventral visual pathway (V1, V2, V4, TEO, and TE) of the macaque monkey at different developmental stages. We performed an in depth quantitative analysis of pyramidal cell morphology throughout development in an effort to determine which aspects mature early in development and which features require a protracted period of maturation. We were also interested in establishing if developmental changes in morphological features occur simultaneously or hierarchically in multiple visual cortical areas. We addressed these questions by performing principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis on relevant morphological features. Our analysis indicates that the maturation of pyramidal cell morphology is largely based on early development of topological features in most visual cortical areas. Moreover, the maturation of pyramidal cell morphology in V1, V2, V4, TEO, and TE is characterized by unique developmental trajectories.</p>

<p>The nervous systems converts the physical quantities sensed by its primary receptors into trains of events that are then processed in the brain. The unmatched efficiency in information processing has long inspired engineers to seek brain-like approaches to sensing and signal processing. The key principle pursued in neuromorphic sensing is to shed the traditional approach of periodic sampling in favor of an event-driven scheme that mimicks sampling as it occurs in the nervous system, where events are preferably emitted upon the change of the sensed stimulus. In this paper we highlight the advantages and challenges of event-based sensing and signal processing in the visual, auditory and olfactory domains. We also provide a survey of the literature covering neuromorphic sensing and signal processing in all three modalities. Our aim is to facilitate research in event-based sensing and signal processing by providing a comprehensive overview of the research performed previously as well as highlighting conceptual advantages, current progress and future challenges in the field.</p>

<p>Somatosensory neurons (SSNs) densely innervate our largest organ, the skin, and shape our experience of the world, mediating responses to sensory stimuli including touch, pressure, and temperature. Historically, epidermal contributions to somatosensation, including roles in shaping innervation patterns and responses to sensory stimuli, have been understudied. However, recent work demonstrates that epidermal signals dictate patterns of SSN skin innervation through a variety of mechanisms including targeting afferents to the epidermis, providing instructive cues for branching morphogenesis, growth control and structural stability of neurites, and facilitating neurite-neurite interactions. Here, we focus onstudies conducted in worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and zebrafish (Danio rerio): prominent model systems in which anatomical and genetic analyses have defined fundamental principles by which epidermal cells govern SSN development.</p>

<p>Familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (FHM3) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SCN1A gene that encodes the α1 subunit of voltage-gated Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 sodium channels. The high level of expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels in peripheral trigeminal neurons may lead to abnormal nociceptive signaling thus contributing to migraine pain. Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 dysfunction is relevant also for other neurological disorders, foremost epilepsy and stroke that are comorbid with migraine. Here we used computer modeling to test the functional role of FHM3-mutated Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels in mechanisms of trigeminal pain. The activation of Aδ-fibers was studied for two algogens, ATP and 5-HT, operating through P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors, respectively, at trigeminal nerve terminals. In WT Aδ-fibers of meningeal afferents, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels efficiently participate in spike generation induced by ATP and 5-HT supported by Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels. Of the various FHM3 mutations tested, the L263V missense mutation, with a longer activation state and lower activation voltage, resulted in the most pronounced spiking activity. In contrast, mutations that result in a loss of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 function largely reduced firing of trigeminal nerve fibers. The combined activation of P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors and branching of nerve fibers resulted in very prolonged and high-frequency spiking activity in the mutants compared to WT. We identified, in silico, key determinants of long-lasting nociceptive activity in FHM3-mutated Aδ-fibers that naturally express P2X3 and 5-HT3 receptors and suggest mutant-specific correction options. Modeled trigeminal nerve firing was significantly higher for FHM3 mutations, compared to WT, suggesting that pronounced nociceptive signaling may contribute to migraine pain.</p>

<p>This work presents the first simulation of a large-scale, bio-physically constrained cerebellum model performed on neuromorphic hardware. A model containing 97,000 neurons and 4.2 million synapses is simulated on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic system. Results are validated against a baseline simulation of the same model executed with NEST, a popular spiking neural network simulator using generic computational resources and double precision floating point arithmetic. Individual cell and network-level spiking activity is validated in terms of average spike rates, relative lead or lag of spike times, and membrane potential dynamics of individual neurons, and SpiNNaker is shown to produce results in agreement with NEST. Once validated, the model is used to investigate how to accelerate the simulation speed of the network on the SpiNNaker system, with the future goal of creating a real-time neuromorphic cerebellum. Through detailed communication profiling, peak network activity is identified as one of the main challenges for simulation speed-up. Propagation of spiking activity through the network is measured, and will inform the future development of accelerated execution strategies for cerebellum models on neuromorphic hardware. The large ratio of granule cells to other cell types in the model results in high levels of activity converging onto few cells, with those cells having relatively larger time costs associated with the processing of communication. Organizing cells on SpiNNaker in accordance with their spatial position is shown to reduce the peak communication load by 41%. It is hoped that these insights, together with alternative parallelization strategies, will pave the way for real-time execution of large-scale, bio-physically constrained cerebellum models on SpiNNaker. This in turn will enable exploration of cerebellum-inspired controllers for neurorobotic applications, and execution of extended duration simulations over timescales that would currently be prohibitive using conventional computational platforms.</p>

<p>Mammals are born on a precocial–altricial continuum. Altricial species produce helpless neonates with closed distant organs incapable of locomotion, whereas precocial species give birth to well-developed young that possess sophisticated sensory and locomotor capabilities. Previous studies suggest that distinct patterns of cortex development differ between precocial and altricial species. This study compares patterns of neocortex neurogenesis and maturation in the precocial guinea pig and altricial dwarf rabbit, both belonging to the taxon of Glires. We show that the principal order of neurodevelopmental events is preserved in the neocortex of both species. Moreover, we show that neurogenesis starts at a later postconceptional day and takes longer in absolute gestational days in the precocial than the altricial neocortex. Intriguingly, our data indicate that the dwarf rabbit neocortex contains a higher abundance of highly proliferative basal progenitors than the guinea pig, which might underlie its higher encephalization quotient, demonstrating that the amount of neuron production is determined by complex regulation of multiple factors. Furthermore, we show that the guinea pig neocortex exhibits a higher maturation status at birth, thus providing evidence for the notions that precocial species might have acquired the morphological machinery required to attain their high functional state at birth and that brain expansion in the precocial newborn is mainly due to prenatally initiating processes of gliogenesis and neuron differentiation instead of increased neurogenesis. Together, this study reveals important insights into the timing and cellular differences that regulate mammalian brain growth and maturation and provides a better understanding of the evolution of mammalian altriciality and presociality.</p>

<p>Electron microscopy (EM)-based synaptology is a fundamental discipline for achieving a complex wiring diagram of the brain. A quantitative understanding of synaptic ultrastructure also serves as a basis to estimate the relative magnitude of synaptic transmission across individual circuits in the brain. Although conventional light microscopic techniques have substantially contributed to our ever-increasing understanding of the morphological characteristics of the putative synaptic junctions, EM is the gold standard for systematic visualization of the synaptic morphology. Furthermore, a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of an individual synaptic profile is required for the precise quantitation of different parameters that shape synaptic transmission. While volumetric imaging of synapses can be routinely obtained from the transmission EM (TEM) imaging of ultrathin sections, it requires an unimaginable amount of effort and time to reconstruct very long segments of dendrites and their spines from the serial section TEM images. The challenges of low throughput EM imaging have been addressed to an appreciable degree by the development of automated EM imaging tools that allow imaging and reconstruction of dendritic segments in a realistic time frame. Here, we review studies that have been instrumental in determining the three-dimensional ultrastructure of synapses. With a particular focus on dendritic spine synapses in the rodent brain, we discuss various key studies that have highlighted the structural diversity of spines, the principles of their organization in the dendrites, their presynaptic wiring patterns, and their activity-dependent structural remodeling.</p>

<p>The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays an essential role in age-related cognitive decline. However, the effect of functional connectivity (FC) changes between EC and other cerebral cortices on cognitive function remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the modulation of two interventions (cognitive training and aerobic exercise) on EC-FC in community-dwelling older adults. In total, 94 healthy older adults aged between 65 and 75 years were assigned to either the cognitive training or aerobic exercise group to receive 24 sessions over 12 weeks, or to a control group. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at both baseline and 12-month follow-up. Compared to the cognitive training group, the aerobic exercise group showed greater EC-FC in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus. Compared to the control group, the cognitive training group had a decreased EC-FC in the right hippocampus, right middle temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and right postcentral gyrus and an increased EC-FC in the bilateral pallidum, while the aerobic exercise group showed increased EC-FC between the right medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC), bilateral pallidum, and right precuneus. Baseline EC-FC in the mPFC was positively correlated with the visuospatial/constructional index score of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. In the cognitive training group, EC-FC value changes in the right hippocampus were negatively correlated with changes in the RBANS delayed memory index score, while in the aerobic exercise group, EC-FC value changes in the left angular gyrus were positively correlated with changes in the RBANS attention index score. These findings support the hypothesis that both cognitive training and aerobic exercise can modulate EC-FC in aging populations but through different neural pathways.</p>

<p>Many clinical symptoms of sporadic Parkinson’s disease (sPD) cannot be completely explained by a lesion of the simple typical extrapyramidal circuit between the striatum and substantia nigra. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the new potential damaged pathogenesis of other brain regions associated with the multiple and complex clinical symptoms of sPD through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 65 patients with mid-stage sPD and 35 healthy controls were recruited in this study. Cortical structural connectivity was assessed by seed-based analysis using the vertex-based morphology of MRI. Seven different clusters in the brain regions of cortical thickness thinning derived from the regression analysis using brain size as covariates between sPD and control were selected as seeds. Results showed that the significant alteration of cortical structural connectivity mainly occurred in the bilateral frontal orbital, opercular, triangular, precentral, rectus, supplementary-motor, temporal pole, angular, Heschl, parietal, supramarginal, postcentral, precuneus, occipital, lingual, cuneus, Rolandic-opercular, cingulum, parahippocampal, calcarine, olfactory, insula, paracentral-lobule, and fusiform regions at the mid-stage of sPD. These findings suggested that the extensive alteration of cortical structural connectivity is one of possible pathogenesis resulting in the multiple and complex clinical symptoms in sPD.</p>

Background<p>Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after orthopedic surgery in elderly patients. The elderly may experience drastic changes in autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and circadian rhythm disorders after surgery. Therefore, we intend to explore the relationship between postoperative long-term heart rate (HR) variability (HRV), as a measure of ANS activity and circadian rhythm, and occurrence of POD in elderly patients.</p>Methods<p>The study population of this cohort was elderly patients over 60 years of age who scheduled for orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. Patients were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria before surgery. Then, participants were invited to wear a Holter monitor on the first postoperative day to collect 24-h electrocardiographic (ECG) data. Parameters in the time domain [the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (SDNN), mean of the standard deviations of all the NN intervals for each 5-min segment of a 24-h HRV recording (SDNNI), and the root mean square of successive differences of the NN intervals (RMSSD)] and frequency domain [heart rate (HR), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), very low frequency (VLF), ultra low frequency (ULF), and total power (TP)] were calculated. Assessment of delirium was performed daily up to the seventh postoperative day using the Chinese version of the 3-Min Diagnostic Interview for CAM-defined Delirium (3D-CAM). The relationship between HRV and POD, as well as the association between HRV and duration of POD, was assessed.</p>Results<p>Of the 294 cases that finally completed the follow-up, 60 cases developed POD. Among the HRV parameters, SDNNI, VLF, and ULF were related to the occurrence of POD. After adjustment for potential confounders, the correlation between HRV indices and POD disappeared. Through stratified analysis, two significant negative correlations emerged: ULF in young-old participants and SDNNI, VLF, and ULF in male patients.</p>Conclusion<p>The lower HRV parameters may be related to the occurrence of POD, and this correlation is more significant in young-old and male patients. ANS disorders and rhythm abnormalities reflected by HRV changes may represent a possible mechanism that promotes POD.</p>

Genetic variation in a key neuromodulatory enzyme of the endocannabinoid system is linked to alterations in fear extinction neural circuitry. Variation in this system may help identify individuals who are at risk of developing a trauma‐related disorder or may benefit from exposure‐based therapies.

Abstract
Poor fear extinction learning and recall are linked to the development of fear‐based disorders, like posttraumatic stress disorder, and are associated with aberrant activation of fear‐related neural circuitry. This includes greater amygdala activation during extinction learning and lesser hippocampal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation during recall. Emerging data indicate that genetic variation in fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH C385A; rs324420) is associated with increased peripheral endocannabinoid (eCB) levels and lesser threat‐related amygdala reactivity. Preclinical studies link increased eCB signaling to better extinction learning and recall, thus FAAH C385A may protect against the development of trauma‐related psychopathology by facilitating extinction learning. However, how this FAAH variant affects fear extinction neural circuitry remains unknown. In the present study, we used a novel, immersive‐reality fear extinction paradigm paired with functional neuroimaging to assess FAAH C385A effects on fear‐related neural circuitry and conditioned fear responding (US expectancy ratings, subjective units of distress, and skin conductance responding) in healthy adults from an urban area (Detroit, MI; N = 59; C/C = 35, A‐carrier = 24). We found lesser amygdala activation in A‐allele carriers, compared to C/C homozygotes, during early extinction recall. Likewise, we found lesser dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and greater hippocampus activation in early extinction learning in A‐carriers compared to C/C homozygotes. We found no effects of FAAH C385A on vmPFC activation or behavioral fear indices. These data support and extend previous findings that FAAH genetic variation, associated with increased eCB signaling and subsequent enhanced fear extinction, may predict individual differences in successful fear learning.

Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) sense glutamate released at synapses via direct synaptic contacts and through volume transmission, which regulates the OPC stem cell like property of self‐renewal. In this study, we show that blocking synaptic transmission using botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) significantly decreased OPC numbers and resulted in cellular atrophy in vivo in the adult mouse hippocampus. Adult OPCs are responsible for life‐long generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes and dysregulation of OPC function would potentially decrease their capacity for repair in pathological scenarios characterized by decreased synaptic activity, such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.
​

Abstract
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are responsible for generating oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS. Life‐long myelination is promoted by neuronal activity and is essential for neural network plasticity and learning. OPCs are known to contact synapses and it is proposed that neuronal synaptic activity in turn regulates their behavior. To examine this in the adult, we performed unilateral injection of the synaptic blocker botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) into the hippocampus of adult mice. We confirm BoNT/A cleaves SNAP‐25 in the CA1 are of the hippocampus, which has been proven to block neurotransmission. Notably, BoNT/A significantly decreased OPC density and caused their shrinkage, as determined by immunolabeling for the OPC marker NG2. Furthermore, BoNT/A resulted in an overall decrease in the number of OPC processes, as well as a decrease in their lengths and branching frequency. These data indicate that synaptic activity is important for maintaining adult OPC numbers and cellular integrity, which is relevant to pathophysiological scenarios characterized by dysregulation of synaptic activity, such as age‐related cognitive decline, Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.

Memory formation requires initiation of new protein synthesis as well as protein synthesis in dendrites, but it is unknown whether initiation can happen within dendritic spines. We combined immunolabeling with serial section 3D electron microscopy to examine the distribution of three initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α in dendritic spines of the lateral amygdala during formation of a Pavlovian conditioning memory. Top row: Electron micrographs showing labeled spines (arrows) with synapses (arrowheads). Bottom left: Segment of dendrite reconstructed from serial sections with synapses shown in red. Bottom right: The percentage of spines containing labeling for eIF4E was higher after training, but there were no differences for eIF4G1 or eIF2α labeling.







Abstract
Local translation can provide a rapid, spatially targeted supply of new proteins in distal dendrites to support synaptic changes that underlie learning. Learning and memory are especially sensitive to manipulations of translational control mechanisms, particularly those that target the initiation step, and translation initiation at synapses could be a means of maintaining synapse specificity during plasticity. Initiation predominantly occurs via recruitment of ribosomes to the 5′ mRNA cap by complexes of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G1 is a particularly important target of translational control pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E–eIF4G1 binding impairs formation of memory for aversive Pavlovian conditioning as well as the accompanying increase in polyribosomes in the heads of dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala (LA). This is consistent with a role for initiation at synapses in memory formation, but whether eIFs are even present near synapses is unknown. To determine whether dendritic spines contain eIFs and whether eIF distribution is affected by learning, we combined immunolabeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume reconstructions of LA dendrites after Pavlovian conditioning. Labeling for eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α—another key target of regulation—occurred in roughly half of dendritic spines, but learning effects were only found for eIF4E, which was upregulated in the heads of dendritic spines. Our results support the possibility of regulated translation initiation as a means of synapse‐specific protein targeting during learning and are consistent with the model of eIF4E availability as a central point of control.

These are the identified wide‐field and medium‐field amacrine cells that made synapses onto a broad thorny ganglion cell (purple) in central macaque retina. The wide field amacrine cells included three wiry amacrine cells (green), a semilunar cell (aqua), and a stellate wavy cell (yellow). The medium‐field cells included a starburst amacrine cell (red) and a spiny amacrine cell (orange). These amacrine cell inputs are expected to mediate the responses of the broad thorny ganglion cells to stimuli outside their classical receptive fields.







Abstract
In primates, broad thorny retinal ganglion cells are highly sensitive to small, moving stimuli. They have tortuous, fine dendrites with many short, spine‐like branches that occupy three contiguous strata in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. The neural circuits that generate their responses to moving stimuli are not well‐understood, and that was the goal of this study. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial block‐face scanning electron microscopy, a broad thorny cell was reconstructed, and its synaptic inputs were analyzed. It received fewer than 2% of its inputs from both ON and OFF types of bipolar cells; the vast majority of its inputs were from amacrine cells. The presynaptic amacrine cells were reconstructed, and seven types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. Two types of narrow‐field cells, knotty bistratified Type 1 and wavy multistratified Type 2, were identified. Two types of medium‐field amacrine cells, ON starburst and spiny, were also presynaptic to the broad thorny cell. Three types of wide‐field amacrine cells, wiry Type 2, stellate wavy, and semilunar Type 2, also made synapses onto the broad thorny cell. Physiological experiments using a macaque retinal preparation in vitro confirmed that broad thorny cells received robust excitatory input from both the ON and the OFF pathways. Given the paucity of bipolar cell inputs, it is likely that amacrine cells provided much of the excitatory input, in addition to inhibitory input.

Mice lacking the microglial receptor CX3CR1 display several phenotypes in the auditory brainstem. They have normal pruning in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and increased expression of mature astrocyte markers. They have normal auditory brainstem recording (ABR) thresholds, but the ABR latencies are decreased. They show increased expression of inhibitory presynaptic terminal markers, possibly reflecting impaired inhibitory pruning. Finally, CX3CR1−/− mice lack the tonotopic gradients seen for cell body size and calyx of Held size in the MNTB.







Abstract
The precise and specialized circuitry in the auditory brainstem develops through adaptations of cellular and molecular signaling. We previously showed that elimination of microglia during development impairs synaptic pruning that leads to maturation of the calyx of Held, a large encapsulating synapse that terminates on neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia depletion also led to a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for mature astrocytes. Here, we investigated the role of signaling through the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), which is expressed by microglia and mediates communication with neurons. CX3CR1−/− and wild‐type mice were studied before and after hearing onset and at 9 weeks of age. Levels of GFAP were significantly increased in the MNTB in mutants at 9 weeks. Pruning was unaffected at the calyx of Held, but we found an increase in expression of glycinergic synaptic marker in mutant mice at P14, suggesting an effect on maturation of inhibitory inputs. We observed disrupted tonotopic gradients of neuron and calyx size in MNTB in mutant mice. Auditory brainstem recording (ABR) revealed that CX3CR1−/− mice had normal thresholds and amplitudes but decreased latencies and interpeak latencies, particularly for the highest frequencies. These results demonstrate that disruption of fractalkine signaling has a significant effect on auditory brainstem development. Our findings highlight the importance of neuron–microglia–astrocyte communication in pruning of inhibitory synapses and establishment of tonotopic gradients early in postnatal development.

Using monosynaptic rabies virus tracing, we have identified the distribution of input cells to basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal subtypes defined by axonal projection patterns. Overall, central nucleus of amygdala‐, nucleus accumbens‐, ventral hippocampus‐projecting BLA neurons receive similar monosynaptic input from various brain regions. However, there are some preferential input patterns among the subtypes, which are likely to be attributed to the differential localization of the starter cells.







Abstract
The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a region critical for emotional processing, is the limbic hub that is connected with various brain regions. BLA neurons are classified into different subtypes that exhibit differential projection patterns and mediate distinct emotional behaviors; however, little is known about their presynaptic input patterns. In this study, we employed projection‐specific monosynaptic rabies virus tracing to identify the direct monosynaptic inputs to BLA subtypes. We found that each neuronal subtype receives long‐range projection input from specific brain regions. In contrast to their specific axonal projection patterns, all BLA neuronal subtypes exhibited relatively similar input patterns. This anatomical organization supports the idea that the BLA is a central integrator that associates sensory information in different modalities with valence and sends associative information to behaviorally relevant brain regions.

Mechanosensory neurons in the human tongue and hard palate were identified using immunohistochemical methods. In fungiform taste papillae, Meissner‐like corpuscles were found within the lamina propria and putative mechanosensory neurons were identified that surround taste buds. In filiform non‐taste papillae, end bulbs of Krause were the predominant sensory ending. Novel sensory endings were also identified, including subepithelial neuronal densities and the endings of myelinated neurons that innervate the epithelium. In the hard‐palate mucosa, Meissner corpuscles and glomerular endings were identified in the lamina propria, and Merkel‐cell neurite complexes were identified in epithelia. This rich cadre of neuronal endings is poised to mediate mechanosensory control of feeding and speech.







Abstract
The oral somatosensory system relays essential information about mechanical stimuli to enable oral functions such as feeding and speech. The neurochemical and anatomical diversity of sensory neurons across oral cavity sites have not been systematically compared. To address this gap, we analyzed healthy human tongue and hard‐palate innervation. Biopsies were collected from 12 volunteers and underwent fluorescent immunohistochemistry (≥2 specimens per marker/structure). Afferents were analyzed for markers of neurons (βIII tubulin), myelinated afferents (neurofilament heavy, NFH), and Merkel cells and taste cells (keratin 20, K20). Hard‐palate innervation included Meissner corpuscles, glomerular endings, Merkel cell‐neurite complexes, and free nerve endings. The organization of these somatosensory endings is reminiscent of fingertips, suggesting that the hard palate is equipped with a rich repertoire of sensory neurons for pressure sensing and spatial localization of mechanical inputs, which are essential for speech production and feeding. Likewise, the tongue is innervated by afferents that impart it with exquisite acuity and detection of moving stimuli that support flavor construction and speech. Filiform papillae contained end bulbs of Krause, as well as endings that have not been previously reported, including subepithelial neuronal densities, and NFH+ neurons innervating basal epithelia. Fungiform papillae had Meissner corpuscles and densities of NFH+ intraepithelial neurons surrounding taste buds. The differing compositions of sensory endings within filiform and fungiform papillae suggest that these structures have distinct roles in mechanosensation. Collectively, this study has identified previously undescribed neuronal endings in human oral tissues and provides an anatomical framework for understanding oral mechanosensory functions.

Pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) expressing serial sister cell types of the mammalian cerebellum and dorsal cochlear nucleus are supposed to share genetic programs. We show that two out of three Ptf1a lineal cell types differ with respect to their Ladybird homeobox protein homolog 1 expression. Our results uncover an unexpected genetic incongruence.







Abstract
The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a mammalian‐specific nucleus of the auditory system. Anatomically, it is classified as a cerebellum‐like structure. These structures are proposed to share genetic programs with the cerebellum. Previous analyses demonstrated that inhibitory serial sister cell types (SCTs) of the DCN and cerebellum are derived from the pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) lineage. Postmitotic neurons of the Ptf1a lineage often express the transcription factor Ladybird homeobox protein homolog 1 (Lbx1) which is involved in neuronal cell fate determination. Lbx1 is therefore an attractive candidate for a further component of the genetic program shared between the DCN and cerebellum. Here, we used cell‐type specific marker analysis in combination with an Lbx1 reporter mouse line to analyze in both tissues which cell types of the Ptf1a lineage express Lbx1. In the DCN, stellate cells and Purkinje‐like cartwheel cells were part of the Lbx1 lineage and Golgi cells were not, as determined by cell counts. In contrast, in the cerebellum, stellate cells and Golgi cells were part of the Lbx1 lineage and Purkinje cells were not. Hence, two out of three phenotypically similar cell types differed with respect to their Lbx1 expression. Our study demonstrates that Lbx1 is differentially recruited to the developmental genetic program of inhibitory neurons both within a given tissue and between the DCN and cerebellum. The differential expression of Lbx1 within the DCN and the cerebellum might contribute to the genetic individuation of the inhibitory SCTs to adapt to circuit specific tasks.

Retinal photoreceptors express visual opsins that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. The consequences of opsin disruption on retinal development are poorly understood. Here, the ultraviolet (short‐wavelength sensitive 1, sws1) opsin of rainbow trout was partially knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system. Knockouts showed a disrupted outer retina consisting of diminished opsin expression, absent or stunted outer segments, photoreceptor degeneration, and loss of mosaic regularity. These findings indicate developmental roles of visual opsins beyond phototransduction.







Abstract
Visual opsins are proteins expressed by retinal photoreceptors that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. In vertebrates, the two types of photoreceptors (rods and cones) express one or multiple opsins and are distributed in variable patterns across the retina. Some cones form opsin retinal gradients, as in the mouse, whereas others form more demarcated opsin domains, as in the lattice‐like mosaic retinas of teleost fishes. Reduced rod opsin (rh1) expression in mouse, zebrafish, and African clawed frog results in lack of photoreceptor outer segments (i.e., the cilium that houses the opsins) and, in the case of the mouse, to retinal degeneration. The effects of diminished cone opsin expression have only been studied in the mouse where knockout of the short‐wavelength sensitive 1 (sws1) opsin leads to ventral retinal cones lacking outer segments, but no retinal degeneration. Here we show that, following CRISPR/Cas9 injections that targeted knockout of the sws1 opsin in rainbow trout, fish with diminished sws1 opsin expression exhibited a variety of developmental defects including head and eye malformations, underdeveloped outer retina, mislocalized opsin expression, cone degeneration, and mosaic irregularity. All photoreceptor types were affected even though sws1 is only expressed in the single cones of wild fish. Our results reveal unprecedented developmental defects associated with diminished cone opsin expression and suggest that visual opsin genes are involved in regulatory processes that precede photoreceptor differentiation.

Using neuronal tract tracing and immunohistochemical methods, we have identified a previously unreported group of auditory efferent neurons located in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus that project unmyelinated axons to the inner hair cell region in mouse. These “dorsal efferents” were then anatomically characterized using a combination of light, fluorescent and electron microscopy, and their possible functional significance within the context of the known olivocochlear efferents is discussed.







Abstract
Auditory efferents originate in the central auditory system and project to the cochlea. Although the specific anatomy of the olivocochlear (OC) efferents can vary between species, two types of auditory efferents have been identified based upon the general location of their cell bodies and their distinctly different axon terminations in the organ of Corti. In the mouse, the relatively small somata of the lateral (LOC) efferents reside in the lateral superior olive (LSO), have unmyelinated axons, and terminate around ipsilateral inner hair cells (IHCs), primarily against the afferent processes of type I auditory nerve fibers. In contrast, the larger somata of the medial (MOC) efferents are distributed in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB), have myelinated axons, and terminate bilaterally against the base of multiple outer hair cells (OHCs). Using in vivo retrograde cell body marking, anterograde axon tracing, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, we have identified a group of efferent neurons in mouse, whose cell bodies reside in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL). By virtue of their location, we call them dorsal efferent (DE) neurons. Labeled DE cells were immuno‐negative for tyrosine hydroxylase, glycine, and GABA, but immuno‐positive for choline acetyltransferase. Morphologically, DEs resembled LOC efferents by their small somata, unmyelinated axons, and ipsilateral projection to IHCs. These three classes of efferent neurons all project axons directly to the cochlea and exhibit cholinergic staining characteristics. The challenge is to discover the contributions of this new population of neurons to auditory efferent function.

Prichard et al. examined dogs' perception of real‐world objects using awake, unrestrained fMRI. Using the same video stimuli and real‐world objects, they identified object‐selective regions of the dog brain. Object regions of the dog brain responded more to objects associated with a mouth action than objects associated with a paw action. Somatosensory cortex was active during dogs' anticipation of performing a mouth action on an object. This suggests that dogs' perception of objects depends on how dogs expect to interact with them.







Abstract
The perception and representation of objects in the world are foundational to all animals. The relative importance of objects' physical properties versus how the objects are interacted with continues to be debated. Neural evidence in humans and nonhuman primates suggests animate‐inanimate and face‐body dimensions of objects are represented in the temporal cortex. However, because primates have opposable thumbs and interact with objects in similar ways, the question remains as to whether this similarity represents the evolution of a common cognitive process or whether it reflects a similarity of physical interaction. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in dogs to test whether the type of interaction affects object processing in an animal that interacts primarily with its mouth. In Study 1, we identified object‐processing regions of cortex by having dogs passively view movies of faces and objects. In Study 2, dogs were trained to interact with two new objects with either the mouth or the paw. Then, we measured responsivity in the object regions to the presentation of these objects. Mouth‐objects elicited significantly greater activity in object regions than paw‐objects. Mouth‐objects were also associated with activity in somatosensory cortex, suggesting dogs were anticipating mouthing interactions. These findings suggest that object perception in dogs is affected by how dogs expect to interact with familiar objects.

We labeled markers of cell division (PCNA), cell migration (DCX), and neuronal maturation (NeuN) in vocal control brain regions of male and female zebra finch brains at four different stages of song learning. Sex differences in the size of these regions emerged by the onset of song learning, and the rate of neurogenic processes varied across brain regions in a sex‐ and region‐specific manner.







Abstract
The brain regions that control the learning and production of song and other learned vocalizations in songbirds exhibit some of the largest sex differences in the brain known in vertebrates and are associated with sex differences in singing behavior. Song learning takes place through multiple stages: an early sensory phase when song models are memorized, followed by a sensorimotor phase in which auditory feedback is used to modify song output through subsong, plastic song, to adult crystalized song. However, how patterns of neurogenesis in these brain regions change through these learning stages, and differ between the sexes, is little explored. We collected brains from 63 young male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) over four stages of song learning. Using neurogenesis markers for cell division (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), neuron migration (doublecortin), and mature neurons (neuron‐specific nuclear protein), we demonstrate that there are sex‐specific changes in neurogenesis over song development that differ between the caudal motor pathway and anterior forebrain pathway of the vocal control circuit. In many of these regions, sex differences emerged very early in development, by 25 days post hatch, at the beginning of song learning. The emergence of sex differences in other components of the system was more gradual and had specific trajectories depending on the brain region and its function. In conclusion, we found that sex differences occurred early and continued during song learning. Moreover, transitions from the different phases of song development do not seem to depend on large changes in neurogenesis in the vocal control areas measured.

By means of serial block‐face electron microscopy, Wang et al. revealed subcellular structural bases for row‐specific cytoarchitecture and innervation pattern in mouse cochlear amplifier.







Abstract
In mammalian cochlea, sound‐induced vibration is amplified by a three‐row lattice of Y‐shaped microstructures consisting of electromotile outer hair cell and supporting Deiters cell. This highly organized structure is thought to be essential for hearing of low‐level sounds. Prior studies reported differences in geometry and synaptic innervation of the outer hair cells between rows, but how these fine features are achieved at subcellular level still remains unclear. Using serial block‐face electron microscopy, we acquired few‐hundred‐micron‐sized cytoarchitecture of mouse organ of Corti at nanometer resolution. Structural quantifications were performed on the Y‐shapes as well as afferent and efferent projections to outer hair cells (OHCs). Several new features, which support the previously observed inter‐row heterogeneity, are described. Our result provides structural bases for the gradient of mechanical properties and diverse centrifugal regulation of OHC rows.

Abstract
The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is composed of glutamatergic neurons at the midbrain–hindbrain junction. These neurons form many subpopulations, one of which expresses Calca, which encodes the neuropeptide calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP). This Calca‐expressing subpopulation has been implicated in a variety of homeostatic functions, but the overall distribution of Calca‐expressing neurons in this region remains unclear. Also, while previous studies in rats and mice have identified output projections from CGRP‐immunoreactive or Calca‐expressing neurons, we lack a comprehensive understanding of their efferent projections. We began by identifying neurons with Calca mRNA and CGRP immunoreactivity in and around the PB, including populations in the locus coeruleus and motor trigeminal nucleus. Calca‐expressing neurons in the PB prominently express the mu opioid receptor (Oprm1) and are distinct from neighboring neurons that express Foxp2 and Pdyn. Next, we used Cre‐dependent anterograde tracing with synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of these neurons. Calca‐expressing PB neurons heavily target subregions of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, basal forebrain, thalamic intralaminar and ventral posterior parvicellular nuclei, and hindbrain, in different patterns depending on the injection site location within the PB region. Retrograde axonal tracing revealed that the previously unreported hindbrain projections arise from a rostral‐ventral subset of CGRP/Calca neurons. Finally, we show that these efferent projections of Calca‐expressing neurons are distinct from those of neighboring PB neurons that express Pdyn.

In normal rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) overlap with callosal patches in V1. ODCs (a) and callosal patches (c) are present by postnatal day 10 (P10). In rats monocularly enucleated (ME) at P10 and perfused before the onset of the critical period (~P20), ODCs desegregate in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye (b), whereas callosal patches do not desegregate in this hemisphere (d).







Abstract
In Long Evans rats, ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in V1 overlap with patches of callosal connections. Using anatomical tracers, we found that ODCs and callosal patches are present at postnatal day 10 (P10), several days before eye opening, and about 10 days before the activation of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (~P20). In rats monocularly enucleated at P10 and perfused ~P20, ODCs ipsilateral to the remaining eye desegregated, indicating that rat ODCs are highly susceptible to monocular enucleation during a precritical period. Monocular enucleation during the critical period exerted significant, although smaller, effects. Monocular eye lid suture during the critical period led to a significant expansion of the ipsilateral projection from the nondeprived eye, whereas the contralateral projection invaded into, and intermixed with, ipsilateral ODCs innervated by the deprived eye. We propose that this intermixing allows callosal connections to contribute to the effects of monocular deprivation assessed in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the nondeprived eye. The ipsilateral and contralateral projections from the deprived eye did not undergo significant shrinkage. In contrast, we found that callosal patches are less susceptible to imbalance of eye input. In rats monocularly enucleated during either the precritical or critical periods, callosal patches were maintained in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the remaining eye, but desegregated in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the enucleated orbit. Callosal patches were maintained in rats binocularly enucleated at P10 or later. Similarly, monocular deprivation during the critical period had no significant effect on callosal patches in either hemisphere.

Custom made antibodies against four putative neuropeptides where used on whole mounts of the box jellyfish, Tripedalia cystophora, and revealed new details of the neuroanatomy in both the rhopalium and in the bell. These neuropeptides are most likely neurotransmitters in most stained neurons but might also be involved in neuronal development.







Abstract
Box jellyfish have an elaborate visual system and perform advanced visually guided behaviors. However, the rhopalial nervous system (RNS), believed to be the main visual processing center, only has 1000 neurons in each of the four eye carrying rhopalia. We have examined the detailed structure of the RNS of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora, using immunolabeling with antibodies raised against four putative neuropeptides (T. cystophora RFamide, VWamide, RAamide, and FRamide). In the RNS, T. cystophora RF‐, VW‐, and RAamide antibodies stain sensory neurons, the pit eyes, the neuropil, and peptide‐specific subpopulations of stalk‐associated neurons and giant neurons. Furthermore, RFamide ir+ neurites are seen in the epidermal stalk nerve, whereas VWamide antibodies stain the gastrodermal stalk nerve. RFamide has the most widespread expression including in the ring and radial nerves, the pedalium nerve plexus, and the tentacular nerve net. RAamide is the putative neurotransmitter in the motor neurons of the subumbrellar nerve net, and VWamide is a potential marker for neuronal differentiation as it is found in subpopulations of undifferentiated cells both in the rhopalia and in the bell. The results from the FRamide antibodies were not included as only few cells were stained, and in an unreproducible way. Our studies show hitherto‐unseen details of the nervous system of T. cystophora and allowed us to identify specific functional groups of neurons. This identification is important for understanding visual processing in the RNS and enables experimental work, directly addressing the role of the different neuropeptides in vision.

The blink reflex is critical for protecting the eyes and spreading the tear film, and is a commonly used for learning model. We demonstrate monosynaptic trigeminal (shown here) and disynaptic reticular formation pathways connecting the principal and the spinal trigeminal nucleus (pars caudalis) with orbicularis oculi motoneurons in the macaque monkey.







Abstract
The trigeminal blink reflex plays an important role in protecting the corneal surface from damage and preserving visual function in an unpredictable environment. The closing phase of the human reflex, produced by activation of the orbicularis oculi (ObOc) muscles, consists of an initial, small, ipsilateral R1 component, followed by a larger, bilateral R2 component. We investigated the circuitry that underlies this reflex in macaque (Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta) monkeys by the use of single and dual tracer methods. Injection of retrograde tracer into the facial nucleus labeled neurons in the principal trigeminal nucleus, and in the spinal nucleus pars oralis and interpolaris, bilaterally, and in pars caudalis, ipsilaterally. Injection of anterograde tracer into the principal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ObOc motoneurons, with an ipsilateral predominance. Injection of anterograde tracer into pars caudalis of the spinal trigeminal nucleus labeled axons that directly terminated on ipsilateral ObOc motoneurons. The observed pattern of labeling indicates that the reticular formation ventromedial to the principal and spinal nuclei also contributes extensive bilateral input to ObOc motoneurons. Thus, much of the trigeminal sensory complex is in a position to supply a monosynaptic drive for lid closure, and the adjacent reticular formation can supply a disynaptic drive. These findings indicate that the assignment of the R1 and R2 components of the blink reflex to different parts of the trigeminal sensory complex cannot be exclusively based on subdivision connectional relationships with facial motoneurons. The characteristics of the R2 component may be due, instead, to other circuit properties.

At the peak of the critical period, immersion into complete darkness for 10 days significantly reduces the number of perineuronal nets (PNN) in the primary visual cortex of cats but does not alter the number of parvalbumin (PV) cells that they usually surround. Darkness also reduces the size of PV cells even if they are surrounded by a PNN, indicating that PNNs do not inhibit all forms of neural plasticity.







Abstract
During development, the visual system maintains a high capacity for modification by expressing characteristics permissive for plasticity, enabling neural circuits to be refined by visual experience to achieve their mature form. This period is followed by the emergence of characteristics that stabilize the brain to consolidate for lifetime connections that were informed by experience. Attenuation of plasticity potential is thought to derive from an accumulation of plasticity‐inhibiting characteristics that appear at ages beyond the peak of plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are molecular aggregations that primarily surround fast‐spiking inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin (PV) cells, which exhibit properties congruent with a plasticity inhibitor. In this study, we examined the development of PNNs and PV cells in the primary visual cortex of a highly visual mammal, and assessed the impact that 10 days of darkness had on both characteristics. Here, we show that labeling for PV expression emerges earlier and reaches adult levels sooner than PNNs. We also demonstrate that darkness, a condition known to enhance plasticity, significantly reduces the density of PNNs and the size of PV cell somata but does not alter the number of PV cells in the visual cortex. The darkness‐induced reduction of PV cell size occurred irrespective of whether neurons were surrounded by a PNN, suggesting that PNNs have a restricted capacity to inhibit plasticity. Finally, we show that PV cells surrounded by a PNN were significantly larger than those without one, supporting the view that PNNs may mediate trophic support to the cells they surround.

Behavioral tests assaying digging can be difficult to interpret. We present a novel paradigm combining burrowing and free digging that can be used to explore digging motivation and sex‐specific deficits.
​

Abstract
Digging behavior is often used to test motor function and repetitive behaviors in mice. Different digging paradigms have been developed for behaviors related to anxiety and compulsion in mouse lines generated to recapitulate genetic mutations leading to psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, the interpretation of these tests has been confounded by the difficulty of determining the motivation behind digging in mice. Digging is a naturalistic mouse behavior that can be focused toward different goals, that is foraging for food, burrowing for shelter, burying objects, or even for recreation as has been shown for dogs, ferrets, and human children. However, the interpretation of results from current testing protocols assumes the motivation behind the behavior often concluding that increased digging is a repetitive or compulsive behavior. We asked whether providing a choice between different types of digging activities would increase sensitivity to assess digging motivation. Here, we present a test to distinguish between burrowing and exploratory digging in mice. We found that mice prefer burrowing when the option is available. When food restriction was used to promote a switch from burrowing to exploration, males readily switched from burrowing to digging outside, while females did not. In addition, when we tested a model of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder that had shown inconsistent results in the marble burying test, the Cc2d1a conditional knockout mouse, we found greatly reduced burrowing only in males. Our findings indicate that digging is a nuanced motivated behavior and suggest that male and female rodents may perform it differently.

Objective
Protein misfolding plays a central role not only in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but also in other conditions, such as frontemporal dementia (FTD), inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) or Paget's disease of bone. The concept of multisystem proteinopathies (MSP) was created to account for those rare families that segregate at least 2 out of these 4 conditions in the same pedigree. The calcium‐dependent phospholipid‐binding protein annexin A11 was recently associated to ALS in European pedigrees. Herein, we describe in detail 3 Brazilian families presenting hIBM (isolated or in combination with ALS/FTD) caused by the novel p.D40Y change in the gene encoding annexin A11 (ANXA11).


Methods
We collected clinical, genetic, pathological and skeletal muscle imaging from 11 affected subjects. Neuroimaging was also obtained from 8 patients and 8 matched controls.


Results
Clinico‐radiological phenotype of this novel hIBM reveals a slowly progressive predominant limb‐girdle syndrome, but with frequent axial (ptosis/dropped head) and distal (medial gastrocnemius) involvement as well. Muscle pathology identified numerous rimmed vacuoles with positive annexin A11, TDP‐43 and p62 inclusions, but no inflammation. Central nervous system was also involved: two patients had FTD, but diffusion tensor imaging uncovered multiple areas of cerebral white matter damage in the whole group (including the corticospinal tracts and frontal subcortical regions).


Interpretation
These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum related to ANXA11. This gene should be considered the cause of a novel multisystem proteinopathy (MSP type 6), rather than just ALS.

Relying on duplex in situ hybridization, targeting PPGAL (pre‐pro‐galanin) and SLC17A6 mRNAs, neurons of the human retrotrapezoid nucleus were identified within the parafacial region of the brainstem. NeuromedinB (NMB), suggested as being a specific marker of RTN neurons in mice by others, was not convincing in our anatomical study, but could benefit from more thorough investigations.







Abstract
The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a hub for respiratory chemoregulation in the mammal brainstem that integrates chemosensory information from peripheral sites and central relays. Chemosensitive neurons of the RTN express specific genetic and molecular determinants, which have been used to identify RTN precise location within the brainstem of rodents and nonhuman primates. Based on a comparative approach, we hypothesized that among mammals, neurons exhibiting the same specific molecular and genetic signature would have the same function. The co‐expression of preprogalanin (PPGAL) and SLC17A6 (VGluT2) mRNAs with duplex in situ hybridization has been studied in formalin fixed paraffin‐embedded postmortem human brainstems. Two specimens were processed and analyzed in line with RTN descriptions in adult rats and macaques. Double‐labeled PPGAL+/SLC17A6+ neurons were only identified in the parafacial region of the brainstem. These neurons were found surrounding the nucleus of the facial nerve, located ventrally to the nucleus VII on caudal sections, and slightly more dorsally on rostral sections. The expression of neuromedin B (NMB) mRNA as a single marker of chemosensitive RTN neurons has not been confirmed in humans. The location of the RTN in human adults is provided. This should help to develop investigation tools combining anatomic high‐resolution imaging and respiratory functional investigations to explore the pathogenic role of the RTN in congenital or acquired neurodegenerative diseases.

Objective
The objective of this study was to characterize patients with extracranial giant cell arteritis with intracranial involvement.


Methods
In a multicenter retrospective study, we included 31 patients with systemic giant cell arteritis (GCA) with intracranial involvement. Clinical characteristics, pattern of arterial involvement, and cytokine profiles were assessed. Patients with GCA without intracranial involvement (n = 17), and with intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 25) served as controls.


Results
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 18 patients (69.2%) with and in 16 patients (100%) without intracranial involvement (p = 0.02). Headache was complained by 15 patients (50.0%) with and 13 patients (76.5%) without intracranial involvement (p = 0.03). Posterior circulation arteries were affected in 26 patients (83.9%), anterior circulation arteries in 17 patients (54.8%), and both territories in 12 patients (38.7%). Patients with GCA had vertebral artery stenosis proximal and, in contrast, patients with atherosclerosis distal to the origin of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Among patients with GCA with intracranial involvement, 11 patients (37.9%) had a rapid progressive disease course characterized by short‐term recurrent ischemic events. The median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at follow‐up in these patients was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2.0–6.0) and 4 patients (36.4%) died. Vessel wall expression of IL‐6 and IL‐17 was significantly increased in patients with rapid progressive course.


Interpretation
Typical characteristics of GCA, headache, and an elevated ESR, are frequently absent in patients with intracranial involvement. However, differentiation of intracranial GCA from atherosclerosis can be facilitated by the typical pattern of vertebral artery stenosis. About one‐third of patients with intracranial GCA had a rapid progressive course with poor outcome. IL‐17 and IL‐6 may represent potential future treatment targets. ANN NEUROL 2021

Understanding the function of the nervous system necessitates mapping the spatial distributions of its constituent cells defined by function, anatomy or gene expression. Recently, developments in tissue preparation and microscopy allow cellular populations to be imaged throughout the entire rodent brain. However, mapping these neurons manually is prone to bias and is often impractically time consuming. Here we present an open-source algorithm for fully automated 3D detection of neuronal somata in mouse whole-brain microscopy images using standard desktop computer hardware. We demonstrate the applicability and power of our approach by mapping the brain-wide locations of large populations of cells labeled with cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins expressed via retrograde trans-synaptic viral infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MAScjJ0lnL4" width="1" />

RNA tertiary structure is crucial to its many non-coding molecular functions. RNA architecture is shaped by its secondary structure composed of stems, stacked canonical base pairs, enclosing loops. While stems are precisely captured by free-energy models, loops composed of non-canonical base pairs are not. Nor are distant interactions linking together those secondary structure elements (SSEs). Databases of conserved 3D geometries (a.k.a. modules) not captured by energetic models are leveraged for structure prediction and design, but the computational complexity has limited their study to local elements, loops. Representing the RNA structure as a graph has recently allowed to expend this work to pairs of SSEs, uncovering a hierarchical organization of these 3D modules, at great computational cost. Systematically capturing recurrent patterns on a large scale is a main challenge in the study of RNA structures. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to compute maximal isomorphisms in edge colored graphs. We extend this algorithm to a framework well suited to identify RNA modules, and fast enough to considerably generalize previous approaches. To exhibit the versatility of our framework, we first reproduce results identifying all common modules spanning more than 2 SSEs, in a few hours instead of weeks. The efficiency of our new algorithm is demonstrated by computing the maximal modules between any pair of entire RNA in the non-redundant corpus of known RNA 3D structures. We observe that the biggest modules our method uncovers compose large shared sub-structure spanning hundreds of nucleotides and base pairs between the ribosomes of <i>Thermus thermophilus</i>, <i>Escherichia Coli</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IT8KKikwB4Q" width="1" />

Modification of the <i>Per2</i> clock gene in <i>mPer2</i><sup>Luc</sup> reporter mice significantly alters circadian function. Behavioral period in constant dark is lengthened, and dissociates into two distinct components in constant light. Rhythms exhibit increased bimodality, enhanced phase resetting to light pulses, and altered entrainment to scheduled feeding. Mechanistic mathematical modelling predicts that enhanced protein interactions with the modified mPER2 C-terminus, combined with differential clock regulation among SCN subregions, can account for effects on circadian behavior via increased <i>Per2</i> transcript and protein stability. PER2::LUC produces greater suppression of CLOCK:BMAL1 E-box activity than PER2. <i>mPer2</i><sup>Luc</sup> carries a 72 bp deletion in exon 23 of <i>Per2</i>, and retains a neomycin resistance cassette that affects rhythm amplitude but not period. The results show that <i>mPer2</i><sup>Luc</sup> acts as a circadian clock mutation illustrating a need for detailed assessment of potential impacts of c-terminal tags in genetically modified animal models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JtO_M4W_2tE" width="1" />

Abstract
Human brain injury elicits accumulation of water within the brain due to a variety of pathophysiological processes. As our understanding of edema emerged two temporally (and cellular) distinct processes were identified, cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. The emergence of both types of edema is reflected by the temporal evolution and is influenced by the underlying pathology (type and extent). However, this two‐edema compartment model does not adequately describe the transition between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Hence, a third category has been proposed, termed ionic edema, that is observed in the transition between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Magnetic resonance neuroimaging of edema today primarily utilizes T2‐weighted (T2WI) and diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI). Clinical diagnostics and translational science studies have clearly demonstrated the temporal ability of both T2WI and DWI to monitor edema content and evolution. DWI measures water mobility within the brain reflecting cytotoxic edema. T2WI at later time points when vasogenic edema develops visualizes increased water content in the brain. Clinically relevant imaging modalities, including ultrasound and positron emission tomography, are not typically used to assess edema. In sum, edema imaging is an important cornerstone of clinical diagnostics and translational studies and can guide effective therapeutics manage edema and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract
Regulation of neuronal activity is a necessity for communication and information transmission. Many regulatory processes which have been studied provide a complex picture of how neurons can respond to permanently changing functional requirements. One such activity‐dependent mechanism involves signaling mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Within the brain, NO is generated in response to neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) activation but NO‐dependent pathways regulating neuronal excitability in the hippocampus remain to be fully elucidated. This study was set out to systematically assess the effects of NO on ion channel activities and intrinsic excitabilities of pyramidal neurons within the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. We characterized whole‐cell potassium and sodium currents, both involved in action potential (AP) shaping and propagation and determined NO‐mediated changes in excitabilities and AP waveforms. Our data describe a novel signaling by which NO, in a cGMP‐independent manner, suppresses voltage‐gated Kv2 potassium and voltage‐gated sodium channel activities, thereby widening AP waveforms and reducing depolarization‐induced AP firing rates. Our data show that glutathione, which possesses denitrosylating activity, is sufficient to prevent the observed nitrergic effects on potassium and sodium channels, whereas inhibition of cGMP signaling is also sufficient to abolish NO modulation of sodium currents. We propose that NO suppresses both ion channel activities via redox signaling and that an additional cGMP‐mediated component is required to exert effects on sodium currents. Both mechanisms result in a dampened excitability and firing ability providing new data on nitrergic activities in the context of activity‐dependent regulation of neuronal function following nNOS activation.

Twenty‐four participants were classified as stable or decliners according to their 4‐year working memory (WM) trajectories following a retrospective longitudinal approach. Then, we studied longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) differences between groups (stable and decliners) and across two multifocal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) montages (fitting “compensatory” and “maintenance” fMRI patterns related to high WM performance) applied inside the scan using a single‐blind sham‐controlled cross‐over design. Among the decliner group, the “compensatory”‐tDCS montage reduced the activity over the posterior regions where these subjects showed longitudinal hyperactivation.

Abstract
The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide original data to investigate age‐related brain changes. We examined neural activity modulations induced by two multifocal tDCS procedures based on two distinct montages fitting two N‐back task‐based fMRI patterns (“compensatory” and “maintenance”) related to high working memory (WM) in a previous publication (Fernández‐Cabello et al. Neurobiol Aging (2016);48:23–33). We included 24 participants classified as stable or decliners according to their 4‐year WM trajectories following a retrospective longitudinal approach. Then, we studied longitudinal fMRI differences between groups (stable and decliners) and across multifocal tDCS montages (“compensatory” and “maintenance”) applied using a single‐blind sham‐controlled cross‐over design. Decliners evidenced over‐activation of non‐related WM areas after 4 years of follow‐up. Focusing on tDCS effects, among the decliner group, the “compensatory”‐tDCS montage reduced the activity over the posterior regions where these subjects showed longitudinal hyperactivation. These results reinforce the notion that tDCS effects are characterized by an activity reduction and might be more noticeable in compromised systems. Importantly, the data provide novel evidence that cognitive trajectories predict tDCS effects in older adults.

In healthy mitochondria, cleaved PINK1 retro‐translocates to the cytosol, where it phosphorylates and activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA activation results in the PKA‐mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB), which subsequently relocates to the nucleus to promote the transcription of genes in CRE‐localized domains. Brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the targets of CREB‐mediated transcription. BDNF gets transcribed, translated, post‐translationally cleaved, and released into the extracellular space, where it binds to the TRKβ receptor and triggers the synaptic delivery of PSD95.

Abstract
Mutations in PTEN‐induced kinase 1 (PINK1) lead to early onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease in humans. In healthy neurons, full‐length PINK1 (fPINK1) is post‐translationally cleaved into different lower molecular weight forms, and cleaved PINK1 (cPINK1) gets shuttled to the cytosolic compartments to support extra‐mitochondrial functions. While numerous studies have exemplified the role of mitochondrially localized PINK1 in modulating mitophagy in oxidatively stressed neurons, little is known regarding the physiological role of cPINK1 in healthy neurons. We have previously shown that cPINK1, but not fPINK1, modulates the neurite outgrowth and the maintenance of dendritic arbors by activating downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in healthy neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cPINK1 promotes neurite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. In this report, we show that cPINK1 supports neuronal development by modulating the expression and extracellular release of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consistent with this role, we observed a progressive increase in the level of endogenous cPINK1 but not fPINK1 during prenatal and postnatal development of mouse brains and during development in primary cortical neurons. In cultured primary neurons, the pharmacological activation of endogenous PINK1 leads to enhanced downstream PKA activity, subsequent activation of the PKA‐modulated transcription factor cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREB), increased intracellular production and extracellular release of BDNF, and enhanced activation of the BDNF receptor‐TRKβ. Mechanistically, cPINK1‐mediated increased dendrite complexity requires the binding of extracellular BDNF to TRKβ. In summary, our data support a physiological role of cPINK1 in stimulating neuronal development by activating the PKA‐CREB‐BDNF signaling axis in a feedforward loop.

<p>Cross-modal effects provide a model framework for investigating hierarchical inter-areal processing, particularly, under conditions where unimodal cortical areas receive contextual feedback from other modalities. Here, using complementary behavioral and brain imaging techniques, we investigated the functional networks participating in face and voice processing during gender perception, a high-level feature of voice and face perception. Within the framework of a signal detection decision model, Maximum likelihood conjoint measurement (MLCM) was used to estimate the contributions of the face and voice to gender comparisons between pairs of audio-visual stimuli in which the face and voice were independently modulated. Top–down contributions were varied by instructing participants to make judgments based on the gender of either the face, the voice or both modalities (N = 12 for each task). Estimated face and voice contributions to the judgments of the stimulus pairs were not independent; both contributed to all tasks, but their respective weights varied over a 40-fold range due to top–down influences. Models that best described the modal contributions required the inclusion of two different top–down interactions: (i) an interaction that depended on gender congruence across modalities (i.e., difference between face and voice modalities for each stimulus); (ii) an interaction that depended on the within modalities’ gender magnitude. The significance of these interactions was task dependent. Specifically, gender congruence interaction was significant for the face and voice tasks while the gender magnitude interaction was significant for the face and stimulus tasks. Subsequently, we used the same stimuli and related tasks in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm (N = 12) to explore the neural correlates of these perceptual processes, analyzed with Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) and Bayesian Model Selection. Results revealed changes in effective connectivity between the unimodal Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and Temporal Voice Area (TVA) in a fashion that paralleled the face and voice behavioral interactions observed in the psychophysical data. These findings explore the role in perception of multiple unimodal parallel feedback pathways.</p>

<p>In this work we propose a machine learning (ML) method to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia using electroencephalograms (EEGs) as input data. The computational algorithm not only yields a proposal of diagnostic but, even more importantly, it provides additional information that admits clinical interpretation. It is based on an ML model called random forest that operates on connectivity metrics extracted from the EEG signals. Specifically, we use measures of generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC) and direct directed transfer function (dDTF) to construct the input features to the ML model. The latter allows the identification of the most performance-wise relevant features which, in turn, provide some insights about EEG signals and frequency bands that are associated with schizophrenia. Our preliminary results on real data show that signals associated with the occipital region seem to play a significant role in the diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, although every frequency band might yield useful information for the diagnosis, the beta and theta (frequency) bands provide features that are ultimately more relevant for the ML classifier that we have implemented.</p>

<p>Adverse events and childhood trauma increase the susceptibility towards developing psychiatric disorders (substance use disorder, anxiety, depression, etc.) in adulthood. Although there are treatment strategies that have utility in combating these psychiatric disorders, little attention is placed on how to therapeutically intervene in children exposed to early life stress (ELS) to prevent the development of later psychopathology. The lateral habenula (LHb) has been a topic of extensive investigation in mental health disorders due to its prominent role in emotion and mood regulation through modulation of brain reward and motivational neural circuits. Importantly, rodent models of ELS have been shown to promote LHb dysfunction. Moreover, one of the potential mechanisms contributing to LHb neuronal and synaptic dysfunction involves endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, which has been observed to critically regulate emotion/mood and motivation. Many pre-clinical studies targeting eCB signaling suggest that this neuromodulatory system could be exploited as an intervention therapy to halt maladaptive processes that promote dysfunction in reward and motivational neural circuits involving the LHb. In this perspective article, we report what is currently known about the role of eCB signaling in LHb function and discuss our opinions on new research directions to determine whether the eCB system is a potentially attractive therapeutic intervention for the prevention and/or treatment of ELS-associated psychiatric illnesses.</p>

<p>As a significant public health issue, chronic pain, mainly neuropathic pain (NP) and inflammatory pain, has a severe impact. The underlying mechanisms of chronic pain are enigmatic at present. The roles of ubiquitin have been demonstrated in various physiological and pathological conditions and underscore its potential as therapeutic targets. The dysfunction of the component of the ubiquitin system that occurs during chronic pain is rapidly being discovered. These results provide insight into potential molecular mechanisms of chronic pain. Chronic pain is regulated by ubiquitination, SUMOylation, ubiquitin ligase, and deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), etc. Insight into the mechanism of the ubiquitin system regulating chronic pain might contribute to relevant therapeutic targets and the development of novel analgesics.</p>

<p>Cannabidiol, a compound of Cannabis sativa, has been proposed as an alternative treatment of schizophrenia. Preclinical and clinical data have suggested that cannabidiol shares more similarity with atypical antipsychotics than typical, both of which are customarily used to manage schizophrenia symptoms. While oligodendrocytes are known to be relevant targets of antipsychotics, the biochemical knowledge in this regard is still limited. Here we evaluated the molecular pathways modulated by cannabidiol compared to the antipsychotics clozapine (atypical) and haloperidol (typical), additionally evaluating the effects of benztropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist that displays a protective effect in oligodendrocytes and myelination. For this purpose, we employed nano-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate the proteomic response to these drugs both in healthy oligodendrocytic cells and in a cuprizone-based toxicity model, using the human oligodendrocyte precursor cell line MO3.13. Cannabidiol shares similarities of biochemical pathways with clozapine and benztropine, in agreement with other studies that indicated an atypical antipsychotic profile. All drugs tested affected metabolic and gene expression pathways and cannabidiol, benztropine, and clozapine modulated cell proliferation and apoptosis when administered after cuprizone-induced toxicity. These general pathways are associated with cuprizone-induced cytotoxicity in MO3.13 cells, indicating a possible proteomic approach when acting against the toxic effects of cuprizone. In conclusion, although modeling oligodendrocytic cytotoxicity with cuprizone does not represent the entirety of the pathophysiology of oligodendrocyte impairments, these results provide insight into the mechanisms associated with the effects of cannabidiol and antipsychotics against cuprizone toxicity, offering new directions of study for myelin-related processes and deficits.</p>

<p>Astrocytes play a crucial role in the maintenance of the normal functions of the Central Nervous System (CNS). During the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, astrocytes undergo morphological and functional remodeling, a process called reactive astrogliosis, in response to the insults to the CNS. One of the key aspects of the reactive astrocytes is the change in the expression and function of connexins. Connexins are channel proteins that highly expressed in astrocytes, forming gap junction channels and hemichannels, allowing diffusional trafficking of small molecules. Alterations of astrocytic connexin expression and function found in neurodegenerative diseases have been shown to affect the disease progression by changing neuronal function and survival. In this review, we will summarize the role of astroglial connexins in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Also, we will discuss why targeting connexins can be a plausible therapeutic strategy to manage these neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The specific role of peri-infarct microglia and the timing of its morphological changes following ischemic stroke are not well understood. Valproic acid (VPA) can protect against ischemic damage and promote recovery. In this study, we first determined whether a single dose of VPA after stroke could decrease infarction area or improve functional recovery. Next, we investigated the number and morphological characteristic of peri-infarct microglia at different time points and elucidated the mechanism of microglial response by VPA treatment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAo) for 90 min, followed by reperfusion. Some received a single injection of VPA (200 mg/kg) 90 min after the induction of ischemia, while vehicle-treated animals underwent the same procedure with physiological saline. Infarction volume was calculated at 48 h after reperfusion, and neurological symptoms were evaluated. VPA didn’t significantly reduce infarct volume but did ameliorate neurological deficit at least partially compared with vehicle. Meanwhile, VPA reduced dMCAo-induced elevation of IL-6 at 24 h post-stroke and significantly decreased the number of CD11b-positive microglia within peri-infarct cortex at 7 days. Morphological analysis revealed that VPA therapy leads to higher fractal dimensions, smaller soma size and lower circularity index of CD11b-positive cells within peri-infarct cortex at both 2 and 7 days, suggesting that VPA has core effects on microglial morphology. The modulation of microglia morphology caused by VPA might involve HDAC inhibition-mediated suppression of galectin-3 production. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of CD11b-positive cells at 3 days post-stroke suggested that VPA could partially enhance M2 subset polarization of microglia in peri-infarct cortex. Analysis of VPA-induced changes to gene expressions at 3 days post-stroke implies that these alternations of the biomarkers and microglial responses are implicated in the upregulation of wound healing, collagen trimmer, and extracellular matrix genes within peri-infarct cortex. Our results are the first to show that a low dose of VPA promotes short-term functional recovery but does not alter infarct volume. The decreases in the expression of both IL-6 and galectin-3 might influence the morphological characteristics and transcriptional profiles of microglia and extracellular matrix remodeling, which could contribute to the improved recovery.</p>

<p>Excessive inflammation leads to secondary immune damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The intestinal mucosa is a key component of immune tolerance due to gut-brain axis regulation, but the curative effect is not optimal. Intestinal dysfunction impairs the establishment of immune tolerance in patients with TBI. Therefore, we orally administered brain protein (BP) combined with probiotics to induce immune tolerance and explored the mechanism by which the homeostasis of the microbiota contributes to the enhancement of curative effects by BPs. Herein, we demonstrated that patients with TBI and surgical brain injury (SBI) models of rats had obvious dysbiosis. Notably, the intestinal barrier, proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of microglia demonstrated that excessive inflammatory damage was better controlled in the combined group (oral administration of BP combined with probiotics) than in the BP group (oral administration of BP). Fundamentally, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that BP and probiotics preferentially affect Try-related pathways. A series of experiments further confirmed that Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO)/Kynurenine (Kyn)/Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression was high in the BP group, while Tryptophan hydroxylase 1(TpH1)/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) only changed in the combined group. This study suggests that probiotics can enhance the efficacy of oral BP-induced immune tolerance through the Try pathway.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is an effective technology for automatic brain tumor MRI image recognition. The training of an AI model requires a large number of labeled data, but medical data needs to be labeled by professional clinicians, which makes data collection complex and expensive. Moreover, a traditional AI model requires that the training data and test data must follow the independent and identically distributed. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer model based on supervised multi-layer dictionary learning (TSMDL) for brain tumor MRI image recognition in this paper. With the help of the knowledge learned from related domains, the goal of this model is to solve the task of transfer learning where the target domain has only a small number of labeled samples. Based on the framework of multi-layer dictionary learning, the proposed model learns the common shared dictionary of source and target domains in each layer to explore the intrinsic connections and shared information between different domains. At the same time, by making full use of the label information of samples, the Laplacian regularization term is introduced to make the dictionary coding of similar samples as close as possible and the dictionary coding of different class samples as different as possible. The recognition experiments on brain MRI image datasets REMBRANDT and Figshare show that the model performs better than competitive state of-the-art methods.</p>

<p>Brain tumor image classification is an important part of medical image processing. It assists doctors to make accurate diagnosis and treatment plans. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is one of the main imaging tools to study brain tissue. In this article, we propose a brain tumor MR image classification method using convolutional dictionary learning with local constraint (CDLLC). Our method integrates the multi-layer dictionary learning into a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure to explore the discriminative information. Encoding a vector on a dictionary can be considered as multiple projections into new spaces, and the obtained coding vector is sparse. Meanwhile, in order to preserve the geometric structure of data and utilize the supervised information, we construct the local constraint of atoms through a supervised k-nearest neighbor graph, so that the discrimination of the obtained dictionary is strong. To solve the proposed problem, an efficient iterative optimization scheme is designed. In the experiment, two clinically relevant multi-class classification tasks on the Cheng and REMBRANDT datasets are designed. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method is effective for brain tumor MR image classification, and it could outperform other comparisons.</p>

<p>Predicting brain age has become one of the most attractive challenges in computational neuroscience due to the role of the predicted age as an effective biomarker for different brain diseases and conditions. A great variety of machine learning (ML) approaches and deep learning (DL) techniques have been proposed to predict age from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. If on one hand, DL models could improve performance and reduce model bias compared to other less complex ML methods, on the other hand, they are typically black boxes as do not provide an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods have been recently introduced to provide interpretable decisions of ML and DL algorithms both at local and global level. In this work, we present an explainable DL framework to predict the age of a healthy cohort of subjects from ABIDE I database by using the morphological features extracted from their MRI scans. We embed the two local XAI methods SHAP and LIME to explain the outcomes of the DL models, determine the contribution of each brain morphological descriptor to the final predicted age of each subject and investigate the reliability of the two methods. Our findings indicate that the SHAP method can provide more reliable explanations for the morphological aging mechanisms and be exploited to identify personalized age-related imaging biomarker.</p>

<p>Machine Learning methods are often adopted to infer useful biomarkers for the early diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases and, in general, of neuroanatomical ageing. Some of these methods estimate the subject age from morphological brain data, which is then indicated as “brain age”. The difference between such a predicted brain age and the actual chronological age of a subject can be used as an indication of a pathological deviation from normal brain ageing. An important use of the brain age model as biomarker is the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Many different machine learning approaches have been applied to this specific predictive task, some of which have achieved high accuracy at the expense of the descriptiveness of the model. This work investigates an appropriate combination of data science techniques and linear models to provide, at the same time, high accuracy and good descriptiveness. The proposed method is based on a data workflow that include typical data science methods, such as outliers detection, feature selection, linear regression, and logistic regression. In particular, a novel inductive bias is introduced in the regression model, which is aimed at improving the accuracy and the specificity of the classification task. The method is compared to other machine learning approaches for AD classification based on morphological brain data with and without the use of the brain age, including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks. This study adopts brain MRI scans of 1, 901 subjects which have been acquired from three repositories (ADNI, AIBL, and IXI). A predictive model based only on the proposed apparent brain age and the chronological age has an accuracy of 88% and 92%, respectively, for male and female subjects, in a repeated cross-validation analysis, thus achieving a comparable or superior performance than state of the art machine learning methods. The advantage of the proposed method is that it maintains the morphological semantics of the input space throughout the regression and classification tasks. The accurate predictive model is also highly descriptive and can be used to generate potentially useful insights on the predictions.</p>

<p>Brain activity is composed of oscillatory and broadband arrhythmic components; however, there is more focus on oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms to study movement, but temporal dynamics of broadband arrhythmic electroencephalography (EEG) remain unexplored. We have previously demonstrated that broadband arrhythmic EEG contains both short- and long-range temporal correlations that change significantly during movement. In this study, we build upon our previous work to gain a deeper understanding of these changes in the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in broadband EEG and contrast them with the well-known LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude typically found in the literature. We investigate and validate changes in LRTCs during five different types of movements and motor imagery tasks using two independent EEG datasets recorded with two different paradigms—our finger tapping dataset with single self-initiated asynchronous finger taps and publicly available EEG dataset containing cued continuous movement and motor imagery of fists and feet. We quantified instantaneous changes in broadband LRTCs by detrended fluctuation analysis on single trial 2 s EEG sliding windows. The broadband LRTC increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) during all motor tasks as compared to the resting state. In contrast, the alpha oscillation LRTC, which had to be computed on longer stitched EEG segments, decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) consistently with the literature. This suggests the complementarity of underlying fast and slow neuronal scale-free dynamics during movement and motor imagery. The single trial broadband LRTC gave high average binary classification accuracy in the range of 70.54±10.03% to 76.07±6.40% for all motor execution and imagery tasks and hence can be used in brain–computer interface (BCI). Thus, we demonstrate generalizability, robustness, and reproducibility of novel motor neural correlate, the single trial broadband LRTC, during different motor execution and imagery tasks in single asynchronous and cued continuous motor-BCI paradigms and its contrasting behavior with LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude.</p>

<p>Neurofeedback training (NFT) is a non-invasive, safe, and effective method of regulating the nerve state of the brain. Presently, NFT is widely used to prevent and rehabilitate brain diseases and improve an individual’s external performance. Among the various NFT methods, NFT to improve sport performance (SP-NFT) has become an important research and application focus worldwide. Several studies have shown that the method is effective in improving brain function and motor control performance. However, appropriate reviews and prospective directions for this technology are lacking. This paper proposes an SP-NFT classification method based on user experience, classifies and discusses various SP-NFT research schemes reported in the existing literature, and reviews the technical principles, application scenarios, and usage characteristics of different SP-NFT schemes. Several key issues in SP-NFT development, including the factors involved in neural mechanisms, scheme selection, learning basis, and experimental implementation, are discussed. Finally, directions for the future development of SP-NFT, including SP-NFT based on other electroencephalograph characteristics, SP-NFT integrated with other technologies, and SP-NFT commercialization, are suggested. These discussions are expected to provide some valuable ideas to researchers in related fields.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke is one of the main central nervous system diseases and is associated with high disability and mortality rates. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and mechanical thrombectomy are the optimal therapies available currently to restore blood flow in patients with stroke; however, their limitations are well recognized. Therefore, new treatments are urgently required to overcome these shortcomings. Recently, stem cell transplantation technology, involving the transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), has drawn the interest of neuroscientists and is considered to be a promising alternative for ischemic stroke treatment. iPSCs are a class of cells produced by introducing specific transcription factors into somatic cells, and are similar to embryonic stem cells in biological function. Here, we have reviewed the current applications of stem cells with a focus on iPSC therapy in ischemic stroke, including the neuroprotective mechanisms, development constraints, major challenges to overcome, and clinical prospects. Based on the current state of research, we believe that stem cells, especially iPSCs, will pave the way for future stroke treatment.</p>

<p>Glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease that leads to irreversible vision loss, is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic axons. To date, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) has been recognized as the main phenotypic factor associated with glaucoma. However, some patients with normal IOP also have glaucomatous visual impairment and RGC loss. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms behind such cases remain unclear. Recent studies have suggested that retinal glia play significant roles in the initiation and progression of glaucoma. Multiple types of glial cells are activated in glaucoma. Microglia, for example, act as critical mediators that orchestrate the progression of neuroinflammation through pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, macroglia (astrocytes and Müller cells) participate in retinal inflammatory responses as modulators and contribute to neuroprotection through the secretion of neurotrophic factors. Notably, research results have indicated that intricate interactions between microglia and macroglia might provide potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of glaucoma. In this review, we examine the specific roles of microglia and macroglia in open-angle glaucoma, including glaucoma in animal models, and analyze the interaction between these two cell types. In addition, we discuss potential treatment options based on the relationship between glial cells and neurons.</p>

<p>Childhood medulloblastoma (MB) is a threatening malignant tumor affecting children all over the globe. It is believed to be the foremost common pediatric brain tumor causing death. Early and accurate classification of childhood MB and its classes are of great importance to help doctors choose the suitable treatment and observation plan, avoid tumor progression, and lower death rates. The current gold standard for diagnosing MB is the histopathology of biopsy samples. However, manual analysis of such images is complicated, costly, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the expertise and skills of pathologists, which might cause inaccurate results. This study aims to introduce a reliable computer-assisted pipeline called CoMB-Deep to automatically classify MB and its classes with high accuracy from histopathological images. This key challenge of the study is the lack of childhood MB datasets, especially its four categories (defined by the WHO) and the inadequate related studies. All relevant works were based on either deep learning (DL) or textural analysis feature extractions. Also, such studies employed distinct features to accomplish the classification procedure. Besides, most of them only extracted spatial features. Nevertheless, CoMB-Deep blends the advantages of textural analysis feature extraction techniques and DL approaches. The CoMB-Deep consists of a composite of DL techniques. Initially, it extracts deep spatial features from 10 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then performs a feature fusion step using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), a texture analysis method capable of reducing the dimension of fused features. Next, the CoMB-Deep explores the best combination of fused features, enhancing the performance of the classification process using two search strategies. Afterward, it employs two feature selection techniques on the fused feature sets selected in the previous step. A bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network; a DL-based approach that is utilized for the classification phase. CoMB-Deep maintains two classification categories: binary category for distinguishing between the abnormal and normal cases and multi-class category to identify the subclasses of MB. The results of the CoMB-Deep for both classification categories prove that it is reliable. The results also indicate that the feature sets selected using both search strategies have enhanced the performance of Bi-LSTM compared to individual spatial deep features. CoMB-Deep is compared to related studies to verify its competitiveness, and this comparison confirmed its robustness and outperformance. Hence, CoMB-Deep can help pathologists perform accurate diagnoses, reduce misdiagnosis risks that could occur with manual diagnosis, accelerate the classification procedure, and decrease diagnosis costs.</p>

<p>The corticostriatal circuit has been identified as a vital pathway for associative learning. However, how learning is implemented when the sensory striatum is permanently impaired remains unclear. Using chemogenetic techniques to suppress layer five auditory cortex (AC) input to the auditory striatum, learning of a sound discrimination task was significantly impacted in freely moving Mongolian gerbils, in particular when this suppression occurs early on during learning. Whole-cell recordings sampled throughout learning revealed a transient reduction in postsynaptic (GABAA) inhibition in both striatal D1 and D2 cells in normal-hearing gerbils during task acquisition. In contrast, when the baseline striatal inhibitory strengths and firing rates were permanently reduced by a transient period of developmental sensory deprivation, learning was accompanied by augmented inhibition and increased firing rates. Direct manipulation of striatal inhibition in vivo and in vitro revealed a key role of the transient inhibitory changes in task acquisition. Together, these results reveal a flexible corticostriatal inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that accompanies associative auditory learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.688905">Chemogenetic Activation of Feed-Forward Inhibitory Parvalbumin-Expressing Interneurons in the Cortico-Thalamocortical Network During Absence Seizures</a></h4>

<p>Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons are a subset of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that mediate feed-forward inhibition (FFI) within the cortico-thalamocortical (CTC) network of the brain. The CTC network is a reciprocal loop with connections between cortex and thalamus. FFI PV+ interneurons control the firing of principal excitatory neurons within the CTC network and prevent runaway excitation. Studies have shown that generalized spike-wave discharges (SWDs), the hallmark of absence seizures on electroencephalogram (EEG), originate within the CTC network. In the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy, reduced FFI is believed to contribute to absence seizure genesis as there is a specific loss of excitatory α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) at synaptic inputs to PV+ interneurons within the CTC network. However, the degree to which this deficit is directly related to seizure generation has not yet been established. Using chemogenetics and in vivo EEG recording, we recently demonstrated that functional silencing of PV+ interneurons in either the somatosensory cortex (SScortex) or the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) is sufficient to generate absence-SWDs. Here, we used the same approach to assess whether activating PV+ FFI interneurons within the CTC network during absence seizures would prevent or reduce seizures. To target these interneurons, mice expressing Cre recombinase in PV+ interneurons (PV-Cre) were bred with mice expressing excitatory Gq-DREADD (hM3Dq-flox) receptors. An intraperitoneal dose of pro-epileptic chemical pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was used to induce absence seizure. The impact of activation of FFI PV+ interneurons during seizures was tested by focal injection of the “designer drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO) into either the SScortex or the RTN thalamus. Seizures were assessed in PV<sup>Cre</sup>/Gq-DREADD animals using EEG/video recordings. Overall, DREADD-mediated activation of PV+ interneurons provided anti-epileptic effects against PTZ-induced seizures. CNO activation of FFI either prevented PTZ-induced absence seizures or suppressed their severity. Furthermore, PTZ-induced tonic-clonic seizures were also reduced in severity by activation of FFI PV+ interneurons. In contrast, administration of CNO to non-DREADD wild-type control animals did not afford any protection against PTZ-induced seizures. These data demonstrate that FFI PV+ interneurons within CTC microcircuits could be a potential therapeutic target for anti-absence seizure treatment in some patients.</p>

While prior all-optical electrophysiology studies relied on genetically encoded voltage indicators, here, we demonstrate an alternative protocol using a synthetic voltage sensor and genetically encoded optogenetic actuator that generate robust and reproducible results. We demonstrate the functionality of this method by measuring spontaneous and evoked activity in three independent hiPSC-derived neuronal cell lines with distinct genetic backgrounds.</p>

<p>Animal pose estimation tools based on deep learning have greatly improved animal behaviour quantification. These tools perform pose estimation on individual video frames, but do not account for variability of animal body shape in their prediction and evaluation. Here, we introduce a novel multi-frame animal pose estimation framework, referred to as OptiFlex. This framework integrates a flexible base model (i.e., FlexibleBaseline), which accounts for variability in animal body shape, with an OpticalFlow model that incorporates temporal context from nearby video frames. Pose estimation can be optimised using multi-view information to leverage all four dimensions (3D space and time). We evaluate FlexibleBaseline using datasets of four different lab animal species (mouse, fruit fly, zebrafish, and monkey) and introduce an intuitive evaluation metric—adjusted percentage of correct key points (aPCK). Our analyses show that OptiFlex provides prediction accuracy that outperforms current deep learning based tools, highlighting its potential for studying a wide range of behaviours across different animal species.</p>

<p>Sprouting of surviving axons is one of the major reorganization mechanisms of the injured brain contributing to a partial restoration of function. Of note, sprouting is maturation as well as age-dependent and strong in juvenile brains, moderate in adult and weak in aged brains. We have established a model system of complex organotypic tissue cultures to study sprouting in the dentate gyrus following entorhinal denervation. Entorhinal denervation performed after 2 weeks postnatally resulted in a robust, rapid, and very extensive sprouting response of commissural/associational fibers, which could be visualized using calretinin as an axonal marker. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of maturation on this form of sprouting and compared cultures denervated at 2 weeks postnatally with cultures denervated at 4 weeks postnatally. Calretinin immunofluorescence labeling as well as time-lapse imaging of virally-labeled (AAV2-hSyn1-GFP) commissural axons was employed to study the sprouting response in aged cultures. Compared to the young cultures commissural/associational sprouting was attenuated and showed a pattern similar to the one following entorhinal denervation in adult animals in vivo. We conclude that a maturation-dependent attenuation of sprouting occurs also in vitro, which now offers the chance to study, understand and influence maturation-dependent differences in brain repair in these culture preparations.</p>

<p>Urea transporter B (UT-B) is a membrane channel protein widely distributed in mammals, and plays a significant physiological role by regulating urea and water transportation in different tissues. More and more studies have found that UT-B is related to neurological diseases, including myelinopathy and depression. When urea accumulates in the brains of UT-B knockout mice, the synaptic plasticity of neurons is reduced, and the morphology and function of glial cells are also changed. However, the distribution and expression change of UT-B remain unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the expression characteristics of UT-B in the brain. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, UT-B was found to express universally and substantially throughout the various cells in the central nervous system except for endothelial and smooth muscle cells. UT-B was detected in the third cerebral ventricular wall, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, and other parts of the hippocampal, cerebral cortex, substantia nigra, habenular, and lateral hypothalamic nucleus by immunohistochemistry. Compared with the membrane expression of UT-B in glial cells, the subcellular localization of UT-B is in the Golgi apparatus of neurons. Further, the expression of UT-B was regulated by osmotic pressure in vitro. In the experimental traumatic brain injury model (TBI), the number of UT-B positive neurons near the ipsilateral cerebral cortex increased first and then decreased over time, peaking at the 24 h. We inferred that change in UT-B expression after the TBI was an adaptation to changed urea levels. The experimental data suggest that the UT-B may be a potential target for the treatment of TBI and white matter edema.</p>

<p>Background: This study aimed to evaluate the total cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) score in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) at different stages and related factors.</p><p>Methods: A 100 and seven patients with idiopathic PD and 62 normal controls (NCs) who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were enrolled. PD patients were divided into two groups: early PD [(Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) 1–1.5, n = 36)] and advanced PD (H&amp;Y 2–4, n = 71) groups. We calculated the total CSVD score for each participant based on lacunes, high-grade white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). Differences in total CSVD score between the PD and NCs and between the two subgroups were compared. In addition, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between CSVD markers and clinical variables in PD.</p><p>Results: Lacunes were found in 9.3% of patients with PD, periventricular WMH (PVWMH) in 89.7%, deep WMH (DWMH) in 81.3%, EPVS in 85%, and CMBs in 2.8%. Compared with NCs, patients with PD showed higher PVWMH and DWMH scores. Advanced PD patients exhibited greater PVWMH (P = 0.041), DWMH (P = 0.046), and total CSVD score (P = 0.044) than the early PD group. After adjusting for multiple variables, higher H&amp;Y stage was independently correlated with increased total CSVD score (OR = 2.667, 95% CI 1.154–2.266) and PVWMH score (OR = 2.237, 95% CI 1.084–1.696).</p><p>Conclusions: CSVD may play a critical role in patients with PD. The total CSVD score is a potential neuroimaging marker for monitoring the progression of PD.</p>

<p>Biological aging is a complex process featured by declined function of cells and tissues, including those of the immune system. As a consequence, aging affects the expression and development of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells, which can be seen in their sum as the autoimmunome of an individual. In this study we analyzed whether sets of autoimmune features are associated with specific phenotypes which form autoimmunomic signatures related to age and neurodegenerative diseases. The autoantibody profile data of healthy subjects and patients from the GEO database was used to explore autoimmunomic signatures of aging and three neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Our results demonstrate that the autoimmunomic signature of aging is featured by an undulated increase of IgG autoantibodies associated with learning and behavior and a consistent increase of IgG autoantibodies related to ribosome and translation, and the autoimmunomic signature of aging are also associated with age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Intriguingly, Differential Expression-Sliding Window Analysis (DE-SWAN) identified three waves of changes of autoantibodies during aging at an age of 30, 50, and 62 years, respectively. Furthermore, IgG autoantibodies, in particular those against ribosomal proteins, could be used as prediction markers for aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this study for the first time uncovers comprehensive autoimmunomic signatures for aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Sex differences have been observed in the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and elucidating their genetic basis is an active research topic. Based on autosomal genotype data of 7,216 men and 10,680 women, including 8,136 AD cases and 9,760 controls, we explored sex-related genetic heterogeneity in AD by investigating SNP heritability, genetic correlation, as well as SNP- and gene-based genome-wide analyses. We found similar SNP heritability (men: 19.5%; women: 21.5%) and high genetic correlation (R<sub>g</sub> = 0.96) between the sexes. The heritability of APOE ε4-related risks for AD, after accounting for effects of all SNPs excluding chromosome 19, was nominally, but not significantly, higher in women (10.6%) than men (9.7%). In age-stratified analyses, ε3/ε4 was associated with a higher risk of AD among women than men aged 65–75 years, but not in the full sample. Apart from APOE, no new significant locus was identified in sex-stratified gene-based analyses. Our result of the high genetic correlation indicates overall similar genetic architecture of AD in both sexes at the genome-wide averaged level. Our study suggests that clinically observed sex differences may arise from sex-specific variants with small effects or more complicated mechanisms involving epigenetic alterations, sex chromosomes, or gene-environment interactions.</p>

<p>Cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with functional and structural abnormalities in the intrinsic brain network. The salience network (SN) is a neurocognitive network that maintains normal cognitive function, but it has received little attention in T2DM. We explored SN changes in patients with T2DM with normal cognitive function (DMCN) and in patients with T2DM with mild cognitive impairment (DMCI). Sixty-five T2DM patients and 31 healthy controls (HCs) underwent a neuropsychological assessment, independent component analysis (ICA), and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis. The ICA extracted the SN for VBM to compare SN functional connectivity (FC) and gray matter (GM) volume (GMV) between groups. A correlation analysis examined the relationship between abnormal FC and GMV and clinical/cognitive variables. Compared with HCs, DMCN patients demonstrated increased FC in the left frontoinsular cortex (FIC), right anterior insula, and putamen, while DMCI patients demonstrated decreased right middle/inferior frontal gyrus FC. Compared with DMCN patients, DMCI patients showed decreased right FIC FC. There was no significant difference in SN GMV in DMCN and DMCI patients compared with HCs. FIC GMV was decreased in the DMCI patients compared with DMCN patients. In addition, right FIC FC and SN GMV positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. These findings indicate that changes in SN FC, and GMV are complex non-linear processes accompanied by increased cognitive dysfunction in patients with T2DM. The right FIC may be a useful imaging biomarker for supplementary assessment of early cognitive dysfunction in patients with T2DM.</p>

<p>The antidepressant drug amitriptyline is used in the treatment of clinical depression and a variety of neurological conditions such as anxiety, neuropathic pain disorders and migraine. Antidepressants are associated with both therapeutic and untoward effects, and their use in the elderly has tripled since the mid-1990s. Because of this widespread use, we are interested in testing the acute effects of amitriptyline on synaptic transmission at therapeutic concentrations well below those that block voltage-gated calcium channels. We found that 3 μM amitriptyline reduced the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and reduced quantal content in mice at ages of 7–10 mo. and 23–25 mo., suggesting a presynaptic mechanism of action that does not diminish with age. We employed a reduced synaptic preparation of the basal forebrain (BF) and a new optogenetic aging model utilizing a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse line with stable expression of the channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) variant H134R specific for GABAergic neurons [VGAT-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP]. This model enables optogenetic light stimulation of specific GABAergic synaptic terminals across aging. Age-related impairment of circadian behavior was used to confirm predictable age-related changes associated with this model. Our results suggest that low concentrations of amitriptyline act presynaptically to reduce neurotransmitter release and that this action is maintained during aging.</p>

<p>The aseptic trauma of peripheral surgery activates a systemic inflammatory response that results in neuro-inflammation; the microglia, the resident immunocompetent cells in the brain, are a key element of the neuroinflammatory response. In most settings microglia perform a surveillance role in the brain detecting and responding to “invaders” to maintain homeostasis. However, microglia have also been implicated in producing harm possibly by changing its phenotype from its beneficial, anti-inflammatory state (termed M2) into an injurious pro-inflammatory state (termed M1); it is likely that there are intermediates states between these polar phenotypes and some consider that a gradient exists with a number of intermediates, rather than a strict dichotomy between M1 and M2. In the pro-inflammatory phenotypes, microglia can disrupt synaptic plasticity such as long- term potentiation that can result in disorders of learning and memory of the type observed in Peri-operative Neurocognitive Disorders. Therefore, investigators have sought strategies to prevent microglia from provoking this adverse event in the perioperative period. In preclinical studies microglia can be depleted by removing trophic factors required for its maintenance; subsequent repopulation with a more beneficial microglial phenotype may result in memory enhancement, improved sensory motor function, as well as suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Another approach consists of preventing microglial activation using the non-specific P38 MAP kinase blockers such as minocycline. Perhaps a more physiologic approach is the use of inhibitors of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channels that are required to convert the microglia into an active state. In this context the specific K<sup>+</sup> channels that are implicated are termed Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 and high selective inhibitors for each have been developed. Data are accumulating demonstrating the utility of these K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers in preventing Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders.</p>

<p>Finding effective training solutions to attenuate the alterations of behavior and cognition in the growing number of older adults is an important challenge for Science and Society. By offering 3D computer-simulated environments to combine perceptual-motor and cognitive exercise, exergames are promising in this respect. However, a careful analysis of meta-analytic reviews suggests that they failed to be more effective than conventional motor-cognitive training. We analyzed the reasons for this situation, and we proposed new directions to design new, conceptually grounded, exergames. Consistent with the evolutionary neuroscience approach, we contend that new solutions should better combine high level of metabolic activity with (neuro)muscular, physical, perceptual-motor, and cognitive stimulations. According to the Ecological Dynamics rationale, we assume that new exergames should act at the agent–environment scale to allow individuals to explore, discover, and adapt to immersive and informationally rich environments that should include cognitively challenging tasks, while being representative of daily living situations.</p>

<p>The rate of cognitive decline among patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) varies, and it is thus crucial to accurately predict the probability of cognitive deterioration in patients with MCI. We compared the potential of cytokines with amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau biomarkers for predicting cognitive decline in patients with aMCI or Alzheimer’s disease (AD). All participants (controls, aMCI, and AD patients) underwent plasma biomarker examinations for Aβ<sub>1–40</sub>, Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, total tau (t-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 [p-Tau181]), and 29 cytokines and baseline cognitive tests, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The correlation between biomarker levels and annual MMSE change during the follow-up was examined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine whether the statistically significant plasma biomarkers could identify cognitive decline. Higher baseline levels of IL-2, sCD40L, IL-8, and VEGF were associated with a lower annual cognitive decline in the aMCI group, and higher baseline levels of Aβ<sub>1–40</sub>, IFNγ, IL-5, IL-17A, IL-25, and FGF were associated with a rapid annual cognitive decline in the AD group. IL-2 had a high discriminatory capacity for identifying cognitive decline, with an area under curve (AUC) of 85.7% in the aMCI group, and the AUC was slightly increased when combining IL-2 with Aβ or tau biomarkers. However, none of the biomarkers had a satisfactory discriminatory capacity in the AD group. IL-2 may have a better discriminatory capacity for identifying cognitive decline than Aβ and tau biomarkers in patients with aMCI.</p>

<p>Objectives: We aimed to develop and validate a novel multi-biomarker model for predicting hemorrhagic transformation (HT) risk after acute ischemic stroke (AIS).</p><p>Methods: We prospectively included patients with AIS admitted within 24 h of stroke from January 1st 2016 to January 31st 2019. A panel of 17 circulating biomarkers was measured and analyzed in this cohort. We assessed the ability of individual circulating biomarkers and the combination of multiple biomarkers to predict any HT, symptomatic HT (sHT) and parenchymal hematoma (PH) after AIS. The strategy of multiple biomarkers in combination was then externally validated in an independent cohort of 288 Chinese patients.</p><p>Results: A total of 1207 patients with AIS (727 males; mean age, 67.2 ± 13.9 years) were included as a derivation cohort, of whom 179 patients (14.8%) developed HT. The final multi-biomarker model included three biomarkers [platelets, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLR), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)] from different pathways, showing a good performance for predicting HT in both the derivation cohort (c statistic = 0·64, 95% CI 0·60–0·69), and validation cohort (c statistic = 0·70, 95% CI 0·58–0·82). Adding these three biomarkers simultaneously to the basic model with conventional risk factors improved the ability of HT reclassification [net reclassification improvement (NRI) 65.6%, P &lt; 0.001], PH (NRI 64.7%, P &lt; 0.001), and sHT (NRI 71.3%, P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Conclusion: This easily applied multi-biomarker model had a good performance for predicting HT in both the derivation and external validation cohorts. Incorporation of biomarkers into clinical decision making may help to identify patients at high risk of HT after AIS and warrants further consideration.</p>

Dorsal-ventral patterning of the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo depends on the NFκB superfamily transcription factor Dorsal (Dl). Toll receptor activation signals for degradation of the IκB inhibitor Cactus (Cact), leading to a ventral-to-dorsal nuclear Dl gradient. Cact is critical for Dl nuclear import, as it binds to and prevents Dl from entering the nuclei. Quantitative analysis of <i>cact</i> mutants revealed an additional Cact function to promote Dl nuclear translocation in ventral regions of the embryo. To investigate this dual Cact role, we developed a predictive model based on a reaction-diffusion regulatory network. This network distinguishes non-uniform Toll-dependent Dl nuclear import and Cact degradation, from the Toll-independent processes of Cact degradation and reversible nuclear-cytoplasmic Dl flow. In addition, it incorporates translational control of Cact levels by Dl. Our model successfully reproduces wild-type data and emulates the Dl nuclear gradient in mutant <i>dl</i> and <i>cact</i> allelic combinations. Our results indicate that the dual role of Cact depends on the dynamics of Dl-Cact trimers along the dorsal-ventral axis: In the absence of Toll activation, free Dl-Cact trimers retain Dl in the cytoplasm, limiting the flow of Dl into the nucleus; in ventral-lateral regions, Dl-Cact trimers are recruited by Toll activation into predominant signaling complexes and promote Dl nuclear translocation. Simulations suggest that the balance between Toll-dependent and Toll-independent processes are key to this dynamics and reproduce the full assortment of Cact effects. Considering the high evolutionary conservation of these pathways, our analysis should contribute to understanding NFκB/c-Rel activation in other contexts such as in the vertebrate immune system and disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZAAH6OfbL4c" width="1" />

Antibodies are widely used reagents to test for expression of proteins and other antigens. However, they might not always reliably produce results when they do not specifically bind to the target proteins that their providers designed them for, leading to unreliable research results. While many proposals have been developed to deal with the problem of antibody specificity, it is still challenging to cover the millions of antibodies that are available to researchers. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of automatically generating alerts to users of problematic antibodies by extracting statements about antibody specificity reported in the literature. The extracted alerts can be used to construct an “Antibody Watch” knowledge base containing supporting statements of problematic antibodies. We developed a deep neural network system and tested its performance with a corpus of more than two thousand articles that reported uses of antibodies. We divided the problem into two tasks. Given an input article, the first task is to identify snippets about antibody specificity and classify if the snippets report that any antibody exhibits non-specificity, and thus is problematic. The second task is to link each of these snippets to one or more antibodies mentioned in the snippet. The experimental evaluation shows that our system can accurately perform the classification task with 0.925 weighted F1-score, linking with 0.962 accuracy, and 0.914 weighted F1 when combined to complete the joint task. We leveraged Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) to precisely identify antibodies linked to the extracted specificity snippets. The result shows that it is feasible to construct a reliable knowledge base about problematic antibodies by text mining.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FGzQhsRalKM" width="1" />

Mass gathering events have been identified as high-risk environments for community transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Empirical estimates of their direct and spill-over effects however remain challenging to identify. In this study, we propose the use of a novel synthetic control framework to obtain causal estimates for direct and spill-over impacts of these events. The Sabah state elections in Malaysia were used as an example for our proposed methodology and we investigate the event’s spatial and temporal impacts on COVID-19 transmission. Results indicate an estimated (i) 70.0% of COVID-19 case counts within Sabah post-state election were attributable to the election’s direct effect; (ii) 64.4% of COVID-19 cases in the rest of Malaysia post-state election were attributable to the election’s spill-over effects. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted by examining epidemiological pre-trends, surveillance efforts, varying synthetic control matching characteristics and spill-over specifications. We demonstrate that our estimates are not due to pre-existing epidemiological trends, surveillance efforts, and/or preventive policies. These estimates highlight the potential of mass gatherings in one region to spill-over into an outbreak of national scale. Relaxations of mass gathering restrictions must therefore be carefully considered, even in the context of low community transmission and enforcement of safe distancing guidelines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zoApTSJo7aA" width="1" />

<p>by Susana Andrea Contreras, Jan-Hendrik Schleimer, Allan T. Gulledge, Susanne Schreiber</p>

During normal neuronal activity, ionic concentration gradients across a neuron’s membrane are often assumed to be stable. Prolonged spiking activity, however, can reduce transmembrane gradients and affect voltage dynamics. Based on mathematical modeling, we investigated the impact of neuronal activity on ionic concentrations and, consequently, the dynamics of action potential generation. We find that intense spiking activity on the order of a second suffices to induce changes in ionic reversal potentials and to consistently induce a switch from a regular to an intermittent firing mode. This transition is caused by a qualitative alteration in the system’s voltage dynamics, mathematically corresponding to a co-dimension-two bifurcation from a saddle-node on invariant cycle (SNIC) to a homoclinic orbit bifurcation (HOM). Our electrophysiological recordings in mouse cortical pyramidal neurons confirm the changes in action potential dynamics predicted by the models: (i) activity-dependent increases in intracellular sodium concentration directly reduce action potential amplitudes, an effect typically attributed solely to sodium channel inactivation; (ii) extracellular potassium accumulation switches action potential generation from tonic firing to intermittently interrupted output. Thus, individual neurons may respond very differently to the same input stimuli, depending on their recent patterns of activity and/or the current brain-state.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eHmLpATrpGY" width="1" />
