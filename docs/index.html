	<p>Purpose: Neuropathic pain often originates from nerve injury or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system. However, its specific pathogenesis remains unclear. The requirement for excitatory synaptic plasticity in pain-related syndromes has been demonstrated. A recent study reported that pentraxin-3 is important in glutamatergic synaptic formation and function. Meanwhile, nectin-1 mediates synaptogenesis in neurological disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate whether pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 modulate spinal nerve damage-related neuropathic pain in male mice. Methods: L4 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) in male mice was performed to induce experimental neuropathic pain. Mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia following SNL were based on paw withdrawal (PW) threshold and PW latency, respectively. Spinal pentraxin-3 levels and nectin-1 expression following SNL were examined. Pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 knockdown models were established by the shRNA method. These models were used with a recombinant pentraxin-3 cell model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of SNL. Results: The SNL operation generated persistent decreases in mechanical PW threshold and thermal PW latency, with subsequent long-lasting elevations in spinal pentraxin-3 and nectin-1 expression levels. Pentraxin-3 knockdown reduced SNL-associated neuropathic pain behaviors as well as nectin-1 amounts in the spinal dorsal horn. Nectin-1 deficiency impaired mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia following spinal nerve injury. The application of recombinant pentraxin-3 in the spinal cord triggered an acute nociception phenotype and induced spinal overexpression of nectin-1. The intrathecal knockdown of nectin-1 prevented exogenous pentraxin-3-evoked pain hypersensitivity. Conclusions: The findings suggest spinal pentraxin-3 is required for SNL-triggered neuropathic pain via nectin-1 upregulation in male mice.</p>

     alt="Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging quantification of gray matter alterations in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder"/>
<p>Using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging-derived myelin volume fraction, we showed gray matter alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Our findings suggested extensive neuroinflammation, along with a lesser extent demyelination and neuronal loss in RRMS. In contrast, we observed substantial neuronal loss with no evidence of demyelination and neuroinflammation in NMOSD.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Herein, we combined neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (SyMRI) to evaluate the spatial distribution and extent of gray matter (GM) microstructural alterations in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). The NODDI (neurite density index [NDI], orientation dispersion index [ODI], and isotropic volume fraction [ISOVF]) and SyMRI (myelin volume fraction [MVF]) measures were compared between age- and sex-matched groups of 30 patients with RRMS (6 males and 24 females; mean age, 51.43 ± 8.02 years), 18 patients with anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD (2 males and 16 females; mean age, 52.67 ± 16.07 years), and 19 healthy controls (6 males and 13 females; mean age, 51.47 ± 9.25 years) using GM-based spatial statistical analysis. Patients with RRMS showed reduced NDI and MVF and increased ODI and ISOVF, predominantly in the limbic and paralimbic regions, when compared with healthy controls, while only increases in ODI and ISOVF were observed when compared with NMOSD. Compared to NDI and MVF, the changes in ODI and ISOVF were observed more widely, including in the cerebellar cortex. These abnormalities were associated with disease progression and disability. In contrast, patients with NMOSD only showed reduced NDI mainly in the cerebellar, limbic, and paralimbic cortices when compared with healthy controls and patients with RRMS. Taken together, our study supports the notion that GM pathologies in RRMS are distinct from those of NMOSD. However, owing to the limitations of the study, the results should be cautiously interpreted.</p>

<p>Hippocampal subfield volumes were significantly different in ME/CFS, especially in patients meeting ICC criteria. Hippocampal subfield volumes correlated with ME/CFS clinical measures. For example, smaller subfield volumes were associated with higher pain and fatigue levels in ME/CFS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) patients suffer from a cognitive and memory dysfunction. Because the hippocampus plays a key role in both cognition and memory, we tested for volumetric differences in the subfields of the hippocampus in ME/CFS. We estimated hippocampal subfield volumes for 25 ME/CFS patients who met Fukuda criteria only (ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>), 18 ME/CFS patients who met the stricter ICC criteria (ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub>), and 25 healthy controls (HC). Group comparisons with HC detected extensive differences in subfield volumes in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> but not in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub>. ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients had significantly <i>larger</i> volume in the left subiculum head (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), left presubiculum head (<i>p</i> = 0.0020), and left fimbria (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Correlations of hippocampus subfield volumes with clinical measures were stronger in ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> than in ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients. In ME/CFS<sub>Fukuda</sub> patients, we detected positive correlations between fatigue and hippocampus subfield volumes and a negative correlation between sleep disturbance score and the right CA1 body volume. In ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients, we detected a strong negative relationship between fatigue and left hippocampus tail volume. Strong negative relationships were also detected between pain and SF36 physical scores and two hippocampal subfield volumes (left: GC-ML-DG head and CA4 head). Our study demonstrated that volumetric differences in hippocampal subfields have strong statistical inference for patients meeting the ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> case definition and confirms hippocampal involvement in the cognitive and memory problems of ME/CFS<sub>ICC</sub> patients.</p>

     alt="Bate palmas mutant mice as a model of Kabuki syndrome: Higher susceptibility to infections and vocalization impairments?"/>
<p><i>Bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) mutant mice were validated as a model of Kabuki syndrome as they were more susceptible to infections. Juvenile <i>bapa</i> mice also presented dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Juvenile control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted a novel vocalization pattern: 31-kHz.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The recessive mutant mouse <i>bate palmas</i> (<i>bapa</i>) arose from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Previous studies of our group revealed some behavioral impairments and a mutation in the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (Kmt2d) gene. Because mutations in the KMT2D gene in humans are mainly responsible for Kabuki syndrome, this study was proposed to validate <i>bapa</i> mice as a model of Kabuki syndrome. Besides other symptoms, Kabuki syndrome is characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and speech impairments, usually diagnosed in the early childhood. Thus, juvenile male and female <i>bapa</i> mice were studied in different developmental stages (prepubertal period and puberty). To induce sickness behavior and to study infection susceptibility responses, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used. To study oral communication, ultrasonic vocalizations were evaluated. Behavioral (open-field test) and central (astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and tyrosine hydroxylase [TH]) evaluations were also performed. Control and <i>bapa</i> female mice emitted 31-kHz ultrasounds on prepubertal period when exploring a novel environment, a frequency not yet described for mice, being defined as 31-kHz exploratory vocalizations. Males, LPS, and puberty inhibited these vocalizations. <i>Bapa</i> mice presented increased motor/exploratory behaviors on prepubertal period due to increased striatal TH expression, revealing striatal dopaminergic system hyperactivity. Combining open-field behavior and GFAP expression, <i>bapa</i> mice did not develop LPS tolerance, that is, they remained expressing signs of sickness behavior after LPS challenge, being more susceptible to infectious/inflammatory processes. It was concluded that <i>bapa</i> mice is a robust experimental model of Kabuki syndrome.</p>

     alt="Abnormal dynamic functional connectivity in first-episode, drug-naïve adolescents with major depressive disorder"/>
<p>This dynamic functional connectivity (FC) study suggests that adolescent depression is characterized by unstable network dynamic pattern, altered state transition metrics, and disrupted FC in a weakly connected state. Furthermore, mean dwell time in this weakly connected state is associated with disease severity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Previous neuroimaging studies have identified disrupted large-scale functional brain networks in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, most of them focused on adult patients and were based on static functional connectivity (FC). Thus, we aimed to investigate the patterns of change in dynamic FC in depressed adolescents. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 60 first-episode, drug-naïve adolescents with MDD and 60 matched healthy controls (HCs). Then, the dynamic FC properties were analyzed using a sliding windows approach, <i>k</i>-means clustering, and graph theory methods. The intrinsic brain FC were clustered into two configuration states—a more frequent and relatively sparsely connected State 1 and a less frequent and more strongly interconnected State 2. Compared with HCs, depressed adolescents had higher reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 1, and lower reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 2, and higher total number of transitions between the two states. Depressed adolescents showed decreased FC within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other networks in State 1. Additionally, the MDD group showed higher variances in the global and local efficiency. Furthermore, the duration of illness was positively correlated with the number of state transitions, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the mean dwell time in State 1. This study demonstrated abnormal dynamic FC in depressed adolescents, which provided new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adolescent-onset depression.</p>

     alt="Childhood trauma exposure and reward processing in healthy adults: A functional neuroimaging study"/>
<p>Childhood abuse was associated with increased ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and income. Overall childhood trauma and childhood neglect were not associated with significant activation changes in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation or the orbitofrontal cortex during reward outcome.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The association between childhood trauma exposure and risk of developing psychopathology may in part be mediated by the effects of chronic stress on dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, little is known about the differential effects of distinct trauma types on reward processing, particularly in adults without concurrent medical or psychiatric disorders. We examined the association of childhood trauma exposure, including the differential effects of abuse and neglect, with reward processing in healthy adults (<i>n</i> = 114). Functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task was used to assess neural activity in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in relation to reward anticipation and reward outcome, respectively. Exposure to childhood trauma, including abuse and neglect, was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form. We found a significant effect for abuse on ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation, adjusting for age, sex, scanner site, educational level, and household monthly income. There were no effects for abuse or neglect, independently or combined, on orbitofrontal cortex activation during reward outcome. Our findings suggest differential effects of childhood abuse on ventral striatum activation during reward anticipation in healthy adults.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), including diffuse axonal injury, are influenced by the direction, magnitude, and duration of head acceleration during the injury exposure. Ovine models have been used to study injury mechanics and pathological outcomes of TBI. To accurately describe the kinematics of the head during an injury exposure, and better facilitate comparison with human head kinematics, anatomical coordinate systems (ACS) with an origin at the head or brain center of mass (CoM), and axes that align with the ovine Frankfort plane equivalent, are required. The aim of this study was to determine the mass properties of the sheep head and brain, and define an ACS<sub>virtual</sub> for the head and brain, using anatomical landmarks on the skull with the aforementioned origins and orientation. Three-dimensional models of 10 merino sheep heads were constructed from computed tomography images, and the coordinates of the head and brain CoMs, relative to a previously reported sheep head coordinate system (ACS<sub>physical</sub>), were determined using the Hounsfield unit–mass density relationship. The ACS<sub>physical</sub> origin was 34.8 ± 3.1 mm posterosuperior of the head CoM and 43.7 ± 1.7 anteroinferior of the brain CoM. Prominent internal anatomical landmarks were then used to define a new ACS (ACS<sub>virtual</sub>) with axes aligned with the Frankfort plane equivalent and an origin 10.4 ± 3.2 mm from the head CoM. The CoM and ACS<sub>virtual</sub> defined in this study will increase the potential for comparison of head kinematics between ovine models and humans, in the context of TBI.</p>

     alt="Serotonin 5-HT7 receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area produces antidepressive effect and affects brain serotonin system in male mice"/>
<p>5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain produces antidepressive effect in both “normal” C57Bl/6J and “depressive” ASC/Icg mice. This effect is accompanied by increased 5-HT metabolism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heterodimerization between 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors seems to play an important role in the mechanism of depression and antidepressant drug action. It was suggested that the shift of the ratio between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>7</sub> hetero- and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers in presynaptic neurons toward 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers is one of the reasons of depression. Consequently, the artificial elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor number in presynaptic terminals might restore physiological homo-/heterodimer ratio resulting in antidepressive effect. Here we showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain raphe nuclei area produced antidepressive effect in male mice of both C57Bl/6J and genetically predisposed to depressive-like behavior ASC (antidepressant sensitive cataleptics) strains. These changes were accompanied by the elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor mRNA level in the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and its reduction in the hippocampus of ASC mice. The presence of engineered 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the midbrain of both mouse strains was further demonstrated. Importantly that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression resulted in the reduction of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor level in the membrane protein fraction from the midbrain samples of C57Bl/6J, but not ASC, mice. 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression caused an increase of 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the midbrain and the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and in all investigated brain structures of ASC mice. Thus, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area affects brain 5-HT system and causes antidepressive effect both in C57Bl/6J and in “depressive” ASC male mice. Obtained results indicate the involvement of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the mechanisms underlying depressive behavior.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral septum (LS) is a structure in the midline of the brain that is interconnected with areas associated with stress and feeding. This review highlights the role of the LS in anxiety, depression, and eating disorders and their comorbidity. There is a prevailing view that the LS is anxiolytic. This review finds that the LS is both anxiolytic and anxiogenic. Furthermore, the LS can promote and inhibit feeding. Given these shared roles, the LS represents a common site for the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric disorders, and therefore a potential pharmacological target. This is crucial since currently available treatments are not always effective. Corticotrophin-releasing factor 2 antagonists are potential drugs for the treatment of anxiety and anorexia and require further research. Furthermore, other drugs currently in trials for binge eating, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists, may in fact promote food intake. It is hoped that the advancements in chemo- and optogenetic techniques will allow future studies to profile the specific neural connections of the LS and their function. This information could facilitate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and therefore pharmacological targets, of these psychiatric conditions.</p>

     alt="Altered basal ganglia infraslow oscillation and resting functional connectivity in complex regional pain syndrome"/>
<p>This study is the first systematic evaluation of functional connectivity of basal ganglia motor and non-motor territories in CRPS. In CRPS, there is increased ISOs and resting functional connectivity in motor but not in non-motor basal ganglia territories (except caudate body functional connectivity) compared to controls.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful condition commonly accompanied by movement disturbances and often affects the upper limbs. The basal ganglia motor loop is central to movement, however, non-motor basal ganglia loops are involved in pain, sensory integration, visual processing, cognition, and emotion. Systematic evaluation of each basal ganglia functional loop and its relation to motor and non-motor disturbances in CRPS has not been investigated. We recruited 15 upper limb CRPS and 45 matched healthy control subjects. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, infraslow oscillations (ISO) and resting-state functional connectivity in motor and non-motor basal ganglia loops were investigated using putamen and caudate seeds. Compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased ISO power in the putamen contralateral to the CRPS affected limb, specifically, in contralateral putamen areas representing the supplementary motor area hand, motor hand, and motor tongue. Furthermore, compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased resting connectivity between these putaminal areas as well as from the caudate body to cortical areas such as the primary motor cortex, supplementary and cingulate motor areas, parietal association areas, and the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate changes in basal ganglia loop function in CRPS subjects and may underpin motor disturbances of CRPS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexing the principal gradient of the cerebral cortex to suit changing semantic task demands</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how thought emerges from the topographical structure of the cerebral cortex is a primary goal of cognitive neuroscience. Recent work has revealed a principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity capturing the separation of sensory-motor cortex from transmodal regions of the default mode network (DMN); this is thought to facilitate memory-guided cognition. However, studies have not explored how this dimension of connectivity changes when conceptual retrieval is controlled to suit the context. We used gradient decomposition of informational connectivity in a semantic association task to establish how the similarity in connectivity across brain regions changes during familiar and more original patterns of retrieval. Multivoxel activation patterns at opposite ends of the principal gradient were more divergent when participants retrieved stronger associations; therefore when long-term semantic information is sufficient for ongoing cognition, regions supporting heteromodal memory are functionally separated from sensory-motor experience. In contrast, when less related concepts were linked, this dimension of connectivity was reduced in strength as semantic control regions separated from the DMN to generate more flexible and original responses. We also observed fewer dimensions within the neural response towards the apex of the principal gradient when strong associations were retrieved, reflecting less complex or varied neural coding across trials and participants. In this way, the principal gradient explains how semantic cognition is organised in the human cerebral cortex: the separation of DMN from sensory-motor systems is a hallmark of the retrieval of strong conceptual links that are culturally shared.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct population and single-neuron selectivity for executive and episodic processing in human dorsal posterior cingulate</a></h4>

              
                Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is an enigmatic region implicated in psychiatric and neurological disease, yet its role in cognition remains unclear. Human studies link PCC to episodic memory and default mode network (DMN), while findings from the non-human primate emphasize executive processes more associated with the cognitive control network (CCN) in humans. We hypothesized this difference reflects an important functional division between dorsal (executive) and ventral (episodic) PCC. To test this, we utilized human intracranial recordings of population and single unit activity targeting dorsal PCC during an alternated executive/episodic processing task. Dorsal PCC population responses were significantly enhanced for executive, compared to episodic, task conditions, consistent with the CCN. Single unit recordings, however, revealed four distinct functional types with unique executive (CCN) or episodic (DMN) response profiles. Our findings provide critical electrophysiological data from human PCC, bridging incongruent views within and across species, furthering our understanding of PCC function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Status epilepticus induces chronic silencing of burster and dominance of regular firing neurons during sharp wave-ripples in the mouse subiculum</a></h4>

              
                Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal oscillations associated with memory consolidation. The subiculum, as the hippocampal output structure, ensures that hippocampal memory representations are transferred correctly to the consolidating neocortical regions. Because patients with temporal lobe epilepsy often develop memory deficits, we hypothesized that epileptic networks may disrupt subicular SWRs. We therefore investigated the impact of experimentally induced status epilepticus (SE) on subicular SWRs and contributing pyramidal neurons using electrophysiological recordings in mouse hippocampal slices. Subicular SWRs expressed hyperexcitable features post-SE, including increased ripple and unit activity. While regular firing neurons normally remain silent during SWRs, selective disinhibition recruited more regular firing neurons for action potential generation during SWRs post-SE. By contrast, burster neurons generated fewer action potential bursts during SWRs post-SE. Furthermore, altered timing of postsynaptic and action potentials suggested distorted neuronal recruitment during SWRs. Distorted subicular SWRs may therefore impair information processing and memory consolidation in epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) Facilitates Dendritic Spine Growth of Pyramidal Neurons in Mouse Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The L1 cell adhesion molecule NrCAM (Neuron-glia related cell adhesion molecule) functions as a co-receptor for secreted class 3 Semaphorins to prune subpopulations of dendritic spines on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the developing mouse neocortex. The developing spine cytoskeleton is enriched in actin filaments but a small number of microtubules have been shown to enter the spine apparently trafficking vesicles to the membrane. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a member of the Doublecortin (DCX) family of microtubule-binding proteins with serine/threonine kinase activity. To determine if DCLK1 plays a role in spine remodeling, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse line (Nex1Cre-ERT2: DCLK1flox/flox : RCE) to delete microtubule binding isoforms of DCLK1 from pyramidal neurons during postnatal stages of spine development. Homozygous DCLK1 conditional mutant mice exhibited decreased spine density on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex (layer 2/3). Mature mushroom spines were selectively decreased upon DCLK1 deletion but dendritic arborization was unaltered. Mutagenesis and binding studies revealed that DCLK1 bound NrCAM at the conserved FIGQY1231 motif in the NrCAM cytoplasmic domain, a known interaction site for the actin-spectrin adaptor Ankyrin. These findings demonstrate that DCLK1 facilitates spine growth and maturation on cortical pyramidal neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex potentially through microtubule and NrCAM interactions.

	<p>Cognitive control is essential to daily life. Task switching is a classical paradigm used to study cognitive control. Previous researchers have studied the representation of different abstract hierarchical rules in the prefrontal cortex and explored the process mechanisms of task switching. However, the differences between the different hierarchical levels of task switching, especially the related neural mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex, are still unclear. This review focuses on and summarizes this issue. The present study suggests that the higher the hierarchical rule shifting or task switching, the more anterior the activation is on the prefrontal cortex. In addition, a high hierarchy of rules or tasks is more abstract, which leads to a larger switching cost.</p>

	<p>Rhythmic passive movements are often used during rehabilitation to improve physical functions. Previous studies have explored oscillatory activities in the sensorimotor cortex during active movements; however, the relationship between movement rhythms and oscillatory activities during passive movements has not been substantially tested. Therefore, we aimed to quantitatively identify changes in cortical oscillations during rhythmic passive movements. Twenty healthy young adults participated in our study. We placed electroencephalography electrodes over a nine-position grid; the center was oriented on the transcranial magnetic stimulation hotspot of the biceps brachii muscle. Passive movements included elbow flexion and extension; the participants were instructed to perform rhythmic elbow flexion and extension in response to the blinking of 0.67 Hz light-emitting diode lamps. The coherence between high-beta and low-gamma oscillations near the hotspot of the biceps brachii muscle and passive movement rhythms was higher than that between alpha oscillation and passive movement rhythm. These results imply that alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations of the primary motor cortex are differently related to passive movement rhythm.</p>

	<p>Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed important aspects of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine suggesting abnormal brain energy metabolism and altered functional connectivity. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies investigated migraine patients in the interictal or ictal state. This first-of-its-kind study aimed to investigate the whole migraine cycle using 1H-MRS and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A migraine patient underwent 1H-MRS and resting-state fMRI for 21 consecutive days, regardless of whether he was in an interictal or ictal state. Metabolite ratios were assessed and compared to the intrinsic connectivity of subcortical brain areas. Probable migraine phase-dependent changes in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/total creatine (tCr) and choline (Cho)/tCr levels are found in the left occipital lobe and left basal ganglia. NAA reflects neuronal integrity and Cho cellular membrane turnover. Such abnormalities may increase the susceptibility to excitatory migraine triggers. Functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and right or left pallidum was strongly correlated to the NAA/Cho ratio in the right thalamus, suggesting neurochemical modulation of these brain areas through thalamic connections. To draw statistically significant conclusions a larger cohort is needed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptotagmin-7 Enhances Facilitation of Cav2.1 Calcium Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Voltage-gated calcium channel Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 undergoes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation and inactivation, which are important in short-term synaptic plasticity. In presynaptic terminals, Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 forms large protein complexes that include synaptotagmins. Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt-7) is essential to mediate short-term synaptic plasticity in many synapses. Here, based on evidence that Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 and Syt-7 are both required for short-term synaptic facilitation, we investigated the direct interaction of Syt-7 with Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 and probed its regulation of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 function. We found that Syt-7 binds specifically to the &alpha;<SUB>1A</SUB> subunit of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 through interaction with the synaptic-protein interaction (synprint) site. Surprisingly, this interaction enhances facilitation in paired-pulse protocols and accelerates the onset of facilitation. Syt-7&alpha; induces a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation of Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 and slows Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation, whereas Syt-7&beta; and Syt-7 have smaller effects. Our results identify an unexpected, isoform-specific interaction between Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 and Syt-7 through the synprint site, which enhances Ca<SUB>v</SUB>2.1 facilitation and modulates its inactivation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Speed Estimation for Visual Tracking Emerges Dynamically from Nonlinear Frequency Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensing the movement of fast objects within our visual environments is essential for controlling actions. It requires online estimation of motion direction and speed. We probed human speed representation using ocular tracking of stimuli of different statistics. First, we compared ocular responses to single drifting gratings (DGs) with a given set of spatiotemporal frequencies to broadband motion clouds (MCs) of matched mean frequencies. Motion energy distributions of gratings and clouds are point-like, and ellipses oriented along the constant speed axis, respectively. Sampling frequency space, MCs elicited stronger, less variable, and speed-tuned responses. DGs yielded weaker and more frequency-tuned responses. Second, we measured responses to patterns made of two or three components covering a range of orientations within Fourier space. Early tracking initiation of the patterns was best predicted by a linear combination of components before nonlinear interactions emerged to shape later dynamics. Inputs are supralinearly integrated along an iso-velocity line and sublinearly integrated away from it. A dynamical probabilistic model characterizes these interactions as an excitatory pooling along the iso-velocity line and inhibition along the orthogonal "scale" axis. Such crossed patterns of interaction would appropriately integrate or segment moving objects. This study supports the novel idea that speed estimation is better framed as a dynamic channel interaction organized along speed and scale axes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sustainable development of smart cities and smart territories based on the model of minimizing externalities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The development of conceptual models of a digital city poses numerous challenges for developers. The public sector concept model has become one of the most difficult models to use. When developing algorithms to find a solution, the multidirectional interests of businesses and public institutions are combined. This type of model reflects the most acute and urgent problems faced by megapolises with regard to combining numerous localized services provided to the community in a limited territory. The administrations of both cities and regions (the scale of the smart territories) must make decisions concerning overcoming the barriers existing between the profits of commercial structures, the negative externalities generated by their activities, and the social benefits to the population in the territory under their control. It is necessary to solve this problem to achieve the effective management of enterprises belonging to the segment of long-term participants in various business activities, interacting with the surrounding social and business environment in a complex. This study takes into account the complex structures of the economic processes characteristic of megacities. The periodicity of economic processes is also taken into account. When choosing an optimization criterion, functions reflecting the level of internalization of responsibility for external effects were considered. The authors propose a mathematical model that can be used as part of the management decision support systems software, aiming at taking into account the externalities of a wide range of national, institutional, business, and social activities.

                Background: Silkworm cocoons are materials that have fine regenerating abilities for the human body. Fibroin and sericin present in silkworm cocoons (Bombyx mori) are thought to have anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to know the effects of the use of wound dressing from silkworm cocoons toward COX-2 expression and neutrophils number in the inflammatory phase after skin excision. Methods: Twelve male Wistar rats according to inclusion criteria were randomly divided into 4 groups, each group of 6, based on the decapitation time (the 3rd day and the 6th day) and based on the dressing material (moist gauze dressing as the control group and silkworm cocoons as the treatment group). Each group was performed an excision on the dorsal skin with subcutaneous depth using a 4 mm-round punch biopsy. Neutrophil cell observations were performed by Hematoxylin eosin staining (HE). COX-2 expression was found in preparations for immunohistochemical staining using rabbit monoclonal COX-2 antibody at sacrificed period on the 3rd and the 6th day after wound dressing application. Results: The number of neutrophils and expression of COX-2 were analyzed using Two-way ANOVA and Independent t-test. The results showed a significant decrease in the number of COX-2 expression on inflammatory cells as well as the number of neutrophils (p<0.005) in the groups treated with wound dressing from silkworm cocoons on both the 3rd and 6th day. Conclusions: It was concluded that the use of wound dressing from silkworm cocoons can inhibit COX-2 expression (p=0,000) and decrease the number of neutrophils in the inflammatory phase after skin excision (p=0,001).

                Background: The optimal neonatal resuscitation requires healthcare personnel knowledge and experience. This study aims to assess the readiness of hospitals through its healthcare personnel in performing neonatal resuscitation. Methods: This study was an observational study conducted in May 2021 by distributing questionnaires to nurses, midwives, doctors, and residents to determine the level of knowledge and experience of the subject regarding neonatal resuscitation. We conducted the research in four types of hospitals A, B, C, and D, which are defined by the Regulation of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia by the capability and availability of medical services. The type A hospital is the hospital with the most complete medical services, while type D hospitals have the least medical services. The comparative analysis between participants’ characteristics and the knowledge or experience score was conducted.  Results: The total 123 participants are included in the knowledge questionnaire analysis and 70 participants are included in the resuscitation experience analysis. We showed a significant difference (p = 0.013) of healthcare personnel knowledge between the A type hospital (Median 15.00; Interquartile Range [IQR] 15.00–16.00) and the C type hospital (median 14.50; IQR 12.25–15.75). For the experience, the healthcare personnel of type A and type B hospitals have significantly higher experience scores than the type D hospital (p = 0.014; p = 0.007), but we did not find a significant difference between others type of hospital comparison. Conclusions: In this study, we found that the healthcare personnel from type A and type B hospitals are more experienced than the type D hospital in conducting neonatal resuscitation. We suggest more neonatal resuscitation training to improve the readiness of healthcare personnel from type C and type D hospital.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Accurate, high-coverage assignment of in vivo protein kinases to phosphosites from in vitro phosphoproteomic specificity data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brandon M. Invergo</p>

Phosphoproteomic experiments routinely observe thousands of phosphorylation sites. To understand the intracellular signaling processes that generated this data, one or more causal protein kinases must be assigned to each phosphosite. However, limited knowledge of kinase specificity typically restricts assignments to a small subset of a kinome. Starting from a statistical model of a high-throughput, <i>in vitro</i> kinase-substrate assay, I have developed an approach to high-coverage, multi-label kinase-substrate assignment called IV-KAPhE (“<i>In vivo</i>-Kinase Assignment for Phosphorylation Evidence”). Tested on human data, IV-KAPhE outperforms other methods of similar scope. Such computational methods generally predict a densely connected kinase-substrate network, with most sites targeted by multiple kinases, pointing either to unaccounted-for biochemical constraints or significant cross-talk and signaling redundancy. I show that such predictions can potentially identify biased kinase-site misannotations within families of closely related kinase isozymes and they provide a robust basis for kinase activity analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CrowdGO: Machine learning and semantic similarity guided consensus Gene Ontology annotation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maarten J. M. F. Reijnders, Robert M. Waterhouse</p>

Characterising gene function for the ever-increasing number and diversity of species with annotated genomes relies almost entirely on computational prediction methods. These software are also numerous and diverse, each with different strengths and weaknesses as revealed through community benchmarking efforts. Meta-predictors that assess consensus and conflict from individual algorithms should deliver enhanced functional annotations. To exploit the benefits of meta-approaches, we developed CrowdGO, an open-source consensus-based Gene Ontology (GO) term meta-predictor that employs machine learning models with GO term semantic similarities and information contents. By re-evaluating each gene-term annotation, a consensus dataset is produced with high-scoring confident annotations and low-scoring rejected annotations. Applying CrowdGO to results from a deep learning-based, a sequence similarity-based, and two protein domain-based methods, delivers consensus annotations with improved precision and recall. Furthermore, using standard evaluation measures CrowdGO performance matches that of the community’s best performing individual methods. CrowdGO therefore offers a model-informed approach to leverage strengths of individual predictors and produce comprehensive and accurate gene functional annotations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterization and clustering of kinase isoform expression in metastatic melanoma</a></h4>

Mutations to the human kinome are known to play causal roles in cancer. The kinome regulates numerous cell processes including growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition to aberrant expression, aberrant alternative splicing of cancer-driver genes is receiving increased attention as it could lead to loss or gain of functional domains, altering a kinase’s downstream impact. The present study quantifies changes in gene expression and isoform ratios in the kinome of metastatic melanoma cells relative to primary tumors. We contrast 538 total kinases and 3,040 known kinase isoforms between 103 primary tumor and 367 metastatic samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find strong evidence of differential expression (DE) at the gene level in 123 kinases (23%). Additionally, of the 468 kinases with alternative isoforms, 60 (13%) had significant difference in isoform ratios (DIR). Notably, DE and DIR have little correlation; for instance, although DE highlights enrichment in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), DIR identifies altered splicing in non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Using exon junction mapping, we identify five examples of splicing events favored in metastatic samples. We demonstrate differential apoptosis and protein localization between <i>SLK</i> isoforms in metastatic melanoma. We cluster isoform expression data and identify subgroups that correlate with genomic subtypes and anatomic tumor locations. Notably, distinct DE and DIR patterns separate samples with <i>BRAF</i> hotspot mutations and <i>(N/K/H)RAS</i> hotspot mutations, the latter of which lacks effective kinase inhibitor treatments. DE in <i>RAS</i> mutants concentrates in CMGC kinases (a group including cell cycle and splicing regulators) rather than RTKs as in <i>BRAF</i> mutants. Furthermore, isoforms in the <i>RAS</i> kinase subgroup show enrichment for cancer-related processes such as angiogenesis and cell migration. Our results reveal a new approach to therapeutic target identification and demonstrate how different mutational subtypes may respond differently to treatments highlighting possible new driver events in cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrated computational and in vivo models reveal Key Insights into macrophage behavior during bone healing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Etienne Baratchart, Chen Hao Lo, Conor C. Lynch, David Basanta</p>

Myeloid-derived monocyte and macrophages are key cells in the bone that contribute to remodeling and injury repair. However, their temporal polarization status and control of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts responses is largely unknown. In this study, we focused on two aspects of monocyte/macrophage dynamics and polarization states over time: 1) the injury-triggered pro- and anti-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages temporal profiles, 2) the contributions of pro- versus anti-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages in coordinating healing response. Bone healing is a complex multicellular dynamic process. While traditional <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experimentation may capture the behavior of select populations with high resolution, they cannot simultaneously track the behavior of multiple populations. To address this, we have used an integrated coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based framework describing multiple cellular species to <i>in vivo</i> bone injury data in order to identify and test various hypotheses regarding bone cell populations dynamics. Our approach allowed us to infer several biological insights including, but not limited to,: 1) anti-inflammatory macrophages are key for early osteoclast inhibition and pro-inflammatory macrophage suppression, 2) pro-inflammatory macrophages are involved in osteoclast bone resorptive activity, whereas osteoblasts promote osteoclast differentiation, 3) Pro-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages rise during two expansion waves, which can be explained by the anti-inflammatory macrophages-mediated inhibition phase between the two waves. In addition, we further tested the robustness of the mathematical model by comparing simulation results to an independent experimental dataset. Taken together, this novel comprehensive mathematical framework allowed us to identify biological mechanisms that best recapitulate bone injury data and that explain the coupled cellular population dynamics involved in the process. Furthermore, our hypothesis testing methodology could be used in other contexts to decipher mechanisms in complex multicellular processes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Feature blindness: A challenge for understanding and modelling visual object recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gaurav Malhotra, Marin Dujmović, Jeffrey S. Bowers</p>

Humans rely heavily on the shape of objects to recognise them. Recently, it has been argued that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can also show a shape-bias, provided their learning environment contains this bias. This has led to the proposal that CNNs provide good mechanistic models of shape-bias and, more generally, human visual processing. However, it is also possible that humans and CNNs show a shape-bias for very different reasons, namely, shape-bias in humans may be a consequence of architectural and cognitive constraints whereas CNNs show a shape-bias as a consequence of learning the statistics of the environment. We investigated this question by exploring shape-bias in humans and CNNs when they learn in a novel environment. We observed that, in this new environment, humans (i) focused on shape and overlooked many non-shape features, even when non-shape features were more diagnostic, (ii) learned based on only one out of multiple predictive features, and (iii) failed to learn when global features, such as shape, were absent. This behaviour contrasted with the predictions of a statistical inference model with no priors, showing the strong role that shape-bias plays in human feature selection. It also contrasted with CNNs that (i) preferred to categorise objects based on non-shape features, and (ii) increased reliance on these non-shape features as they became more predictive. This was the case even when the CNN was pre-trained to have a shape-bias and the convolutional backbone was frozen. These results suggest that shape-bias has a different source in humans and CNNs: while learning in CNNs is driven by the statistical properties of the environment, humans are highly constrained by their previous biases, which suggests that cognitive constraints play a key role in how humans learn to recognise novel objects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Metacognition and mentalizing are associated with distinct neural representations of decision uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shaohan Jiang, Sidong Wang, Xiaohong Wan</p>

Metacognition and mentalizing are both associated with meta-level mental state representations. Conventionally, metacognition refers to monitoring one’s own cognitive processes, while mentalizing refers to monitoring others’ cognitive processes. However, this self-other dichotomy is insufficient to delineate the 2 high-level mental processes. We here used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to systematically investigate the neural representations of different levels of decision uncertainty in monitoring different targets (the current self, the past self [PS], and others) performing a perceptual decision-making task. Our results reveal diverse formats of internal mental state representations of decision uncertainty in mentalizing, separate from the associations with external cue information. External cue information was commonly represented in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) across the mentalizing tasks. However, the internal mental states of decision uncertainty attributed to others were uniquely represented in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), rather than the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) that also represented the object-level mental states of decision inaccuracy attributed to others. Further, the object-level and meta-level mental states of decision uncertainty, when attributed to the PS, were represented in the precuneus and the lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), respectively. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) represented currently experienced decision uncertainty in metacognition, and also uncertainty about the estimated decision uncertainty (estimate uncertainty), but not the estimated decision uncertainty per se in mentalizing. Hence, our findings identify neural signatures to clearly delineate metacognition and mentalizing and further imply distinct neural computations on internal mental states of decision uncertainty during metacognition and mentalizing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Delayed treatment of tuberculosis of the elbow joint [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is known to occur in the musculoskeletal system, including the elbow joints. These cases are rarely found because the signs and symptoms are not specific to extrapulmonary TB or other diseases. We report a case of a 24-year-old male, who complained about pain in his left elbow and noticed swelling. Initially, he complained about pain all over his left arm, after several reflexology massages to alleviate his toothache. However, instead of seeking medical treatment, he visited a traditional massage therapist every week without improvement in his left arm pain including his left elbow for almost one year. Examination showed skin perforation with discharge. He also had fever during the first few days when the elbow became swollen. Weight loss and a decreased appetite were also noticed by the patient. The patient went to the orthopedic department and underwent surgery. Radiological examination indicated bone erosion on the left humerus and radius, while posteroanterior chest X-ray did not show any abnormality. Histopathological examinations from biopsy and fluid aspiration showed granulomas and datia Langhans cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found on acid-fast bacteria smear and culture. The patient was administered multidrug tuberculosis therapy, which consisted of two months of an intensive phase and seven months of a continuation phase, in accordance with the World Health Organization’s guidelines for extrapulmonary tuberculosis treatment. He has currently undergone the continuation phase of the treatment and his condition has improved. Early detection of tuberculosis of the elbow can prevent damage to joint structure and impairment of joint function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Internet addiction during COVID-19 restricted movement period: A cross-sectional study from Bangladesh [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The restricted movement period related to COVID-19 has presumably contributed to the deterioration of the Internet addiction crisis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of Internet addiction and identify the factors associated with the increase in severity of Internet addiction among the general population of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 related restricted movement period. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in Bangladesh from September 20 to October 5, 2020, and 315 Bangladeshi adults were included in the study. We used Young’s Internet Addiction Scale to assess the prevalence of Internet addiction and identified the factors associated with the increase in severity of Internet addiction during the restricted movement period using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The overall prevalence of Internet addiction was 39.7% among the general population of Bangladesh during the restricted movement period. Almost 75% of the respondents reported increased time spent on recreational use of the Internet during the period of interest, and 48.5% of the respondents reported increases in the severity of Internet addiction. In logistic regression analyses, the increase in severity of Internet addiction was found to be significantly associated with social class, occupation, sleeping hours, and increased time spent on recreational use of the internet (p < 0.05). Watching movies/series was the main activity of the respondents during the restricted movement period. Conclusion: Our study reported an increase in the prevalence of Internet addiction among the general population of Bangladesh during the restricted movement period. Social class, occupation, sleeping hours, and increased time spent on recreational use were the significant determinants of the increase in severity of Internet addiction. The policymakers should undertake tailored policies to prevent people from being victims of the consequences of psychological issues in the long run.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">DeepReGraph co-clusters temporal gene expression and cis-regulatory elements through heterogeneous graph representation learning [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This work presents DeepReGraph, a novel method for co-clustering genes and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) into candidate regulatory networks. Gene expression data, as well as data from three CRE activity markers from a publicly available dataset of mouse fetal heart tissue, were used for DeepReGraph concept proofing. In this study we used open chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq experiments, as well as H3K27ac and H3K27me3 histone marks as CREs activity markers. However, this method can be executed with other sets of markers. We modelled all data sources as a heterogeneous graph and adapted a state-of-the-art representation learning algorithm to produce a low-dimensional and easy-to-cluster embedding of genes and CREs. Deep graph auto-encoders and an adaptive-sparsity generative model are the algorithmic core of DeepReGraph. The main contribution of our work is the design of proper combination rules for the heterogeneous gene expression and CRE activity data and the computational encoding of well-known gene expression regulatory mechanisms into a suitable objective function for graph embedding. We showed that the co-clusters of genes and CREs in the final embedding shed light on developmental regulatory mechanisms in mouse fetal-heart tissue. Such clustering could not be achieved by using only gene expression data. Function enrichment analysis proves that the genes in the co-clusters are involved in distinct biological processes. The enriched transcription factor binding sites in CREs prioritize the candidate transcript factors which drive the temporal changes in gene expression. Consequently, we conclude that DeepReGraph could foster hypothesis-driven tissue development research from high-throughput expression and epigenomic data. Full source code and data are available on the DeepReGraph GitHub project.

                Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder in the older population. In this work, we have developed a formulation of orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) containing Centella asiatica (CA) encapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with rapid disintegration and dissolution, thereby providing greater convenience and ease of use to older patients with PD or dysphagia. Methods: The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of CA compounds were evaluated using QikProp module of Schrödinger. CA-SLNs were prepared using hot homogenization method. The physicochemical properties and quality control of the pre-compressed powder were characterized. The direct compression method was used to prepare ODTs, and post-compression physical properties were evaluated. Results: In silico study of ADMET properties revealed the CA compounds can follow the criteria for an orally active drug and are within the standard range in terms of "Rule of Five" and "Rule of Three”. The characteristics of CA-SLNs developed in a lipid-based nanocarrier showed monodispersed particles with an average particle size of about 37.91±1.55 nm, zeta potential of -10.27±1.37 mV, encapsulation efficiency, and loading capacity of 95.07±1.14%, and 3.99±0.06%, respectively. The results obtained for the pre-compression characterization showed that the CA-SLNs powder mixture had excellent flowability properties and compressibility. Furthermore, these results affected the physical properties of CA-SLNs ODTs with a disintegration time of 14.5s, the acceptance value of content uniformity was 3.2%, and the in vitro dissolution test fulfilled the tolerance limits recommended in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) monograph. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that CA-SLNs ODTs developed with lipid-based nanocarriers can be considered an alternative delivery system to protect the active compound from instability while enhancing permeability through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and can be used in the management of PD in older patients with dysphagia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strategies of promoting sustainable use and conservation of indigenous chicken breeds in Zambia: lessons from low-income countries [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                This review explores innovative and sustainable strategies for conservation and use of village or indigenous chickens (IC) ( Gallus domesticus) in Zambia with lessons in  Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Small scale farmers (SSF) have kept IC for hundreds of years to meet their households’ nutritional needs, incomes, social-cultural and religious uses. The commitment exhibited by SSF to keeping indigenous animals has made them the major custodians of essential animal genetic resources in most low-income regions. Between 1991 and 2012, private breeders invested over US$95 million in Zambia’s commercial poultry sector resulting in over 100% increase in the annual production of day-old chicks to 65 million. However, high production costs and low market access hindered the participation of rural farmers hence their continued dependence on IC breeds. The future of IC genetic resources is threatened due to their rapid erosion. In the 2015 biodiversity status report, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, an international body of the United Nations highlighted that over 3.5% of chicken breeds were extinct, nearly 33% were at high risk, and over 67% were of unknown status. Poultry diseases, lack of sustainable conservation strategies and poor use have significantly contributed to these losses. For example, in 2012, 60% of village chickens were reportedly diseased in parts of SSA. If these challenges are not mitigated, the loss of IC genetic resources and the adverse impact on rural communities is inevitable. Further, future research and breeding programs on commercial chickens may be limited due to the erosion of IC genetic resources. This paper reviews lessons and contributes to previous studies that demonstrated how community-based breeding programs and researcher-community-stakeholder engagements potentially enhanced sustainability, adoption of innovative ideas and conservation of local animal genetic resources in selected low-income countries. Further, suggest strategies to promote judicious use and conservation of IC breeds in Zambia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Duration of dry and humidified incubation of single-step embryo culture medium and oxygen tension during sham culture do not alter metabolomics signature [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extended embryo culture using single-step medium gained popularity in clinical in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, there are concerns about the degradation of unstable medium components and their negative effects on the developing embryos. Further, dry-incubation can increase osmolality, which can in-turn enhance the concentration of constituents of the media and their stability. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the immediate changes in the culture media metabolites in relation to clinically comparable situations such as single-step extended embryo culture and use of dry and humidified-incubation in two-different gaseous conditions. Methods: Commercially available single-step medium was sham-cultured in droplets under oil in two different conditions viz. dry (37°C; 6%CO2; 5%O2) and humidified (37°C; 6% CO2; atmospheric O2) for 0h, 72h, and 120h intervals. Droplets were subjected to the sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based profiling using 800 MHz NMR equipped with a cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7mm) probe. Metabolomic signatures between the two groups were comprehensively assessed. Results: A total of ten amino acids and four energy substrates were identified from the culture medium. Metabolite levels showed a non-significant increase in the dry-incubation group at 72h and then declined at 120h. Humidified incubation had no effects on the level of the metabolite until 120h. No significant differences in the levels of metabolites were observed between the dry and humidified-groups at various time-points tested. Conclusions: A non-significant variation in the levels of metabolites observed in the dry-incubation of single-step medium most unlikely to influence a clinical outcome. However, the impact of these subtle changes on the (epi)genetic integrity of the embryos in a clinical set-up to be addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Incentives for pregnant mothers during antenatal care for better maternal and neonatal health outcomes in low and middle income countries: A systematic review protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Universal access to maternal new-born and child healthcare services (MNCH) is detrimental for attainment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) three pertaining to promotion of health at all ages. Incentivization in the form of cash, vouchers, and goods have been used as part of strategies to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes around the world. However, there exists uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of various incentive-based programmes targeted for pregnant mothers in low- and middle-income countries during their antenatal period. Methods: We will search six electronic databases, namely the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase in addition to Google Scholar. Manual searching of the reference lists of included studies will also be done. The reporting of this protocol will follow the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statement [29]. Only interventional studies that follow randomized, quasi randomized, and cluster randomized controlled study designs will be included. A three-stage screening process will be adopted to select articles. Risk of bias for the included studies will be assessed using the tools and criteria specified in the Cochrane handbook. In addition, the GRADE approach will be used to assess the quality of evidence for the maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Conclusion: This review of trials is essential to inform the effectiveness of incentive-based programmes targeted for pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries. It will help the policy makers to utilise the resources more effectively and to integrate the evidence based public health initiatives into the health system. This can also help build the continuum of care financial packages for all pregnant women.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify the rates of neurological events following administration of mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna) or adenovirus vector (Janssen) vaccines in the U.S.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used publicly available data from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) collected between January 1, 2021 and June 14, 2021. All free text symptoms that were reported within 42 days of vaccine administration were manually reviewed and grouped into 36 individual neurological diagnostic categories. Post-vaccination neurological event rates were compared between vaccine types and to age-matched baseline incidence rates in the U.S. and rates of neurological events following COVID.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 306,907,697 COVID vaccine doses administered during the study timeframe, 314,610 (0.1%) people reported any adverse event and 105,214 (0.03%) reported neurological adverse events in a median of 1 day (IQR0-3) from inoculation. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) occurred in fewer than 1 per 1,000,000 doses. Significantly more neurological adverse events were reported following Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccination compared to either Pfizer-BioNtech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1,273; 0.15% vs 0.03% vs 0.03% of doses, respectively, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). The observed-to-expected ratios for GBS, CVT and seizure following Janssen vaccination were ≥1.5-fold higher than background rates. However, the rate of neurological events after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was up to 617-fold higher than after COVID vaccination.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Reports of serious neurological events following COVID vaccination are rare. GBS, CVT and seizure may occur at higher than background rates following Janssen vaccination. Despite this, rates of neurological complications following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are up to 617-fold higher than after COVID vaccination. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:756–771</p>

Following the third vaccine dose, patients who are low or nonresponders following initial vaccination did not increase antibody titers. In healthy controls and ocrelizumab-treated pwMS, cellular response decreased 6 months after initial vaccination and increased significantly after the third dose.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to estimate the time to recovery of command-following and associations between hypoxemia with time to recovery of command-following.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study during the initial surge of the United Statesʼ pandemic (March–July 2020) we estimate the time from intubation to recovery of command-following, using Kaplan Meier cumulative-incidence curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients were included if they were admitted to 1 of 3 hospitals because of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), required endotracheal intubation for at least 7 days, and experienced impairment of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score &lt;6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five hundred seventy-one patients of the 795 patients recovered command-following. The median time to recovery of command-following was 30 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27–32 days). Median time to recovery of command-following increased by 16 days for patients with at least one episode of an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) value ≤55 mmHg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and 25% recovered ≥10 days after cessation of mechanical ventilation. The time to recovery of command-following  was associated with hypoxemia (PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤55 mmHg hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46–0.68; PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤70 HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.91), and each additional day of hypoxemia decreased the likelihood of recovery, accounting for confounders including sedation. These findings were confirmed among patients without any imagining evidence of structural brain injury (n = 199), and in a non-overlapping second surge cohort (N = 427, October 2020 to April 2021).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Survivors of severe COVID-19 commonly recover consciousness weeks after cessation of mechanical ventilation. Long recovery periods are associated with more severe hypoxemia. This relationship is not explained by sedation or brain injury identified on clinical imaging and should inform decisions about life-sustaining therapies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The encephalitis associated with antibodies against contactin-associated proteinlike 2 (CASPR2) is presumably antibody-mediated, but the antibody effects and whether they cause behavioral alterations are not well known. Here, we used a mouse model of patients' immunoglobulin G (IgG) transfer and super-resolution microscopy to demonstrate the antibody pathogenicity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IgG from patients with anti-CASPR2 encephalitis or healthy controls was infused into the cerebroventricular system of mice. The levels and colocalization of CASPR2 with transient axonal glycoprotein 1 (TAG1) were determined with stimulated emission depletion microscopy (40–70μm lateral resolution). Hippocampal clusters of Kv1.1 voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) and GluA1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) were quantified with confocal microscopy. Behavioral alterations were assessed with standard behavioral paradigms. Cultured neurons were used to determine the levels of intracellular CASPR2 and TAG1 after exposure to patients' IgG.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Infusion of patients' IgG, but not controls' IgG, caused memory impairment along with hippocampal reduction of surface CASPR2 clusters and decreased CASPR2/TAG1 colocalization. In cultured neurons, patients' IgG led to an increase of intracellular CASPR2 without affecting TAG1, suggesting selective CASPR2 internalization. Additionally, mice infused with patients' IgG showed decreased levels of Kv1.1 and GluA1 (two CASPR2-regulated proteins). All these alterations and the memory deficit reverted to normal after removing patients' IgG.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IgG from patients with anti-CASPR2 encephalitis causes reversible memory impairment, inhibits the interaction of CASPR2/TAG1, and decreases the levels of CASPR2 and related proteins (VGKC, AMPAR). These findings fulfill the postulates of antibody-mediated disease and provide a biological basis for antibody-removing treatment approaches. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:801–813</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this paper was to explore the utility of time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>)-based target mismatch on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in predicting radiological and clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) selected for endovascular treatment (EVT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with AIS underwent CTP within 24 hours from onset followed by EVT. Critically hypoperfused tissue and ischemic core volumes were automatically calculated using T<sub>max</sub> thresholds &gt;9.5 seconds and &gt;16 seconds, respectively. The difference between T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 9.5 seconds and T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volumes and the ratio between T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 9.5 seconds and T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volumes were considered ischemic penumbra and T<sub>max</sub> mismatch ratio, respectively. Final infarct volume (FIV) was measured on follow-up non-contrast computed tomography (CT) at 24 hours. Favorable clinical outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2. Predictors of FIV and outcome were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Optimal T<sub>max</sub> volumes for identification of good outcome was defined using receiver operating curves.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 393 patients were included, of whom 298 (75.8%) achieved successful recanalization and 258 (65.5%) achieved good outcome. In multivariable analyses, all T<sub>max</sub> parameters were independent predictors of FIV and outcome. T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume had the strongest association with FIV (beta coefficient = 0.596 <i>p</i> &lt;0.001) and good outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96 per 1 ml increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–0.97, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume had the highest discriminative ability for good outcome (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.842–0.909). A T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume of ≤67 ml best identified subjects with favorable outcome (sensitivity = 0.91 and specificity = 0.73).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>T<sub>max</sub> target mismatch predicts radiological and clinical outcomes in patients with AIS with LVO receiving EVT within 24 hours from onset. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:878–888</p>

<p>We addressed this issue using two complementary systems: (1) human skin from patients with diabetic neuropathy and to (2) a coculture model of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons in the context of intrinsic neuronal factor and extrinsic microenvironmental collagen and its biosynthetic pathways.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In diabetic neuropathy, the skin innervation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFd), a measure of sensory nerve degeneration, was reduced with similar expression of a growth associated protein 43, a marker of nerve regeneration. In contrast, the content and packing of collagen in the diabetic skin became more rigid than the control skin. Sec31a, a protein that regulates the collagen biosynthetic pathway, was upregulated and inversely correlated with IENFd. In the cell model, activated HDFs exposed to high-glucose medium enhanced the expression of Sec31a and collagen I through the activation of transforming growth factor β, a profibrotic molecule. Sec31a upregulation impaired neurite outgrowth. This effect was reversed by silencing Sec31a expression and neurite outgrowth was resumed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The current study provides evidence that Sec31a plays a key role in inhibiting nerve regeneration in diabetic neuropathy. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:821–833</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Greater Diffusion Restriction in White Matter in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Alzheimer's continuum is biologically defined by beta-amyloid deposition, which at the earliest stages is superimposed upon white matter degeneration in aging. However, the extent to which these co-occurring changes is characterized is relatively underexplored. The goal of this study was to use diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and biophysical modeling to detect and describe amyloid-related white matter changes in preclinical Alzheimer disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitively unimpaired participants ages 45 to 85 years completed brain magnetic resonance imaging, amyloid positron emission tomography (florbetapir), neuropsychological testing, and other clinical measures at baseline in a cohort study. We tested whether beta-amyloid-negative (AB−) and -positive (AB+) participants differed on DKI-based conventional (ie, fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], mean kurtosis) and modeling (ie, axonal water fraction [AWF], extra-axonal radial diffusivity [<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>]) metrics, and whether these metrics were associated with other biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found significantly greater diffusion restriction (higher FA/AWF, lower MD/<i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub>) in white matter in AB+ than AB− (partial <i>η</i>
<sup>2</sup> =0.08–0.19), more notably in the extra-axonal space within primarily late myelinating tracts. Diffusion metrics predicted amyloid status incrementally over age (area under the curve = 0.84) with modest yet selective associations, where AWF (a marker of axonal density) correlated with speed/executive functions and neurodegeneration, whereas <i>D</i>
<sub>e,⊥</sub> (a marker of gliosis/myelin repair) correlated with amyloid deposition and white matter hyperintensity volume.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support prior evidence of a nonmonotonic change in diffusion behavior, where an early increase in diffusion restriction is hypothesized to reflect inflammation and myelin repair prior to an ensuing decrease in diffusion restriction, indicating glial and neuronal degeneration.

                <p><i>APOE</i> is the strongest genetic factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A specific conformation of the ApoE protein is present in amyloid-β (Aβ) containing plaques. Immunotherapy targeting ApoE in plaques reduces brain Aβ deposits in mice. Here, we evaluated the effects of the anti-human APOE antibody HAE-4 on amyloid plaques, Aβ-mediated tau seeding and spreading, and neuritic dystrophy in the 5XFAD amyloid mice expressing human ApoE4. HAE-4 reduced Aβ plaques as well as Aβ-driven tau seeding/spreading and neuritic dystrophy. These results demonstrate that HAE-4 may provide therapeutic effects on amyloid removal and Aβ driven downstream consequences such as tauopathy. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:847–852</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>As SARS-CoV-2 is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, a plasma system for quantifying central nervous system proteins in living humans was used to investigate neuropathogenic mechanisms of long-COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins (MPs) in enriched plasma neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) were quantified in resolved acute COVID-19 without post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), PASC without neuropsychiatric manifestations (NP), PASC with NP and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NDEV and ADEV mean levels of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were higher in all PASC sub-groups than controls, but only N levels were higher in PASC with than without NP. Exosome marker CD81-normalized NDEV mean levels of subunit 6 of MP respiratory chain complex I and subunit 10 of complex III, and neuroprotective MPs Humanin and mitochondrial open-reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c (MOTS-c) all were decreased significantly in PASC with NP but not in PASC without NP relative to controls. NDEV levels of MPs voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1) were decreased in PASC without and with NP, whereas those of calcium channel MPs mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX) and leucine zipper EF-hand containing transmembrane 1 protein (LETM1) were decreased only in PASC with NP. ADEV levels of MCU and NCLX only were increased in PASC without and with NP.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Abnormal NDEV and ADEV levels of SARS-CoV-2 N and S1 protein and MPs correlate with NP and may be biomarkers for long-COVID prognostics and therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:772–781</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Caffeine Consumption and Dementia: Are Lewy Bodies the Link?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the association between caffeine intake and cognitive impairment. Caffeine-neuropathology correlations and interactions with lifestyle and genetic factors impacting caffeine metabolism and response were also tested.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 888 participants aged 59+ years from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and 303,887 participants aged 55+ years from the UK Biobank (UKB). MAP participants took part in annual cognitive testing. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. A subset provided postmortem tissue for neuropathologic evaluation for common age-related diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease [AD], Lewy bodies, and vascular). For UKB, dementia was determined by linked hospital and death records. Self-reported caffeine intake was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires in both cohorts. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR), regression, and mixed models were used to examine associations of caffeine intake with incident dementia, cognitive decline, and neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In MAP, compared to ≤100 mg/day, caffeine intake &gt;100 mg/day was associated with a significantly higher HR (95% confidence interval [CI]) of all-cause (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.03–1.76) and AD (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07–1.85) dementia. Caffeine intake was not associated with cognitive decline. In UKB, compared to ≤100 mg/day, the HRs (95% CI) of all-cause dementia for consuming 100 ≤ 200, 200 ≤ 300, 300 ≤ 400, and &gt; 400 mg/day were 0.83 (95% CI = 0.72–0.94), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64–0.85), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64–0.85), and 0.92 (95% CI = 0.79–1.08), respectively. Similar results were observed for Alzheimer's dementia. In MAP, caffeine intake was inversely associated with postmortem Lewy bodies but no other age-related pathologies. Caffeine intake &gt;100 mg/day was associated with lower neocortical type Lewy bodies (odds ratio (95%CI): 0.40 (95% CI = 0.21–0.75).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Caffeine intake was inconsistently associated with clinical dementia; potentially explained by cohort differences in underlying dementia etiology. Lewy bodies may link caffeine to lower risk in some persons. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:834–846</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the development of cellular and humoral immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with MS aged 18 to 60 years were evaluated for anti-nucleocapsid and anti-Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody with electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay; antibody responses to Spike protein, RBD, N-terminal domain with multiepitope bead-based immunoassays (MBI); live virus immunofluorescence-based microneutralization assay; T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike using TruCulture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and IL-2 and IFNγ ELISpot assays. Assay results were compared by DMT class. Spearman correlation and multivariate analyses were performed to examine associations between immunologic responses and infection severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between January 6, 2021, and July 21, 2021, 389 patients with MS were recruited (mean age 40.3 years; 74% women; 62% non-White). Most common DMTs were ocrelizumab (OCR)—40%; natalizumab —17%, Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulators −12%; and 15% untreated. One hundred seventy-seven patients (46%) had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 130 had symptomatic infection, and 47 were asymptomatic. Antibody responses were markedly attenuated in OCR compared with other groups (<i>p</i> ≤0.0001). T-cell responses (IFNγ) were decreased in S1P (<i>p</i> = 0.03), increased in natalizumab (<i>p</i> &lt;0.001), and similar in other DMTs, including OCR. Cellular and humoral responses were moderately correlated in both OCR (<i>r</i> = 0.45, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and non-OCR (<i>r</i> = 0.64, <i>p</i> &lt;0.0001). Immune responses did not differ by race/ethnicity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical course was mostly non-severe and similar across DMTs; 7% (9/130) were hospitalized.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DMTs had differential effects on humoral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune responses did not correlate with COVID-19 clinical severity in this relatively young and nondisabled group of patients with MS. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:782–795</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intrathecal Immunoglobulin M synthesis (IgM<sub>Intrathecal Fraction (IF)</sub>
<sup>+</sup>) and spinal MRI lesions are both strong independent predictors of higher disease activity and severity in multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated whether IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> is associated with spinal cord manifestation and higher neuroaxonal damage in early MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 122 patients with a first demyelinating event associations between (1) spinal versus (vs) non-spinal clinical syndrome (2) spinal vs cerebral T2-weighted (T2w) and (3) contrast-enhancing (CE) lesion counts with IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (vs IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) or IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (vs IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) were investigated by logistic regression adjusted for age and sex, respectively. For serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) analysis patients were categorized for presence or absence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB), IgG<sub>IF</sub> and IgM<sub>IF</sub> (&gt;0% vs 0%, respectively): (1) OCGB<sup>−</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; (2) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; (3) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; and (4) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>. Associations between categories 2 to 4 vs category 1 with sNfL concentrations were analyzed by robust linear regression, adjusted for sex and MRI parameters.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with a spinal syndrome had a 8.36-fold higher odds of IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (95%CI 3.03–23.03; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Each spinal T2w lesion (odds Ratio 1.39; 1.02–1.90; <i>p</i> = 0.037) and CE lesion (OR 2.73; 1.22–6.09; <i>p</i> = 0.014) was associated with an increased risk of IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (but not of IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>); this was not the case for cerebral lesions. OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> category patients showed highest sNfL levels (estimate:1.80; 0.55–3.06; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Intrathecal IgM synthesis is strongly associated with spinal manifestation and independently more pronounced neuroaxonal injury in early MS, suggesting a distinct clinical phenotype and pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:814–820</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to determine the pattern of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) related to postmortem Lewy body disease (LBD) pathology in clinical Alzheimer disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>FDG-PET scans were analyzed in 62 autopsy-confirmed patients and 110 controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on neuropathologic evaluations on Braak stage for neurofibrillary tangle, Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD score for neuritic plaque, and Lewy-related pathology, subjects were classified into AD(−)/LBD(−), AD(−)/LBD(+), AD(+)/LBD(−), and AD(+)/LBD(+) groups. The association between postmortem LBD and AD pathologies and antemortem brain metabolism was evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD and LBD pathologies had significant interaction effects to decrease metabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral caudate, putamen, basal frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex in addition to the left side of the entorhinal cortex and amygdala, and significant interaction effects to increase metabolism in the bilateral parietal and occipital cortices. LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the cerebellar vermis, bilateral putamen, anterior cingulate cortex, and basal frontal cortex, corresponding to the Lewy body-related hypermetabolic patterns. AD pathology was associated with hypometabolism in the bilateral hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex regardless of LBD pathology, whereas LBD pathology was associated with hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamen and anterior cingulate cortex regardless of AD pathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Postmortem LBD and AD pathologies had significant interaction effects on the antemortem brain metabolism in clinical AD patients. Specific metabolic patterns related to AD and LBD pathologies could be elucidated when simultaneously considering the two pathologies. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:853–863</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Reassessing synaptic adhesion pathways</a></h4>

              
                Multiple synaptic adhesion proteins are thought to collectively define the properties of specific synapses and thereby shape the architectures of neural circuits. Growing evidence supports a molecular model in which a set of central hub proteins interacts with a vast number of other proteins to organize multifarious synaptic adhesion pathways. However, several fundamental open questions remain, partly owing to drawbacks in current approaches and interpretations. In this opinion, we provide an overview of synaptic adhesion pathways, underscoring open questions to be addressed in future work, and highlighting approaches for advancing understanding of synaptic adhesion processes.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Functional interplay between central and autonomic nervous systems in human fear conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Historically, studies on the neural basis of fear conditioning have emphasized the role of the central nervous system. However, there is growing evidence for the role of the autonomic nervous system in human fear conditioning. Here, we provide an overview of the sophisticated anatomical–functional interplay between the prefrontal cortex and heart-related dynamics in human fear conditioning and propose a theoretical model to conceptualize these psychophysiological processes, the neurovisceral integration model of fear (NVI-f).

                Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by deficiencies in telomere maintenance leading to very short telomeres and the premature onset of certain age-related diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis (PF). PF is thought to derive from epithelial failure, particularly that of type II alveolar epithelial (AT2) cells, which are highly dependent on Wnt signaling during development and adult regeneration. We use human iPSC-derived AT2 (iAT2) cells to model how short telomeres affect AT2 cells. Cultured DC mutant iAT2 cells accumulate shortened, uncapped telomeres and manifest defects in the growth of alveolospheres, hallmarks of senescence, and apparent defects in Wnt signaling. The GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR99021, which mimics the output of canonical Wnt signaling, enhances telomerase activity and rescues the defects. These findings support further investigation of Wnt agonists as potential therapies for DC related pathologies.

                A developing understanding suggests that spatial compartmentalisation in pancreatic β cells is critical in controlling insulin secretion. To investigate the mechanisms, we have developed live-cell sub-cellular imaging methods using the mouse organotypic pancreatic slice. We demonstrate that the organotypic pancreatic slice, when compared with isolated islets, preserves intact β cell structure, and enhances glucose dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and insulin secretion. Using the slice technique, we have discovered the essential role of local activation of integrins and the downstream component, focal adhesion kinase, in regulating β cells. Integrins and focal adhesion kinase are exclusively activated at the β cell capillary interface and using <i>in situ</i> and <i>in vitro</i> models we show their activation both positions presynaptic scaffold proteins, like ELKS and liprin, and regulates glucose dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and insulin secretion. We conclude that focal adhesion kinase orchestrates the final steps of glucose dependent insulin secretion within the restricted domain where β cells contact the islet capillaries.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CLUH controls astrin-1 expression to couple mitochondrial metabolism to cell cycle progression</a></h4>

              
                Proliferating cells undergo metabolic changes in synchrony with cell cycle progression and cell division. Mitochondria provide fuel, metabolites, and ATP during different phases of the cell cycle, however it is not completely understood how mitochondrial function and the cell cycle are coordinated. CLUH is a post-transcriptional regulator of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and several metabolic pathways. Here, we show a role of CLUH in regulating the expression of astrin, which is involved in metaphase to anaphase progression, centrosome integrity, and mTORC1 inhibition. We find that CLUH binds both the <i>SPAG5</i> mRNA and its product astrin, and controls the synthesis and the stability of the full-length astrin-1 isoform. We show that CLUH interacts with astrin-1 specifically during interphase. Astrin-depleted cells show mTORC1 hyperactivation and enhanced anabolism. On the other hand, cells lacking CLUH show decreased astrin levels and increased mTORC1 signaling, but cannot sustain anaplerotic and anabolic pathways. In absence of CLUH, cells fail to grow during G1, and progress faster through the cell cycle, indicating dysregulated matching of growth, metabolism and cell cycling. Our data reveal a role of CLUH in coupling growth signaling pathways and mitochondrial metabolism with cell cycle progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia differ in maturation and synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of the world population. Genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors are known to play a role in this psychiatric disorder. While there is a high concordance in monozygotic twins, about half of twin pairs are discordant for schizophrenia. We characterized human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hippocampal neurons from two pairs of monozygotic twins that are discordant for a schizophrenia diagnosis. We compared the affected and the non-affected siblings and compared all of them to twin sets where none of the siblings suffered from schizophrenia. We found that the neurons derived from the schizophrenia patients were less arborized, were hypoexcitable with immature spike features, and exhibited a significant reduction in synaptic activity with dysregulation in synapse-related genes. Interestingly, the neurons derived from the co-twin siblings who did not have schizophrenia formed another distinct group that was different from the neurons in the group of the affected twin siblings but also different from the neurons in the group of the control twins. The neurons in the unaffected co-twin group were also less arborized than the neurons from controls but more arborized than those from affected siblings. Some of their spike features were immature (but less immature than neurons derived from the affected siblings). Importantly, their synaptic activity was not affected. Since schizophrenia is a genetically complex disorder, our twin study allows the measurement of neuronal phenotypes with a similar genetic background. The differences between the siblings may arise due to changes that occurred after the split of the egg into twins. Therefore, our study confirms that dysregulation of synaptic pathways, as well as changes in the rate of synaptic events, distinguishes between individuals affected with schizophrenia and unaffected individuals, even in those having a very similar genetic background.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A gain-of-function recurrent missense variant leads to a GABAergic/glutamatergic imbalance in a forebrain organoid model of PACS1 syndrome</a></h4>

              
                PACS1 syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities resulting from a de novo p.R203W variant in phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS1). PACS1 is known to play roles in both the endosomal pathway and nucleus, but little is known about how this variant affects the developing nervous system and patients have few therapeutic options. Here, we used stem cell-derived forebrain organoids to show that PACS1(+/R203W) cells share convergent molecular features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through a gain-of-function mechanism. These features include an aberrant propensity towards GABAergic differentiation, increased inhibitory synaptic density, and impaired expression of an ASD-specific gene network enriched at synapses. This work is the first to investigate the impact of the p.R203W variant on the developing brain and suggests a therapy that either clears p.R203W PACS1 or targets convergent pathological mechanisms of ASD could be beneficial for patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Agency as a Bridge to Form Associative Memories</a></h4>

              
                The perception of agency occurs when individuals feel their decisions exert control over their environment. While agency can increase memory for items, most real-life situations are more complex. The decisions we make not only affect the item we act upon, but all the other items in direct proximity of our decisions. Here, we examined how an individual's agency to influence a situation affects their ability to learn associations between items that occur prior to and after making a decision. In our paradigm, participants were told they were playing a game show where they had to help a trial unique "contestant" choose between three doors. On "agency" trials, participants were allowed to pick any door they wanted. On "forced-choice" trials, participants were instructed to select a door that was highlighted. They then saw the outcome, a "prize" that was behind the selected door. Across two studies, participants show enhanced memory for contestants they saw in agency vs forced-choice trials. Memory benefits also extended to contestant - door and door - prize associations in both studies. Study 2 found this effect in the contestant - prize association. Notably, we found that agency also shaped the representation of memories such that they were stored as integrated sequences rather than individual relational pairs. Together, these data suggest agency over a situation leads to enhanced memory for all items in that situation. This enhanced binding for items may be occurring by the formation of causal links when an individual has agency over their learning environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes of oscillatory and aperiodic neuronal activity in working memory following anaesthesia: a prospective observational study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anaesthesia and surgery can lead to cognitive decline, especially in the elderly. However, to date, the neurophysiological underpinnings of perioperative cognitive decline remain unknown. Methods: We included male patients, who were 60 years or older scheduled for elective radical prostatectomy under general anaesthesia. We obtained neuropsychological (NP) tests as well as a visual match-to-sample working memory (WM) task with concomitant 62-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG) before and after surgery. Results: A total number of 26 patients completed neuropsychological assessments and EEG pre- and postoperatively. Behavioural performance declined in the neuropsychological assessment after anaesthesia (total recall; t-tests: t25 = -3.25, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.015 d = -0.902), while WM performance showed a dissociation between match and mis-match accuracy (rmANOVA: match*session F1,25 = 3.866, p = 0.060). Distinct EEG signatures tracked behavioural performance: Better performance in the NP assessment was correlated with an increase of non-oscillatory (aperiodic) activity, reflecting increased cortical activity (cluster permutation tests: total recall r = 0.66, p = 0.029, learning slope r = 0.66, p = 0.015), while WM accuracy was tracked by distinct temporally-structured oscillatory theta/alpha (7-9 Hz), low beta (14-18 Hz) and high beta/gamma (34-38 Hz) activity (cluster permutation tests: matches: p < 0.001, mis-matches: p = 0.022). Conclusions: Oscillatory and non-oscillatory (aperiodic) activity in perioperative scalp EEG recordings track distinct features of perioperative cognition. Aperiodic activity provides a novel electrophysiological biomarker to identify patients at risk for developing perioperative neurocognitive decline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient parameter calibration and real-time simulation of large scale spiking neural networks with GeNN and NEST</a></h4>

              
                Spiking neural networks (SNN) represent the state-of-the-art approach to the biologically realistic modeling of nervous system function. The systematic calibration for multiple free model parameters to achieve robust network function demands high computing power and large memory resources. Special requirements arise from closed-loop model simulation in virtual environments, and from real-time simulation in robotic application. Here, we compare two complementary approaches to efficient large scale and real-time SNN simulation. The widely used NEural Simulation Technology (NEST) parallelizes simulation across multiple CPU cores. The GPU-enhanced Neural Network (GeNN) simulator uses the highly-parallel GPU-based architecture to gain simulation speed. We quantify fixed and variable simulation costs on different hardware configurations. As benchmark model we us a spiking cortical attractor network with a topology of densely connected excitatory and inhibitory neuron clusters. We show that simulation time scales linear with the simulated biological time and, for large networks, approximately linear with the model size as dominated by the number of synaptic connections. Additional fixed costs with GeNN for model compilation are independent of model size while fixed costs with NEST for model building increase linear with model size. We demonstrate how GeNN can be used for simulating networks with up to 3, 5 million neurons (> 3 x 10 12 synapses) on a high-end GPU, and up to 250 thousand neurons (25 billion synapses) on a low-cost GPU. Real-time simulation was achieved for networks of more than 90 k neurons. We conclude that GeNN is in advantage for large networks and real-time applications while NEST plays out its strengths in a high degree of flexibility ideal for prototyping, and easy access for non-expert programmers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocytic Gi-GPCR activation enhances stimulus-evoked extracellular glutamate</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes perform critical functions in the nervous system, many of which are dependent on neurotransmitter-sensing through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, whether specific astrocytic outputs follow specific GPCR activity remains unclear, and exploring this question is critical for understanding how astrocytes ultimately influence brain function and behavior. We previously showed that astrocytic Gi-GPCR activation is sufficient to increase slow-wave neural activity (SWA) during sleep when activated in cortical astrocytes. Here, we investigate the outputs of astrocytic Gi-GPCRs, focusing on the regulation of extracellular glutamate and GABA, by combining in vivo fiber photometry recordings of the extracellular indicators iGluSnFR and iGABASnFR with astrocyte-specific chemogenetic Gi-GPCR activation. We find that Gi-GPCR activation does not change spontaneous dynamics of extracellular glutamate or GABA. However, Gi-GPCR activation does specifically increase visual stimulus-evoked extracellular glutamate. Together, these data point towards a complex relationship between astrocytic inputs and outputs in vivo that may depend on behavioral context. Further, they suggest an extracellular glutamate-specific mechanism underlying some astrocytic Gi-GPCR-dependent behaviors, including the regulation of sleep SWA.

                Subretinal transplantation of human retinal organoid-derived cells can potentially restore vision in patients with degenerative retinal diseases. How the recipient retina regulates the maturation, fate specification, and migration of transplanted donor cells is not known. Here, we transplanted human retinal organoid-derived cells into photoreceptor-deficient mice, conducted imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, and observed two main classes of graft-derived cells. The first class consisted of retinal astrocytes and brain/spinal cord-like neural precursors that were rarely observed in age-matched cultured organoids. These cells migrated from the graft into all recipient retinal layers and traveled relatively long distances. The second class consisted of retinal progenitor-derived cells, including rod and cone photoreceptors that remained in the subretinal space and matured more rapidly than photoreceptors in cultured organoids. These data suggest that the adult recipient subretinal space promotes the maturation of transplanted photoreceptors while inducing or expanding migratory cell populations that are not normally derived from retinal progenitors. These findings have important implications for the development of cell-based therapies for degenerative retinal diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for a common mechanism supporting invigoration of action selection and action execution</a></h4>

              
                The speed, or vigor, of our movements can vary depending on circumstances. For instance, it is well established that the promise of a reward leads us to make faster movements. Potential rewards also lead to lower reaction times, suggesting that the process of action selection can be similarly invigorated by reward. It has been proposed that invigoration of action selection and of action execution might occur through a common mechanism, and thus these aspects of behavior might be coupled. To test this hypothesis, we instructed participants to make reaching movements to 'shoot' through a target at varying speeds and we assessed whether moving more quickly was also associated with more rapid action selection. We found that action selection was significantly slower when participants moved more slowly. This finding was recapitulated in a further dataset in which participants determined their own movement speed and moved slowly in order to stop their movement inside the target. Our results support the hypothesis that action selection and action execution are invigorated by a common underlying mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglial P2X4 receptors promote ApoE degradation and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease</a></h4>

              
                Numerous evidence support that microglia contributes to the progression of Alzheimer s disease. P2X4 receptors are ATP-gated channels, which are de novo expressed in a subset of reactive microglia associated to various pathological contexts, contributing to microglial functions. Here, we investigated the role of P2X4 in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD). In both human AD brain and APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice, P2X4 is almost exclusively expressed in plaque associated microglia. Genetic deletion of P2rx4 results in the reversal of cognitive declines and in a lower amount of soluble Abeta1-42 in 12 months old APP/PS1 mice, while no obvious alteration of plaque associated microglia characteristics is observed. Using proteomic, we identified ApoE as a specific P2X4 interacting protein. We found that P2X4 regulates lysosomal cathepsin B activity promoting ApoE degradation; P2rx4 deletion results in higher amount of intracellular and secreted ApoE in both BMDM and microglia from APP/PS1 brain. Our results support that microglial P2X4 promotes lysosomal ApoE degradation, indirectly altering Abeta peptide clearance, which in turn might promote synaptic dysfunctions and cognitive deficits. Our findings also uncover a specific interplay between purinergic signaling, microglial ApoE, sAbeta species and cognitive deficits associated with AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A critical role for spike synchrony in determining steep 1/f slopes in the setting of bursting EEG patterns</a></h4>

              
                EEG signals are commonly analyzed in the frequency-domain. Analysis of the power spectrum commonly demonstrates a reproducible fall-off of high frequencies, sometimes referred to as the "1/f slope". The 1/f slope comes about from a linear fit of the power spectral density in log-log form and takes typical values between (minus) 0-4. This slope has been recently hypothesized to correlate with the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic weights. However, we demonstrate models of excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance only explain small values of 1/f slope (< 2). We seek to construct a model to explain large slopes (> 2), which have been reported under conditions of anesthesia. Using simulations of clustered spike pulses, we find that pulse widths on the order of 1-10 ms result in a transition to steep 1/f slopes between 3-4. This trend also holds when measuring the 1/f slope from a spiking recurrent network model in a synchronous regime. We conclude that steep 1/f slopes result from synchronous spiking in bulk microcircuit activity. This suggests interpretations of steep 1/f slopes should consider spike synchrony in addition to other factors like E/I balance.

                Although behaviorally relevant patterns of neocortical activity in specific frequency bands have been broadly characterized, identifying individual underlying network events remains a key challenge in understanding information processing in cortical circuits. Using a novel analytical method for temporally precise detection of discrete network events, we identified and tracked discrete sets of events underlying two major forms of state-dependent activity patterns in mouse V1 cortex in the {beta} (15-30Hz) and {gamma} (30-80Hz) ranges. {gamma} events regulated spike timing and selectively enhanced visual encoding. Precise tracking revealed that {gamma}, but not {beta}, event rates increased prior to visually cued behavioral responses and were predictive of trial-by-trial visual task performance. Finally, the task-related temporal dynamics of {gamma} events exhibited rapid plasticity during task learning and were modality-specific. {gamma} events in mouse V1 thus flexibly enhance visual encoding according to behavioral context.

                We describe structural and multimodal functional neuroimaging data collected from 21 healthy volunteers. Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were acquired in separate sessions from the same individuals while they were performing a visual one-back repetition task. During functional sessions, participants were presented with images from five categories, including animals, chairs, faces, fruits, and vehicles. The stimulus set and experimental parameters were chosen to be similar to that of an available electrocorticography (ECoG) dataset, therefore creating a unique opportunity to study vision in humans with multiple complementary neuroimaging modalities. Individual-specific head models can be constructed for each participant using T1-weighted MPRAGE images and the recorded positions of the EEG electrodes. By combining the three functional modalities and the structural data, this dataset provides a unique setting to explore spatiotemporal dynamics of invariant object recognition in humans. This multimodal data can also be used to develop new methods for combining fMRI and electrophysiological modalities to come up with more accurate spatiotemporally resolved maps of brain function, which is inaccessible by any of the modalities alone.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Macroscale Thalamic Functional Organization Disturbances And Underlying Core Cytoarchitecture In Early-Onset Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a polygenetic mental disorder with a heterogeneous clinical presentation, and is associated with an abnormal connectivity profile in the cortex. The thalamus acts as an integrated hub in cortical function and plays a central role in the development of the cerebral cortex. Thus, altered functional organization of the thalamus might account for overarching cortical disruptions in schizophrenia. Here, we contrasted resting-state fMRI in 99 antipsychotic-naive first-episode early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) patients and 100 typically developing controls to study whether macroscale thalamic organization is altered in EOS. Employing manifold learning techniques on thalamocortical functional connectome, we derived both lateral-medial and anterior-posterior gradient axes of the thalamus. We observed increased dispersion of macroscale thalamic functional organization in EOS patients, which was related to altered thalamocortical interactions both in unimodal and transmodal networks. Moreover, using an ex vivo approximation of core-matrix cell distribution, we found that core cells particularly underlie the macroscale abnormalities in EOS patients. Last, functional decoding indicated that schizophrenia-related abnormalities in connectome-gene couplings were associated with both perceptual and abstract cognitive functions, suggesting a unitary pathophysiology of diverse symptoms in schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult-born granule cells improve stimulus encoding and discrimination in the dentate gyrus</a></h4>

              
                Heterogeneity plays an important role in diversifying neural responses to support brain function. Adult neurogenesis provides the dentate gyrus with a heterogeneous population of granule cells (GCs) that were born and developed their properties at different times. Immature GCs have distinct intrinsic and synaptic properties than mature GCs and are needed for correct encoding and discrimination in spatial tasks. How immature GCs enhance the encoding of information to support these functions is not well understood. Here, we record the responses to fluctuating current injections of GCs of different ages to study how they encode stimuli. Immature GCs produce unreliable responses compared to mature GCs, exhibiting imprecise spike timings across repeated stimulation. We use a statistical model to describe the stimulus-response transformation performed by GCs of different ages. We fit this model to the data and obtain parameters that capture GCs encoding properties. Parameter values from this fit reflect the maturational differences of the population and indicate that immature GCs perform a differential encoding of stimuli. To study how this age heterogeneity influences encoding by a population, we perform stimulus decoding using populations that contain GCs of different ages. We find that, despite their individual unreliability, immature GCs enhance the fidelity of the signal encoded by the population and improve the discrimination of similar time dependent stimuli. Thus, the observed heterogeneity confers the population with enhanced encoding capabilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modality specific roles for metabotropic GABAergic signaling and calcium induced calcium release mechanisms in regulating cold nociception</a></h4>

              
                Calcium (Ca2+) plays a pivotal role in modulating neuronal-mediated responses to multimodal sensory stimuli. Recent studies in Drosophila reveal class III (CIII) multidendritic (md) sensory neurons function as multimodal sensors regulating distinct behavioral responses to innocuous mechanical and nociceptive thermal stimuli. Functional analyses indicate that CIII-mediated multimodal behavioral output is dependent upon activation levels with stimulus-evoked Ca2+ displaying relatively low vs. high intracellular levels in response to gentle touch vs. noxious cold, respectively. However, the mechanistic bases underlying modality-specific differential Ca2+ responses in CIII neurons remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that noxious cold-evoked high intracellular Ca2+ responses in CIII neurons may rely upon Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanisms involving transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and/or metabotropic G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation to promote cold nociceptive behaviors. GABAB receptor mutants and CIII-specific knockdown resulted in impaired noxious cold-evoked behaviors. Gq and Phospholipase C signaling are likewise required for noxious cold sensing. Additionally, ER localized Ca2+ channels including the Ryanodine receptor (RyR) and Inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) are required for cold nociceptive behaviors. GPCR mediated signaling, through GABAB-R2 and IP3R, is not required in CIII neurons for innocuous touch evoked behaviors. However, CICR via RyR is required in CIII neurons for innocuous touch-evoked behaviors. Disruptions in GABAB -R2, IP3R and RyR in CIII neurons leads to significantly lower levels of cold-evoked Ca2+ responses indicating GPCR and CICR signaling mechanisms function in regulating Ca2+ release. CIII neurons exhibit bipartite cold-evoked firing patterns, where CIII neurons burst during rapid temperature change and tonically fire during steady state cold temperatures. GABAB-R2 knockdown in CIII neurons resulted in disorganized firing patterns during cold exposure. Upon ryanodine pharmacological application, CIII neurons exhibit increased bursting activity and with CIII specific RyR knockdown, there is an increase in cold-evoked tonic firing and decrease in bursting. Lastly, our previous studies implicated the TRPP channel Pkd2 in cold nociception, and here, we show that Pkd2 and IP3R genetically interact in regulating cold-evoked behavior. Collectively, these analyses support novel, modality-specific roles for metabotropic GABAergic signaling and CICR mechanisms in regulating intracellular Ca2+ levels and cold-evoked behavioral output from multimodal CIII neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The length of the thalamo-cortical white matter fibers brings insight into sex differences in sleep spindle frequency</a></h4>

              
                Sleep spindles (SS) are crucial to brain functions like memory and learning. SS characteristics result from the propagation of nerve impulses along white matter (WM) projections underlying an intricate loop between the thalamus and the cortex. SS amplitude and density have been associated with WM diffusion microarchitecture but physiological mechanisms underlying individual and sex-related variations in SS frequency are unknown. Here, we tested a model of traveling signals along the thalamo-cortico-thalamic projections to explain individual differences in spindle frequency. We predicted the presence of a relationship between the length of the thalamo-cortical WM bundles and a specific characteristic of this functional network, SS frequency.

Thirty young participants underwent a polysomnographic recording and a 3T MRI including a diffusion sequence. The length of WM fiber bundles between the thalamus and the frontal cortex was derived from probabilistic tractography computed through constrained spherical deconvolution.

Longer WM fiber bundles between the thalamus and specific regions of the frontal cortex (rostral middle frontal gyrus and anterior and middle part of the superior frontal gyrus) were associated with slower SS frequency. Moreover, the length of these WM fiber bundles statistically mediated the sex-related differences in SS frequency.

By providing a neuroanatomical marker of individual and sex-related differences in SS frequency, this study is the first to highlight the association between the anatomy of a specific brain network and a specific functional characteristic of this network, the frequency of oscillations produced during sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased sensorimotor structural connectivity in high schizotypy</a></h4>

              
                We explored the link between brain structural connectivity and schizotypy in healthy participants. Two datasets collected at two different neuroimaging centres, comprising 140 and 115 healthy participants respectively, were used. The participants completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, through which their total schizotypy scores were calculated. Diffusion MRI data collected at the two centres were used to perform streamline tractography and to generate the structural brain networks of the participants. The edges of the structural networks were weighted with the inverse radial diffusivity. Graph theoretical metrics of the networks were calculated and their correlation coefficients with the schizotypy scores were calculated.

We found a positive correlation between the schizotypy score and both the mean node degree and the mean clustering coefficient of the sensorimotor network. This implies that high-schizotypy participants have stronger connectivity in the sensorimotor network compared to those with low schizotypy. Weaker evidence was found for stronger structural connectivity in high schizotypy in the default-mode and visual networks. Our results agree with the dysconnection hypothesis which suggests that the decreases in white matter structural connectivity observed in schizophrenia patients, rather than being the cause of the disease, could be the result of altered functional connectivity in the disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebellar motor memory expression requires learned alterations to the activity of inhibitory molecular layer interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Procedural memories formed in the cerebellum in response to motor errors depend on changes to Purkinje cell (PC) spiking patterns that correct movement when the erroneous context is repeated. Because molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) inhibit PCs, learning-induced changes to MLI output may participate in reshaping PC spiking patterns. Yet, it remains unclear whether error-driven learning alters MLI activity and whether such changes are necessary for the memory engram. We addressed this knowledge gap by measuring and manipulating MLI activity in the flocculus of both sexes of mice before and after vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. We found that MLIs are activated during vestibular stimuli and that their population response exhibits a phase shift after the instantiation of gain-increase VOR adaptation, a type of error-driven learning requiring climbing-fiber-mediated instructive signaling. Although acute optogenetic suppression of MLI activity did not affect baseline VOR performance, it negated the expression of gain-increase learning, demonstrating a specific causal role of MLI activity changes in motor memory expression. This effect was transitory; after a multi-day consolidation period, the expression of VOR gain-increase learning was no longer sensitive to MLI activity suppression. Together, our results indicate that error-driven alteration of MLI activity is necessary for labile, climbing-fiber-induced motor memory expression.

Significance StatementIn the cerebellum, motor learning induces an associative memory of the sensorimotor context of an erroneous movement that, when recalled, results in a new pattern of output that improves subsequent trials of performance. Our study shows that error-driven motor learning induces changes to the activity pattern of cerebellar molecular layer interneurons and that this new pattern of activity is required to express the corrective motor memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric Signaling Across the Hierarchy of Cytoarchitecture within the Human Connectome</a></h4>

              
                Cortical variations in cytoarchitecture form a sensory-fugal axis that systematically shapes regional profiles of extrinsic connectivity. Additionally, this axis is thought to guide signal propagation and integration across the cortical hierarchy. While human neuroimaging work has shown that this axis constrains local properties of the human connectome, it remains unclear whether it also shapes the asymmetric signaling that arises from higher-order connectome topology. Here, we used network control theory to examine the amount of energy required to propagate dynamics across the sensory-fugal axis. Our results revealed an asymmetry in this energy indicating that bottom-up transitions were easier to complete compared to top-down transitions. Supporting analyses demonstrated that this asymmetry was underpinned by a connectome topology that is wired to support efficient bottom-up signaling. Finally, we found that this asymmetry correlated with changes in intrinsic neuronal timescales and lessened throughout youth. Our results show that cortical variation in cytoarchitecture may guide the formation of macroscopic connectome topology.

	<p>Recent research has suggested that working-memory training interventions may benefit children with developmental language disorder (DLD). The current study investigated a short and engaging adaptive working-memory intervention that targeted executive skills and aimed to improve both language comprehension and working-memory abilities in children with DLD. Forty-seven 6- to 10-year-old children with DLD were randomly allocated to an executive working-memory training intervention (n = 24) or an active control group (n = 23). A pre-test/intervention/post-test/9-month-follow-up design was used. Outcome measures included assessments of language (to evaluate far transfer of the training) and working memory (to evaluate near transfer of the training). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for pre-intervention performance and age found the group to be a significant predictor of sentence comprehension and of performance on six untrained working-memory measures at post-intervention and 9-month follow-up. Children in the intervention group showed significantly higher language comprehension and working-memory scores at both time points than children in the active control group. The intervention programme showed the potential to improve working memory and language comprehension in children with DLD and demonstrated several advantages: it involved short sessions over a short period, caused little disruption in the school day, and was enjoyed by children.</p>

	<p>A growing body of literature suggests a close link between olfaction and social expertise. The current study examines whether mentalizing skills are related to olfactory discrimination performance. In order to assess their mentalizing ability, 21 women and 20 men completed the &amp;amp;ldquo;Reading the Mind in the Eyes&amp;amp;rdquo; test (RMET). Here, the participants have to infer other persons&amp;amp;rsquo; mental state from photographs of eye regions. Odor discrimination was assessed using the &amp;amp;ldquo;D&amp;amp;uuml;sseldorf Odour Discrimination Test&amp;amp;rdquo; (DODT). The DODT consists of 15 items, each containing mixtures of four monomolecular substances. Within each item, two bottles contain the same mixing ratio, while the third contains the reversed mixing ratio. The participants had to identify the deviating odor. Women&amp;amp;rsquo;s expertise in mentalizing (RMET score) is strongly related to olfactory discrimination performance (DODT score): The better women are in mentalizing, the better their performance in olfactory discrimination (rho = 0.572, p = 0.042, Bonferroni-corrected). Men&amp;amp;rsquo;s mentalizing capability was unrelated to olfactory discrimination (rho = &amp;amp;minus;0.117, p &amp;amp;gt; 0.999, Bonferroni-corrected). The current results suggest that the social skill of mentalizing might underly the link between olfaction and social integration, at least in women, and are discussed with regard to the social nature of human olfaction.</p>

	<p>Nowadays, the use of social networks (SNs) is pervasive and ubiquitous. Among other things, SNs have become a key resource for establishing and maintaining personal relationships, as further demonstrated by the emergence of the pandemic. However, easy access to SNs may be a source of addictive behaviour, especially among the younger population. The literature highlights various psychological and physiological factors as possible predictors of vulnerability to SN addiction. This paper explores the joint effects of stress level and cognitive absorption, in the form of temporal dissociation while on SNs, on the addiction of university students to SNs. Here, 312 participants were involved in an online survey. About 14% of the sample presented a risk for SN addiction. Moreover, it was found that stress level predicted SN addiction both directly and indirectly through the effect of individual temporal dissociation, as experienced during SN usage. These results suggest a significant role of perceived stress level on addiction risk, while also pointing out additional vulnerability to SN addiction for cognitive profiles that are relatively more prone to temporal dissociation while online.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in the Spatial Behavior Functions of Adult-Born Neurons in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adult neurogenesis modifies hippocampal circuits and behavior, but removing newborn neurons does not consistently alter spatial processing, a core function of the hippocampus. Additionally, little is known about sex differences in neurogenesis since few studies have compared males and females. Since adult-born neurons regulate the stress response, we hypothesized that spatial functions may be more prominent under aversive conditions and may differ between males and females given sex differences in stress responding. We therefore trained intact and neurogenesis-deficient rats in the spatial water maze at temperatures that vary in their degree of aversiveness. In the standard water maze, ablating neurogenesis did not alter spatial learning in either sex. However, in cold water, ablating neurogenesis had divergent sex-dependent effects: relative to intact rats, male neurogenesis-deficient rats were slower to escape the maze and female neurogenesis-deficient rats were faster. Neurogenesis promoted temperature-related changes in search strategy in females, but it promoted search strategy stability in males. Females displayed greater recruitment (Fos expression) of the dorsal hippocampus than males, particularly in cold water. However, blocking neurogenesis did not alter Fos expression in either sex. Finally, morphologic analyses revealed greater experience-dependent plasticity in males. Adult-born neurons in males and females had similar morphology at baseline but training increased spine density and reduced presynaptic terminal size, specifically in males. Collectively, these findings indicate that adult-born neurons contribute to spatial learning in stressful conditions and they provide new evidence for sex differences in their behavioral functions.</p>

                <p>Endosomal transport and positioning cooperate in the establishment of neuronal compartment architecture, dynamics, and function, contributing to neuronal intracellular logistics. Furthermore, dysfunction of endo-lysosomal has been identified as a common mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we analyzed endo-lysosomal transport when &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) fibrillar polymorphs, &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) fibrils, and oligomers were externally applied on primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons. To measure this transport, we used a simple readout based on the spontaneous endocytosis in cultured neurons of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs), a perfectly stable nano-emitter, and the subsequent automatic extraction and quantification of their directed motions at high-throughput. &alpha;-Syn fibrillar polymorphs, A&beta; fibrils, and oligomers induce a 2-fold decrease of the fraction of nanodiamonds transported along microtubules, while only slightly reducing their interaction with cortical neurons. This important decrease in moving endosomes is expected to have a huge impact on neuronal homeostasis. We next assessed lysosomes dynamics, using LysoTracker. Neurons exposure to A&beta; oligomers led to an increase in the number of lysosomes, a decrease in the fraction of moving lysosome and an increase in their size, reminiscent of that found in APP transgenic model of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. We then analyzed the effect of &alpha;-syn fibrillar polymorphs, A&beta; fibrils, and oligomers on endosomal and lysosomal transport and quantified directed transport of those assemblies within cortical neurons. We report different impacts on endosomal and lysosomal transport parameters and differences in the trajectory lengths of cargoes loaded with pathogenic protein assemblies. Our results suggest that intraneuronal pathogenic protein aggregates internalization and transport may represent a target for novel neuroprotective therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Homeostatic pH disturbance, specifically acidosis, is a trigger for panic attacks relevant to panic disorder; however, contributory mechanisms are still unclear. Here we report a role of microglial acid chemosensory G protein–coupled receptor, T-cell death-associated gene 8, within the subfornical organ in orchestrating acidosis-evoked, fear-associated behavior of relevance to panic.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>An important role of pH homeostasis has been suggested in the physiology of panic disorder, with acidosis as an interoceptive trigger leading to fear and panic. Identification of novel mechanisms that can translate acidosis into fear will promote a better understanding of panic physiology. The current study explores a role of the subfornical organ (SFO), a blood–brain barrier compromised brain area, in translating acidosis to fear-relevant behaviors. We performed SFO-targeted acidification in male, wild-type mice and mice lacking microglial acid-sensing G protein–coupled receptor—T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8). Localized SFO acidification evoked significant freezing and reduced exploration that was dependent on the presence of acid-sensor TDAG8. Acidosis promoted the activation of SFO microglia and neurons that were absent in TDAG8-deficient mice. The assessment of regional neuronal activation in wild-type and TDAG8-deficient mice following SFO acidification revealed significant acidosis and genotype-dependent alterations in the hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray nuclei. Furthermore, mapping of interregional co-activation patterns revealed that SFO acidosis promoted positive hypothalamic-cortex associations and desynchronized SFO-cortex and amygdala-cortex associations, suggesting an interplay of homeostatic and fear regulatory areas. Importantly, these alterations were not evident in TDAG8-deficient mice. Overall, our data support a regulatory role of subfornical organ microglial acid sensing in acidosis-evoked fear, highlighting a centralized role of blood–brain barrier compromised nodes in interoceptive sensing and behavioral regulation. Identification of pathways by which humoral information can modulate fear behavior is relevant to panic disorder, where aberrant interoceptive signaling has been reported.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein induced by RNA binding</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Helder Veras Ribeiro-Filho, Gabriel Ernesto Jara, Fernanda Aparecida Heleno Batista, Gabriel Ravanhani Schleder, Celisa Caldana Costa Tonoli, Adriana Santos Soprano, Samuel Leite Guimarães, Antonio Carlos Borges, Alexandre Cassago, Marcio Chaim Bajgelman, Rafael Elias Marques, Daniela Barretto Barbosa Trivella, Kleber Gomes Franchini, Ana Carolina Migliorini Figueira, Celso Eduardo Benedetti, Paulo Sergio Lopes-de-Oliveira</p>

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causal agent of COVID-19, is a multifunction phosphoprotein that plays critical roles in the virus life cycle, including transcription and packaging of the viral RNA. To play such diverse roles, the N protein has two globular RNA-binding modules, the N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains, which are connected by an intrinsically disordered region. Despite the wealth of structural data available for the isolated NTD and CTD, how these domains are arranged in the full-length protein and how the oligomerization of N influences its RNA-binding activity remains largely unclear. Herein, using experimental data from electron microscopy and biochemical/biophysical techniques combined with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, in the absence of RNA, the N protein formed structurally dynamic dimers, with the NTD and CTD arranged in extended conformations. However, in the presence of RNA, the N protein assumed a more compact conformation where the NTD and CTD are packed together. We also provided an octameric model for the full-length N bound to RNA that is consistent with electron microscopy images of the N protein in the presence of RNA. Together, our results shed new light on the dynamics and higher-order oligomeric structure of this versatile protein.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Capturing the songs of mice with an improved detection and classification method for ultrasonic vocalizations (BootSnap)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Reyhaneh Abbasi, Peter Balazs, Maria Adelaide Marconi, Doris Nicolakis, Sarah M. Zala, Dustin J. Penn</p>

House mice communicate through ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), which are above the range of human hearing (>20 kHz), and several automated methods have been developed for USV detection and classification. Here we evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in a full, systematic comparison, while also presenting a new approach. This study aims to 1) determine the most efficient USV detection tool among the existing methods, and 2) develop a classification model that is more generalizable than existing methods. In both cases, we aim to minimize the user intervention required for processing new data. We compared the performance of four detection methods in an out-of-the-box approach, pretrained DeepSqueak detector, MUPET, USVSEG, and the Automatic Mouse Ultrasound Detector (A-MUD). We also compared these methods to human visual or ‘manual’ classification (ground truth) after assessing its reliability. A-MUD and USVSEG outperformed the other methods in terms of true positive rates using default and adjusted settings, respectively, and A-MUD outperformed USVSEG when false detection rates were also considered. For automating the classification of USVs, we developed <i>BootSnap</i> for supervised classification, which combines bootstrapping on Gammatone Spectrograms and Convolutional Neural Networks algorithms with Snapshot ensemble learning. It successfully classified calls into 12 types, including a new class of false positives that is useful for detection refinement. <i>BootSnap</i> outperformed the pretrained and retrained state-of-the-art tool, and thus it is more generalizable. <i>BootSnap</i> is freely available for scientific use.

In recent years, a wide variety of mentorship programmes targeting issues that cannot be addressed through traditional teaching and learning methods alone have been developed. Mentoring plays significant roles in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees, and the positive impacts of mentoring have been well documented. Mentorship programmes are therefore increasingly being implemented in a wide variety of fields by organisations, academic institutes, businesses, and governments. While there is a growing body of literature on mentoring and mentorship programmes, gaining a clear overview of the field is often challenging. In this article, we therefore provide a concise summary of recommendations to consider when designing and establishing mentorship programmes. These recommendations are based on the collective knowledge and experiences of 4 different emerging and established mentorship programmes and can be adapted across various mentorship settings or contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Unusual mammalian usage of TGA stop codons reveals that sequence conservation need not imply purifying selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Thomas Ho, Laurence Daniel Hurst</p>

The assumption that conservation of sequence implies the action of purifying selection is central to diverse methodologies to infer functional importance. GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a meiotic mismatch repair bias strongly favouring GC over AT, can in principle mimic the action of selection, this being thought to be especially important in mammals. As mutation is GC→AT biased, to demonstrate that gBGC does indeed cause false signals requires evidence that an AT-rich residue is selectively optimal compared to its more GC-rich allele, while showing also that the GC-rich alternative is conserved. We propose that mammalian stop codon evolution provides a robust test case. Although in most taxa TAA is the optimal stop codon, TGA is both abundant and conserved in mammalian genomes. We show that this mammalian exceptionalism is well explained by gBGC mimicking purifying selection and that TAA is the selectively optimal codon. Supportive of gBGC, we observe (i) TGA usage trends are consistent at the focal stop codon and elsewhere (in UTR sequences); (ii) that higher TGA usage and higher TAA→TGA substitution rates are predicted by a high recombination rate; and (iii) across species the difference in TAA <-> TGA substitution rates between GC-rich and GC-poor genes is largest in genomes that possess higher between-gene GC variation. TAA optimality is supported both by enrichment in highly expressed genes and trends associated with effective population size. High TGA usage and high TAA→TGA rates in mammals are thus consistent with gBGC’s predicted ability to “drive” deleterious mutations and supports the hypothesis that sequence conservation need not be indicative of purifying selection. A general trend for GC-rich trinucleotides to reside at frequencies far above their mutational equilibrium in high recombining domains supports the generality of these results.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico comparison between the mutated and wild type androgen receptors and their influence on the selection of optimum androgenic receptor blocker for treatment of prostate cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prostate cancer is a disease that occurs in men aged more than 50 years. In Iraq, 8.89 men per 100,000 population suffer from prostate cancer, with the incidence being 14,016 cases and mortality being 6,367 cases. Despite advances in treatment against prostate cancer, it can become resistant to drugs. Therefore, the aim of current study was to search and identify binding sites for the repositioning of drugs by computational methods (docking).  Methods: Based on the protein structure of the wild androgen receptor, the analysis parameters (22x22x22 on the X, Y, and Z axes) were established. Results: The interactions of the natural ligands with androgen receptor were 10.0 (testosterone) and 10.8 (dihydrotestosterone) while mutated androgen receptor (T877A) had a low affinity with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (-5.3 and -6.7, respectively). In the interactions of both receptors with the reported inhibitors (antagonists), a decrease with Bicalutamide (-8.3 and -4.3, respectively) and an increase in affinity with Flutamide and Nilutamide (-7.7 and 8.6, wild AR; -8.7 and -9.3 AR T877A) were observed. As for Enzalutamide and Apalutamide (second-generation antagonists), the change was minimal between wild androgen receptor and T877A (-7.6 and -7.7; -7.3 and -7.3, respectively). The change in the affinity of the ligands with androgen receptor and androgen receptor T877A shows how a mutation alters the bonds between these molecules. Conclusion: The identification of key sites and potent inhibitors against abnormal androgen receptor functions will enrich prostate cancer treatments.

                Objective – To systematically review evidence on effectiveness of contact tracing apps (CTAs) for SARS-CoV-2 on epidemiological and clinical outcomes Design – Update of a systematic review (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050519) Data sources - EMBASE (OVID), MEDLINE (PubMed), BioRxiv, and MedRxiv were searched up to June 9th 2021 Study selection – Studies, empirical or model-based, assessing effect of CTAs for SARS-CoV-2 on quarantine rate, reproduction number (R), total number of infections, hospitalization, mortality, and other epidemiologically and clinically relevant outcomes, were eligible for inclusion. Data extraction – Empirical and model-based studies were both critically appraised based on dedicated quality and risk of bias assessment checklists. Data on type of study (i.e., empirical or model-based), sample size, (simulated) time horizon, study population, CTA type (and associated interventions), comparator, and outcomes assessed, were extracted. Key findings were extracted and narratively summarized. Specifically for model-based studies, characteristics and values of important model parameters were collected. Results – 5123 studies were identified, of which 27 studies (five empirical, 22 model-based studies) were eligible and included in this review. All empirical studies were observational (non-randomized) studies and either at unclear or high risk of bias, mostly due to uncontrolled confounding. Risk of bias of model-based studies was considered high for 7 of 22 studies. Most studies demonstrated beneficial effects of CTAs on R, total number of infections, hospitalization, and mortality. Effect size was dependent on other model parameter values (e.g., proportion of asymptomatic individuals, testing delays), but in general a beneficial effect was observed at CTA adoption rates of 20% and over. Conclusions – CTAs are potentially effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 related epidemiological and clinical outcomes, though effect size depends on other model parameter values. Methodologically sound comparative empirical studies on effectiveness of CTAs are lacking and would be desirable to confirm findings from model-based studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lessons from COVID-19 for GCR governance: a research agenda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Lessons from Covid-19 Research Agenda offers a structure to study the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic response from a Global Catastrophic Risk (GCR) perspective. The agenda sets out the aims of our study, which is to investigate the key decisions and actions (or failures to decide or to act) that significantly altered the course of the pandemic, with the aim of improving disaster preparedness and response in the future. It also asks how we can transfer these lessons to other areas of (potential) global catastrophic risk management such as extreme climate change, radical loss of biodiversity and the governance of extreme risks posed by new technologies. Our study aims to identify key moments- ‘inflection points’- that significantly shaped the catastrophic trajectory of COVID-19. To that end this Research Agenda has identified four broad clusters where such inflection points are likely to exist: pandemic preparedness, early action, vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions. The aim is to drill down into each of these clusters to ascertain whether and how the course of the pandemic might have gone differently, both at the national and the global level, using counterfactual analysis. Four aspects are used to assess candidate inflection points within each cluster: 1. the information available at the time; 2. the decision-making processes used; 3. the capacity and ability to implement different courses of action, and 4. the communication of information and decisions to different publics. The Research Agenda identifies crucial questions in each cluster for all four aspects that should enable the identification of the key lessons from COVID-19 and the pandemic response.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Time to initiate randomized controlled clinical trials with methadone in cancer patients [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Public media coverage has fueled a demand for methadone as potential cure for cancer itself. Because patients have asked for respective prescriptions, clinical societies issued statements warning against the use of methadone as long as preclinical findings have not been supported by clinical evidence. In fact, not all preclinical data clearly support relevant effects. However, strong epidemiologic data suggest beneficial effects of methadone on cancer. Alternative explanations, namely better safety of methadone or hidden selection bias, seem less likely. This uncertainty can only be resolved by randomized controlled clinical trials. This review discusses all relevant data pertinent to methadone and cancer, uncovers supportive epidemiologic data, and suggests possible study designs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current practices of physiotherapists in Switzerland regarding fall risk-assessment for community-dwelling older adults: A national cross-sectional survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Falls can strongly impact older people’s quality of life, health, and lifestyle. Multifactorial assessment can determine an individual’s risk of falling as the first step for fall prevention intervention. Physiotherapists have an essential role to play in assessing fall risk by older adults living in the community. In the absence of published data on this topic in Switzerland, this study investigated the current practices of physiotherapists to determine whether those are in line with recommendations. Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was undertaken among physiotherapists practising in Switzerland between the 21st of November and the 31st of December 2020. A priori and exploratory hypotheses were tested. Responses to open-ended questions were grouped into themes for analysis.  Results: A total of 938 questionnaires from all three language regions of Switzerland was analysed. Participants worked in different settings, with a higher representation of private practice self-employees (56%). Standardised fall risk assessments or instruments were used by 580 (62%) participants, while 235 (25%) preferred subjective assessment of fall risk only. Differences in fall risk assessment were observed according to the workplace setting (adjusted OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.7) and education level (trend test, p<0.001). The standardised assessments most frequently employed were the Berg Balance Scale (57.5%), the Timed-Up-and-Go (56.5%) and the Tinetti Balance Assessment tool (46.7%). Risk factors for falls were frequently queried, particularly history of falls (88.3%), home hazards (84.1%), and functional ability (81%). Technical resources (39.8%), knowledge (30.3%), and time (22.2%) were common barriers to implement a systematic fall risk assessment. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of the current practices of physiotherapists in Switzerland in fall risk assessment. There is still room to optimise the standardisation and systematisation of this assessment to implement a best practice strategy and prevent avoidable falls.

                Background: Malnutrition is a crucial issue that contributes to approximately 45% of deaths among children under 5 years old and even >50% of deaths when accompanied by diarrhea. Several studies have stated that the use of honey can overcome cases of infertility due to malnutrition. Methods: An infertile female rat model with a degenerative ovary was induced with malnutrition through a 5-day food fasting but still had drinking water. The administration of (T1) 30% (v/v) and (T2) 50% (v/v) forest honey (Apis dorsata) were performed for ten consecutive days, whereas the (T+) group was fasted and not administered forest honey and the (T−) group has not fasted and not administered forest honey. Superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, IL-13 and TNF-α cytokine expressions, and ovarian tissue regeneration were analyzed. Results: Antioxidant activity (SOD) was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (65.24±7.53), T2 (74.16±12.3), and T− (65.09±6.56) compared with T+ (41.76±8.51). Oxidative stress (MDA) was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (9.71±1.53), T2 (9.23±0.96), and T− (9.83±1.46) compared with T+ (15.28±1.61). Anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-13) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (5.30±2.31), T2 (9.80±2.53), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (2.70±1.57). Pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (4.40±3.02), T2 (2.50±1.65), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (9.50±1.78). Ovarian tissue regeneration was significantly different (p<0.05) in T− (8.6±0.69) and T2 (5.10±0.99) compared with T1 (0.7±0.95) and T+ (0.3±0.67). Conclusion: The 10-day administration of 50% (v/v) forest honey can be an effective therapy for ovarian failure that caused malnutrition in the female rat model.

                Myocardial infarction (MI) is frequently complicated by the worsening of renal function. Undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) becomes crucial to a patient with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). With appropriate management of MI, acute-on-chronic kidney disease (ACKD) requiring dialysis post-MI remains an important clinical predictor of elevated in-hospital mortality among patients with MI.    In this study, we reported an octogenarian patient suffering from STEMI with ACKD and total atrioventricular block (TAVB). She underwent insertion of a temporary pacemaker and primary PCI. Renal function was improved after dialysis by decreasing the amount of serum creatinine from 8.1 mg/dL at admission to 1.05 mg/dL after primary PCI and dialysis. Primary PCI should still be considered for patients with acute MI, even though these patients have kidney disease, to save the heart muscle and even indirectly improve the kidney function itself.

                Early marriage practices undermine girls’ autonomy and seriously affect their physical and mental wellbeing. Monitoring the trends and understanding the drivers is essential in intervening against early marriage. However, many studies on early marriage in Ethiopia are cross-sectional, focusing only on the magnitude at a single point in time. Hence, we extracted data of girls of 10-17 years from Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Kersa HDSS) database for the period of 2008–2018 in order to examine the trends of early marriage. In this data note we provide the details of a research database of 24,452 girls in the age group of 10-17 years. The extracted data include date of marriage and the girls’ socio-demographic variables. Other variables considered to be potentially associated with timing of marriage were also extracted. The purpose of this publication is to describe the dataset for external researchers who may be interested in making use of it as a secondary use of their routinely collected data. This dataset is available at   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15034812.

                Background: The modern concept of oligometastatic (OM) state has been initially developed to describe patients with a low burden of disease and with a potential for cure with local ablative treatments. We systematically assessed the risk of death and relapse of oligometastatic (OM) cancers compared to cancers with more diffuse metastatic spread, through a meta-analysis of published data.  Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting prognosis of patients with OM solid tumors. Risk of death and relapse were extracted and pooled to provide an adjusted hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval (HR 95%CI).  The primary outcome of the study refers to overall mortality in OM vs. polymetastatic (PM) patients.  Results. Mortality and relapse associated with OM state in patients with cancer were evaluated among 104,234 participants (n=173 studies). Progression-free survival was better in patients with OM disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.62, 95% CI 0.57–0.68; P <.001; n=69 studies). Also, OM cancers were associated with a better overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68; P<.01; n=161 studies). In colorectal (CRC), breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the reduction in the risk of death for OM patients were 35, 38, 30 and 42%, respectively. Biliary tract and cervical cancer do not significantly better in OM stage likely for paucity of data. Conclusions. Patients with OM cancers have a significantly better prognosis than those with more widespread stage IV tumors. In OM cancer patients a personalized approach should be pursued.

                Cholesterol granuloma is a rare non-infectious disease. Currently, there are no established guidelines, leaving the clinician to decide the best practice for each patient. A 43-year-old woman presented to the Surgery Clinic at Siloam General Hospital, Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, with the primary complaint of a painful mass located in her left breast over the previous week before being admitted to the hospital. The mass was found abruptly and was accompanied by severe pain and fever. On inspection, peau d’orange, nipple retraction, tenderness, and warmth of the skin were observed. Ultrasonography suggested a malignant mass. The primary diagnosis was breast cancer, with a secondary differential diagnosis of breast abscess. An open biopsy was chosen because a breast abscess was the possible diagnosis. The biopsy results showed characteristics of cholesterol granuloma. Following the operation, the pain score was notably reduced as the operation showed a satisfactory result. The primary purpose of this case report was to illustrate a case of breast abscess caused by cholesterol granuloma, in which open excisional biopsy and drainage was superior for pain reduction and faster recovery.

                Kim et al. review the emerging field of interorganelle contact sites, focusing on their role in organelle dynamics and interorganelle communication to maintain cellular homeostasis. In particular, they discuss how the disruptions in interorganelle contacts contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases.
