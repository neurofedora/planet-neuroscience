              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/6/ENEURO.0377-24.2025?rss=1">Evidence That Dmrta2 Acts through Repression of Pax6 in Cortical Patterning and Identification of a Mutation Impairing DNA Recognition Associated with Microcephaly in Human</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dmrta2 (also designated Dmrt5) is a transcriptional regulator expressed in cortical progenitors in a caudomedial<sup>high</sup>/rostrolateral<sup>low</sup> gradient with important roles at different steps of cortical development. Dmrta2 has been suggested to act in cortex development mainly by differential suppression of <I>Pax6</I> and other homeobox transcription factors such as the ventral telencephalic regulator <I>Gsx2</I>, which remains to be fully demonstrated. Here we have addressed the epistatic relation between Pax6 and Dmrta2 by comparing phenotypes in mutant embryos or embryos overexpressing both genes in various allelic combinations. We show that Dmrta2 cooperates with Pax6 in the maintenance of cortical identity in dorsal telencephalic progenitors and that it acts as a transcriptional repressor of <I>Pax6</I> to control cortical patterning. Mechanistically, we show that in P19 cells, Dmrta2 acts as a DNA binding-dependent repressor on the <I>Pax6 E60</I> enhancer and that a point mutation that affects its DNA binding properties identified in a consanguineous family leads to agenesis of the corpus callosum, pachygyria, and the absence of the cingulate gyrus. Finally, we provide evidence that Dmrta2 binds components of the NuRD repressor complex and interacts with zinc finger proteins such as Zfp423. Together, our results highlight the importance and conserved function of Dmrta2 in cortical development and provide novel insights into its mechanism of action.</p>

                Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common oral cancers with a high mortality rate. The biodiversity source in Indonesia makes areca nut a potential antioxidant in treating disease. Objective The study aimed to evaluate the effect of areca nut extract on 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO)-tumor-induced rats. Methods Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups. Group 1 served as the control group, group 2 was 4NQO-induced rats without treatment, and groups 3 and 4 were given 4NQO-tumor inducer with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract, respectively. The rats in groups 2,3, and 4 received 30 ppm of 4NQO tumor inducer in drinking water for 12 weeks. In the end, all rats were euthanized, and the tongue was removed. The body, liver, kidney, heart, and lung weights were measured. Tongue tumor volume and dysplasia lesions were analyzed. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor and stromal areas were scored semi-quantitatively associating the infiltrate grade (0-3) and analyzed histologically. Results There were significant differences in body weight loss between the initial and final phases in groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The areca nut at 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW significantly reduced the tumor size compared with groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). The incidence of OSCC in rats with 500 and 1000 mg/kg BW of areca nut extract after 22 weeks was 0%, but the dysplasia lesions were observed at 28.57% and 85.71%, respectively. The highest mean of stromal TILs was in group 3 and there were significant differences in stromal TILs between groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Conclusion Areca nut extract induced infiltrating lymphocytes in the stromal tumor area on the OSCC lesion of the tongue in 4NQO-induced rats.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-179/v2?src=rss">Risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19 associated with mask use outside the home in Indonesia during the mandatory policy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it spread to 213 countries in 2020. In Indonesia there were 6,812,127 cases, which ranked 20th worldwide in the year 2024. In response, Indonesia issued a policy mandating mask use. This study aims to investigate the association between risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19 with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Methods This was an online study conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, during the first wave of COVID-19. Participants were provided written informed consent prior to agreeing or declining to voluntarily participate in the questionnaire-based study. A total of 1,153 respondents were selected. The dependent variable was consistent mask-wearing outside the home, while the independent variables were risk perception regarding COVID-19, sociodemographic factors (location, age, gender, education, occupation, family income, family members, social health scheme), and knowledge of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results The risk perception of COVID-19 as a viral disease that can cause death (aOR: 2.502; 95% CI: 1.601-3.912) was positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Regarding sociodemographic factor, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years (aOR: 0.486; 95% CI: 0.254-0.932) were 49% less likely to consistently use masks. Knowledge of the need to change cloth masks every 4-6 hours (aOR: 1.697; 95% CI: 1.118-2.576); the transmission (aOR: 1.974; 95%CI: 1.040-3.746), knowledge of severe symptoms of COVID-19 (aOR: 1.981; 95%CI: 1.175-3.342); and awareness of the confirmed diagnosis by PCR (aOR: 2.238; 95%CI: 1.215-4.120) were positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Conclusions The risk perception of COVID-19 as potentially fatal and knowledge regarding proper mask-changing intervals, the transmission, severe symptoms, and PCR-based diagnosis were positively associated with mask-wearing outside the home. However, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years were less likely to wear mask consistently. These findings underscore the importance of targeted public health interventions that address risk perception and enhance knowledge to promote mask use as effective COVID-19 prevention measures.

                <p>by Ryan J. Rowekamp, Tatyana O. Sharpee</p>

Biological visual systems are celebrated for their ability to reliably and precisely recognize objects. However, the specific neural mechanisms responsible for this capability remain largely elusive. In this study, we investigate neural responses in the visual areas V1, V2, and V4 of the brain to natural stimuli using a framework that includes quadratic computations in order to capture local recurrent interactions, both excitatory and suppressive. We find that these quadratic computations and specific coordination between their elements strongly increase both the predictive power of the model and the neural selectivity to natural stimuli. Particularly important were (i) coordination between excitatory and suppressive features to represent mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding incoming stimuli, such as orthogonal orientations or opposing motion directions in area V4, (ii) balance in the contribution of excitatory and suppressive components and its maintenance at similar levels across stages of processing, and (iii) refinement of feature selectivity between stages, with earlier stages representing broader category of inputs. Overall, this work describes how the brain could use multiple nonlinear mechanisms to increase selectivity of neural responses to natural stimuli.

The T<sub>SCM</sub> population has been shown to have the key properties of a stem cell population: multipotency, self-renewal and clonal longevity. Here we show that no single population has all these stem cell properties, instead the properties are distributed. We show that the human T<sub>SCM</sub> population consists of two distinct cell subpopulations which can be distinguished by the level of their CD95 expression (CD95int and CD95hi). Crucially, using long-term <i>in vivo</i> labelling of human volunteers, we establish that these are distinct populations rather than transient states of the same population. These two subpopulations have different functional profiles <i>ex vivo</i>, different transcriptional patterns, and different tissue distributions. They also have significantly different TREC content indicating different division histories and we find that the frequency of CD95hi T<sub>SCM</sub> increases with age. Most importantly, CD95hi and CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub> cells also have very different dynamics <i>in vivo</i> with CD95hi cells showing considerably higher proliferation but significantly reduced clonal longevity compared with CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub>. While both T<sub>SCM</sub> subpopulations exhibit considerable multipotency, no single population of T<sub>SCM</sub> cells has both the properties of self-renewal and clonal longevity. Instead, the “stemness” of the T<sub>SCM</sub> population is generated by the complementary dynamic properties of the two subpopulations: CD95int T<sub>SCM</sub> which have the property of clonal longevity and CD95hi T<sub>SCM</sub> which have the properties of expansion and self-renewal. We suggest that together, these two populations function as a stem cell population.

                Background The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a pressing need for exploring new natural compounds with innovative mechanisms to replace existing antibiotics. Bacteriocins offer promising alternatives for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies in livestock, aquaculture, and human health. Specifically, those produced by LAB are recognized as GRAS and QPS. This study aims to develop a deep learning model specifically designed to classify bacteriocins by their LAB origin, using interpretable k-mer features and embedding vectors to enable applications in antimicrobial discover. Methods We developed a deep learning neural network for binary classification of bacteriocin amino acid sequences (BacLAB vs. Non-BacLAB). Features were extracted using k-mers (k=3,5,7,15,20) and vector embeddings (EV). Ten feature combinations were tested (e.g., EV, EV+5-mers+7-mers). Sequences were filtered by length (50–2000 AA) to ensure uniformity, and class balance was maintained (24,964 BacLAB vs. 25,000 Non-BacLAB). The model was trained on Google Colab, demonstrating computational accessibility without specialized hardware. Results The ‘5-mers+7-mers+EV’ group achieved the best performance, with k-fold cross-validation (k=30) showing: 9.90% loss, 90.14% accuracy, 90.30% precision, 90.10% recall and F1 score. Folder 22 stood out with 8.50% loss, 91.47% accuracy, and 91.00% precision, recall, and F1 score. Five sets of 100 LAB-specific k-mers were identified, revealing conserved motifs. Despite high accuracy, sequence length variation (50–2000 AA) may bias k-mer representation, favoring longer sequences. Additionally, experimental validation is required to confirm the biological activity of predicted bacteriocins. These aspects highlight directions for future research. Conclusions The model developed in this study achieved consistent results with those seen in the reviewed literature. It outperformed some studies by 3-10%. Its implementation in resource-limited settings is feasible via cloud platforms like Google Colab. The identified k-mers could guide the design of synthetic antimicrobials, pending further in vitro validation.

                There is a recognised need to further understand potential harms from the use of e-cigarettes and other non-tobacco oral nicotine products (ONPs), particularly among children and young people. This protocol describes a programme of work that aims to continually identify and classify the evolving international evidence base on the effects of these products on human health, trends in their use, and related interventions. In terms of its methods, we will produce and maintain a living evidence map, available in an online interactive format, and updated continually over the planned duration of the project (~5 years from registration). A wide range of electronic databases will be searched, with eligible articles including a focus on the use of e-cigarettes or ONPs in humans. Should satisfactory levels of machine performance be reached (by reference to human performance benchmarks), we intend to automate the bulk screening of articles for inclusion using Large Language Model (LLM) decisions. A similar approach will be applied to the automated coding of a range of characteristics of included articles, including their type of research, and the nature of harms and products being examined. In conjunction with the production of the living evidence map, we will produce regular descriptive surveillance reports (research digests) that will summarise the current contents of the map. Ongoing production and maintenance of this living evidence map and linked outputs will enable potential users – including across research, policy, and charitable sectors – to more efficiently establish an overview of the landscape of relevant research and surveil key developments.

                Background Long-read RNA sequencing technologies can produce complete or near-complete transcript sequences. Recently introduced methods for direct RNA and cDNA sequencing can provide a high-throughput strategy for the discovery of novel and rare gene isoforms. However, the high error rates in ONT sequences limit the ability to exactly pinpoint splice site boundaries when aligning reads to the genome. Methods In this paper, we present a novel tool called NIFFLR (Novel IsoForm Finder using Long Reads) that identifies and quantifies both known and novel isoforms using long-read RNA sequencing data. NIFFLR recovers known transcripts and assembles novel transcripts present in the data by aligning exons from a reference annotation to the long reads. Results NIFFLR effectively recovers correct transcripts from simulated reads based on known transcript annotations, achieving higher sensitivity and precision compared to several previously-published tools. On real data, NIFFLR shows the high accuracy as measured by concordance of isoform counts to the counts computed from Illumina data for the same sample. We applied NIFFLR to a set of 92 GTEx long-read samples and produced transcript counts for both novel and known isoforms. In total, we identified and quantified 121,155 isoforms present in the RefSeq annotation of GRCh38 and 106,667 high-confidence novel isoforms across 32,875 genes present in two or more samples in these data, more than previous studies identified in this data set. Conclusions NIFFLR is an effective tool aimed at assembly and quantification of transcripts present in the long high error transcriptome reads. NIFFLR is released under an open-source license (GPL 3.0) and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/alguoo314/NIFFLR/releases.

                Background Long Covid is defined as conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection more than 3 months. This study aimed to analyze the point prevalence and predictors of long Covid in the Omicron variant dominant epidemic at 3 and 6 months in Thailand. Methods Prospective cohort study on the COVID-19 cohort at Thammasat University Hospital (TUH) and Thammasat Field Hospital (TFH) during the Omicron variant dominant epidemic was performed. The phone interview for long Covid symptoms was performed among 1,388 patients at 3 months and 917 patients at 6 months after the infection. Clinical characteristics of all participants were retrieved from the database of the hospital. Results The point prevalence of long Covid was 52.59% at 3 months and 28.57% at 6 months. The most prevalent symptom group at both time points was fatigue and weakness, affecting 31.70% of patients at 3 months and 15.81% at 6 months. Three significant predictors of long Covid were identified at both 3 and 6 months: severe-to-critical illness during the acute phase, female sex, and healthcare worker occupation. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for severe-to-critical illness were 4.50 [95% CI, 1.59–12.75] at 3 months and 9.15 [95% CI, 1.35–62.10] at 6 months. Female sex was associated with aORs of 2.04 [95% CI, 1.61–2.58] at 3 months and 2.41 [95% CI, 1.71–3.34] at 6 months. Healthcare workers had aORs of 1.96 [95% CI, 1.39–2.78] at 3 months and 3.12 [95% CI, 1.85–5.27] at 6 months. Obesity was a significant predictor of long Covid only at 3 months. Conclusions The prevalence of long Covid remains substantial following the Omicron variant-dominant epidemic. Key predictors of long Covid at both 3 and 6 months include severe-to-critical illness during the acute phase, female sex, and healthcare worker occupation.

                Background DataSHIELD is a mature, R-based federated learning platform that enables multi-site analysis without sharing individual participant data. While DataSHIELD includes many packages for data analysis, it lacks user-friendly data manipulation tools. Methods To address this gap, we developed dsTidyverse, an implementation of selected functions from the popular Tidyverse package within the DataSHIELD client-server architecture. Disclosure checks were implemented to prevent individual-level data leakage. Results This package provides functionality for selecting, renaming, and creating columns; conditional recoding; combining data frames by rows or columns; filtering and arranging rows; grouping and ungrouping data; and converting data frames to tibbles. Through examples, we demonstrate how dsTidyverse simplifies common data manipulation tasks within DataSHIELD. Conclusions By providing additional data manipulation functionality, dsTidyverse improves the user experience and analytical efficiency within DataSHIELD. The package is open-source and freely available on CRAN and GitHub, and welcomes further development: https://github.com/molgenis/ds-tidyverse.

                Background Sleep disturbances frequently occur in concomitance with chronic pain, exacerbating its detrimental effects and diminishing patients’ quality of life. Although various studies have explored the relationship between chronic pain and sleep disturbances, comprehensive evidence on detailed assessment methods and their bidirectional interactions remains limited. This scoping review aimed to examine the characteristics and prevalence of assessment methods for sleep and pain-related outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. Methods A comprehensive search of nine databases identified observational and interventional studies examining the relationship between sleep disturbances/disorders and chronic pain in adults. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) as well as gray literature sources, Open Grey. In addition, the following trial registries were searched for ongoing or unpublished trials: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Results This review included 81 of 3,513 studies. Approximately 90.1% of studies relied on self-report sleep assessments, whereas only 9.9% incorporated objective measures. Additionally, 7.4% of studies used a combination of self-report and objective sleep assessments. The visual analog and numeric rating scales were the most frequently used methods for assessing pain-related outcomes (58.0%). Despite extensive research on sleep and chronic pain, critical gaps persist, particularly in the integration of multidimensional assessment tools. Conclusions This scoping review discovered imbalances in the content of both sleep and pain assessments. Future studies should integrate both objective and self-report assessment tools to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this interaction.

                Background Malnutrition impairs immune function and vaccine responses, particularly in low-income settings. This can lead to reduced seroconversion rates and compromised herd immunity in children. Nutritional interventions have been proposed to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, yet evidence remains scattered and context specific. Objective This systematic review assesses the impact of nutritional interventions—especially vitamin A, zinc supplementation, and protein-energy rehabilitation—on serological responses to routine childhood vaccines among malnourished children in low- and middle-income countries. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Health Library for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews reporting on nutritional supplementation and vaccine seroconversion outcomes in malnourished children. Results From 3,245 records, 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A supplementation improved measles vaccine seroconversion by 35%, especially among deficient children. Zinc enhanced responses to oral vaccines by 20%. Protein-energy rehabilitation significantly increased seroconversion rates for BCG and measles vaccines, particularly in children recovering from severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion Nutritional interventions improve vaccine immunogenicity among malnourished children. Integrated strategies combining immunization and nutrition services should be prioritized to address immunity gaps in vulnerable populations.

                Background The discovery spurred further exploration, leading to the expansion of opal mining into neighboring districts. Numerous cooperative groups, composed of small-scale miners, traditionally explore, develop, and extract significant amounts of rough opal gemstones. This study tries to investigate the challenges and economic impacts of traditional opal mining practice in wollo province of Ethiopia. Methods The study used in this study is primary data collected from rural households, which are living in five districts of north wollo zone, in Amhara regional state. The data was collected using field observation, focus grouped discussion, interview, and questionnaire from sampled households. The study uses both descriptive and econometric methods of data analysis to achieve its objective. Results Among the challenges of traditional opal mining, primitive way of exploring and extraction, limited access to market and low institutional support in terms of training and finance are identified. The probit model reveals that, increased education, access to training, and access to credit positively influence the likelihood of engaging in opal mining. The ESR model shows that, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) indicates that participating in opal mining increases monthly income by 31,380 ETB, while the average treatment effect on the untreated (ATU) shows a potential income increase of 31,625 ETB for non-miners if they engaged in mining. Conclusion The study identifies three main categories of challenges faced by traditional opal miners: exploration and extraction issues, market limitations, and regulatory and institutional shortcomings. Exploration and extraction challenges include the lack of modern mining tools and knowledge, as well as difficult terrain, leading to inefficient and hazardous mining practices. Market-related challenges involve limited access to broader markets and lack of value addition, resulting in miners selling raw opals at significantly lower prices compared to polished ones.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-444/v2?src=rss">Region-wise landmarks-based feature extraction employing SIFT, SURF, and ORB feature descriptors to recognize Monozygotic twins from 2D/3D Facial Images [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background In computer vision and image processing, face recognition is increasingly popular field of research that identifies similar faces in a picture and assigns a suitable label. It is one of the desired detection techniques employed in forensics for criminal identification. Methods This study explores face recognition system for monozygotic twins utilizing three widely recognized feature descriptor algorithms: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)—with region-specific facial landmarks. These landmarks were extracted from 468 points detected through the MediaPipe framework, which enables simultaneous recognition of multiple faces. Quantitative similarity metrics t served as inputs for four classification methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM), and Nearest Centroid (NC). The effectiveness of these algorithms was tested and validated using challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets, the most difficult data sets for 2D and 3D face recognition research at Notre Dame University. Results Testing with Notre Dame University’s challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets revealed significant performance differences. Results demonstrated that 2D facial images achieved notably higher recognition accuracy than 3D images. The 2D images produced accuracy of 88% (SVM), 83% (LGBM), 83% (XGBoost), and 79% (NC). In contrast, the 3D TEC dataset yielded a lower accuracy r of 74%, 72%, 72%, and 70%, with the same classifiers. Conclusion The hybrid feature extraction approach proved most effective, with maximum accuracy rates reaching 88% for 2D facial images and 74% for 3D facial images. This work contributes significantly to forensic science by enhancing the reliability of facial recognition systems when confronted with indistinguishable facial characteristics of monozygotic twins.

                A specific neuronal population in the brain encoding D-glucose, the brain’s main fuel, has been proposed but not yet identified. Kim et al. discovered a circuit involving CRFPVN neurons, fasting-activated PBNdl neurons, and lumbar spinal neurons that together encode the identity of D-glucose, revealing a potential glucose-sensing neural pathway.

                Two co-resident temperate archaeal viruses, SNJ1 and SNJ2, and their shared host establish a mutualistic relationship, where SNJ2-encoded type IV pilins assemble into T4P filaments important for host biofilm formation and motility and are used by SNJ1 as a primary receptor. Reciprocally, SNJ1 strongly enhances SNJ2 replication efficiency.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93191">Evidence from pupillometry, fMRI, and RNN modelling shows that gain neuromodulation mediates task-relevant perceptual switches</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual updating has been hypothesised to rely on a network reset modulated by bursts of ascending neuromodulatory neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline, abruptly altering the brain’s susceptibility to changing sensory activity. To test this hypothesis at a large-scale, we analysed an ambiguous figures task using pupillometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behaviourally, qualitative shifts in the perceptual interpretation of an ambiguous image were associated with peaks in pupil diameter, an indirect readout of phasic bursts in neuromodulatory tone. We further hypothesised that stimulus ambiguity drives neuromodulatory tone, leading to heightened neural gain, hastening perceptual switches. To explore this hypothesis computationally, we trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) on an analogous perceptual categorisation task, allowing gain to change dynamically with classification uncertainty. As predicted, higher gain accelerated perceptual switching by transiently destabilising the network’s dynamical regime in periods of maximal uncertainty. We leveraged a low-dimensional readout of the RNN dynamics to develop two novel macroscale predictions: perceptual switches should occur with peaks in low-dimensional brain state velocity and with a flattened egocentric energy landscape. Using fMRI, we confirmed these predictions, highlighting the role of the neuromodulatory system in the large-scale network reconfigurations mediating adaptive perceptual updates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102550">Mapping HIV-1 RNA structure, homodimers, long-range interactions and persistent domains by HiCapR</a></h4>

              
                Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome organization remains a critical knowledge gap in understanding its replication cycle. To address this, we developed HiCapR, a psoralen crosslinking-based RNA proximity ligation method coupled with post-library hybridization, enabling high-resolution mapping of RNA-RNA interactions across the HIV-1 genome. This approach confirmed canonical structural motifs, including stem-loop architectures in the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) and Rev Response Element (RRE), as well as dimerization sites within the 5’-UTR critical for viral packaging. Notably, HiCapR identified novel homodimerization events distributed along the genome, suggesting an expanded regulatory role of RNA multimerization in splicing regulation and selective encapsidation. Intriguingly, while infected cells exhibited extensive long-range RNA interactions—particularly within the 5’-UTR—virion-packaged genomes displayed a marked reduction in such interactions, indicative of a structural transition from a loosely organized state to a condensed conformation. This spatial reorganization coincided with the preservation of stable genomic domains essential for dimerization, which persisted throughout virion assembly. These domains, enriched at homodimer interfaces, likely serve as structural scaffolds ensuring fidelity during genome packaging. This work establishes HiCapR as a robust tool for probing RNA interactomes and provides mechanistic insights into how HIV-1 exploits RNA topological heterogeneity to regulate its life cycle. The identification of conserved structural domains and transient interaction networks opens avenues for targeting RNA conformation in antiviral strategies.

">Level Up the Brain! Novel PCA Method Reveals Key Neuroplastic Refinements in Action Video Gamers</a></h4>

              
                Action video games (AVGs) offer a natural and ecologically rich experimental paradigm for studying how sustained cognitive demands drive behaviorally induced neuroplastic changes in the brain. We demonstrate that long-term AVG players, referred to in this study as gamers, may perhaps be reducing visuomotor information surprise during decision-making by more effectively resolving internal conflict in competing motor plans and thus reducing overall visuomotor uncertainty. To explain how this effect occurs over a prolonged period, we utilized the Cognitive Resource Reallocation (CRR) framework, defined as the dynamic redistribution of metabolic and functional resources to support behaviorally relevant neuroplastic adaptation under repeated, demanding task conditions. Using a novel region-cumulative principal component analysis (rcPCA) approach, we identified key brain regions that explain inter-subject variability, improving statistical power by isolating the most informative regions and reducing the burden of multiple comparisons. Our findings show that prolonged AVG experience plausibly promotes more efficient visuomotor decision-making through top-down cognitive clarity, reflected in the unobstructed transformation of learned value into goal-directed action and bottom-up motor readiness, both of which track with improved visuomotor performance in gamers. The convergence of these factors would effectively reduce internal conflict, mitigate visuomotor uncertainty, and enable rapid yet skillful action selection. Through prolonged action video game exposure, their brains reflect neuroplastic refinements that point towards more effective reduction in internal conflict over competing plans for transforming visuomotor information into skillful action selection, a key factor in high-pressure environments and consistent with CRR. More broadly, these insights show how repeated cognitive challenges could reasonably perturb behaviorally relevant neurodynamics and promote enhanced cognitive abilities.

">Behavioral Signature of Trihexyphenidyl in The Tor1a (DYT1) Knockin Mouse Model of Dystonia</a></h4>

              
                Dystonia is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary repetitive movements and abnormal postures. Animal models have played a pivotal role in studying the pathophysiology of dystonia. However, many genetic models, e.g. the Tor1a+/{Delta}E (DYT1) mouse, lack an overt motor phenotype, despite significant underlying neuronal abnormalities within the striatum and other motor control regions. Because the striatum is implicated in action sequencing, it is possible that the behavioral defect arises as a disruption in the frequency and temporal ordering of behaviors, rather than execution, which cannot be captured using traditional behavioral assays, thus limiting drug discovery efforts. To address this challenge, we used MoSeq, an unsupervised behavioral segmentation framework, to compare the continuous free behavior of control Tor1a+/+ mice and knockin Tor1a+/{Delta}E mutant mice in response to the anti-dystonia drug trihexyphenidyl. Although minimal baseline differences in behavioral organization were detected, both genotypes exhibited robust and consistent shifts in behavioral space structure after treatment with trihexyphenidyl. Further, we demonstrate differences in the behavioral space structure of male vs female mice after trihexyphenidyl challenge. The distinct behavioral signatures evoked by trihexyphenidyl and biological sex, a known risk factor for dystonia, suggest that the analysis of the temporal structure of continuous free behavior provides a sensitive and novel approach to the discovery of therapeutics for the treatment of dystonia.

">Muscle control of an extra robotic digit</a></h4>

              
                Controlling an extra robotic finger requires the brain to adapt existing motor signals. While most current strategies exploit physical movement, there is growing interest in harnessing muscle activity directly via surface electromyography (EMG) as a more seamless interface. We systematically compared muscle- (EMG) and movement-based (force sensor) control of a Third Thumb. Using identical instructions and a counterbalanced within-participants design, we assessed initial skill, learning, and cognitive load across a variety of tasks, enabling a blinded comparison across control modalities. Both control modalities afforded successful Third Thumb control and learning, although force control consistently delivered better performance. Despite execution differences, learning rates and cognitive loads were comparable, with a similar evoked sense of agency. Signal analyses showed performance was predicted by real-time force sensor parameters but not by EMG, reflecting distinct control dynamics. Nonetheless, EMG training led to greater skill transfer to force control, suggesting it may better support generalisable learning. These findings challenge the assumption that proximity to neural signals ensures better control. Although EMG underperformed in execution, it showed unique advantages, including enhanced generalisation and access to richer signals, highlighting the need for improved real-time decoding to fully exploit its potential.

">Potential beneficial effects of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical and clinical studies</a></h4>

              
                Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) play key roles in cancer immune evasion and in modulating neuroinflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade on pathology and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in preclinical and clinical studies. Relevant studies were systematically identified using the MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases from their inception until April 10, 2024. In total, 33 studies were included in this meta-analysis, conducted using R software. Preclinical studies revealed that blockade of PD-1 signaling reduces amyloid-beta plaque burden, tau phosphorylation, and astrocyte reactivity in AD mouse models, accompanied by improvements in cognitive function in behavioral tests. Furthermore, clinical studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of PD-1 signaling inhibitors on cognitive function in cancer patients. This study highlights the necessity for additional research to clarify the exact mechanisms by which PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition impacts AD pathology and cognitive function, opening avenues for potential therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway in AD.

">Tau-seed interactome analysis reveals distinct functional signatures in Alzheimer's disease across model systems.</a></h4>

              
                Tau aggregates propagate through the brain in a prion-like manner in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, but the molecular identity and functional partners of the seeding-competent Tau species remain poorly defined. Here, we present an unbiased proteomic profiling of a high-molecular-weight (HMW) Tau-seed isolated from AD patient brains. We contrast this interactome with that of a biochemically similar, seeding-incompetent HMW-Tau species from age-matched healthy controls. Despite comprising less than 5% of total Tau in the brain, Tau-seed associates with a distinct set of proteins enriched in synaptic, mitochondrial, and vesicle-trafficking functions. Cross-species functional screening in Drosophila and mouse models identifies interactors that modulate Tau toxicity and seeding. Spatially resolved analysis of postmortem AD brains reveals heterogenous co-deposition of these proteins with Tau aggregates, suggesting functionally distinct Tau-seed complexes. Together, this dataset provides a framework for understanding selective Tau-seed toxicity and identifies candidate regulators of Tau propagation with therapeutic potential.

">Comparative Transcriptomics Reveals Inflammatory and Epigenetic Programs that Actively Orchestrate Pineal Brain Sand Calcification</a></h4>

              
                Background: The pineal gland secretes melatonin but paradoxically calcifies more than any other intracranial structure, forming hydroxyapatite "brain-sand" (corpora arenacea) that correlates with reduced melatonin output, sleep disruption and heightened neuro-degenerative risk. Whether this mineralization is a passive dystrophic event or an active, bone-like process remains unclear. Methods: Analyzed RNA-seq datasets from pineal glands of six vertebrate species-calcifiers Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus and Capra hircus, versus non-calcifiers Mus musculus, Gallus gallus and Danio rerio. Species-specific transcripts were mapped to human orthologues, merged, and filtered. Phylogenetically informed differential expression testing used Brownian-motion and Pagel's lamda phylogenetic generalized least-squares models, calibrated on a TimeTree divergence phylogeny. Genes significant in both models (|logtwoFC| > 1; FDR < 0.05; lamda < 0.7) were assigned to functional pathways and visualized by PCA, heat-mapping and volcano plots. Results: Calcifying species segregated cleanly from non-calcifiers on the first two principal components, reflecting a shared 103-gene "calcifier module". Top up-regulated transcripts included developmental morphogens (GLI4, IQCE, NOTCH4), epigenetic regulators (SETD1A, ZNF274, ATF7IP), inflammatory mediators (CSF2RB), and quality-control factors (GABARAPL2, RHOT2). Every leading candidate exhibited minimal phylogenetic signal (lamda to 0), indicating that differential expression tracks the calcified phenotype rather than shared ancestry. Conversely, only three genes (RMI2, RASL11B, GPR18) formed a non-calcifier module, suggesting potential protective roles that are down-regulated during mineralization. Conclusions: Pineal calcification is not a passive by-product of aging but a regulated, lineage- restricted program that redeploys Hedgehog, Notch and chromatin-remodeling pathways classically required for skeletal ossification. The ten-gene core signature identified offers a molecular foothold for mechanistic dissection and therapeutic targeting aimed at preserving pineal function and circadian health. Significance This is the first phylogenetically controlled transcriptomic survey to link pineal "brain-sand" formation to specific developmental and inflammatory gene networks, revealing convergent evolution of calcification programs across divergent mammalian lineages.

                Background This study examined the effect of thermocycling on the flexural strength properties of four CAD/CAM ceramic materials at different thicknesses. Methods Four CAD/CAM ceramics of different types: advanced lithium disilicate (ALD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) lithium disilicate (LD), and leucite reinforced (LE), and at three varying thicknesses 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were examined. After subjecting all specimens to 5000 thermomechanical cycles, flexural strength was determined using a universal testing apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for analysis. Two factorial ANOVA models assessed the association of different factors (ceramic type and thickness) with flexural strength and elastic modulus. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted means were computed. A p-value < 0.05 was designated significant. Results ZLS exhibited the highest flexural strength at 1.5 mm thickness, while LD showed the highest Young’s modulus of elasticity. The lowest flexural strength was observed in the 0.5 mm thickness group of all tested groups. There were notable variations in flexural strength across all ceramic materials, with the highest adjusted mean strength in the ZLS group, ALD, LD, and LE, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were noted in ceramic thickness, with 1.5 mm thickness showing the highest strength and 0.5 mm thickness the lowest. Conclusions Ceramic material thickness significantly impacts flexural strength, with 1.5 mm thickness deemed suitable for posterior restorations. Ceramic materials with zirconia fillers or matrix demonstrated higher flexural strength than other ceramics.

                Abstract: Fetal transverse lie with neglected shoulder presentation is a rare but extremely risky complication in labor. It could severely compromise maternal and fetal outcome. Herein, we report the case of a 32-year-old multiparous patient, consulting in labor with a fetal hand prolapsed through the vaginal opening and a transverse presentation that was not known previously. An emergency cesarean section was performed. It allowed the extraction of a living, healthy newborn without further complications. This case report emphasizes the importance of prenatal follow-up, in particular, the screening of abnormal fetal positioning in term pregnancy. It also highlights that a prompt and swift transfer to a well-equipped medical facility is imperative for optimal maternal and fetal management and to ensure a positive outcome.

                Introduction Sexual dysfunctions are common yet underreported side effects of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, affecting 30-80% of treated individuals. These side effects can severely impact social interactions and treatment adherence for individuals with schizophrenia, but comprehensive comparative evidence assessing the risk profiles of different antipsychotics is lacking. This study aims to address this gap using network meta-analysis that integrates data from both randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS). Protocol This systematic review will include both RCTs and NRS focusing on participants with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses, without restrictions on symptoms, gender, ethnicity, age, or setting. For interventions, all second-generation antipsychotics will be included. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of at least one sexual adverse event of any kind. Secondary outcomes will be the occurrence of any sexual adverse event evaluated in men and women separately, and any adverse event related to the three phases of sexual response cycle separately: desire (e.g. libido, sexual thoughts), arousal (e.g. erection, lubrication) and orgasm (e.g. ejaculation, anorgasmia), and any adverse effect related to breast dysfunction and menstruation irregularities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 1 and ROBINS-I will be employed to evaluate the risk of bias for RCTs and NRS, respectively. Single-arm meta-analysis of proportions will synthesize the average frequency of sexual adverse events in treated participants. Pairwise and network meta-analysis of RCTs and NRS will be used to evaluate comparative tolerability. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will explore possible heterogeneity in results and validate the findings’ robustness. The quality of the evidence will be evaluated using GRADE. Discussion This study will provide vital insights into the sexual side effects of antipsychotics by combining evidence from clinical trials and real-world practice, facilitating better decision-making in choosing the optimal antipsychotic for individuals.

                Background Industrial wastewater significantly affects the microbiome and resistome of aquatic ecosystems, posing environmental and public health risks through the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Methods This study systematically reviewed the influence of industrial effluents on microbial community structure and ARG prevalence in receiving water bodies. Results Our findings revealed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominate polluted environments, with beta-lactamases, macrolides, and sulfonamide resistance genes that are frequently detected. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including integrons and plasmids, are critical drivers of ARG horizontal gene transfer. The limited efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in removing ARGs highlights the urgent need for advanced treatment technologies. Comparisons with the existing literature reinforce the role of industrial activities in exacerbating ARG risks and disrupting microbial diversity. Mitigation strategies including stringent regulatory frameworks, advanced filtration methods, and a one-health approach are recommended to address these challenges. Conclusion This study emphasizes the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration and targeted interventions to safeguard environmental and public health from the impacts of industrial wastewater pollution.

[version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent condition. Recent research highlights the role of kinetic chain and core muscle involvement in disease progression, yet evidence for structured core activation protocols such as CARE-KOA© remains limited.This study addresses this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of CARE-KOA©, which specifically targets proximal stability and biomechanical deficits in KOA, aiming to enhance pain, function, and core endurance beyond conventional approaches. Methods This prospective single-group pre-post study assessed the effect of a Participants underwent a 4-week CARE-KOA© regimen (12 supervised sessions, each including a 10-minute warm-up and core-focused exercises). Pre- and post-intervention assessments included pain (Visual Analog Scale, VAS), patient-reported outcomes (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS), physical function tests (30-second sit-to-stand, 40-meter fast-paced walk, stair climb, timed up-and-go), and knee muscle strength and core endurance. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests in JAMOVI. Results Significant improvements were observed in pain at rest (mean change: 1.13 cm, p = 0.0006, d = 1.07) and during activity (mean change: 2.46 cm, p = 0.000001, d = 1.76), patient-reported outcomes (KOOS Pain: p = 0.00003, d = -0.83; KOOS ADL: p = 0.0000009, d = -1.19), and core endurance (p = 0.027, d = 0.21). Physical function tests also improved (stair climb: p = 0.031, d = 0.34; timed up-and-go: p = 0.006, d = 0.13). Muscle strength gains were significant in flexors of the unaffected knee and extensors of the affected knee (p < 0.05), while other muscle groups showed no significant change. Conclusion The CARE-KOA© program led to clinically meaningful improvements in pain, function, and core endurance, highlighting the value of core activation strategies in KOA management. Future research with larger samples and longer follow-up is warranted to confirm these benefits and optimize exercise protocols.

                Background Anorectal hemorrhoids are a common condition that frequently needs surgery in more challenging situations. Both stapled hemorrhoidectomy and conventional hemorrhoidectomy are standard surgical procedures, each one with various advantages and disadvantages as well. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of these two operations concerning patient satisfaction, complications, recovery time and postoperative pain. Method This retrospective cohort analysis was conducted in Karbala, Iraq, at AL-Kafeel Hospital and AL-Safeer Hospital. Information has been collected from patients who had stapled hemorrhoidectomy in 2023–2024 and those who had conventional hemorrhoidectomy from 2015–2018. To account for baseline variations, especially those related to the kind of anesthetic and extent of hemorrhoids, propensity score matching (caliper = 0.05) was employed. SPSS version 29.0 was used for statistical analysis, and comparisons were made by using t-tests, chi-square tests, and correlation analyses. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value of less than 0.05. Results Out of 114 patients (50 conventional, 64 stapled), the stapled group had a higher percentage of fourth-degree hemorrhoids, postoperative pain and bleeding were significantly lower in the stapled group (p < 0.001), and only the conventional group had wound infections and anal stenosis (p < 0.05). The stapled group also showed better postoperative outcomes. Conclusion Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is linked to less pain, fewer complications, and faster recovery than conventional hemorrhoidectomy, but the risk of recurrent hemorrhoidectomy is still a concern. These findings support that surgical decision-making in hemorrhoid management can be optimized.

                Objectives This study aimed to examine health security (HeS) patterns across European Union (EU) member states to address intra-regional disparities in health security, align with EU-wide policy objectives, and propose evidence-based recommendations for harmonizing preparedness measures while respecting national sovereignty Methods This research employed a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making framework, combining the Entropy Weight Method and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo), to assess and rank EU countries, drawing on six Global Health Security Index indicators. K-means clustering classified countries into three performance tiers: High, Intermediate, and Dangerous. Data from the GHSI (2019, 2021) and the aggregated 2017–2021 period were analyzed to track temporal trends and cross-regional performance disparities. A comparative analysis of HeS priorities with the African and Eastern Mediterranean (EMR) Regions further contextualized the EU's HeS landscape. Results Detection and Reporting, and Rapid Response emerged as the most critical dimensions influencing performance, while Risk Environment and Compliance with Norms showed minimal differentiation. High-performing countries, such as Finland and Germany, demonstrated resilience in surveillance and rapid response, while lower-tier nations, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, and Romania, exhibited systemic vulnerabilities in biosecurity and emergency planning. Post-2019, health system resilience gained prominence, while compliance and risk environment remained neglected. The temporal analysis highlighted post-pandemic shifts in health system disparities. Cross-regional comparisons underscoring context-specific challenges. Conclusion This study highlights the need for targeted investments in surveillance systems, laboratory infrastructure, and crisis preparedness to address specific gaps in different clusters. A metrics-driven framework can reduce regional disparities, promoting equity in preparedness. Policymakers should adopt a collaborative approach to mitigate crises, using high-performing clusters as benchmarks.

                In the anterior area of the mouth, the interdental papilla is important for dental hygiene and appearance. When it disappears, unpleasant “black triangles” form, which affects patients’ self-confidence in their smiles and makes oral hygiene more difficult. The loss of interdental papilla is caused by several variables such as tooth shape, periodontal disease, and aging. Although surgical treatments have been utilized to restore or retain missing papilla, their predictability remains unknown. In response, researchers have investigated non-invasive procedures, such as the use of fillers such as hyaluronic acid (HA). Owing to its capacity to increase tissue volume and bind water, HA, a naturally occurring polysaccharide with special rheological qualities, has become a popular choice for use as a dermal filler. It shows promise when used to cure interdental papilla loss; the effects usually last for six–12 months. This review article explores the development and history of papilla rebuilding methods, emphasizing hyaluronic acid as a cutting-edge and successful method for regaining both periodontal health and aesthetics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-332/v2?src=rss">Are Narrative CVs contributing towards shifting research culture? Workshop Report from the 2023 Recognition and Rewards Festival [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Over the past decade, calls for research assessment reform have grown, led by initiatives such as the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the Leiden Manifesto, and, more recently, the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA). A key element being discussed as part of research assessment reform is a shift towards more qualitative assessments, focussed on the content of research and the broad skills and competencies of researchers, and the array of contributions they make to knowledge creation and innovation. Narrative CV formats have emerged as a good practice example for enabling qualitative assessments of research projects and researchers, and are becoming more widely piloted and implemented. Methods As part of the 2023 Dutch Recognition and Rewards Festival, the authors hosted a workshop to gather perspectives on Narrative CVs, including whether and how they may contribute to shifts in research culture that are needed to support research assessment reform. Results Participants, representing research organisations and the research community, discussed both beneficial and critical aspects of narrative-style CV implementations from their experiences. The effects observed since narrative CVs have been implemented were discussed, with perspectives provided on career prospects and the empowerment of the research community to direct change. Finally, the discussion turned to expectations for the future, with workshop participants calling for focus on the roles that narrative-style CVs can play in improving research careers, recognition of collaborative work, and equality, diversity, and inclusion. A short informal survey exploring levels of implementation of narrative CVs across different research organisations was run prior to the workshop, the results of which are also presented as part of this report. Discussion The authors intend to expand this discussion to other scientific and policy conferences, and this report serves as a basis for a wider and deeper dialogue in the community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-549/v2?src=rss">ALL-IN meta-analysis: breathing life into living systematic reviews and prospective meta-analyses [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Science is justly admired as a cumulative process (“standing on the shoulders of giants”), yet scientific knowledge is typically built on a patchwork of research contributions without much coordination. This lack of efficiency has specifically been addressed in clinical research by recommendations against avoidable research waste and for living systematic reviews and prospective meta-analysis. We propose to further those recommendations with ALL-IN meta-analysis: Anytime Live and Leading INterim meta-analysis. ALL-IN provides meta-analysis based on e-values and anytime-valid confidence intervals that can be updated at any time—reanalyzing after each new observation while retaining type-I error and coverage guarantees, live—no need to prespecify the looks, and leading—in the decisions on whether individual studies should be initiated, stopped or expanded, the meta-analysis can be the leading source of information without losing validity to accumulation bias. The analysis design requires no information about the trial sample sizes or the number of trials eventually included. So ALL-IN meta-analysis can be applied retrospectively as well as prospectively, to evaluate the evidence once or sequentially. Because the intention of the analysis does not change the validity of the results, the results of the analysis can change the intentions (‘optional stopping’ and ‘optional continuation’ based on the results so far). On the one hand: any analysis can be turned into a living one, or even become prospective and real-time by updating with new trial data and including interim data from trials that are still ongoing — without any changes in the cut-offs for testing or the method for interval estimation. On the other hand: no stopping rule needs to be enforced for the analysis to remain valid, so participating in a prospective meta-analysis does not require outside control over data collection. Hence ALL-IN meta-analysis breathes life into living systematic reviews, and offers better and simpler statistics, efficiency, collaboration and communication.

                <p>by Yan Miao, Xuan Tang, Chunyu Wang, Zhenyuan Sun, Guohua Wang, Shan Huang</p>

Circular RNA, a class of RNA molecules gaining widespread attentions, has been widely recognized as a potential biomarker for many diseases. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of the associations between circRNA and diseases. However, traditional experimental methods are often inefficient and costly, making computational models an effective alternative. Nevertheless, existing computational methods still face challenges such as data sparsity and the difficulty of confirming negative samples, which limits the accuracy of predictions. To address these challenges, a novel computational method, namely MVHGCN, is proposed based on multi-view and graph convolutional networks to predict potential associations between circRNA and diseases. MVHGCN first constructs a heterogeneous graph and generates feature descriptors by integrating multiple databases. Then it extracts different connection views of circRNA and diseases through meta-paths, maximizing the utilization of known association information, and aggregates deep feature information through graph convolutional networks. Finally, a MLP is used to predict the association scores. The experimental results show that MVHGCN significantly outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets by 5-fold cross-validation. This research provides an effective new approach to studying the associations between circRNAs and diseases, capable of alleviating the problem of data sparsity and accurately identifying potential associations.

                <p>by Nicholas A. Rondoni, Fan Lu, Daniel B. Turner-Evans, Marcella Gomez</p>

Calcium imaging techniques, such as two-photon imaging, have become a powerful tool to explore the functions of neurons and the connectivity of their circuitry. Frequently, fluorescent calcium indicators are taken as a direct measure of neuronal activity. These indicators, however, are slow relative to behavior, obscuring functional relationships between an animal’s movements and the true neuronal activity. As a consequence, the firing rate of a neuron is a more meaningful metric. Converting calcium imaging data to the firing of a neuron is nontrivial. Most state-of-the-art methods depend largely on non-mechanistic modeling frameworks such as neural networks, which do not illuminate the underlying chemical exchanges within the neuron, require significant data to be trained on, and cannot be implemented in real-time. Leveraging modeling frameworks from chemical reaction networks (CRN) coupled with a control theoretic approach, a new algorithm is presented leveraging a fully deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. This framework utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to challenge state-of-the-art correlation scores while retaining interpretability. Furthermore, these computations can be done in real time, thus, enabling online experimentation informed by neuronal firing rates. To demonstrate the use cases of this architecture, it is tested on ground truth datasets courtesy of the <i>spikefinder</i> challenge. Finally, we propose potential applications of the model for guiding experimental design.

                Schneiderova et al. demonstrate an association between EBV reactivation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and host interleukin 1 genetics in individuals with long COVID. Anti-VCA IgA serum levels, a strong marker of recent EBV reactivation, are associated with a high latent EBV load in blood and objective long-term pulmonary dysfunction in long COVID.

                The mechanism of leptin resistance, the major contributor to DIO, remains elusive. Li et al. found that leptin receptor-negative Arc GABAergic neurons (non-LepR neurons) were activated by HFD feeding, that their activation caused leptin-resistant obesity, and that inhibition reduced/reversed DIO, revealing aberrant activation of these neurons as an alternative mechanism underlying leptin resistance.

                Van Hooff et al. reconstruct the evolutionary histories of eukaryotic SMC complexes, molecular machineries that organize chromosomes. SMC complexes were fully present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) but have been frequently lost during evolution. Remarkably, these complexes originated from an ancient duplication in archaeal ancestors, suggesting that sophisticated chromosome organization predated eukaryotes.

Specifically, SLC44A1 deletion in oligodendrocytes inhibits myelin sheath formation due to decreased plasmalogen synthesis. Choline transporters may be potential targets for myelin deficit-related diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103714">Salmonella exploits host- and bacterial-derived β-alanine for replication inside host macrophages</a></h4>

              
                <i>Salmonella</i> is a major foodborne pathogen that can effectively replicate inside host macrophages to establish life-threatening systemic infections. <i>Salmonella</i> must utilize diverse nutrients for growth in nutrient-poor macrophages, but which nutrients are required for intracellular <i>Salmonella</i> growth is largely unknown. Here, we found that either acquisition from the host or de novo synthesis of a nonprotein amino acid, β-alanine, is critical for <i>Salmonella</i> replication inside macrophages. The concentration of β-alanine is decreased in <i>Salmonella</i>-infected macrophages, while the addition of exogenous β-alanine enhances <i>Salmonella</i> replication in macrophages, suggesting that <i>Salmonella</i> can uptake host-derived β-alanine for intracellular growth. Moreover, the expression of <i>panD,</i> the rate-limiting gene required for β-alanine synthesis in <i>Salmonella,</i> is upregulated when <i>Salmonella</i> enters macrophages. Mutation of <i>panD</i> impaired <i>Salmonella</i> replication in macrophages and colonization in the mouse liver and spleen, indicating that de novo synthesis of β-alanine is essential for intracellular <i>Salmonella</i> growth and systemic infection. Additionally, we revealed that β-alanine influences <i>Salmonella</i> intracellular replication and in vivo virulence partially by increasing expression of the zinc transporter genes <i>znuABC</i>, which in turn facilitates the uptake of the essential micronutrient zinc by <i>Salmonella</i>. Taken together, these findings highlight the important role of β-alanine in the intracellular replication and virulence of <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>panD</i> is a promising target for controlling systemic <i>Salmonella</i> infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101128">Efficacy and mechanism of action of cipargamin as an antibabesial drug candidate</a></h4>

              
                Babesiosis is a disease brought on by intraerythrocytic parasites of the genus <i>Babesia</i>. Current chemotherapies are accompanied by side effects and parasite relapse. Therefore, it is crucial to develop highly effective drugs against <i>Babesia</i>. Cipargamin (CIP) has shown inhibition against apicomplexan parasites, mainly <i>Plasmodium</i> and <i>Toxoplasma</i>. This study evaluated the growth-inhibiting properties of CIP against <i>Babesia</i> spp. and investigated the mechanism of CIP on <i>B. gibsoni</i>. The half inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of CIP against the in vitro growth of <i>B. bovis</i> and <i>B. gibsoni</i> were 20.2 ± 1.4 and 69.4 ± 2.2 nM, respectively. CIP significantly inhibited the growth of <i>B. microti</i> and <i>B. rodhaini</i> in vivo. Resistance was conferred by L921V and L921I mutations in BgATP4, which reduced the sensitivity to CIP by 6.1- and 12.8-fold. The inhibitory potency of CIP against BgATP4-associated ATPase activity was moderately reduced in mutant strains, with a 1.3- and 2.4-fold decrease in BgATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and BgATP4<sup>L921I</sup>, respectively, compared to that of BgATP4<sup>WT</sup>. An in silico investigation revealed reductions in affinity for CIP binding to BgATP4<sup>L921V</sup> and BgATP4<sup>L921I</sup> compared to BgATP4<sup>WT</sup>. Resistant strains showed no significant cross-resistance to atovaquone or tafenoquine succinate (TQ), with less than a onefold change in IC<sub>50</sub> values. Combining CIP with TQ effectively eliminated <i>B. microti</i> infection in SCID mice with no relapse, and parasite DNA was not detected by qPCR within 90 days post-infection. Our findings reveal the efficacy of CIP as an antibabesial agent, its limitations as a monotherapy due to resistance development, and the potential of combination therapy with TQ to overcome said resistance and achieve complete parasite clearance.

">Classifying Resting State Connectivity: Lag-One Autocorrelation and Pattern Differentiability</a></h4>

              
                Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and resting state effective connectivity (rsEC) are two of the most common measures that can be extracted from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. RSFC is often used to indicate the statistical dependencies among different brain regions of interest, whereas rsEC describes the causal influences among them. Many studies have explored utilities of rsFC and rsEC measures for classifying psychiatric conditions. Several studies showed that rsEC were better than rsFC features for classifying major depression (Frassle et al., 2020; Geng et al., 2018) and schizophrenia ((Brodersen et al., 2014)). However, no study to-date has investigated whether rsEC is inherently better than rsFC for classifying psychiatric conditions or the impact of autocorrelation on classifying rsFC, even though autocorrelation is known to be present in rs-fMRI data. To fill these gaps, we performed a series of computational experiments, by varying the size of the network and the number of participants, to gain some insight into these two aspects of supervised classification with resting state connectivity. Contrary to what has been reported in the literature, the results from our study suggest that rsEC cannot be, in principle, better than rsFC features for classification. In fact, rsEC measures led to systematically worse classification results, compared to rsFC features. In terms of the impact of autocorrelation, we found that lag-one autocorrelation could lead to both false negative and false positive classification results for studies with a small sample size.

">Enhancing Functional Connectivity Analysis in Task-Based fMRI Using the BOLD-Filter Method: Greater Network and Activation Voxel Sensitivities</a></h4>

              
                Task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) has gained prominence for investigating brain connectivity by engaging specific functional networks during cognitive or behavioral tasks. Compared to resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), tb-fMRI provides greater specificity and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for examining task-relevant networks and individual differences in brain function. In this study, we evaluated the utility of the BOLD-filter-a method originally developed to extract reliable BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) components from rs-fMRI-by applying it to tb-fMRI data as a preprocessing step for functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The goal was to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of detecting task-induced functional activity. Compared to the conventional preprocessing method, the BOLD-filter substantially improved the isolation of task-evoked BOLD signals. It identified over eleven times more activation voxels at a high statistical threshold and more than twice as many at a lower threshold. Moreover, FC networks derived from BOLD-filtered signals revealed clearer task-related patterns, including gender-specific differences in brain regions linked to everyday behaviors. These patterns were not detectable using standard preprocessing approaches. Our findings demonstrate that the BOLD-filter enhances the robustness and interpretability of FC analysis in tb-fMRI. By effectively isolating meaningful functional networks, this approach offers significant advantages over conventional preprocessing methods. The BOLD-filter holds promise for advancing both basic neuroscience research and clinical applications by enabling more precise characterization of task-induced brain activity.

                The brain is a disproportionately large consumer of fuel, estimated to expend ~20% of the whole-body energy budget, and therefore it is critical to adequately control brain fuel expenditures while satisfying its on-demand needs for continued function. The brain is also metabolically vulnerable as the inability to adequately fuel cellular processes that support information transfer between cells leads to rapid neurological impairment. We show here that a genetic driver of early onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE), SLC13A5, a Na+/citrate cotransporter (NaCT), is critical for gating the activation of local presynaptic glycolysis. We show that SLC13A5 is in part localized to a presynaptic pool of membrane-bound organelles and acts to transiently clear axonal citrate during electrical activity, in turn activating phosphofructokinase 1. We show that loss of SLC13A5 or mistargeting to the plasma membrane results in suppressed glycolytic gating, activity dependent presynaptic bioenergetic deficits and synapse dysfunction.

">High-speed whole-brain imaging in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in brain-wide recordings of small animals such as worms, fish, and flies have revealed complex activity involving large populations of neurons. In the Drosophila brain, with about 140,000 neurons, brain-wide recordings have been critical to uncovering widespread sensory and motor activity. However, current limitations in volumetric imaging rates hinder the accurate capture of fast neural dynamics. To improve the speed of volumetric imaging in Drosophila, we leverage the recently introduced light beads microscopy (LBM) method. We built a microscope and a LBM module tailored to fly brain experiments and used it to record brain-wide calcium signals in adult behaving flies at 28 volumes per second and at 60 volumes per second when selecting the central brain alone. We uncover fast-timescale auditory responses that are missed with standard volumetric imaging. We also demonstrate how temporal super-resolution can be combined with LBM data to uncover responses to single Drosophila courtship song pulses. This establishes LBM as a viable tool for capturing whole-brain activity at high spatial and temporal resolution in the fly.

">A model investigation of short-term synaptic plasticity tuned via Unc13 isoforms.</a></h4>

              
                Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is a fundamental mechanism of neural computation supporting a variety of nervous system functions from sensory adaptation and gain control to working memory and decision making. At the presynaptic release site, an interplay between distinct (M)Unc13 protein isoforms is suggested to orchestrate depressing and facilitating components of STP. In this study, we introduce a modification of the well-established Tsodyks-Markram Model (TMM) for STP. We constrain our model by in vivo intracellular recordings in the olfactory system of the fruit fly, where previous work suggested Unc13A to provide a phasic, depressing and Unc13B a tonic, facilitating release component. A combination of a facilitating and a depressing model component indeed allowed for accurate model fits. Differential knock-down experiments of the Unc13A and Unc13B gene variants provide biological model interpretation, linking the protein-specific molecular mechanisms to synaptic function and STP. Our mathematical formulation of protein-dependent STP can be readily and efficiently used to design biologically realistic spiking neural network models that feature different genetically defined synapse types.

">Resolving synaptic events using subsynaptically targeted GCaMP8 variants</a></h4>

              
                While genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators are valuable for visualizing neural activity, their speed and sensitivity have had limited performance when compared to chemical dyes and electrophysiology, particularly at synaptic compartments. We addressed these limitations by engineering a suite of next-generation GCaMP8-based indicators, targeted to presynaptic boutons, active zones, and postsynaptic compartments at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. We first validated these sensors to be superior to previous versions. Next, we developed a new Python-based analysis program, CaFire, which enables the automated quantification of evoked and spontaneous Ca2+ signals. Using CaFire, we show a ratiometric presynaptic GCaMP8m sensor accurately captures physiologically-relevant presynaptic Ca2+ changes with superior sensitivity and similar kinetics compared to chemical dyes. Moreover, we test the ability of an active zone-targeted, ratiometric GCaMP8f sensor to report differences in Ca2+ between release sites. Finally, a newly engineered postsynaptic GCaMP8m, positioned near glutamate receptors, detects quantal events with temporal and signal resolution comparable to electrophysiological recordings. These next generation indicators and analytical methods demonstrate that GCaMP8 sensors, targeted to synaptic compartments, can now achieve the speed and sensitivity necessary to resolve Ca2+ dynamics at levels previously only attainable with chemical dyes or electrophysiology.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Decision-making is typically influenced by past choices. Previous studies have shown that the activity of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is involved in reward value coding, can be modulated by the reward values of previously chosen options. To further explore how the OFC processes the history of choice-related factors (HCF) from past choices, we analyzed the neuronal activity recorded in the monkey OFC during a decision-making task in which the monkeys could choose between two options based on their reward values. We found that the activity of over 70% of neurons was better explained by models that incorporated HCF than by models without it. The activity of these neurons during current choice was influenced by HCF in the previous trial. Additionally, some types of HCF were represented in these neurons between trials, suggesting that this information was maintained in the OFC and used to guide future decisions. Furthermore, a significant difference was observed in the choice reaction times between trials sorted by HCF. Pharmacological inactivation of the OFC by muscimol infusion eliminated such behavioral differences. These results indicate that HCF-modulated OFC activity contributes to the behavioral bias during current decision-making.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study explores how the morphology of the left occipito-temporal sulcus and anterior cingulate cortex relates to reading and writing abilities. The occipito-temporal sulcus, which houses the visual word form area (VWFA), and the anterior cingulate cortex, involved in cognitive control, are key regions for literacy. Structural MRI scans from 38 children (aged 8 to 11) and 23 adults (aged 20 to 40) were analyzed to identify their sulcal patterns. Reading and writing (spelling and graphomotor) performance was assessed using standardized tests indexing both accuracy and speed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the left posterior occipito-temporal sulcus was associated with reading scores in both children and adults, and with graphomotor scores in children only. The anterior occipito-temporal sulcus and right hemisphere occipito-temporal sulcus also contributed to reading and writing outcomes. Anterior cingulate cortex asymmetry was linked to graphomotor performance in both age groups, highlighting its role in writing development. Since sulcal patterns are established prenatally and remain stable over time, the findings suggest that differences in literacy may partly originate from early brain development, alongside the neuroplastic effects of education and socioeconomic factors. This research underscores the interplay between early brain development, literacy, and the neuroplasticity shaped by learning experiences throughout life.</span>

                <p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the central circadian clock in mammals, coordinating daily rhythms in both behavior and physiology. In the SCN, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-producing neurons (GRPNs) are predominantly located in the core region, suggesting their possible involvement in photic entrainment. However, the specific contribution of GRPNs to the regulation of circadian rhythms remains poorly understood. This study utilized a Cre-driver mouse line, <I>Grp-iCre</I> knock-in (KI) mice, in which Cre recombinase is exclusively expressed in GRPNs, allowing the selective manipulation of SCN GRPNs to investigate their characteristics and functional roles in circadian regulation. All experiments were conducted in adult male mice. Anatomical tracing revealed that SCN GRPNs primarily project to the thalamus and hypothalamus, whereas input mapping demonstrated that SCN GRPNs receive most synaptic inputs from within the SCN. Behavioral analyses revealed that neither GRP deficiency nor ablation of SCN GRPNs significantly affected circadian locomotor activity rhythms or photic entrainment. However, chemogenetic stimulation of the SCN GRPNs is sufficient to induce phase shifts in behavioral rhythms. Additionally, calcium imaging with fiber photometry indicated that SCN GRPNs quickly responded to photic stimulation, with increased neural activity following retinal exposure to white light. These findings suggest that SCN GRPNs play a role in photic entrainment, albeit potentially redundant with other neuronal populations such as vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing neurons.</p>

                <p>Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are intermittent, fast synchronous oscillations that play a pivotal role in memory formation. It has been well established that SWRs occur during "consummatory behaviors," e.g., eating or drinking a reward for correct action. However, most of typical behavioral experiments using freely moving rodents have not rigorously distinguished between the act of eating/drinking (regardless of consummation or consumption) from stopping locomotion (immobility). Therefore, in this study, we investigated the occurrence of SWRs during a reward-seeking action and subsequent consummatory reward licking in constantly immobile rats (male and female) maintained under head fixation and body covering. Immobile rats performed a pedal hold&ndash;release action that was rewarded with water every other time (false and true consummation). Unexpectedly, the SWRs remarkably decreased during reward licking as well as pedal release action. Untrained rats also showed a similar SWR decrease during water licking. Conversely, SWRs gradually increased during the pedal hold period, which was enhanced by reward expectation. A cluster of hippocampal neurons responded to cue/pedal release and reward, as previously shown. Some other clusters exhibited spike activity changes similar to the SWR occurrence, i.e., decreasing during the pedal release action and reward licking, and enhanced by reward expectation during pedal hold period. These task event-responsive neurons and SWR-like neurons displayed stronger spiking synchrony with SWRs than task-unrelated neurons. These findings suggest that the hippocampus generates SWRs, which may associate action with outcome, in "relative immobility" (action pauses) rather than specific consummation or consumption.</p>

                <p>Dynorphin (DYN)/-opioid receptor (KOR) activation contributes to aversion, dysphoria, sedation, depression, and enhanced psychostimulant-rewarding effects by inhibiting dopamine (DA) release. The precise neuronal mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear, limiting the use of KOR agonists in treating mood and substance use disorders. DYN fibers form synapses with DA terminals that express KOR and dopamine transporter (DAT), which is crucial for regulating DA dynamics and related behaviors. Previously, we demonstrated that KOR agonists upregulate DAT activity via ERK1/2 signaling involving phospho-Thr53 DAT (pT53-DAT). However, it remains unclear whether pT53-DAT is involved in KOR-mediated DAT regulation in vivo and whether such a phenomenon contributes to the behavioral effects of KOR agonism. In this study, we utilized male DAT-Ala53 knock-in mice with nonphosphorylatable Ala at position 53 to investigate the role of pT53-DAT in KOR-mediated DAT regulation and its behavioral effects. KOR agonist U69593 increased KOR antagonist-sensitive DAT activity, DAT <I>V</I><SUB>max</SUB>, pT53-DAT, and surface expression in WT but not in DAT-Ala53 mice. KOR agonists caused locomotor suppression, conditioned place aversion (CPA), and enhanced cocaine preference [conditioned place preference (CPP)] in WT but not in DAT-Ala53 mice. Conversely, both WT and DAT-Ala53 mice exhibited similar lithium chloride-induced CPA and morphine-induced CPP. These findings provide the first causal evidence that KOR-mediated locomotor suppression, aversive response, and enhancement of cocaine reward manifest through the modulation of DAT activity via DAT-Thr53 phosphorylation. This suggests that targeting specific DAT-regulatory motif(s) may help develop new KOR-directed therapeutic strategies devoid of adverse effects.</p>

                <p>Spatial frequency (SF) selectivity serves as a fundamental building block within the visual system, determining what we can and cannot see. Attention is theorized to augment the visibility of items in our environment by changing how we process SFs. However, the specific neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear, particularly in humans. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure voxel-wise population SF tuning (pSFT), which allowed us to examine how attention alters the SF response profiles of neural populations in the early visual cortex (V1&ndash;V3). In the scanner, participants (five female, three male) were cued to covertly attend to one of two spatially competing letter streams, each defined by low or high SF content. This task promoted feature-based attention directed to a particular SF, as well as the suppression of the irrelevant stream's SF. Concurrently, we measured pSFT in a task-irrelevant hemifield to examine how the known spatial spread of feature-based attention influenced the SF tuning properties of neurons sampled within a voxel. We discovered that attention elicited attractive shifts in SF preference, toward the attended SF. This suggests that attention can profoundly influence populations of SF preference across the visual field, depending on task goals and native neural preferences.</p>

                <p>While animal studies have found that arousal states modulate visual responses, direct evidence for effects of arousal on human vision remains limited. Here, we used fMRI to examine effects of cognitive arousal on the gain of contrast response functions (CRFs) in human visual cortex. To measure CRFs, we measured BOLD responses in early visual cortex (V1&ndash;V3) while participants (<I>n</I> = 20, 14 females and 6 males) viewed stimuli that parametrically varied in contrast. To induce different cognitive arousal states, participants solved auditory arithmetic problems categorized as either Easy (low arousal) or Hard (high arousal). We found diversity in the modulatory effects across individuals: some individuals exhibited enhanced neural response with increased arousal, whereas others exhibited the opposite effect&mdash;a decrease in response with increased arousal. The pattern of overall BOLD modulation showed within-individual stability and was correlated with the degree of arousal-driven change in pupil size. Individuals who exhibited larger increases in pupil size with the arousal manipulation tended to show greater arousal-related decreases in visuocortical responses. We speculate that the polarity of the modulatory effect by cognitive arousal may relate to individual differences in cognitive effort expended in the high-difficulty condition, with individuals reaching different points on an underlying non-monotonic function.</p>

                <p>Neuronal activity in the olfactory bulb (OB) drives coordinated activity in the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network during early development. Inhibiting OB output in neonatal mice disrupts functional development of the hippocampal formation as well as cognitive abilities. These impairments manifest early in life and resemble dysfunctions of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex that have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, we investigated OB activity during early development in a disease mouse model and asked whether activity disruptions might contribute to the dysfunctional development of the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network. We addressed this question by combining in vivo electrophysiology with behavioral assessment of immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice of both sexes that mimic the dual genetic&ndash;environmental etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. In wild-type mice, we found high DISC1 expression levels in OB projection neurons during development. Furthermore, neuronal and network activity in the OB and the drive from the bulb to the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network were reduced in immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice during early development. This early deficit did not affect odor-evoked activity and odor perception but resulted in impaired long-term odor memory. We propose that reduced spontaneous activity in the developing OB might contribute to altered maturation of the hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal network, leading to memory impairment in immune-challenged <I>Disc1<sup>+/&ndash;</sup></I> mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e1087242025?rss=1">The Molecular Substrates of Second-Order Conditioned Fear in the Basolateral Amygdala Complex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Rats quickly learn to fear a stimulus (e.g., a light) that signals brief but painful footshock. The consolidation of this first-order conditioned fear requires transcription and translation of specific genes in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Rats also learn to fear the associates of first-order conditioned stimuli, such as a sound paired with the already-conditioned light. The consolidation of this second-order conditioned fear also requires transcriptional processes in the BLA, but unlike consolidation of first-order fear, it is unaffected by BLA infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Accordingly, this study sought to identify genes/pathways that regulate second-order conditioned fear in male rats. It focused on the involvement of immediate early genes, as these can be transcribed in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. In Experiment 1, we used a principal components analysis of PCR data and found that second-order fear conditioning involves region- and time-specific changes in a network of genes including the immediate early genes <I>bdnf</I> and <I>egr1</I>. In Experiments 2&ndash;4, we used BLA infusions of antisense oligonucleotides and found that <I>bdnf</I> is required for consolidation of both first- and second-order fears but is not required for reconsolidation of either and <I>egr1</I> is not required for consolidation of first-order fear but is required for acquisition of second-order fear and reconsolidation of both types of fear. Hence, <I>bdnf</I> and <I>egr1</I> regulate different aspects of first- and second-order fear conditioning in the BLA. These findings are discussed with respect to novel forms of information processing in the mammalian brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e1447242025?rss=1">The Functional Anatomy of Nociception: Effective Connectivity in Chronic Pain and Placebo Response</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic pain presents a widespread and complex clinical puzzle, necessitating theoretical approaches. This study expands upon our evolving comprehension of the brain&rsquo;s top-down information processing, encompassing functions such as prediction, expectation, and attention. These processes are believed to play a substantial role in shaping both chronic pain and placebo responses. To examine hierarchical cortical processing in pain, we define a minimal cortical pain network comprising the lateral frontal pole, the primary somatosensory cortex, and posterior insula. Using spectral dynamic causal modeling on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we compare effective connectivity among these regions in chronic osteoarthritic patients (<I>n</I> = 54) and healthy controls (<I>n</I> = 18), and further analyze differences in placebo responders and non-responders within the patient group. Our findings reveal distinct patterns of altered top-down, bottom-up, and recurrent (i.e., intrinsic)  effective connectivity within the network in chronic pain and placebo response. Specifically, recurrent connectivity within the lateral frontal pole becomes more inhibitory, while backward connectivity (higher-to-lower cortical regions) decreases in both pain perceivers and placebo responders. Conversely, forward connections show opposite patterns: nociception is associated with more excitatory (disinhibited) connections, whereas placebo responses correspond to more inhibitory forward connections. The associated effect sizes were sufficiently large to survive a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis of predictive validity. The observed alterations are consistent with predictive processing accounts of placebo effects and chronic pain. Overall, effective extrinsic and intrinsic connectivity among cortical regions involved in pain processing emerge as potentially valuable and quantifiable markers of pain perception and placebo response.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/25/e1488242025?rss=1">Complex Impact of Stimulus Envelope on Motor Synchronization to Sound</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human brain tracks temporal regularities in acoustic signals faithfully. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown complex modulations of synchronized neural activities to the shape of stimulus envelopes. How to connect neural responses to different envelope shapes with listeners&rsquo; perceptual ability to synchronize to acoustic rhythms requires further characterization. Here, we examine motor and sensory synchronization to noise stimuli with periodic amplitude modulations (AM) in human participants (14 females, 10 males). We used three envelope shapes that varied in the sharpness of amplitude onset. In a synchronous motor finger-tapping task, we show that participants more consistently align their taps to the same phase of stimulus envelope when listening to stimuli with sharp onsets than to those with gradual onsets. This effect is replicated in a sensory synchronization task, suggesting a sensory basis for the facilitated phase alignment to sharp-onset stimuli. Surprisingly, despite less consistent tap alignments to the envelope of gradual-onset stimuli, participants are equally effective in extracting the rate of amplitude modulation from both sharp and gradual-onset stimuli, and they tapped consistently at that rate alongside the acoustic input. This result demonstrates that robust tracking of the rate of acoustic periodicity is achievable without the presence of sharp acoustic edges or consistent phase alignment to stimulus envelope. Our findings are consistent with assuming distinct processes for phase and rate tracking during sensorimotor synchronization. These processes are most likely underpinned by different neural mechanisms whose relative strengths are modulated by specific temporal dynamics of stimulus envelope characteristics.</p>

                <p>Reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in the human brain has been inferred through somatic retroinsertion/retrotransposition events; however, actual endogenous enzymatic activities and sources remain unclear. L1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons bicistronically express ORF2, containing RT and endonuclease (EN) domains, and RNA-binding protein ORF1, together enabling L1 retrotransposition and contributing to somatic genomic mosaicism. Here, we assessed endogenous RT activities and L1 mRNA diversity from cerebral cortex samples of 31 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and nondiseased (ND) brains (both sexes) using enzymatic functional assays, targeted PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, and quantitative spatial transcriptomics. Expected bicistronic, full-length L1 transcripts were absent from most samples, constituting &lt;0.01% of L1 sequences, of which &gt;80% were noncoding. Monocistronic ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts were identified across all samples, consistent with quantitative spatial transcriptomics that identified discordant ORF2 and ORF1 expression in neurons. All brains had RT activity, with AD samples showing less activity, consistent with neuronal loss of terminal AD versus aged ND donors. Brain RT activity was higher in the gray matter and correlated with increased neuronal ORF2 expression, further supporting neuronal contributions. Remarkably, &gt;550 protein-encoding, poly(A<sup>+</sup>) ORF2 sequence variants were identified, over two times more than identified in the human reference genome (hg38). Experimental overexpression of full-length and truncated ORF2 variants revealed ~50-fold RT and ~1.3-fold EN activity ranges, supporting endogenous functional capacity of monocistronic ORF2 variants in the human brain. The vast sequence diversity of monocistronic ORF2 mRNAs could underlie functional differences in RT-mediated somatic gene recombination/retroinsertion and resulting genomic mosaicism in the normal and diseased brain.</p>

                <p>This study examined how amyloid burden affects structural and functional brain network topology in subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a risk condition for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Functional and structural brain networks were analyzed in 100 individuals with SCD and 86 normal controls (NC; both sexes included) using resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging. Topological properties of brain networks were evaluated as indicators of information exchange efficiency and network robustness. Amyloid burden in 55 SCD participants was measured using amyloid PET imaging and a frequency-based staging method, which defined global and regional amyloid burden for four anatomical stages. Compared with NC, individuals with SCD exhibited increased functional nodal efficiency and structural nodal betweenness in the left anterior and median cingulate gyri, with no differences in network-level properties. Amyloid staging revealed four cortical divisions: Stage 1, fusiform and lateral temporal gyri; Stage 2, occipital areas; Stage 3, default mode network (DMN), midline brain, and lateral frontotemporal areas; and Stage 4, the remaining cortex. The global and regional amyloid burdens of each cortical stage were positively associated with the node-level properties of a set of DMN hubs, with the left anterior and posterior cingulate gyri being congruently associated with all amyloid stages. These findings suggest that amyloid burden continuously influences network adaptations through DMN hubs, irrespective of local proximity to pathology. Increased nodal properties in cortical hubs may reflect heightened information-processing demands during early amyloid deposition in this population at risk for AD.</p>

                <p>Self-related representation can enhance perception and memory&mdash;a phenomenon known as the self-referential effect (SRE). While SRE has been linked to the activation of the default mode network (DMN), including the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (Pcu/PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the underlying neurochemical processes of DMN activations remain unclear. The balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) within brain circuits is crucial for cognition and may play a role in the SRE. We examine whether the ratio of glutamate/glutamine (Glx) to -aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations, measured by <sup>1</sup>H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) as a proxy measure for E/I balance, is associated with DMN neural processes involved in self-referential encoding. Fifty-four healthy participants aged 7&ndash;35 (25 female) underwent MRS to measure levels of Glx and GABA in Pcu/PCC and completed an fMRI scan during an encoding task that involved self-referential and semantic judgments. We found that the self-related condition led to better subsequent memory and greater activation in the Pcu/PCC compared with the semantic condition. Activations in the Pcu/PCC were positively correlated with the Glx/GABA+ ratio. Task-dependent functional connectivity analysis revealed that connectivity between the Pcu/PCC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was positively associated with both the Glx/GABA+ ratio and the SRE effect on recollection accuracy. Furthermore, mediation analysis showed that a higher Glx/GABA+ ratio correlated with better SRE on memory recollection through increased Pcu/PCC&ndash;mPFC connectivity. Our study provides valuable insights into how neurochemical activity is associated with self-related cognition via functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks.</p>

                <p>Glymphatic transport in rodents has primarily been studied using cisterna magna cannulation (CMC), a minimally invasive method for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracers infusion. However, CMC is suboptimal due to the lack of bony structures to stabilize the cannula, leading to potential movement artifacts. Here, we present an alternative approach involving chronic cannulation of the lateral ventricles of mice for CSF tracer delivery. A direct comparison demonstrated that intraventricular cannulation (IVC) reproduces CMC results in vivo, including perivascular labeling of the middle cerebral artery, which was further confirmed by ex vivo analysis. IVC enables tracer infusion in awake mice, facilitating glymphatic transport studies in conjunction with behavioral assessments that were previously unattainable. Additionally, IVC supports repeated infusions in awake animals, offering the potential to reduce the number of experimental animals required. This study establishes IVC as a robust alternative for studying glymphatic transport and associated physiological processes.</p>

Vaccination against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) generates an antibody response that shows large inter-individual variability. This variability complicates the use of antibody levels as a correlate of protection and the evaluation of population- and individual-level infection risk without access to broad serological testing. Here, we applied a mathematical model of antibody kinetics to capture individual anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody trajectories and to identify factors driving the humoral immune response. Subsequently, we evaluated model predictions and inferred the corresponding duration of protection for new individuals based on a single antibody measurement, assuming sparse access to serological testing. We observe a reduced antibody response in older and in male individuals, and in individuals with autoimmune diseases, diabetes and immunosuppression, using data from a longitudinal cohort study conducted in healthcare workers at Sheba Medical Center, Israel, following primary vaccination with the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Our results further suggest that model predictions of an individual’s antibody response to vaccination can be used to predict the duration of protection when serological data is limited, highlighting the potential of our approach to estimate infection risk over time on both the population and individual level to support public health decision-making in future pandemics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013180">Embodied decisions as active inference</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matteo Priorelli, Ivilin Peev Stoianov, Giovanni Pezzulo</p>

Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This <i>decide-then-act</i> perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions—called <i>embodied decisions</i>—that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to “change mind” between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference—a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings – namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.

                <p>by Amit Yaron, Tomoyo Shiramatsu-Isoguchi, Felix B. Kern, Kenichi Ohki, Hirokazu Takahashi, Zenas C. Chao</p>

Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability—key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.

                <p>by Ling S. Loh, Joseph J. Hanly, Alexander Carter, Martik Chatterjee, Martina Tsimba, Donya N. Shodja, Luca Livraghi, Christopher R. Day, Robert D. Reed, W. Owen McMillan, Gregory A. Wray, Arnaud Martin</p>

The evolution of sexual secondary characteristics necessitates regulatory factors that confer sexual identity to differentiating tissues and cells. In <i>Colias eurytheme</i> butterflies, males exhibit two specialized wing scale types—ultraviolet-iridescent (UVI) and spatulate scales—which are absent in females and likely integral to male courtship behavior. This study investigates the regulatory mechanisms and single-nucleus transcriptomics underlying these two sexually dimorphic cell types during wing development. We show that <i>Doublesex</i> (<i>Dsx</i>) expression is itself dimorphic and required to repress the UVI cell state in females, while unexpectedly, UVI activation in males is independent from <i>Dsx</i>. In the melanic marginal band, <i>Dsx</i> is required in each sex to enforce the presence of spatulate scales in males, and their absence in females. Single-nucleus RNAseq reveals that UVI and spatulate scale cell precursors each show distinctive gene expression profiles at 40% of pupal development, with marker genes that include regulators of transcription, cell signaling, cytoskeletal patterning, and chitin secretion. Both male-specific cell types share a low expression of the <i>Bric-a-brac</i> (<i>Bab</i>) transcription factor, a key repressor of the UVI fate. Bab ChIP-seq profiling suggests that Bab binds the <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions of gene markers associated to UVI fate, including potential effector genes involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal processes and chitin secretion, and loci showing signatures of recent selective sweeps in a UVI-polymorphic population. These findings open new avenues for exploring wing patterning and scale development, shedding light on the mechanisms driving the specification of sex-specific cell states and the differentiation of specialized cell ultrastructures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-598/v1?src=rss">Anticipated Growth in Healthcare Spending: The Role of Thailand’s Comprehensive Health Awareness Policy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Thailand’s health awareness policy embodies a comprehensive, multi-sectoral strategy aimed at enhancing national health literacy and fostering sustainable public health outcomes. Central to this initiative is the empowerment of individuals through education and resources that encourage healthier lifestyles, disease prevention, and a reduction in the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This foundational emphasis reflects the government’s belief that well-informed citizens are the cornerstone of a resilient and effective public health system. Methods The forecasting method for Thailand’s GDP and healthcare spending uses quantitative modeling and scenario analysis, integrating macroeconomic indicators and sector-specific variables. For GDP forecasting, the method applies time-series econometric models, such as ARIMA, with inputs including export performance, domestic consumption, investment trends, and government spending. These models are calibrated using historical data from sources such as the Bank of Thailand and the National Economic and Social Development Council. Healthcare spending forecasts extend these projections by adding demographic data—especially population age structure—along with epidemiological trends, healthcare utilization rates, government healthcare policies, and medical technology advancements. Results A key component of this forecasting involves estimating fiscal pressures by the aging population and rising chronic disease prevalence, increasing demand for long-term care and advanced medical services. Projections consider investments in infrastructure, workforce, and digital health, affecting cost and efficiency. Scenario-based approaches assess policy or economic impacts on future GDP and healthcare spending. This integrated method supports forward-looking, evidence-based policy and resource allocation in economic and healthcare sectors. Conclusions Ultimately, Thailand’s health awareness policy aspires to build a well-informed, health-conscious population capable of making proactive choices that enhance well-being and reduce reliance on healthcare services. Through a sustained focus on prevention, education, and inclusivity, the policy aims to strengthen the resilience of the nation’s healthcare system, promote equity in health outcomes, and ensure long-term public health sustainability.

                Background Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is a paraneoplastic syndrome commonly associated with solid organ malignancies like squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, head & neck, as well as breast, ovarian, renal, and bladder carcinomas and hematological malignancies like Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL). However, its occurrence in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is rare, with the majority of reported cases linked to pancreatic NETs. Here, we describe an extremely rare case of a metastatic duodenal NET presenting with severe hypercalcemia due to the secretion of Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP). This case features an exceptionally high PTHrP level, placing it among the most severe reported cases of NET-associated HHM. Case Presentation A 70-year-old male with known metastatic duodenal NET (grade 2, Ki67 index: 18.2%) presented with unresponsiveness. Despite previous distal gastrectomy with D1 duodenal resection, Octreotide Long-Acting Release (LAR), Everolimus, and four cycles of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), disease progression was evident on Gallium- 68 DOTANOC PET/CT scan. Laboratory evaluation revealed severe hypercalcemia (corrected calcium: 14.06 mg/dL) with suppressed iPTH levels (Intact Parathyroid Hormone) and markedly elevated PTHrP levels of 252 pmol/L (Parathyroid Hormone related Peptide), thereby confirming HHM. Multiple myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis were excluded by appropriate testing. Despite aggressive management with intravenous fluids, calcitonin, ibandronate, and multiple hemodialysis sessions, the patient succumbed to hypoxic brain injury. Discussion HHM is rarely seen in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and is most commonly associated with pancreatic NETs; we report a rare case of metastatic duodenal NET causing severe hypercalcemia due to excessive PTHrP production. With a remarkably elevated PTHrP level, this case is among the most severe documented cases of NET-associated HHM. The relationship between tumor grade and PTHrP production, along with the refractory nature of the hypercalcemia despite standard interventions, highlights the complex pathophysiology of this condition.
