              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17300">Neural association between musical features and shared inter-subject emotional perception while movie-watching: fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of naturalistic stimuli, such as feature films, brings research on emotions closer to ecologically valid settings within brain scanners, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Music is another cultural artifact known to evoke emotions, and film soundtracks are often designed to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. However, the neural basis of shared emotional perception during movie-watching, and its relationship to the soundtrack, remains unclear. In this study, participants watched Forrest Gump in a 3T fMRI scanner. The reported shared arousal and valence (positive and negative) was correlated with the spectrogram and tempo information extracted from the soundtrack. For neuroimaging, four regions of interest (ROIs) related to audiovisual input and narrative content were examined: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. Results: Strong correlations between spectral and tempo, and emotional features (Bonferroni corr). BOLD responses associated with shared positive and negative valence and high-arousal moments were compared to film events with low emotional agreement. Significant activations were found in the STS and precuneus (pFWE < 0.05 peak level). No significant responses were observed in the amygdala or inferior frontal gyrus, but whole-brain analysis (pFWE < 0.05 cluster extent) revealed frontal activity linked to negative valence, alongside expected occipito-temporal lobe responses to the audiovisual stimuli. The STS and precuneus were particularly active during shared emotional perception of valenced and high-arousal events, with the precuneus encoding valence from auditory information. Naturalistic stimuli show promise as diagnostic and therapeutic tools for emotion regulation deficits although challenges may arise when crafting an experimental control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17620">Holistic structure of neural pathways underlies brain perceptual rivalry: A physical perspective of auditory stream segregation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the brain perceptual functions as emerging from complex neural connections, rather than only the behavior of specific neural groups, is increasingly recognized today. Taking the auditory stream segregation, a classical issue in the field of perceptual behaviors, as an example, we demonstrate its emergence from the topological structure of neural pathways, by constructing a holistic neural circuit model based solely on existing neurophysiological data. Combining quantification of deterministic neural dynamics, potential landscape and probability flux, this model accurately reproduces the nonequilibrium phase transition process from integrated stream to completely segregated streams. The mean duration time (MDT) of the auditory perceptions from the simulation accords with the reported experimental results, and its inverse Gaussian distribution is suggested to complement the original Gamma or Lognormal distributions of the MDT. Further, using average probability flux and entropy production rate, we reveal the dynamical and thermodynamical origins, and the cost of the auditory phase transition process, highlighting the role of time irreversibility and detailed balance breaking as bridges between theory and neurophysiological experiment. Moreover, we propose a fundamental principle for attentional modulation and successfully apply this theoretical framework to an attention-modulated system. Finally, two psychoacoustic experiments are conducted to validate the constructed model and the proposed attention mechanism. Our results highlight that the neural basis of a perceptual and cognitive behavior is not limited to a localized brain neural region, but has a holistic and systematic origin.

                arXiv:2410.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive architectures are influential, integrated computational frameworks for modeling cognitive processes. Due to a variety of factors, however, researchers using cognitive architectures to explain and predict human performance rarely employ model validation, comparison, and selection techniques based on likelihood. This paper provides a primer on how to implement maximum likelihood techniques and its derivatives to fit and compare models at the individual and group level, using models implemented in the ACT-R cognitive architecture as examples. The paper covers the most common ways in which likelihood measures can be applied, under different scenarios, for models of different complexity, and provides further technical references for the interested reader. An accompanying notebook in Python provides the code to implement all of the suggestions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17410">Learning Graph Filters for Structure-Function Coupling based Hub Node Identification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, tools from network science have been leveraged to characterize the organization of both structural and functional networks of the brain. One such measure of network organization is hub node identification. Hubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units corresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for identifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and participation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These methods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function coupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing (GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural connectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed framework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural connectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes are sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the non-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter. Based on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated to learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the hub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17691">Longitudinal Causal Image Synthesis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on causal reasoning and longitudinal analysis. For example, for a patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD), how will the brain grey matter atrophy in a year if intervened on the A-beta level in cerebrospinal fluid? The answer is fundamental to diagnosis and follow-up treatment. However, this kind of inquiry involves counterfactual medical images which can not be acquired by instrumental or correlation-based image synthesis models. Yet, such queries require counterfactual medical images, not obtainable through standard image synthesis models. Hence, a causal longitudinal image synthesis (CLIS) method, enabling the synthesis of such images, is highly valuable. However, building a CLIS model confronts three primary yet unmet challenges: mismatched dimensionality between high-dimensional images and low-dimensional tabular variables, inconsistent collection intervals of follow-up data, and inadequate causal modeling capability of existing causal graph methods for image data. In this paper, we established a tabular-visual causal graph (TVCG) for CLIS overcoming these challenges through a novel integration of generative imaging, continuous-time modeling, and structural causal models combined with a neural network. We train our CLIS based on the ADNI dataset and evaluate it on two other AD datasets, which illustrate the outstanding yet controllable quality of the synthesized images and the contributions of synthesized MRI to the characterization of AD progression, substantiating the reliability and utility in clinics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13504">Self-organized transport in noisy dynamic networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.13504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of multi-commodity transport in a noisy, nonlinear network. The nonlinearity determines the dynamics of the edge capacities, which can be amplified or suppressed depending on the local current flowing across an edge. We consider network self-organization for three different nonlinear functions: For all three we identify parameter regimes where noise leads to self-organization into more robust topologies, that are not found by the sole noiseless dynamics. Moreover, the interplay between noise and specific functional behavior of the nonlinearity gives rise to different features, such as (i) continuous or discontinuous responses to the demand strength and (ii) either single or multi-stable solutions. Our study shows the crucial role of the activation function on noise-assisted phenomena.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17268">SPikE-SSM: A Sparse, Precise, and Efficient Spiking State Space Model for Long Sequences Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient solution by utilizing the spike-based and sparse nature of biological systems. Since the advent of Transformers, SNNs have struggled to compete with artificial networks on long sequential tasks, until the recent emergence of state space models (SSMs), which offer superior computational efficiency and modeling capability. However, applying the highly capable SSMs to SNNs for long sequences learning poses three major challenges: (1) The membrane potential is determined by the past spiking history of the neuron, leading to reduced efficiency for sequence modeling in parallel computing scenarios. (2) Complex dynamics of biological spiking neurons are crucial for functionality but challenging to simulate and exploit effectively in large networks. (3) It is arduous to maintain high sparsity while achieving high accuracy for spiking neurons without resorting to dense computing, as utilized in artificial neuron-based SSMs. To address them, we propose a sparse, precise and efficient spiking SSM framework, termed SPikE-SSM. For (1), we propose a boundary compression strategy (PMBC) to accelerate the inference of the spiking neuron model, enabling parallel processing for long sequence learning. For (2), we propose a novel and concise neuron model incorporating reset-refractory mechanism to leverage the inherent temporal dimension for dynamic computing with biological interpretability. For (3), we hierarchically integrate the proposed neuron model to the original SSM block, and enhance the dynamics of SPikE-SSM by incorporating trainable thresholds and refractory magnitudes to balance accuracy and sparsity. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and robustness of SPikE-SSM on the long range arena benchmarks and large language dataset WikiText-103, showing the potential of dynamic spiking neurons in efficient long sequence learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17970">Optical Generative Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models cover various application areas, including image, video and music synthesis, natural language processing, and molecular design, among many others. As digital generative models become larger, scalable inference in a fast and energy-efficient manner becomes a challenge. Here, we present optical generative models inspired by diffusion models, where a shallow and fast digital encoder first maps random noise into phase patterns that serve as optical generative seeds for a desired data distribution; a jointly-trained free-space-based reconfigurable decoder all-optically processes these generative seeds to create novel images (never seen before) following the target data distribution. Except for the illumination power and the random seed generation through a shallow encoder, these optical generative models do not consume computing power during the synthesis of novel images. We report the optical generation of monochrome and multi-color novel images of handwritten digits, fashion products, butterflies, and human faces, following the data distributions of MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Butterflies-100, and Celeb-A datasets, respectively, achieving an overall performance comparable to digital neural network-based generative models. To experimentally demonstrate optical generative models, we used visible light to generate, in a snapshot, novel images of handwritten digits and fashion products. These optical generative models might pave the way for energy-efficient, scalable and rapid inference tasks, further exploiting the potentials of optics and photonics for artificial intelligence-generated content.

                arXiv:2410.17277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum ant colony optimization (QACO) has drew much attention since it combines the advantages of quantum computing and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm overcoming some limitations of the traditional ACO algorithm. However,due to the hardware resource limitations of currently available quantum computers, the practical application of the QACO is still not realized. In this paper, we developed a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm by combining the clustering algorithm with QACO algorithm.This extended QACO can handle large-scale optimization problems with currently available quantum computing resource. We have tested the effectiveness and performance of the extended QACO algorithm with the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) as benchmarks, and found the algorithm achieves better performance under multiple diverse datasets. In addition, we investigated the noise impact on the extended QACO and evaluated its operation possibility on current available noisy intermediate scale quantum(NISQ) devices. Our work shows that the combination of the clustering algorithm with QACO effectively improved its problem solving scale, which makes its practical application possible in current NISQ era of quantum computing.

Abstract: In contrast to the traditional principle of periodic sensing neuromorphic engineering pursues a paradigm shift towards bio-inspired event-based sensing, where events are primarily triggered by a change in the perceived stimulus. We show in a rigorous mathematical way that information encoding by means of Threshold-Based Representation based on either Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) or Send-on-Delta (SOD) is linked to an analog-to-spike conversion that guarantees maximum sparsity while satisfying an approximation condition based on the Alexiewicz norm.

                arXiv:2410.17498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in symbol processing through in-context learning (ICL). This success flies in the face of decades of predictions that artificial neural networks cannot master abstract symbol manipulation. We seek to understand the mechanisms that can enable robust symbol processing in transformer networks, illuminating both the unanticipated success, and the significant limitations, of transformers in symbol processing. Borrowing insights from symbolic AI on the power of Production System architectures, we develop a high-level language, PSL, that allows us to write symbolic programs to do complex, abstract symbol processing, and create compilers that precisely implement PSL programs in transformer networks which are, by construction, 100% mechanistically interpretable. We demonstrate that PSL is Turing Universal, so the work can inform the understanding of transformer ICL in general. The type of transformer architecture that we compile from PSL programs suggests a number of paths for enhancing transformers' capabilities at symbol processing. (Note: The first section of the paper gives an extended synopsis of the entire paper.)

Abstract: This study introduces BrainTransformers, an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) implemented using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Our key contributions include: (1) designing SNN-compatible Transformer components such as SNNMatmul, SNNSoftmax, and SNNSiLU; (2) implementing an SNN approximation of the SiLU activation function; and (3) developing a Synapsis module to simulate synaptic plasticity. Our 3-billion parameter model, BrainTransformers-3B-Chat, demonstrates competitive performance across various benchmarks, including MMLU (63.2), BBH (54.1), ARC-C (54.3), and GSM8K (76.3), while potentially offering improved energy efficiency and biological plausibility. The model employs a three-stage training approach, including SNN-specific neuronal synaptic plasticity training. This research opens new avenues for brain-like AI systems in natural language processing and neuromorphic computing. Future work will focus on hardware optimization, developing specialized SNN fine-tuning tools, and exploring practical applications in energy-efficient computing environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they struggle with inconsistent reasoning, particularly in novel domains and complex logical sequences. This research introduces Proof of Thought, a framework that enhances the reliability and transparency of LLM outputs. Our approach bridges LLM-generated ideas with formal logic verification, employing a custom interpreter to convert LLM outputs into First Order Logic constructs for theorem prover scrutiny. Central to our method is an intermediary JSON-based Domain-Specific Language, which by design balances precise logical structures with intuitive human concepts. This hybrid representation enables both rigorous validation and accessible human comprehension of LLM reasoning processes. Key contributions include a robust type system with sort management for enhanced logical integrity, explicit representation of rules for clear distinction between factual and inferential knowledge, and a flexible architecture that allows for easy extension to various domain-specific applications. We demonstrate Proof of Thought's effectiveness through benchmarking on StrategyQA and a novel multimodal reasoning task, showing improved performance in open-ended scenarios. By providing verifiable and interpretable results, our technique addresses critical needs for AI system accountability and sets a foundation for human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes domains.

                arXiv:2409.19841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in neural networks, error backpropagation has faced criticism for its lack of biological plausibility, suffering from issues such as the backward locking problem and the weight transport problem. These limitations have motivated researchers to explore more biologically plausible learning algorithms that could potentially shed light on how biological neural systems adapt and learn. Inspired by the counter-current exchange mechanisms observed in biological systems, we propose counter-current learning (CCL), a biologically plausible framework for credit assignment in neural networks. This framework employs a feedforward network to process input data and a feedback network to process targets, with each network enhancing the other through anti-parallel signal propagation. By leveraging the more informative signals from the bottom layer of the feedback network to guide the updates of the top layer of the feedforward network and vice versa, CCL enables the simultaneous transformation of source inputs to target outputs and the dynamic mutual influence of these transformations. Experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets using multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks demonstrate that CCL achieves comparable performance to other biologically plausible algorithms while offering a more biologically realistic learning mechanism. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of our approach to an autoencoder task, underscoring its potential for unsupervised representation learning. Our work presents a direction for biologically inspired and plausible learning algorithms, offering an alternative mechanism of learning and adaptation in neural networks.

Abstract: A new Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is proposed to approximate potentially irregular functions in high dimension. We show that it outperforms multilayer perceptrons in terms of accuracy and converges faster. We also compare it with several proposed KAN networks: the original spline-based KAN network appears to be more effective for smooth functions, while the P1-KAN network is more effective for irregular functions.

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks beyond the classical formulation over compact domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we derive universal approximation results for neural networks within function spaces over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, e.g., weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Furthermore, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with several coexisting diseases or comorbidities, including inflammatory and metabolic disorders. In fact, ASD symptoms may be associated with immune system dysfunction. However, studies investigating the peripheral blood levels of immune cells are lacking and have provided mixed findings. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the intensity level of ASD symptoms and the inflammatory and metabolic profiles in 154 children and adolescents (2&amp;amp;ndash;17 years). Methods: Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine the relationship between their symptom intensities and inflammatory/metabolic profiles. Results: Heavier children had higher values for triglyceride and insulin levels. Children with a level 3 of ASD intensity had higher free fatty acids levels. However, when adjusting for ASD intensity, gender, medication use, or weight status, older children appeared to have higher values of triglycerides, insulin levels, and free fatty acids. Conclusions: We concluded that as Brazilian children with ASD became older, they had a higher risk for insulin resistance.</p>

                <p>Injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) can cause severe neurological deficits. Axonal regrowth is a fundamental process for the reconstruction of compensatory neuronal networks after injury; however, it is extremely limited in the adult mammalian CNS. In this study, we conducted a loss-of-function genetic screen in cortical neurons, combined with a Web resource-based phenotypic screen, and identified synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4) as a novel regulator of axon elongation. Silencing Syt4 in primary cultured cortical neurons inhibits neurite elongation, with changes in gene expression involved in signaling pathways related to neuronal development. In a spinal cord injury model, inhibition of Syt4 expression in cortical neurons prevented axonal sprouting of the corticospinal tract, as well as neurological recovery after injury. These results provide a novel therapeutic approach to CNS injury by modulating Syt4 function.</p>

                <p>Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) signaling is critical for neuronal development and function from fate specification to synaptic plasticity. Type III Nrg1 is a synaptic protein which engages in bidirectional signaling with its receptor ErbB4. Forward signaling engages ErbB4 phosphorylation, whereas back signaling engages two known mechanisms: (1) local axonal PI3K-AKT signaling and (2) cleavage by -secretase resulting in cytosolic release of the intracellular domain (ICD), which can traffic to the nucleus (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Bao et al., 2003</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">Hancock et al., 2008</cross-ref>). To dissect the contribution of these alternate signaling strategies to neuronal development, we generated a transgenic mouse with a missense mutation (V<SUB>321</SUB>L) in the Nrg1 transmembrane domain that disrupts nuclear back signaling with minimal effects on forward signaling or local back signaling and was previously found to be associated with psychosis (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Walss-Bass et al., 2006</cross-ref>). We combined RNA sequencing, retroviral fate mapping of neural stem cells, behavioral analyses, and various network analyses of transcriptomic data to investigate the effect of disrupting Nrg1 nuclear back signaling in the dentate gyrus (DG) of male and female mice. The V<SUB>321</SUB>L mutation impairs nuclear translocation of the Nrg1 ICD and alters gene expression in the DG. V<SUB>321</SUB>L mice show reduced stem cell proliferation, altered cell cycle dynamics, fate specification defects, and dendritic dysmorphogenesis. Orthologs of known schizophrenia (SCZ)-susceptibility genes were dysregulated in the V<SUB>321</SUB>L DG. These genes coordinated a larger network with other dysregulated genes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis and protein interaction network analyses revealed striking similarity between DG transcriptomes of V<SUB>321</SUB>L mouse and humans with SCZ.</p>

                <p>Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated intronic variants in <I>PDE4B</I>, encoding cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B), with increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as schizophrenia and substance use disorders that are often comorbid with it. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of genetic risk involving PDE4B are poorly understood. To examine the effects of PDE4B variation on phenotypes with translational relevance to psychiatric disorders, we focused on PDE4B missense variant M220T, which is present in the human genome as rare coding variant rs775201287. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, PDE4B1-M220T exhibited an attenuated response to a forskolin-elicited increase in the intracellular cAMP concentration. In behavioral tests, homozygous <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> male mice with a C57BL/6JJcl background exhibited increased reactivity to novel environments, startle hyperreactivity, prepulse inhibition deficits, altered cued fear conditioning, and enhanced spatial memory, accompanied by an increase in cAMP signaling pathway-regulated expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. In response to a traumatic event (10 tone&ndash;shock pairings), neuronal activity was decreased in the cortex but enhanced in the amygdala and hippocampus of <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice. At 24&nbsp;h post-trauma, <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice exhibited increased startle hyperreactivity and decreased plasma corticosterone levels, similar to phenotypes exhibited by PTSD patients. Trauma-exposed <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice also exhibited a slower decay in freezing at 15 and 30&nbsp;d post-trauma, demonstrating enhanced persistence of traumatic memories, similar to that exhibited by PTSD patients. These findings provide substantive mouse model evidence linking PDE4B variation to PTSD-relevant phenotypes and thus highlight how genetic variation of PDE4B may contribute to PTSD risk.</p>

                <p>Neural decoding is a tool for understanding how activities from a population of neurons inside the brain relate to the outside world and for engineering applications such as brain&ndash;machine interfaces. However, neural decoding studies mainly focused on different decoding algorithms rather than different neuron types which could use different coding strategies. In this study, we used two-photon calcium imaging to assess three auditory spatial decoders (space map, opponent channel, and population pattern) in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the dorsal inferior colliculus of male and female mice. Our findings revealed a clustering of excitatory neurons that prefer similar interaural level difference (ILD), the primary spatial cues in mice, while inhibitory neurons showed random local ILD organization. We found that inhibitory neurons displayed lower decoding variability under the opponent channel decoder, while excitatory neurons achieved higher decoding accuracy under the space map and population pattern decoders. Further analysis revealed that the inhibitory neurons&rsquo; preference for ILD off the midline and the excitatory neurons&rsquo; heterogeneous ILD tuning account for their decoding differences. Additionally, we discovered a sharper ILD tuning in the inhibitory neurons. Our computational model, linking this to increased presynaptic inhibitory inputs, was corroborated using monaural and binaural stimuli. Overall, this study provides experimental and computational insight into how excitatory and inhibitory neurons uniquely contribute to the coding of sound locations.</p>

                <p>Neural circuits supporting innate behaviors, such as feeding, exploration, and social interaction, intermingle in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Although previous studies have shown that individual LH neurons change their firing relative to the baseline during one or more behaviors, the firing rate dynamics of LH populations within behavioral episodes and the coordination of behavior-related LH populations remain largely unknown. Here, using unsupervised graph-based clustering of LH neurons firing rate dynamics in freely behaving male mice, we identified distinct populations of cells whose activity corresponds to feeding, specific times during feeding bouts, or other innate behaviors&mdash;social interaction and novel object exploration. Feeding-related cells fired together with a higher probability during slow and fast gamma oscillations (30&ndash;60 and 60&ndash;90&nbsp;Hz) than during nonrhythmic epochs. In contrast, the cofiring of neurons signaling other behaviors than feeding was overall similar between slow gamma and nonrhythmic epochs but increased during fast gamma oscillations. These results reveal a neural organization of ethological hierarchies in the LH and point to behavior-specific motivational systems, the dysfunction of which may contribute to mental disorders.</p>

                <p>Sleep is known to drive the consolidation of motor memories. During nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the close temporal proximity between slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles ("nesting" of SO-spindles) is known to be essential for consolidation, likely because it is closely associated with the reactivation of awake task activity. Interestingly, recent work has found that spindles can occur in temporal clusters or "trains." However, it remains unclear how spindle trains are related to the nesting phenomenon. Here, we hypothesized that spindle trains are more likely when SOs co-occur in the prefrontal and motor cortex. We conducted simultaneous neural recordings in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) of male rats training on the reach-to-grasp motor task. We found that intracortically recorded M1 spindles are organized into distinct temporal clusters. Notably, the occurrence of temporally precise SOs between mPFC and M1 was a strong predictor of spindle trains. Moreover, reactivation of awake task patterns is much more persistent during spindle trains in comparison with that during isolated spindles. Together, our work suggests that the precise coupling of SOs across mPFC and M1 may be a potential driver of spindle trains and persistent reactivation of motor memory during NREM sleep.</p>

                <p>We used virus-mediated anterograde and retrograde tracing, optogenetic modulation, immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and patch-clamp recordings in acute brain slices to study the release mechanism and &mu;-opioid modulation of the dual glutamatergic/GABAergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area and supramammillary nucleus to the granule cells of the dorsal hippocampus of male and female mice. In keeping with previous reports showing that the two transmitters are released by separate active zones within the same terminals, we found that the short-term plasticity and pharmacological modulation of the glutamatergic and GABAergic currents are indistinguishable. We further found that glutamate and GABA release at these synapses are both virtually completely mediated by N- and P/Q-type calcium channels. We then investigated &mu;-opioid modulation of these synapses and found that activation of &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs) strongly inhibits the glutamate and GABA release, mostly through inhibition of presynaptic N-type channels. However, the modulation by MORs of these dual synapses is complex, as it likely includes also a disinhibition due to downmodulation of local GABAergic interneurons which make direct axo-axonic contacts with the dual glutamatergic/GABAergic terminals. We discuss how this opioid modulation may enhance LTP at the perforant path inputs, potentially contributing to reinforce memories of drug-associated contexts.</p>

                <p>The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates neuronal plasticity and animal behavior. ECM staining shows a net-like structure around a subset of neurons, a ring-like structure at the nodes of Ranvier, and diffuse staining in the interstitial matrix. However, understanding the structural features of ECM deposition across various neuronal types and subcellular compartments remains limited. To visualize the organization pattern and assembly process of the hyaluronan-scaffolded ECM in the brain, we fused a HaloTag to hyaluronan proteoglycan link protein 1, which links hyaluronan and proteoglycans. Expression or application of the probe in primary rat neuronal cultures enables us to identify spatial and temporal regulation of ECM deposition and heterogeneity in ECM aggregation among neuronal populations. Dual-color birthdating shows the ECM assembly process in culture and in vivo. Sparse expression in mouse brains of either sex reveals detailed ECM architectures around excitatory neurons and developmentally regulated dendritic ECM. Our study uncovers extensive structural features of the brain's ECM, suggesting diverse roles in regulating neuronal plasticity.</p>

                <p>Perivascular mural cells including vascular smooth cells (VSMCs) and pericytes are integral components of the vascular system. In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are also indispensable for the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB), blood&ndash;spinal cord barrier, and blood&ndash;retinal barrier and play key roles in maintaining cerebrovascular and neuronal functions. However, the functional specifications of pericytes between CNS and peripheral organs have not been resolved at the genetic and molecular levels. Hence, the generation of reliable CNS pericyte-specific models and genetic tools remains very challenging. Here, we report a new CNS pericyte marker in mice. This putative cation-transporting ATPase 13A5 (<I>Atp13a5</I>) marker was identified through single-cell transcriptomics, based on its specificity to brain pericytes. We further generated a knock-in model with both tdTomato reporter and Cre recombinase. Using this model to trace the distribution of <I>Atp13a5-</I>positive pericytes in mice, we found that the tdTomato reporter reliably labels the CNS pericytes, including the ones in spinal cord and retina but not peripheral organs. Interestingly, brain pericytes are likely shaped by the developing neural environment, as <I>Atp13a5-</I>positive pericytes start to appear around murine embryonic day 15 (E15) and expand along the cerebrovasculature. Thus, <I>Atp13a5</I> is a specific marker of CNS pericyte lineage, and this <I>Atp13a5-</I>based model is a reliable tool to explore the heterogeneity of pericytes and BBB functions in health and diseases.</p>

                <p>Thalamocortical pathways from the rodent ventral posterior (VP) thalamic complex to the somatosensory cerebral cortex areas are a key model in modern neuroscience. However, beyond the intensively studied projection from medial VP (VPM) to the primary somatosensory area (S1), the wiring of these pathways remains poorly characterized. We combined micropopulation tract-tracing and single-cell transfection experiments to map the pathways arising from different portions of the VP complex in male mice. We found that pathways originating from different VP regions show differences in area/lamina arborization pattern and axonal varicosity size. Neurons from the rostral VPM subnucleus innervate trigeminal S1 in point-to-point fashion. In contrast, a caudal VPM subnucleus innervates heavily and topographically second somatosensory area (S2), but not S1. Neurons in a third, intermediate VPM subnucleus innervate through branched axons both S1 and S2, with markedly different laminar patterns in each area. A small anterodorsal subnucleus selectively innervates dysgranular S1. The parvicellular VPM subnucleus selectively targets the insular cortex and adjacent portions of S1 and S2. Neurons in the rostral part of the lateral VP nucleus (VPL) innervate spinal S1, while caudal VPL neurons simultaneously target S1 and S2. Rostral and caudal VP nuclei show complementary patterns of calcium-binding protein expression. In addition to the cortex, neurons in caudal VP subnuclei target the sensorimotor striatum. Our finding of a massive projection from VP to S2 separate from the VP projections to S1 adds critical anatomical evidence to the notion that different somatosensory submodalities are processed in parallel in S1 and S2.</p>

                <p>Estrogens act through nuclear and membrane-initiated signaling. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) is critical for reproduction, but the relative contribution of its nuclear and membrane signaling to the central regulation of reproduction is unclear. To address this question, two complementary approaches were used: estetrol (E<SUB>4</SUB>) a natural estrogen acting as an agonist of nuclear ERs, but as an antagonist of their membrane fraction, and the C451A-ER&alpha; mouse lacking mER&alpha;. E<SUB>4</SUB> dose- dependently blocks ovulation in female rats, but the central mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. To determine whether E<SUB>4</SUB> acts centrally to control ovulation, its effect was tested on the positive feedback of estradiol (E<SUB>2</SUB>) on neural circuits underlying luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. In ovariectomized females chronically exposed to a low dose of E<SUB>2</SUB>, estradiol benzoate (EB) alone or combined with progesterone (P) induced an increase in the number of kisspeptin (Kp) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons coexpressing Fos, a marker of neuronal activation. E<SUB>4</SUB> blocked these effects of EB, but not when combined to P. These results indicate that E<SUB>4</SUB> blocked the central induction of the positive feedback in the absence of P, suggesting an antagonistic effect of E<SUB>4</SUB> on mER&alpha; in the brain as shown in peripheral tissues. In parallel, as opposed to wild-type females, C451A-ER&alpha; females did not show the activation of Kp and GnRH neurons in response to EB unless they are treated with P. Together these effects support a role for membrane-initiated estrogen signaling in the activation of the circuit mediating the LH surge.</p>

                Introduction Mitochondria are cell organelles that function as the cell’s main power plant, producing ATP, the main energy molecule in cells. Mitochondria play an important role in the context of neuroprotection, and mitochondrial function has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent research in the field of neuroprotection has focused on the development of therapies that target mitochondria. Natural ingredients have long been used in traditional medicine and show potential as neuroprotective agents. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords natural agents, herb*, neuroprotective, and mitochondria. The data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, A factorial map illustrating the leading contributors of papers, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, qualitative analysis, and word cloud. Conclusions Natural Agent Neurotropik is a natural substance that influences the brain’s nervous system and peripheral nervous system, enhancing cognition, mood, and brain function. Derived from herbs, spices, and herbal products, it has advantages over other natural agents in energy production, brain biogenesis, and neuroprotection. Natural agents’ compositional heterogeneity affects reproductive results. Proper characterization and standardized extraction techniques are crucial for establishing plant extracts’ chemical profile. Dosage consistency is essential for standardized results. Long-term safety and potential toxicity should be evaluated. Comparing natural medicines with synthetic pharmaceuticals can enhance therapy efficacy and reduce drug resistance. Further research is needed to assess neuroprotection and mitochondrial function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1401/v4?src=rss">Molecular survey of certain protozoan agents that cause diarrhea in children in Sudan [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 3 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in the Third World. Identification of the pathogen that causes diarrhea is vital for measures to prevent and control this disease. There are also very few reports of diarrhea in Sudan. Our study aimed to determine the Prevalence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum., and Giardia spp) in children in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among children under five years of age hospitalized with acute diarrhea between April and December 2014. Diarrheal stool samples were collected, and E. histolytica, C. parvum, and Giardia spp were examined using multiplex real-time PCR. Results Four hundred and thirty-seven children with acute diarrhea were included in this study; the higher prevalence of diarrhea was in the age ≤ 2 years old (403, 92.2%), >2–≤4 years (32, 7.3%), and >4–<5 years (2, 0.5%). The male-to-female ratio in this study was 1:1.7. Infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was detected in 16 (3.7%) cases. Giardia spp (18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8%) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.9). The parasite infection rate was highest and lowest in the under 2-year-old group 143 (35.5%) and the 2–4-year-old group 12 (37.5%). The infection rate was higher in boys 104 (37.7%) than in girls 51 (31.7%). The number of positive cases was higher in the rainy season (August to December) 143 (37.4%), corresponding with that in the dry Season (April to June) 12 (21.8%). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of Giardia spp and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in the Khartoum region and the usefulness of the multiplex real-time method in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                Objective To analyze the effectiveness of various techniques available for printing, finishing and polishing of 3D printed prosthesis. Methods The articles were selected from electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus. Recently, lot of advancements have been observed in the field of 3D printing in dentistry. Results Numerous studies were found explaining the factors affecting the surface roughness such as printing speed, direction, layer thickness, post curing, etc., and the significance in achieving a smooth surface finish of a 3D printed prosthesis. The methods employed to achieve this range, similar to conventional and chairside polishing, are to use advanced coating materials such as light cured glazes to nanoparticles. Conclusion 3D printing is being used in day-to-day practice and the prosthesis must be aesthetic looking to satisfy the patients’ expectations. There is a lack of data supporting any one polishing method for the prosthesis. There is a need for further research on the existing techniques and newer advancements yielding aesthetic prostheses with an optimal surface finish.

Public gene expression databases are a rapidly expanding resource of organism responses to diverse perturbations, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge for bioinformatics workflows to extract actionable knowledge of transcription regulatory network function. Here, we introduce a five-step computational pipeline, called iModulonMiner, to compile, process, curate, analyze, and characterize the totality of RNA-seq data for a given organism or cell type. This workflow is centered around the data-driven computation of co-regulated gene sets using Independent Component Analysis, called iModulons, which have been shown to have broad applications. As a demonstration, we applied this workflow to generate the iModulon structure of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> using all high-quality, publicly-available RNA-seq data. Using this structure, we predicted regulatory interactions for multiple transcription factors, identified groups of co-expressed genes that are putatively regulated by undiscovered transcription factors, and predicted properties of a recently discovered single-subunit phage RNA polymerase. We also present a Python package, PyModulon, with functions to characterize, visualize, and explore computed iModulons. The pipeline, available at https://github.com/SBRG/iModulonMiner, can be readily applied to diverse organisms to gain a rapid understanding of their transcriptional regulatory network structure and condition-specific activity.

                <p>by Dephney Mathebula, Abigail Amankwah, Kossi Amouzouvi, Kétévi Adiklè Assamagan, Somiealo Azote, Jesutofunmi Ayo Fajemisin, Jean Baptiste Fankam Fankame, Aluwani Guga, Moses Kamwela, Mulape Mutule Kanduza, Toivo Samuel Mabote, Francisco Fenias Macucule, Azwinndini Muronga, Ann Njeri, Michael Olusegun Oluwole, Cláudio Moisés Paulo</p>

The rapid development of vaccines to combat the spread of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a great scientific achievement. Before the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, most studies capitalized on the available data that did not include pharmaceutical measures. Such studies focused on the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures such as social distancing, sanitation, use of face masks, and lockdowns to study the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we used the SIDARTHE-V model, an extension of the SIDARTHE model, which includes vaccination rollouts. We studied the impact of vaccination on the severity of the virus, specifically focusing on death rates, in African countries. The SIRDATHE-V model parameters were extracted by simultaneously fitting the COVID-19 cumulative data of deaths, recoveries, active cases, and full vaccinations reported by the governments of Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Togo, and Zambia. Using South Africa as a case study, our analysis showed that the cumulative death rates declined drastically with the increased extent of vaccination drives. Whilst the infection rates sometimes increased with the arrival of new coronavirus variants, the death rates did not increase as they did before vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011971">On the identification of differentially-active transcription factors from ATAC-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Felix Ezequiel Gerbaldo, Emanuel Sonder, Vincent Fischer, Selina Frei, Jiayi Wang, Katharina Gapp, Mark D. Robinson, Pierre-Luc Germain</p>

ATAC-seq has emerged as a rich epigenome profiling technique, and is commonly used to identify Transcription Factors (TFs) underlying given phenomena. A number of methods can be used to identify differentially-active TFs through the accessibility of their DNA-binding motif, however little is known on the best approaches for doing so. Here we benchmark several such methods using a combination of curated datasets with various forms of short-term perturbations on known TFs, as well as semi-simulations. We include both methods specifically designed for this type of data as well as some that can be repurposed for it. We also investigate variations to these methods, and identify three particularly promising approaches (a chromVAR-limma workflow with critical adjustments, monaLisa and a combination of GC smooth quantile normalization and multivariate modeling). We further investigate the specific use of nucleosome-free fragments, the combination of top methods, and the impact of technical variation. Finally, we illustrate the use of the top methods on a novel dataset to characterize the impact on DNA accessibility of TRAnscription Factor TArgeting Chimeras (TRAFTAC), which can deplete TFs—in our case NFkB—at the protein level.

                Background Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is predominant cultured species in aquaculture. However, there is a scarcity of literature regarding relationship between guava and star gooseberry leaf extract and the condition factor. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of guava and star gooseberry leaf extract-supplemented diets on the specific growth rate, length-weight relationship, and condition factor of Nile tilapia. Methods Six hundred and thirty Nile tilapia (8.7±0.4 g) were randomly distributed among twenty-one tanks (30 fish per tank) within a recirculation system. Over a 60-day period, the fish were fed diets supplemented with 5g/Kg and 10g/Kg of guava leaf extract (GLE-5, GLE-10), star gooseberry leaf extract (SGLE-5, SGLE-10), and a mixture of both (MxLE-5, MXLE-10). Subsequently, specific growth rate, length-weight relationship, and condition factor were determined. Results After 60 days, the specific growth rate was significantly higher in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups compared to the control group. The final lengths and weights differed significantly both in the control group and all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. The analysis of the regression equation indicated a positive correlation (r = 0.970, 0.977, 0.976, 0.974, 0.974, 0.974, and 0.969) between the length and weight of Nile tilapia in the control group and in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. The regression exponent “b” values in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups were >3, indicating a positive allometric growth pattern in Nile tilapia compared to the control (b=2.866), which exhibited a negative allometry. The final condition factor values did not differ significantly in either the control group or any of the plant extract groups. Conclusions Nile tilapia exhibited positive allometric growth patterns and maintained good health when fed with GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. Therefore, these plant extracts demonstrate suitability for commercial Nile tilapia production.

<p>We investigated the immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity-related molecular markers such as Aldoc, PLCB3, and PLCB4 in the cerebellar cortex and related nuclei of rhesus macaque monkeys. We then compared these findings with those of previous studies on such markers in rodents. The current study shed light on the molecular basis underlying differences in cerebellar function between primates and rodents.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cerebellar molecular signatures in primates remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity-related molecular markers, including aldolase C (Aldoc), phospholipase C beta 3 (PLCB3), and phospholipase C beta 4 (PLCB4) in the cerebellar cortex and associated nuclei of rhesus macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>). Our main findings are as follows: First, the cerebellar vermis in macaques exhibited striped compartmentalization for all markers, with the striped expression boundary of PLCB3 being less distinct than those of Aldoc and PLCB4. Second, the striped pattern was less pronounced in the cerebellar hemisphere compared to the vermis, with signals in the hemisphere being predominantly intense throughout. Third, distinct zonal patterns and elevated signals for Aldoc and PLCB3 were observed in the cerebellar deep nuclei. Specifically, the fastigial nucleus displayed intense Aldoc signals in both caudal and rostral regions, while the dentate nucleus displayed strong Aldoc signals in both ventral and dorsal regions. Compared to previous rodent studies, the macaque cerebellum demonstrated a higher proportion of intense signal areas and distinct compartmentalization patterns in both cortical and deep nuclei. These findings offer crucial insights into the unique molecular organization of the primate cerebellum, enhancing our understanding of the advanced neuroplasticity, cognitive, and motor capabilities in primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88456">Somatic mutation rates scale with time not growth rate in long-lived tropical trees</a></h4>

              
                The rates of appearance of new mutations play a central role in evolution. However, mutational processes in natural environments and their relationship with growth rates are largely unknown, particular in tropical ecosystems with high biodiversity. Here, we examined the somatic mutation landscapes of two tropical trees, <i>Shorea laevis</i> (slow-growing) and <i>S. leprosula</i> (fast-growing), in central Borneo, Indonesia. Using newly constructed genomes, we identified a greater number of somatic mutations in tropical trees than in temperate trees. In both species, we observed a linear increase in the number of somatic mutations with physical distance between branches. However, we found that the rate of somatic mutation accumulation per meter of growth was 3.7-fold higher in <i>S. laevis</i> than in <i>S. leprosula</i>. This difference in the somatic mutation rate was scaled with the slower growth rate of <i>S. laevis</i> compared to <i>S. leprosula,</i> resulting in a constant somatic mutation rate per year between the two species. We also found that somatic mutations are neutral within an individual, but those mutations transmitted to the next generation are subject to purifying selection. These findings suggest that somatic mutations accumulate with absolute time and older trees have a greater contribution towards generating genetic variation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95999">Actin dynamics switches two distinct modes of endosomal fusion in yolk sac visceral endoderm cells</a></h4>

              
                Membranes undergo various patterns of deformation during vesicle fusion, but how this membrane deformation is regulated and contributes to fusion remains unknown. In this study, we developed a new method of observing the fusion of individual late endosomes and lysosomes by using mouse yolk sac visceral endoderm cells that have huge endocytic vesicles. We found that there were two distinct fusion modes that were differently regulated. In homotypic fusion, two late endosomes fused quickly, whereas in heterotypic fusion they fused to lysosomes slowly. Mathematical modeling showed that vesicle size is a critical determinant of these fusion types and that membrane fluctuation forces can overcome the vesicle size effects. We found that actin filaments were bound to late endosomes and forces derived from dynamic actin remodeling were necessary for quick fusion during homotypic fusion. Furthermore, cofilin played a role in endocytic fusion by regulating actin turnover. These data suggest that actin promotes vesicle fusion for efficient membrane trafficking in visceral endoderm cells.

">Spontaneous alpha-band lateralization extends persistence of visual information in iconic memory by modulating cortical excitability.</a></h4>

              
                Pre-stimulus alpha oscillations in the visual cortex modulate neuronal excitability, influencing sensory processing and decision-making. While this relationship has been demonstrated mostly in detection tasks with low-visibility stimuli, interpretations of such effects can be ambiguous due to biases, making it difficult to clearly distinguish between perception-related and decision-related effects. In this study, we investigated how spontaneous fluctuations in pre-stimulus alpha power affect iconic memory, a high-capacity, ultra-short visual memory store. Data from 49 healthy adults (34 female and 15 male) was analyzed. We employed a partial report task, where a brief display of six stimuli was followed by a report cue indicating the target stimulus. In this paradigm, accuracy at short stimulus-cue onset asynchronies (SOAs) is typically high, reflecting the initial availability of sensory information, but it rapidly declines at intermediate SOAs due to the decay of the iconic memory trace, stabilizing at a low asymptote at long SOAs, representing the limited capacity of short-term memory. Crucially, performance in this task is constrained by the temporal persistence of sensory information, not by low visibility or response bias. We found that strong pre-stimulus alpha power enhanced performance by amplifying initial stimulus availability without affecting the speed of iconic decay. This effect was driven predominantly by stronger pre-stimulus alpha power in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the to-be-reported target, likely suppressing neuronal excitability of neurons coding irrelevant stimuli. Our findings underscore the role of alpha oscillations in modulating neuronal excitability and visual perception, independent of decision-making strategies implicated in prior studies.

">The Neural Oscillatory Basis of Perspective-Taking in Autistic and Non-Autistic Adolescents using MEG</a></h4>

              
                Taking another's perspective is a high-level mental skill underlying many aspects of social cognition. Perspective-taking is usually an embodied egocentric process whereby people mentally rotate themselves away from their physical location into the other's orientation. This is accompanied by increased theta-band (3-7Hz) brain oscillations within a widespread fronto-parietal cortical network including the temporoparietal junction. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been reported to experience challenges with high-level perspective-taking, particularly when adopting embodied strategies. To investigate the potential neurophysiological basis of these autism-related individual differences, we used magnetoencephalography in combination with a well-replicated perspective-taking paradigm in a group of 18 autistic and 17 age-matched non-autistic adolescents. Findings revealed that increasing the angle between self and other perspective resulted in prolonged reaction times for the autistic group during perspective-taking. This was accompanied by reduced theta power across a wide network of regions typically active during social cognitive tasks. On the other hand, the autistic group showed greater alpha power decreases in visual cortex compared with the non-autistic group across all perspective-taking conditions. These divergent theta and alpha power effects, coupled with steeper response time slopes, suggest that autistic individuals may rely more on alternative cognitive strategies, such as mental object rotation, rather than an egocentric embodied approach. Finally, no group differences were found when participants were asked to track, rather than take, another's viewpoint, suggesting that autism-related individual differences are specific to high-level perspective-taking.

">Neural Correlates of Psychedelic, Sleep, and Sedated States Support Global Theories of Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neural mechanisms of consciousness remains a challenging question in neuroscience. A central debate in the field concerns whether consciousness arises from global interactions that involve multiple brain regions or focal neural activity, such as in sensory cortex. Additionally, global theories diverge between the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) hypothesis, which emphasizes frontal and parietal areas, and the Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which focuses on information integration within posterior cortical regions. To disentangle the global vs. local and frontoparietal vs. posterior dilemmas, we measured global functional connectivity and local neural synchrony with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data across a spectrum of conscious states in humans induced by psychedelics, sleep, and deep sedation. We found that psychedelic states are associated with increased global functional connectivity and decreased local neural synchrony. In contrast, non-REM sleep and deep sedation displayed the opposite pattern, suggesting that consciousness arises from global brain network interactions rather than localized activity. This mirror-image pattern between enhanced and diminished states was observed in both anterior-posterior (A-P) and posterior-posterior (P-P) brain regions but not within the anterior part of the brain alone. Moreover, anterior transmodal regions played a key role in A-P connectivity, while both posterior transmodal and posterior unimodal regions were critical for P-P connectivity. Overall, these findings provide empirical evidence supporting global theories of consciousness in relation to varying states of consciousness. They also bridge the gap between two prominent theories, GNW and IIT, by demonstrating how different theories can converge on shared neuronal mechanisms.

">Endogenous neuronal DNA double-strand breaks are not sufficient to drive brain aging and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Loss of genomic information due to the accumulation of somatic DNA damage has been implicated in aging and neurodegeneration. Somatic mutations in human neurons increase with age, but it is unclear whether this is a cause or a consequence of brain aging. Here, we clarify the role of endogenous, neuronal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in brain aging and neurodegeneration by generating mice with post-developmental inactivation of the classical non-homologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) core factor Xrcc4 in forebrain neurons. Xrcc4 is critical for the ligation step of C-NHEJ and has no known function outside of DSB repair. We find that, unlike their wild-type counterparts, C-NHEJ-deficient neurons accumulate high levels of DSB foci with age, indicating that neurons undergo frequent DSBs that are typically efficiently repaired by C-NHEJ across their lifespan. Genome-wide mapping reveals that endogenous neuronal DSBs preferentially occur in promoter regions and other genic features. Analysis of 3-D genome organization shows intra-chromosomal clustering and loop extrusion of neuronal DSB regions. Strikingly, however, DSB accumulation caused by loss of C-NHEJ induces only minor epigenetic alterations and does not significantly affect gene expression, 3-D genome organization, or mutational outcomes at neuronal DSBs. Despite extensive aging-associated accumulation of neuronal DSBs, mice with neuronal Xrcc4 inactivation do not show neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, reduced lifespan, or impaired memory and learning behavior. We conclude that the formation of spontaneous neuronal DSBs caused by normal cellular processes is insufficient to cause brain aging and neurodegeneration, even in the absence of C-NHEJ, the principal neuronal DSB repair pathway.

">Enhanced Fear Extinction Through Infralimbic Perineuronal Net Digestion: The Modulatory Role of Adolescent Alcohol Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized components of the extracellular matrix that play a critical role in learning and memory. In a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, degradation of PNNs affects the formation and storage of fear memories. This study examined the impact of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure by vapor inhalation on the expression of PNNs in the adult rat prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IfL) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex. Results indicated that following AIE, the total number of PNN positive cells in the PrL cortex increased in layer II/III but did not change in layer V. Conversely, in the IfL cortex, the number of PNN positive cells decreased in layer V, with no change in layer II/III. In addition, the intensity of PNN staining was significantly altered by AIE exposure, which narrowed the distribution of signal intensity, reducing the number of high and low intensity PNNs. Given these changes in PNNs, the next experiment assessed the effects of AIE and PNN digestion on extinction of a conditioned fear memory. In Air control rats, digestion of PNNs by bilateral infusion of Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) into the IfL cortex enhanced fear extinction and reduced contextual fear renewal. In contrast, both fear extinction learning and contextual fear renewal remained unchanged following PNN digestion in AIE exposed rats. These results highlight the sensitivity of prefrontal PNNs to adolescent alcohol exposure and suggest that ChABC-induced plasticity is reduced in the IfL cortex following AIE exposure.

">Frequency-specific hemispheric bias in phase entrainment of neural oscillations in unilateral spatial neglect</a></h4>

              
                Left unilateral spatial neglect (USN), typically caused by a right hemisphere lesion, impairs left-side stimulus perception. Attention influences perception via cortical oscillations, shown as phase shifts and power changes in electroencephalography (EEG). Given this relationship, USN may stem from hemispheric imbalance in synchronizing cortical oscillations internally and externally. We studied this using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) from flickering stimuli of various frequencies. Our study included USN and non-USN patients with a right hemisphere lesion, but no hemianopsia, as well as healthy controls. Importantly, we confirmed that the affected hemisphere's visual cortex in both patient groups responded to all flickering frequencies, ensuring a valid comparison. Comparing SSVEP power between the intact and affected hemispheres revealed no differences in non-USN patients. In USN patients, both hemispheres responded equally to most frequencies; however, SSVEP power was enhanced in the intact visual cortex with 9-Hz stimulation, resulting in a significant hemispheric bias. This bias was not caused by deficiencies in generating oscillations (we observed no significant differences in spontaneous pre-stimulus alpha oscillations) but rather by abnormal alpha-band synchronization with external inputs. Further analyses revealed increased phase-amplitude coupling between alpha phase and gamma amplitude in the intact hemisphere and elevated transfer entropy from the right visual cortex to the left frontal cortex in USN patients. These results reveal that USN involves complex alterations in neural synchronization stemming from imbalanced entrainment of oscillators to alpha-frequency stimuli, beyond merely local damage. This alpha-specific effect provides insights into frequency-specific synchronization in spatial attention, potentially guiding targeted therapies.

">Preemptive minocycline decreases allodynia and depressive-like behaviors in a peripheral neuropathy rat model: a preliminary study</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objective: The neuroimmune system plays a critical role at all phases of chronic pain including at its onset. We therefore hypothesized that preemptive immunomodulation could decrease susceptibility and/or offer protection to pain. Materials and Methods: Six days before the spared nerve injury (SNI), Wistar Han rats were treated with either the immunomodulator minocycline (MIN) or vehicle (VEH). After that, half of the animals from each group switch treatments for additional 7 days, resulting in 4 groups: continuous treatment (MIN/MIN), pretreatment (MIN/VEH), early treatment (VEH/MIN) and the control (VEH/VEH). Mechanical allodynia was recorded using Von Frey test until 4 weeks after SNI where depressive-like behaviors of the animals were also assessed using sucrose preference test. Results: The continuous treatment provided sustained protection against mechanical allodynia, with rats in this group showing a significantly higher threshold to pain sensitivity compared to those in VEH/VEH. In contrast, pain relief effects were not observed with MIN/VEH and VEH/MIN. Additionally, animals in MIN/MIN, and VEH/MIN exhibited decreased anhedonic-like behavior at 30 days after SNI, relative to the control. Conclusions: The exposure to an anti-inflammatory drug circa the installation of a neuropathic lesion had a positive impact on allodynia and on anhedonic behavior for a relatively long period after treatment cessation. The results support the assertions that pain trajectories can be altered at pain early stages by targeting the neuroimmune system. This proof-of-concept has the potential to be broadened to other drugs and/or therapeutical schemes

">Decoding the transcriptomic signatures of psychological trauma in human cortex and amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Psychological trauma has profound effects on brain function and precipitates psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals, however, the molecular mechanisms linking trauma with psychiatric risk remain incompletely understood. Using RNA-seq data postmortem brain tissue of a cohort of 304 donors (N=136 with trauma exposure), we investigated transcriptional signatures of trauma exposures in two cortical regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and two amygdala regions (medial amygdala and basolateral amygdala) associated with stress processing and regulation. We focused on dissecting heterogeneity of traumatic experiences in these transcriptional signatures by investigating exposure to several trauma types (childhood, adulthood, complex, single acute, combat, and interpersonal traumas) and interactions with sex. Overall, amygdala regions were more vulnerable to childhood traumas, whereas cortical regions were more vulnerable to adulthood trauma (regardless of childhood experience). Using cell-type-specific expression imputation, we identified a strong transcriptional response of medial amygdala excitatory neurons to childhood trauma, which coincided with dysregulation observed in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons exposed to hydrocortisone. We resolved multiscale coexpression networks for each brain region and identified modules enriched in trauma signatures and whose connectivity was altered with trauma. Trauma-associated coexpression modules provide insight into coordinated functional dysregulation with different traumas and point to potential gene targets for further dissection. Together, these data provide a characterization of the long-lasting human encoding of traumatic experiences in corticolimbic regions of human brain.

">Distinct optimization of motor control and learning: Self-paced motor learning achieves different motor patterns from overtrained</a></h4>

              
                Self-paced movement, resulting from extensive training and optimization, serves as an ideal model for investigating internal objectives without external constraints within the sensorimotor system. Previous studies have shown that the self-paced movement is consistent within individuals but inconsistent across individuals, highlighting a robust, unique optimization in motor control. Although motor learning is similarly an optimization process, it is unknown whether the internal objectives are shared with motor control and learning, i.e., whether it replicates the motor patterns identified by self-paced motor control. As the optimality principles typically address redundancy, a human behavioral experiment was designed to equate movement distance for motor control and learning, comparing redundant motion parameters, movement velocity, and duration, through detailed analysis that accommodates their nonlinear interaction and significant inter-individual baseline differences. Participants, instructed to use their preferred velocities and duration, exhibited minimal intra-individual variability in motion parameters. Notably, visuomotor shift perturbations exclusively affected velocity, while changes in target distances affected both velocity and duration. These findings suggest that the sensorimotor system employs distinct optimization mechanisms for motor control and learning to resolve redundancy.

">ALS-associated RNA binding proteins converge on UNC13A transcription through regulation of REST</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. Although multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified, a unified molecular basis for ALS has remained elusive. The ALS-associated RNA binding protein (RBP) TDP-43 has previously been shown to stabilize UNC13A mRNA by preventing cryptic exon inclusion. We here show that three ALS-associated RBPs, MATR3, FUS, and hnRNPA1 regulate UNC13A expression by targeting the silencing transcription factor REST. These three RBPs bind to and downregulate REST mRNA and thereby promote UNC13A transcription. REST overexpression was detected not only in response to the loss of each of these three RBPs in cultured cells but also in motor neurons of individuals with familial or sporadic ALS. The functional convergence of four RBPs on the regulation of UNC13A, a gene essential for synaptic transmission, highlights a pivotal contribution of these proteins to maitainance of synaptic integrity. Our findings thus provide key insight into ALS pathogenesis and a basis for the development of new therapeutic agents.

">The role of dopaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic networks in hyposmia in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Olfactory impairment is frequently observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) before motor symptom onset. Patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) are at risk to develop PD and present olfactory dysfunction. Subcortical neuromodulatory nuclei including the substantia nigra, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and the locus coeruleus, may all contribute to olfactory dysfunction. Objective: The objective of this study was to understand the network alterations underlying olfactory dysfunction in PD and in the early prodromal iRBD patients using multimodal MRI. Methods: PD (n = 107), iRBD patients (n = 35) and healthy controls (HC, n = 39) were recruited from the ICEBERG cohort for a cross-sectional study. We separated subjects in Healthy Controls, iRBD patients, and PD patients with or without RBD and with or without anosmia. Olfactory, motor, and cognitive scores were assessed and combined with multimodal imaging. Results: We found that olfaction positively correlated with (i) striatal DaT signal in PD patients; (ii) neuromelanin contrast in the locus coeruleus and (iii) Nucleus Basalis of Meynert grey matter (GM) volume in all patients. These signals were uncorrelated with motor and cognitive scores. Functional connectivity was reduced in regions of the cholinergic olfactory network in anosmic patients. Functional connectivity was also reduced in the noradrenergic network of patients with RBD. Discussion: Our results indicate the implication of the cholinergic network in PD patients with anosmia and a contribution of the noradrenergic network to olfactory dysfunction, only in patients with RBD.

">Over supplementation of folic acid reduces survival 24 hours after hypoxia in male and female Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia is a major component of ischemic stroke. Nutrition has been established as a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. Over-supplementation of folic acid (FA) has become an increasing problem in the U.S and other countries as more people are consuming at or above the recommended daily amount of FA. The impact of over-supplementation of FA on hypoxia is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate how FA over-supplementation impacts hypoxia outcomes using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Adult w1118 Drosophila melanogaster were placed on control and 100 micromolar folic acid supplemented diets (FASD). Progeny 5 to 6 days old were exposed to hypoxia for two hours prior to returning to normoxic conditions to model reperfusion. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, elevated FA levels were observed in FASD flies. Escape behavior was also demonstrated in hypoxia larvae, and increased hypoxia-induced mortality was exacerbated in FASD flies; however, diet did not influence hypoxia-medicated reductions in climbing motivation and ability. Data obtained suggests that hypoxia has a negative effect on survival and climbing behavior in the flies, and that FA over-supplementation has selected negative health outcomes after hypoxia.

">Effector selection precedes movement specification: evidence from repetition effects in motor planning</a></h4>

              
                Motor performance is influenced by movements that were performed shortly prior. For example, reaction times (RTs) for successive movements are reduced when executed with the same effector, even if the specifics of the consecutive movements differ. These findings have been taken to support the notion that repetition effects in motor planning reflect the involvement of effector-specific motor plans. However, previous studies have confounded motor and visual aspects of repetition: movements have typically been instructed via visual cues, and movement repetition, therefore, implied repeating also the visual cue, so that the latter may be (at least partly) responsible for the observed RT effects. In the present study, participants performed two movements in succession, a prime and a probe action, either with their left or right hand and in one of two directions, inward or outward relative to the body midline. We used different cues for prime and probe actions, so that movement repetitions did not involve repetition of the visual cue. Participants initiated successive same-limb movements faster than different-limb movements, but this RT advantage was smaller than observed in previous work. Moreover, repeating movement direction also led to a decrease in RT, though only in combination with hand repetition. Whereas these findings imply that visual cue repetition can contribute to accelerated RTs in movement repetition, they confirm that the recent motor history affects motor planning. Furthermore, they support the idea of a hierarchical framework of motor planning in which effector selection precedes specification of motor parameters.

">A GABA-A receptor response to CBD following status epilepticus in the medial entorhinal cortex of the rat</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol is a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid that has been implicated as a potential therapeutic in numerous neurological diseases. Perhaps the most widespread therapeutic use of CBD has been in the form of Epidiolex, which is used to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Whilst the effectiveness of CBD in seizure reduction is clear, its mechanism of action is complex, and reflects the wide range of pharmacodynamic targets that includes receptors, ion channels and enzymes. This study investigated the effects of action of cannabidiol (CBD) on GABAergic transmission in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex in animals that had previously undergone a period of status epilepticus (SE). Spontaneous post-synaptic currents were recorded from medial entorhinal cortex layer II pyramidal cells in animals 1-7 after SE and in age matched controls as well as in tissue resected from children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). CBD enhanced GABAAR-mediated inhibition by increasing decay times and inhibitory charge transfer across the postsynaptic membrane in status epilepticus (SE) but did not alter GABAergic transmission in age-matched control rats. The SE-induced effects of CBD were blocked by ligands acting as inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAAR receptor and the effects of CBD were additive to low-doses of benzodiazepine and barbiturate agonists, consistent with allosteric actions on the GABAAR. Similar effects were observed in both SE rat and human layer II neurons. Overall, these data suggest CBD may act as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) at postsynaptic GABAARs and this action appears to develop following SE.

">Topography of putative bidirectional interaction between hippocampal sharp wave ripples and neocortical slow oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation relies on coordination between hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) and neocortical UP/DOWN states during sleep. However, whether this coupling exists across neocortex and the mechanisms enabling it remain unknown. By combining electrophysiology in mouse hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) with widefield imaging of dorsal neocortex, we found spatially and temporally precise bidirectional hippocampo-neocortical interaction. HPC multi-unit activity and SWR probability were correlated with UP/DOWN states in mouse default mode network (DMN), with highest modulation by RSC in deep sleep. Further, some SWRs were preceded by the high rebound excitation accompanying DMN DOWN[-&gt;]UP transitions, while large-amplitude SWRs were often followed by DOWN states originating in RSC. We explain these electrophysiological results with a model in which HPC and RSC are weakly coupled excitable systems capable of bi-directional perturbation and suggest RSC may act as a gateway through which SWRs can perturb downstream cortical regions via cortico-cortical propagation of DOWN states.

">Convergent olfactory circuits for courtship in Drosophila revealed by ds-Tango</a></h4>

              
                Animals exhibit sex-specific behaviors that are governed by sexually dimorphic circuits. One such behavior in male Drosophila melanogaster, courtship, is regulated by various sensory modalities, including olfaction. Here, we reveal how sexually dimorphic olfactory pathways in male flies converge at the third-order, onto lateral horn output neurons, to regulate courtship. To achieve this, we developed ds-Tango, a modified version of the monosynaptic tracing and manipulation tool trans-Tango. In ds-Tango, two distinct configurations of trans-Tango are positioned in series, thus providing selective genetic access not only to the monosynaptic partners of starter neurons but also to their disynaptic connections. Using ds-Tango, we identified a node of convergence for three sexually dimorphic olfactory pathways. Silencing this node results in deficits in sex recognition of potential partners. Our results identify lateral horn output neurons required for proper courtship behavior in male flies and establish ds-Tango as a tool for disynaptic circuit tracing.

">Omega-3 fatty acid normalizes postsynaptic density proteins via miRNAs regulation in hippocampus and prevents DEHP-induced impairment of learning and memory in mice</a></h4>

              
                DEHP is the most widely used plasticizer in many products. However, growing evidence has indicated that DEHP may induce neurotoxicity. DEHP exposure affects mircoRNAs (miRNAs) expression in brain. A growing body of evidence suggests that nutrients and other bioactive food components prevent neurotoxicity through regulation of miRNA expression. Due to the increasing concern about the risks of DEHP to human health, we explored the neuroprotective effect of Omega-3 fatty acid (Omega-3FA) on subchronic DEHP-induced neurotoxicity in mice, and the potential involved miRNAs and their targets in the protective action of Omega-3FA against DEHP-induced neurotoxicity. Omega-3FA protected against the DEHP-induced impairment of learning and memory and alleviated the thinning of postsynaptic density (PSD) thickness in hippocampal synapses. We observed that there are fourteen up or down regulated miRNAs associated PSD in DEHP exposure which were normalized by Omega-3FA treatment. Protein targets in PSD of these differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted. Furthermore, the expression levels of protein mGluR5, Homer1, and NMDAR2B were carried out via Western blot, for further verifying PSD associated miRNAs' targets are involved in neuroprotection of Omega-3FA against DEHP. These findings suggested that Omega-3FA protected DEHP-induced impairment of learning and memory as well as synaptic structure alteration in the hippocampus by regulating the expression of PSD associated miRNAs and their targets. Thus, Omega-3FA should be included in diet to prevent or suppress neurotoxicity caused by continuous exposure to DEHP.

">The YTHDF Proteins Shape the Brain Gene Signatures of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                The gene signatures of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brains reflect an output of a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, epi-transcriptomic, and post-transcriptional regulations. To identify the most significant factor that shapes the AD brain signature, we developed a machine learning model (DEcode-tree) to integrate cellular and molecular factors explaining differential gene expression in AD. Our model indicates that YTHDF proteins, the canonical readers of N6-methyladenosine RNA modification (m6A), are the most influential predictors of the AD brain signature. We then show that protein modules containing YTHDFs are downregulated in human AD brains, and knocking out YTHDFs in iPSC-derived neural cells recapitulates the AD brain gene signature in vitro. Furthermore, eCLIP-seq analysis revealed that YTHDF proteins influence AD signatures through both m6A-dependent and independent pathways. These results indicate the central role of YTHDF proteins in shaping the gene signature of AD brains.

">RPE-specific MCT2 expression promotes cone survival in models of retinitis pigmentosa</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common cause of inherited retinal degeneration worldwide. It is characterized by the sequential death of rod and cone photoreceptors, the cells responsible for night and daylight vision, respectively. Although mutations in RP are mostly rod-specific, there is a secondary degeneration of cones. One possible mechanism behind cone death is metabolic dysregulation. Photoreceptors are highly metabolically active, consuming large quantities of glucose and producing substantial amounts of lactate. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mediates the transport of glucose from the blood to photoreceptors and, in turn, removes lactate, which it can use as its own source of fuel. The model for metabolic dysregulation in RP suggests that, following the death of rods, lactate levels are substantially diminished causing the RPE to withhold glucose, resulting in nutrient deprivation for cones. Here, we present adeno-associated viral vector-mediated delivery of monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) into RPE cells with the aim of promoting lactate uptake from the blood and encouraging the passage of glucose to cones. We demonstrate prolonged survival and function of cones in rat and mouse RP models, revealing a possible gene agnostic therapy for preserving vision in RP. We also present the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging-based biosensors for lactate and glucose within the eye. Using this technology, we show changes to lactate and glucose levels within MCT2-expressing RPE, suggesting cone survival is impacted by RPE metabolism.

Additionally, elevated TNF levels and -Syn-reactive T cells in circulation suggest a strong link between innate and adaptive immune responses in PD. We have previously reported that reduced levels of the class II transactivator, the master regulator of MHCII expression, increases susceptibility to -Syn-induced PD-like pathology in rats and are associated with higher serum levels of soluble TNF (sTNF). Here, we demonstrate that inhibiting sTNF with a dominant-negative TNF variant, XPro1595, known to be neuroprotective in endotoxin- and toxin-induced neurodegeneration models, fails to protect against robust -Syn-induced PD-like pathology in rats. We used a model combining rAAV-mediated -Syn overexpression in SNpc with striatal injection of -Syn preformed fibrils two weeks later. Systemic XPro1595 treatment was initiated one-week post-rAAV--Syn. We observed up to 70% loss of striatal dopaminergic fibers without treatment, and no protective effects on dopaminergic neurodegeneration after XPro1595 administration. Pathological -Syn levels as well as microglial and astrocytic activation were not reduced in SNpc or striatum following XPro1595 treatment. An increase in IL-6 and IL-1{beta} levels in CSF was observed in rats treated with XPro1595, possibly explaining a lack of protective effects following treatment. Our results highlight the need to determine the importance of timing of treatment initiation, which is crucial for future applications of sTNF therapies in PD patients.

">Sex-biased effect of sodium leak channel NALCN deletion in striatal Drd2 spiny projection neurons</a></h4>

              
                The sodium leak channel NALCN is an important modulator of neuronal excitability, yet its specific role in striatal medium-sized spiny neurons remains largely unexplored. In this study, considering that Nalcn transcripts are enriched in the dorsal and ventral striatum of Drd2-SPNs, we investigated the functional impact of NALCN deletion in Drd2-expressing SPNs in both male and female mice. Electrophysiological recordings revealed significant sex differences, with male SPNs exhibiting altered membrane properties and increased excitability, while females showed more subtle changes. Interestingly, eticlopride-induced intracellular signaling was selectively enhanced in female SPNs lacking NALCN. Behaviorally, male mice exhibited reduced motivation in food-seeking tasks and impaired discrimination of threat cues. Our findings uncover an important, sex-specific role for NALCN in regulating striatal function and behavior and underscore its significance in maintaining normal striatal function.

">Cortex-wide characterization of decision-making neural dynamics during spatial navigation</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making during freely moving behaviors involves complex interactions among many cortical and subcortical regions. However, the spatiotemporal coordination across regions to generate a decision is less understood. Using a head-mounted widefield microscope, cortex-wide calcium dynamics were recorded in mice expressing GCaMP7f as they navigated an 8-maze using two paradigms. The first was an alternating pattern that required short term memory of the previous trial to make the correct decision and the second after a rule change to a fixed path in which rewards were delivered only on the left side. Identification of cortex-wide activation states revealed differences between the two paradigms. There was a higher probability for a visual/retrosplenial cortical state during the alternating paradigm and higher probability of a secondary motor and posterior parietal state during left-only. Three state sequences (motifs) illustrated both anterior and posterior activity propagations across the cortex. The anterior propagating motifs had the highest probability around the decision and propagating motifs peaked following the decision. The latter, likely reflecting internal feedback to influence future actions, were more common in the left-only paradigm. Therefore, the probabilities and sequences of cortical states differ when working memory is required versus a fixed trajectory reward paradigm.

">Twelve phosphomimetic mutations induce the assembly of recombinant full-length human tau into paired helical filaments</a></h4>

              
                The assembly of tau into amyloid filaments is associated with more than twenty neurodegenerative diseases, collectively termed tauopathies. Cryo-EM structures of brain-derived tau filaments revealed that specific structures define different diseases, triggering a quest for the development of experimental model systems that replicate the structures of disease. Here, we describe twelve phosphomimetic, serine/threonine to aspartate, mutations in tau, which we termed PAD12, that collectively induce the in vitro assembly of full-length tau into filaments with the same structure as that of paired helical filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau may facilitate filament formation by disrupting an intramolecular interaction between two IVYK motifs. PAD12 tau can be used for both nucleation-dependent and multiple rounds of seeded assembly in vitro, as well as for the seeding of tau biosensor cells. PAD12 tau can be assembled into paired helical filaments under various shaking conditions, with the resulting filaments being stable for extended periods of time. They can be labelled with fluorophores and biotin. Tau filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease brains have been known to be made of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated full-length tau, but it was not known if the presence of this post-translational modification is more than a mere correlation. Our findings suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau may be sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer tau fold. PAD12 tau will be a useful tool for the study of molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

">SC10X/U: A High-density Electrode System for Non-Invasive Recording of Neural Activity of the Cervical Spinal Cord</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To design and develop a high-density (HD) electrode system that describes the position of surface electrodes for recording electrophysiological signals from the human cervical spinal cord. The system is intended to standardize experimental recordings and facilitate the subsequent analysis of evoked and spontaneous spinal cord neural activity, using high-density electrospinography (HD-ESG). Method: The proposed system (SC10-X/U) describes the locations of up to 76 channels with a unique nomenclature, where the division of the spinal cord (SC) electrode space was inspired by the EEG 10-10 system. As proof of concept, spinal evoked potentials in response to median nerve stimulation at the wrist were recorded from 10 participants and characterized based on a 64-channel derivation from the SC10-X/U system. Results: Following the design criteria, the SC10-X/U defines 76 electrode positions and its configuration. HD-ESG system was utilized to successfully record evoked spinal responses and significant N13 and P9 potential were observed in response to the stimulation. The spinal N13 potential had a latency of 13.2 +- 1.1ms (mean +- SD) after stimulation. A topographic map of the N13 electro-spinal activity using the 64-channel recording system revealed an epicentre at C5-C7 dorsal-vertebral locations (ML4 - ML6 electrodes). Conclusion: The proposed SC10-X/U system will facilitate standardized recording and analysis of high-density ESG signals from the human cervical spinal cord. The system defines electrode locations to promote standardization across different individuals, studies, and clinical and research centres. The HD-ESG evoked potentials recorded using the proposed system were comparable to those observed in previous non-HD studies. The presented topographic maps conform to known neurophysiological and neuroanatomical findings. This served to validate the design and development of the electrode system and patch for future studies.

">Type 2 diabetes remodels collateral circulation and promotes leukocyte adhesion following ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with impaired leptomeningeal collateral compensation and poor stroke outcome. Neutrophils tethering and rolling on endothelium after stroke can also independently reduce flow velocity. However, the chronology and topological changes in collateral circulation in T2DM is not yet defined. Here, we describe the spatial and temporal blood flow dynamics and vessel remodeling in pial arteries and veins and leukocyte-endothelial adhesion following middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke using two-photon microscopy in awake control and T2DM mice. Relative to control mice prior to stroke, T2DM mice already exhibited smaller pial vessels with reduced flow velocity. Following stroke, T2DM mice displayed persistently reduced blood flow in pial arteries and veins, resulting in a poor recovery of downstream penetrating arterial flow and a sustained deficit in microvascular flow. There was also persistent increase of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium of veins, coincided with elevated neutrophils infiltration into brain parenchyma in T2DM mice compared to control mice after stroke. Our data suggest that T2DM-induced increase in chronic inflammation may contribute to the remodeling of leptomeningeal collateral circulation and the observed hemodynamics deficiency that potentiates poor stroke outcome.

">Modulation of leg trajectory by transcranial magnetic stimulation during walking</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex is involved in initiation and adaptive control of locomotion. However, the role of the motor cortex in controlling gait trajectories remains unclear. In animals, cortical neuromodulation allows for precise control of step height. We hypothesized that a similar control framework applies to humans, whereby cortical stimulation would primarily increase foot elevation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the motor cortex to assess the involvement of the corticospinal tract over the limb trajectory during human walking. Eight healthy adults (aged 20-32 years) participated in treadmill walking at 1.5 km/h. TMS was applied over the left motor cortex at an intensity of 120% of the threshold to elicit a dorsiflexion of the right ankle during the swing phase of gait. Electromyographic (EMG) measurements and three-dimensional (3D) lower limb kinematics were collected. When delivered during the early swing phase, TMS led to a significant increase in the maximum height of the right toe by a mean of 40.7% +/- 14.9% (25.6mm +/- 9.4 mm, p = 0.0352) and knee height by 57.8%+/-16.8%; (32mm +/- 9.3 mm; p = 0.008) across participants. These findings indicate that TMS can influence limb trajectory during walking, highlighting its potential as a tool for studying cortical control of locomotion.

">A common stay-on-goal mechanism in anterior cingulate cortex for information and effort choices</a></h4>

              
                Humans and non-humans alike often make choices to gain information, even when the information cannot be used to change the outcome. Prior research has shown the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for evaluating options involving reward-predictive information. Here we studied the role of ACC in information choices using optical inhibition to evaluate the contribution of this region during specific epochs of decision making. Rats could choose between an uninformative option followed by a cue that predicted reward 50% of the time vs. a fully informative option that signaled outcomes with certainty, but was rewarded only 20% of the time. Reward seeking during the informative S+ cue decreased following ACC inhibition, indicating a causal contribution of this region in supporting reward expectation to a cue signaling reward with certainty. Separately in a positive control experiment and in support of a known role for this region in sustaining high-effort behavior for preferred rewards, we observed reduced lever presses and lower breakpoints in effort choices following ACC inhibition. The lack of changes in reward latencies in both types of decisions indicate the motivational value of rewards remained intact, revealing instead a common role for ACC in maintaining persistence toward certain and valuable rewards.

                Recent human neuroimaging studies of episodic memory have revealed a counterintuitive phenomenon in the hippocampus: when events are highly similar, corresponding hippocampal activity patterns are sometimes less correlated than activity patterns associated with unrelated events. This phenomenon (repulsion) is not accounted for by most theories of the hippocampus, and the conditions that trigger repulsion remain poorly understood. Here, we used a spatial route-learning task and high-resolution fMRI in humans to test whether hippocampal repulsion is fundamentally driven by internal beliefs about the environment. By precisely measuring participants' internal beliefs and actively manipulating them, we show that repulsion selectively occurred in hippocampal subfields CA3 and dentate gyrus when visual input was ambiguous, or even identical, but internal beliefs were distinct. These findings firmly establish conditions that elicit repulsion and have broad relevance to theories of hippocampal function and to the fields of human episodic memory and rodent spatial navigation.

                Anticipating distractors during working memory maintenance is critical to reduce their disruptive effects. In this study, we aimed to identify the oscillatory correlates of this process across different spatial scales of neural activity. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFP) from the LPFC and electroencephalograms (EEG) from the scalp of monkeys performing a modified memory-guided saccade (MGS) task. The monkeys were required to remember the location of a target visual stimulus while anticipating distracting visual stimulus, flashed at 50% probability during the delay period. We found significant theta-band activity across spatial scales during anticipation of a distractor, closely linked with underlying working memory dynamics, through decoding and cross-temporal generalization analyses. EEG particularly reflected reactivation of memory around the anticipated time of a distractor, even in the absence of stimuli. During this anticipated time, beta-band activity exhibited transiently enhanced intrahemispheric communication between the LPFC and occipitoparietal brain areas. These oscillatory phenomena were observed only when the monkeys successfully performed the task, implicating their possible functional role in mitigating anticipated distractors. Our results demonstrate that distractor anticipation recruits multiple oscillatory processes across the brain during working memory maintenance, with a key activity observed predominantly in the theta and beta bands.

">Expression of sex steroid receptors and sex differences of Otp glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The medial extended amygdala (EAme) is part of the social behavior network and its subdivisions show expression of sex steroid receptors, which participate in the regulation of sexually dimorphic behaviors. However, EAme subdivisions are highly heterogeneous in terms of neuron subtypes, with different subpopulations being involved in regulation of different aspects of social and non-social behaviors. To further understand the role of the different EAme neurons and their contribution to sexual differences, here we studied one of its major subtypes of glutamatergic neurons, those derived from the telencephalon-opto-hypothalamic domain that coexpress Otp and Foxg1 genes during development. Our results showed that the vast majority of the Otp glutamatergic neurons of the medial amygdala and BSTM in both sexes express Ar, Esr1 (ER-alpha) and Esr2 (ER-beta) mRNA. Moreover, the high percentage of receptors expression in the Otp neurons (between 93 and 100%) indicates that probably the majority of the Otp neurons of EAme are coexpressing the three receptors. In addition, Otp neurons of the posterodorsal medial amygdala have a larger soma and occupy more space in males than in females. These and other features of the Otp neurons regarding their expression of sex steroid receptors likely contribute to some of the sexually-dimorphic behaviors regulated by EAme.

	<p>Emerging research into the human microbiome, an intricate ecosystem of microorganisms residing in and on our bodies, reveals that it plays a pivotal role in maintaining our health, highlighting the potential for microbiome-based interventions to prevent, diagnose, treat, and manage a myriad of diseases. The objective of this review is to highlight the importance of microbiome studies in enhancing our understanding of rare genetic epilepsy and related neurological disorders. Studies suggest that the gut microbiome, acting through the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis, impacts the development and severity of epileptic conditions in children. Disruptions in microbial composition can affect neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory responses, and immune regulation, which are all critical factors in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This growing body of evidence points to the potential of microbiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics or dietary modifications, as innovative approaches to managing epilepsy. By harnessing the power of the microbiome, we stand to develop more effective and personalized treatment strategies for children affected by this disease and other rare neurological diseases.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sensorimotor dysfunction is often reported in individuals experiencing neck pain, irrespective of severity and chronicity. The treatment of neck dysfunction has been found to positively impact sensorimotor integration (SMI), thereby improving sensorimotor function. However, no patient-reported outcome measure has been validated for discrimination between healthy individuals and neck pain patients with disordered SMI, nor has there been documentation of positive change in SMI following neck pain treatment.The purpose of this study was to administer the Sensory-Motor Dysfunction Questionnaire (SMD-Q), for the purposes of: (1) known-group validity between individuals without and with chronic neck pain (CNP) or subclinical neck pain (SCNP); (2) assess the questionnaire&amp;amp;rsquo;s capacity to quantify changes in altered SMI following a tailored treatment plan. Methods: Part 1&amp;amp;mdash;Known Group Validity: The SMD-Q was administered to 30 neck pain (13 with CNP, and 17 with SCNP), and 30 healthy participants. Part 2&amp;amp;mdash;Sensitivity to Change: The SMD-Q was re-administered to neck pain participants following their tailored treatment plans (SCNP&amp;amp;mdash;8-weeks and CNP&amp;amp;mdash;12 weeks). Results: The SMD-Q can discriminate between healthy and neck pain participants (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), and may be sensitive to showing treatment effects (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.162; large effect size (ES)), but the sample size was too small to determine if it can discriminate treatment effects between groups (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.070; medium ES). Conclusions: Differing degrees of disordered SMI can be discriminated by the SMD-Q, but further research is needed to determine its sensitivity to treatment.</p>

	<p>The inexorable progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, is closely related to irreversible brain decline. Accurately characterizing pathophysiological features and identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and optimized treatment are critical. Hindered by the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), obtaining sensitive monitoring indicators for disease progression and achieving efficient drug delivery remain significant challenges. Exosomes, endogenous nanoscale vesicles that carry key bioactive substances, reflect the intracellular environment and play an important role in cell signaling. They have shown promise in traversing the BBB, serving dual roles as potential biomarkers for NDs and vehicles for targeted drug delivery. However, the specific mechanisms by which exosome influence NDs are not fully understood, necessitating further investigation into their attributes and functionalities in the context of NDs. This review explores how exosomes mediate multifaceted interactions, particularly in exacerbating pathogenic processes such as oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and apoptosis integral to NDs. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the profound impact of exosomes under stress and disease states, assessing their prospective utility as biomarkers and drug delivery vectors, offering new perspectives for tackling these challenging diseases.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Hypnosis shows great potential for managing patients suffering from fibromyalgia and chronic pain. Several studies have highlighted its efficacy in improving pain, quality of life, and reducing psychological distress. Despite its known feasibility and efficacy, the mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Building on these insights, this innovative study aims to assess neural activity during hypnosis in fibromyalgia patients using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and self-reported measures. Methods: Thirteen participants with fibromyalgia were included in this study. EEG recordings were done during resting state and hypnosis conditions. After both conditions, levels of pain, comfort, absorption, and dissociation were assessed using a numerical rating scale. Time perception was collected via an open-ended question. The study was prospectively registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov public registry (NCT04263324). Results: Neural oscillations showed increased theta power during hypnosis in the left parietal and occipital electrodes, increased beta power in the frontal and left temporal electrodes, and increased slow-gamma power in the frontal and left parietal electrodes. Functional connectivity using pairwise-phase consistency measures showed decreased connectivity in the frontal electrodes during hypnosis. Graph-based measures, the node strength, and the cluster coefficient were lower in frontal electrodes in the slow-gamma bands during hypnosis compared to resting state. Key findings indicate significant changes in neural oscillations and brain functional connectivity, suggesting potential electrophysiological markers of hypnosis in this patient population.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Vulnerability to sound distraction is commonly reported in older adults with dementia and tends to be associated with adverse impacts on daily activity. However, study outcome heterogeneity is increasingly evident, with preserved resistance to distraction also evident. Contributory factors may include individual differences in distractibility in older adulthood per se, and failure to consider the influence of how difficult a person found the test. Methods: We therefore measured distractibility in a group of older adults by comparing the performance of a primary visual task (Swansea Test of Attentional Control), which includes an adaptive algorithm to take into account how difficult a person finds the test under both no-sound and sound conditions. Results: Analysis revealed no significant difference in group mean performance between no-sound versus sound conditions [t (33) = 0.181, p = 0.858; Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size d = &amp;amp;minus;0.028], but individual differences in performance both within and between sound and no-sound conditions were evident, indicating that for older adults, distracting sounds can be neutral, detrimental, or advantageous with respect to visual task performance. It was not possible to determine individual thresholds for whether sound versus no-sound conditions affected a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s actual behaviour. Conclusions: Nevertheless, our findings indicate how variable such effects may be in older adults, which in turn may help to explain outcome heterogeneity in studies including people living with dementia. Furthermore, such within-group heterogeneity highlights the importance of considering a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s individual performance in order to better understand their behaviour and initiate interventions as required.</p>

	<p>Rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare syndrome presenting in early childhood associated with a high risk of mortality between 50 and 60%. It is characterised by rapid, early onset of obesity between 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;7 years, along with central hypoventilation and hypothalamic dysfunction, such as central hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, disorders of sodium and water balance, growth hormone deficiency, adrenocortical insufficiency, or disorders of puberty and features of autonomic dysregulation. Up to half of cases have neural crest tumours, most commonly ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas. The incidence of ROHHAD syndrome in any population is unknown. Currently, there is no specific diagnostic or genetic biomarker for ROHHAD, and diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, which is often challenging, and consequently may be delayed or unrecognised. Early diagnosis is important, as without intervention, ROHHAD is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Aetiology remains unclear; an autoimmune origin has been postulated, with immunosuppressive agents being used with variable benefit. With no cure, multidisciplinary management is largely supportive. Therefore, there are many unanswered questions in ROHHAD syndrome. In this review article, we outline the challenges posed by ROHHAD syndrome, including aetiology, genetics, diagnosis, screening, management, and prognosis. We present research priorities to tackle these issues to improve outcomes.</p>

                <p>The formation and precise positioning of axons and dendrites are crucial for the development of neural circuits. Although juxtacrine signaling via cell&ndash;cell contact is known to influence these processes, the specific structures and mechanisms regulating neuronal process positioning within the central nervous system (CNS) remain to be fully identified. Our study investigates motoneuron 24 (MN24) in the <I>Drosophila</I> embryonic CNS, which is characterized by a complex yet stereotyped axon projection pattern, known as "axonal routing." In this motoneuron, the primary dendritic branches project laterally toward the midline, specifically emerging at the sites where axons turn. We observed that Scp2-positive neurons contribute to the lateral fascicle structure in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) near MN24 dendrites. Notably, the knockout of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (<I>Dscam1</I>) results in the loss of dendrites and disruption of proper axonal routing in MN24, while not affecting the formation of the fascicle structure. Through cell-type specific knockdown and rescue experiments of Dscam1, we have determined that the interaction between MN24 and Scp2-positive fascicle, mediated by Dscam1, promotes the development of both dendrites and axonal routing. Our findings demonstrate that the holistic configuration of neuronal structures, such as axons and dendrites, within single motoneurons can be governed by local contact with the adjacent neuron fascicle, a novel reference structure for neural circuitry wiring.</p>

                <p>Confirmation bias (CB) is a cognitive bias that allows us to fool ourselves by selectively filtering data and distorting analyses to support favored beliefs or hypotheses. In this article, I will briefly review some classic experiments from cognitive psychology that illustrate what a powerful, pernicious, and insidious force CB is. I will then discuss how to recognize CB in our own thinking and behavior and describe specific elements of good experimental design that can mitigate its effects. These elements&mdash;such as randomization and blinding&mdash;are conceptually straightforward but often difficult in practice and therefore not as widely implemented as they should be.</p>

                Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor clinical outcomes. Hence cost-effective drugs with fewer side effects as a standard supportive therapy might yield substantial advantages in efficacy and safety. Kadukkai maathirai (KM) is being used as a supplement in hepatocellular carcinoma. We evaluated whether KM has any preventive action on cancer progression in diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) - induced HCC in rats. Methods DEN was injected to produce HCC in rats, which was confirmed after 16 weeks. All the rats were orally administered KM for 4 weeks. Hepatoprotective potential (serum AST, ALT, ALP, Bilirubin) and anticancer efficacy (body weight, nodule count, tumor progression by histopathology, expression of GSTM1 by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and In-silico analysis of phytoconstituents against β catenin and LRP analysis were evaluated. Results KM prevented cancer progression against DEN-induced HCC by an increase in GSTM1, a phase II detoxifying enzyme. It significantly reversed altered nodule count, relative liver weight, body weight, and histopathological features of HCC. In silico analysis of phytoconstituents of KM showed that they modulate the intracellular transcription process by inhibiting the armadillo repeat region of β catenin. Conclusions Our results elucidate the potential of KM as a supplement in HCC by reducing nodule count, protecting the liver from further damage, GSTM1 expression, and inhibiting armadillo repeat region of β catenin.

                Background Several studies have shown that the retrieval of positive memories may play a role in emotional regulation. However, it is unclear whether the effects of neutral and positive autobiographical memories differ. It is necessary to confirm whether genuinely neutral autobiographical memories can be retrieved without bias when prompted to recall neutral memories. Methods In this pilot study, using “home” and “study” as cue words, we investigated whether participants were able to retrieve appropriate autobiographical memories when asked to recall a limited number of neutral or positive memories. Results Although participants were asked to recall neutral autobiographical memories, they tended to recall positive memories. Conclusions Our results support the concept of positive memory bias and suggest that future work should consider combining neutral and positive autobiographical memories by asking participants to recall neutral–positive memories.

                Background This study delves into the intricate interplay among paradoxical leadership (PL), employees’ proactive work behaviour (PAB), and perceived psychological contract fulfilment (PPCF). PL, characterized by its simultaneous emphasis on apparently contradictory behaviours, has garnered attention due to its potential to foster innovation, adaptability, and creativity. The study’s main objective is to thoroughly explore the complexities of PL, its influence on PAB, and whether the PPCF serves as a mediator. Methods A survey was distributed to 338 hotel and travel agency employees to gather data. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling through a SmartPLS program. Results The results reveal a positive correlation between PL and PAB. Additionally, PPCF partially mediates this relationship, indicating its vital role in exploring the positive impact of PL on boosting proactive behaviours. Conclusions This research brings forth meaningful contributions to both theoretical and practical dimensions. Theoretically, it enhances our comprehension of how PL manifests in the distinctive landscape of the hospitality and tourism domain, substantiating its potential to drive proactive behaviours among employees. The mediation of PPCF enriches our grasp of the underlying mechanisms, accentuating the significance of maintaining harmonized and consistent leadership practices. From a practical vantage point, these findings offer valuable insights for hospitality and tourism establishments aspiring to optimize their leadership strategies for cultivating proactive work behaviour among their workforces.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1265/v1?src=rss">The efficacy of hemoglobin spray in wound management: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of comparative studies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose There is no evidence comparing the treatment results of hemoglobin spray and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in chronic wounds. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and role of hemoglobin spray in the treatment of chronic wounds. The probabilities of being the best treatment option were estimated and ranked between hemoglobin spray and HBOT. Methods A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and PROSPERO number: CRD42020161396. Results A total of 934 studies were identified from PUBMED and SCOPUS databases, and 112 articles were deleted. Among the 24 studies, 16 RCTs and eight cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. In direct meta-analysis, HBOT had higher proportion of wound healing rate than control with pooled risk ratios (RRs) of 1.67 (95%CI: 1.10, 2.52). Hemoglobin spray had a higher wound healing rate than the control, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.92 (95%CI: 1.35, 2.73). In the network meta-analysis, the probability of being the best treatment was hemoglobin spray, followed by hyperbaric, with surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRAs) of 67.9, and 32.1, respectively. Conclusions Our evidence suggests that the proportion of wound healing in the hemoglobin spray and HBOT groups was higher than that in the control group. A network meta-analysis demonstrated that hemoglobin spray had the highest chance of treatment success. There is a need for further studies using well-designed RCTs and updated meta-analyses to provide enough evidence to compare the effectiveness of hemoglobin spray and HBOT in clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1264/v1?src=rss">Traumatic  brain injury (TBI): Is there anything we can do? A review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered a global health crisis. It results in injury to the brain from an external impact leading to severe disability, with higher incidence statistics recently observed in young adults and elderly individuals. Purpose The review aims to analyze current research findings explaining the prevalence, incidence, and demographics of such injuries stressing the need for enhanced prevention and management techniques. The pathophysiology involves a complex cascade of biochemical and cellular events, which results in necrotic-apoptotic neuronal cell death. Method The review synthesizes current research on TBI, highlighting epidemiological data, advanced diagnostics, and effective rehabilitation strategies like physical and cognitive therapy. Findings Traumatic Brain Injury is an important public health issue with high morbidity and mortality rates causing extreme damage to a person, such as comas, catatonic states for various years, or lifelong injury or demolition. Early diagnostic imaging techniques include CT, MRI, advanced neuroimaging methods, and blood-based biomarkers. In the acute setting, initial management is directed toward stabilizing and preventing secondary injuries and early mobilization. The goals of rehabilitation are to promote the highest level of functional independence and physical function, cognitive functions, and social integration. Conclusion This review highlights that the use of new rehabilitation technologies, such as VR-based and robot-assisted therapies, might lead to improved recovery. Long-term supportive care combined with community integration is mandatory for enhancing quality of life. A systematic multidisciplinary team approach and family support are needed for traumatic brain injury survivors.

                The finite-volume theory has shown to be numerically efficient and stable for topology optimization of continuum elastic structures. The significant features of this numerical technique are the local satisfaction of equilibrium equations and the employment of compatibility conditions along edges in a surface-averaged sense. These are essential properties to adequately mitigate some numerical instabilities in the gradient version of topology optimization algorithms, such as checkerboard, mesh dependence, and local minima issues. Several computational tools have been proposed for topology optimization employing analysis domains discretized with essential features for finite-element approaches. However, this is the first contribution to offer a platform to generate optimized topologies by employing a Matlab code based on the finite-volume theory for compliance minimization problems. The Top2DFVT provides a platform to perform 2D topology optimization of structures in Matlab, from domain initialization for structured meshes to data post-processing. This contribution represents a significant advancement over earlier publications on topology optimization based on the finite-volume theory, which needed more efficient computational tools. Moreover, the Top2DFVT algorithm incorporates SIMP and RAMP material interpolation schemes alongside sensitivity and density filtering techniques, culminating in a notably enhanced optimization tool. The application of this algorithm to various illustrative cases confirms its efficacy and underscores its potential for advancing the field of structural optimization.

                Introduction Numerous studies have concluded that the functional ingredients benefit human health. Similarly, present times have seen exponential growth in functional food in bakery product segments like breads and biscuits. However, there is a lack of information on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional bakery products. This bibliometric study addresses this gap by identifying the current research trends in functional ingredients. Objective To investigate current research trends on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional biscuits. Method The study followed the “Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews” standards for retrieving literature.

                Background Prosthetic joint infection is a serious complication that can arise after total joint replacement surgery. When bacteria colonise an orthopaedic implant, they form biofilms that protect them from their environment, making them difficult to remove. Treatment is further complicated by a global rise of antimicrobial resistance. These protective mechanisms make treatment of prosthetic joint infection increasingly complex. Non-contact induction heating is an upcoming technology that uses heat to eradicate bacteria that are present on the surface of metallic implants. This study aims to provide insight into the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating on metallic implants that are in direct contact with other biomaterials, such as coatings composed of hydroxyapatite and bone cement composed of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Methods Characterisation of hydroxyapatite coatings and adhesion strength tests were conducted according to standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 13779-2). The fixation strength of acrylic bone cement was tested according to an adapted method from ISO. Results It was found that non-contact induction heating did not significantly affect the adhesion strength of hydroxyapatite coatings. In contrast to hydroxyapatite coatings, acrylic bone cement softened temporarily as the temperature exceeded the glass transition temperature (83.38 ± 10.88°C). However, the induction heating temperature had no significant effect on the fixation strength after the cement was allowed to cool down. Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating up to 80°C when bone cement or ceramic coatings are present in contact with infected metallic implants.

                <p>by Yun Zuo, Xingze Fang, Jiayong Wan, Wenying He, Xiangrong Liu, Xiangxiang Zeng, Zhaohong Deng</p>

The translated protein undergoes a specific modification process, which involves the formation of covalent bonds on lysine residues and the attachment of small chemical moieties. The protein’s fundamental physicochemical properties undergo a significant alteration. The change significantly alters the proteins’ 3D structure and activity, enabling them to modulate key physiological processes. The modulation encompasses inhibiting cancer cell growth, delaying ovarian aging, regulating metabolic diseases, and ameliorating depression. Consequently, the identification and comprehension of post-translational lysine modifications hold substantial value in the realms of biological research and drug development. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) at lysine (K) sites are among the most common protein modifications. However, research on K-PTMs has been largely centered on identifying individual modification types, with a relative scarcity of balanced data analysis techniques. In this study, a classification system is developed for the prediction of concurrent multiple modifications at a single lysine residue. Initially, a well-established multi-label position-specific triad amino acid propensity algorithm is utilized for feature encoding. Subsequently, PreMLS: a novel ClusterCentroids undersampling algorithm based on MiniBatchKmeans was introduced to eliminate redundant or similar major class samples, thereby mitigating the issue of class imbalance. A convolutional neural network architecture was specifically constructed for the analysis of biological sequences to predict multiple lysine modification sites. The model, evaluated through five-fold cross-validation and independent testing, was found to significantly outperform existing models such as iMul-kSite and predML-Site. The results presented here aid in prioritizing potential lysine modification sites, facilitating subsequent biological assays and advancing pharmaceutical research. To enhance accessibility, an open-access predictive script has been crafted for the multi-label predictive model developed in this study.

We hypothesize that sample species abundance, sequencing depth, and taxonomic relatedness influence the recovery of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). To test this hypothesis, we assessed MAG recovery in three in silico microbial communities composed of 42 species with the same richness but different sample species abundance, sequencing depth, and taxonomic distribution profiles using three different pipelines for MAG recovery. The pipeline developed by Parks and colleagues (8K) generated the highest number of MAGs and the lowest number of true positives per community profile. The pipeline by Karst and colleagues (DT) showed the most accurate results (~ 92%), outperforming the 8K and Multi-Metagenome pipeline (MM) developed by Albertsen and collaborators. Sequencing depth influenced the accurate recovery of genomes when using the 8K and MM, even with contrasting patterns: the MM pipeline recovered more MAGs found in the original communities when employing sequencing depths up to 60 million reads, while the 8K recovered more true positives in communities sequenced above 60 million reads. DT showed the best species recovery from the same genus, even though close-related species have a low recovery rate in all pipelines. Our results highlight that more bins do not translate to the actual community composition and that sequencing depth plays a role in MAG recovery and increased community resolution. Even low MAG recovery error rates can significantly impact biological inferences. Our data indicates that the scientific community should curate their findings from MAG recovery, especially when asserting novel species or metabolic traits.

                <p>by Carrisa V. Cocuzza, Ruben Sanchez-Romero, Takuya Ito, Ravi D. Mill, Brian P. Keane, Michael W. Cole</p>

A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how function-relevant brain activations are generated. Here we test the hypothesis that function-relevant brain activations are generated primarily by distributed network flows. We focused on visual processing in human cortex, given the long-standing literature supporting the functional relevance of brain activations in visual cortex regions exhibiting visual category selectivity. We began by using fMRI data from N = 352 human participants to identify category-specific responses in visual cortex for images of faces, places, body parts, and tools. We then systematically tested the hypothesis that distributed network flows can generate these localized visual category selective responses. This was accomplished using a recently developed approach for simulating – in a highly empirically constrained manner – the generation of task-evoked brain activations by modeling activity flowing over intrinsic brain connections. We next tested refinements to our hypothesis, focusing on how stimulus-driven network interactions initialized in V1 generate downstream visual category selectivity. We found evidence that network flows directly from V1 were sufficient for generating visual category selectivity, but that additional, globally distributed (whole-cortex) network flows increased category selectivity further. Using null network architectures we also found that each region’s unique intrinsic “connectivity fingerprint” was key to the generation of category selectivity. These results generalized across regions associated with all four visual categories tested (bodies, faces, places, and tools), and provide evidence that the human brain’s intrinsic network organization plays a prominent role in the generation of functionally relevant, localized responses.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011948">Computational joint action: Dynamical models to understand the development of joint coordination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cecilia De Vicariis, Vinil T. Chackochan, Laura Bandini, Eleonora Ravaschio, Vittorio Sanguineti</p>

Coordinating with others is part of our everyday experience. Previous studies using sensorimotor coordination games suggest that human dyads develop coordination strategies that can be interpreted as Nash equilibria. However, if the players are uncertain about what their partner is doing, they develop coordination strategies which are robust to the actual partner’s actions. This has suggested that humans select their actions based on an explicit prediction of what the partner will be doing—a partner model—which is probabilistic by nature. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of a joint coordination over repeated trials remain unknown. Very much like sensorimotor adaptation of individuals to external perturbations (eg force fields or visual rotations), dynamical models may help to understand how joint coordination develops over repeated trials. Here we present a general computational model—based on game theory and Bayesian estimation—designed to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of a joint coordination over repeated trials. Joint tasks are modeled as quadratic games, where each participant’s task is expressed as a quadratic cost function. Each participant predicts their partner’s next move (partner model) by optimally combining predictions and sensory observations, and selects their actions through a stochastic optimization of its expected cost, given the partner model. The model parameters include perceptual uncertainty (sensory noise), partner representation (retention rate and internale noise), uncertainty in action selection and its rate of decay (which can be interpreted as the action’s learning rate). The model can be used in two ways: (i) to simulate interactive behaviors, thus helping to make specific predictions in the context of a given joint action scenario; and (ii) to analyze the action time series in actual experiments, thus providing quantitative metrics that describe individual behaviors during an actual joint action. We demonstrate the model in a variety of joint action scenarios. In a sensorimotor version of the Stag Hunt game, the model predicts that different representations of the partner lead to different Nash equilibria. In a joint two via-point (2-VP) reaching task, in which the actions consist of complex trajectories, the model captures well the observed temporal evolution of performance. For this task we also estimated the model parameters from experimental observations, which provided a comprehensive characterization of individual dyad participants. Computational models of joint action may help identifying the factors preventing or facilitating the development of coordination. They can be used in clinical settings, to interpret the observed behaviors in individuals with impaired interaction capabilities. They may also provide a theoretical basis to devise artificial agents that establish forms of coordination that facilitate neuromotor recovery.

Hepatic lipid metabolism is regulated by the autonomic nervous system of the liver, with the sympathetic innervation being extensively studied, while the parasympathetic efferent innervation is less understood despite its potential importance. In this study, we investigate the consequences of disrupted brain–liver communication on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice exposed to obesogenic conditions. We found that a subset of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes are innervated by parasympathetic nerve terminals originating from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The elimination of the brain–liver axis by deleting parasympathetic cholinergic neurons innervating the liver prevents hepatic steatosis and promotes browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT). The loss of liver-innervating cholinergic neurons increases hepatic <i>Cyp7b1</i> expression and fasting serum bile acid levels. Furthermore, knockdown of the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 gene in ingWAT reverses the beneficial effects of the loss of liver-innervating cholinergic neurons, leading to the reappearance of hepatic steatosis. Deleting liver-innervating cholinergic neurons has a small but significant effect on body weight, which is accompanied by an increase in energy expenditure. Taken together, these data suggest that targeting the parasympathetic cholinergic innervation of the liver is a potential therapeutic approach for enhancing hepatic lipid metabolism in obesity and diabetes.

tRNAs are evolutionarily ancient molecular decoders essential for protein translation. In eukaryotes, tRNAs and other short, noncoding RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) III, an enzyme that promotes ageing in yeast, worms, and flies. Here, we show that a partial reduction in Pol III activity specifically disrupts tRNA levels. This effect is conserved across worms, flies, and mice, where computational models indicate that it impacts mRNA decoding. In all 3 species, reduced Pol III activity increases proteostatic resilience. In worms, it activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and direct disruption of tRNA metabolism is sufficient to recapitulate this. In flies, decreasing Pol III’s transcriptional initiation on tRNA genes by a loss-of-function in the TFIIIC transcription factor robustly extends lifespan, improves proteostatic resilience and recapitulates the broad-spectrum benefits to late-life health seen following partial Pol III inhibition. We provide evidence that a partial reduction in Pol III activity impacts translation, quantitatively or qualitatively, in both worms and flies, indicating a potential mode of action. Our work demonstrates a conserved and previously unappreciated role of tRNAs in animal ageing.

                <p>by Meiyu Ruan, Fan Xu, Na Li, Jing Yu, Fukang Teng, Jiawei Tang, Cheng Huang, Huanhu Zhu</p>

Postembryonic development of animals has long been considered an internally predetermined program, while macronutrients were believed to be essential solely for providing biomatters and energy to support this process. However, in this study, by using a nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (abbreviated as <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> hereafter) model, we surprisingly discovered that dietary supplementation of palmitic acid alone, rather than other abundant essential nutrients such as glucose or amino acid mixture, was sufficient to initiate early postembryonic development even under complete macronutrient deprivation. Such a development was evidenced by changes in morphology, cellular markers in multiple tissues, behaviors, and the global transcription pattern and it occurred earlier than the well-known early L1 nutrient checkpoint. Mechanistically, palmitic acid did not function as a biomatter/energy provider, but rather as a ligand to activate the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49/80, leading to the production of an unknown peroxisome-derived secretive hormone in the intestine. This hormonal signal was received by chemosensory neurons in the head, regulating the insulin-like neuropeptide secretion and its downstream nuclear receptor to orchestrate global development. Additionally, the nutrient-sensing hub mTORC1 played a negative role in this process. In conclusion, our data indicate that free fatty acids act as a primary nutrient signal to launch the early development in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, which suggests that specific nutrients, rather than the internal genetic program, serve as the first impetus for postembryonic development.

Pre-babbling infants can track nonadjacent dependencies (NADs) in the auditory domain. While this forms a crucial prerequisite for language acquisition, the neurodevelopmental origins of this ability remain unknown. We applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy in neonates and 6- to 7-month-old infants to investigate the neural substrate supporting NAD learning and detection using tone sequences in an artificial grammar learning paradigm. Detection of NADs was indicated by left prefrontal activation in neonates while by left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and inferior frontal gyrus activation in 6- to 7-month-olds. Functional connectivity analyses further indicated that the neonate activation pattern during the test phase benefited from a brain network consisting of prefrontal regions, left SMG and STG during the rest and learning phases. These findings suggest a left-hemispheric learning-related functional brain network may emerge at birth and serve as the foundation for the later engagement of these regions for NAD detection, thus, providing a neural basis for language acquisition.

<p>Clinicians fear thrombolysis after direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use due to experience with warfarin. In contrast to vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin, DOACs prevent thrombosis by blocking thrombin. Clinical observational data suggest that thrombolysis may be safe in the setting of DOAC use. Thrombin, a serine protease, acts on the PAR1 receptor of brain cells, resulting in cell killing. Thrombin injury to endothelial cells can lead to blood-brain barrier disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. DOACs such as argatroban and dabigatran, by inhibiting thrombin, prevent PAR1 activation leading to cell protection, blood-brain barrier protection, and reduced risk of hemorrhage.

<p>Direct oral anticoagulants are the primary stroke prevention option in patients with atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulant use before stroke, however, might inhibit clinician comfort with thrombolysis if a stroke does occur. Resuming anticoagulants after ischemic stroke is also problematic for fear of hemorrhage. We describe extensive literature showing that thrombolysis is safe after stroke with direct anticoagulant use. Early reinstitution of direct anticoagulant treatment is associated with lower risk of embolic recurrence and lower hemorrhage risk. The use of direct anticoagulants before, during, and after thrombolysis appears to be safe and is likely to promote improved outcomes after ischemic stroke.

                <p>Genetic testing of patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs) is critical for diagnosis, medical management, and access to precision therapies. Because genetic testing approaches evolve rapidly, professional society practice guidelines serve an essential role in guiding clinical care; however, several challenges exist regarding the creation and equitable implementation of these guidelines. In this scoping review, we assessed the current state of United States professional societies' guidelines pertaining to genetic testing for unexplained global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and cerebral palsy. We describe several identified shortcomings and argue the need for a unified, frequently updated, and easily-accessible cross-specialty society guideline.

<p>Despite therapeutic suppression of relapses, multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often experience subtle deterioration, which extends beyond the definition of “progression independent of relapsing activity.” We propose the concept of smouldering-associated-worsening (SAW), encompassing physical and cognitive symptoms, resulting from smouldering pathological processes, which remain unmet therapeutic targets. We provide a consensus-based framework of possible pathological substrates and manifestations of smouldering MS, and we discuss clinical, radiological, and serum/cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for potentially monitoring SAW. Finally, we share considerations for optimizing disease surveillance and implications for clinical trials to promote the integration of smouldering MS into routine practice and future research efforts.

                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) safety and efficacy in patients with large core infarcts receiving oral anticoagulants (OAC) are unknown. In the SELECT2 trial (NCT03876457), 29 of 180 (16%; vitamin K antagonists 15, direct OACs 14) EVT, and 18 of 172 (10%; vitamin K antagonists 3, direct OACs 15) medical management (MM) patients reported OAC use at baseline. EVT was not associated with better clinical outcomes in the OAC group (EVT 6 [4–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 0.89 [0.53–1.50]), but demonstrated significantly better outcomes in patients without OAC (EVT 4 [3–6] vs MM 5 [4–6], adjusted generalized odds ratio 1.87 [1.45–2.40], <i>p</i> = 0.02). The OAC group had higher comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation (70% vs 17%), congestive heart failure (28% vs 10%), and hypertension (87% vs 72%), suggesting increased frailty. However, the results were consistent after adjustment for these comorbidities, and was similar regardless of the type of OACs used. Whereas any hemorrhage rates were higher in the OAC group receiving EVT (86% in OAC vs 70% in no OAC), no parenchymal hemorrhage or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed with OAC use in both the EVT and MM arms. Although we did not find evidence that the effect was due to excess hemorrhage or confounded by underlying cardiac disease or older age, OAC use alone should not exclude patients from receiving EVT. Baseline comorbidities and ischemic injury extent should be considered while making individualized treatment decisions. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:887–894</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) can show a very heterogeneous trajectory among patients. Here, we explored the mechanisms involved in the expression and prediction of different cognitive phenotypes over 4 years.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 2 independent cohorts (total n = 475), we performed a cluster analysis to identify trajectories of cognitive progression. Baseline and longitudinal level II neuropsychological assessments were conducted, and baseline structural magnetic resonance imaging, resting electroencephalogram and neurofilament light chain plasma quantification were carried out. Linear mixed-effects models were used to study longitudinal changes. Risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia were estimated using multivariable hazard regression. Spectral power density from the electroencephalogram at baseline and source localization were computed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two cognitive trajectories were identified. Cluster 1 presented stability (PD-Stable) over time, whereas cluster 2 showed progressive cognitive decline (PD-Progressors). The PD-Progressors group showed an increased risk for evolving to PD mild cognitive impairment (HR 2.09; 95% CI 1.11–3.95) and a marked risk for dementia (HR 4.87; 95% CI 1.34–17.76), associated with progressive worsening in posterior-cortical-dependent cognitive processes. Both clusters showed equivalent clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and neurofilament light chain levels at baseline. Conversely, the PD-Progressors group showed a fronto-temporo-occipital and parietal slow-wave power density increase, that was in turn related to worsening at 2 and 4 years of follow-up in different cognitive measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the absence of differences in baseline cognitive function and typical markers of neurodegeneration, the further development of an aggressive cognitive decline in PD is associated with increased slow-wave power density and with a different profile of worsening in several posterior-cortical-dependent tasks.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intellectual disability is often the outcome of neurodevelopmental disorders and is characterized by significant impairments in intellectual and adaptive functioning. X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a subset of these disorders caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome, affecting about 2 out of 1,000 males. In syndromic form, it leads to a broad range of cognitive, behavioral, ocular, and physical disabilities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Employing exome or genome sequencing, here we identified 4 missense variants (c.475C &gt; G; p.H159D, c.1373C &gt; A; p.T458N, and c.1585G &gt; A; p.E529K, c.953C &gt; T; p.S318L) and a putative truncating variant (c.1413_1414del; p.Y471*) in the <i>SRPK3</i> gene in 9 XLID patients from 5 unrelated families. To validate <i>SRPK3</i> as a novel XLID gene, we established a knockout (KO) model of the <i>SRPK3</i> orthologue in zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 8 patients ascertained postnatally shared common clinical features including intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum, abnormal eye movement, and ataxia. A ninth case, ascertained prenatally, had a complex structural brain phenotype. Together, these data indicate a pathological role of <i>SRPK3</i> in neurodevelopmental disorders. In post-fertilization day 5 larvae (free swimming stage), KO zebrafish exhibited severe deficits in eye movement and swim bladder inflation, mimicking uncontrolled ocular movement and physical clumsiness observed in human patients. In adult KO zebrafish, cerebellar agenesis and behavioral abnormalities were observed, recapitulating human phenotypes of cerebellar atrophy and intellectual disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, these results suggest a crucial role of <i>SRPK3</i> in the pathogenesis of syndromic X-linked intellectual disability and provide new insights into brain development, cognitive and ocular dysfunction in both humans and zebrafish. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:914–931</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy (ADLD), and to understand the genotype/phenotype correlation of structural variants (SVs) in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Since the discovery of 3D genome architectures and topologically associating domains (TADs), new pathomechanisms have been postulated for SVs, regardless of gene dosage changes. ADLD is a rare genetic disease associated with duplications (classical ADLD) or noncoding deletions (atypical ADLD) in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>High-throughput chromosome conformation capture, RNA sequencing, histopathological analyses of postmortem brain tissues, and clinical and neuroradiological investigations were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We collected data from &gt;20 families worldwide carrying SVs in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus and reported strong clinical variability, even among patients carrying duplications of the entire <i>LMNB1</i> gene, ranging from classical and atypical ADLD to asymptomatic carriers. We showed that patients with classic ADLD always carried intra-TAD duplications, resulting in a simple gene dose gain. Atypical ADLD was caused by <i>LMNB1</i> forebrain-specific misexpression due to inter-TAD deletions or duplications. The inter-TAD duplication, which extends centromerically and crosses the 2 TAD boundaries, did not cause ADLD. Our results provide evidence that astrocytes are key players in ADLD pathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study sheds light on the 3D genome and TAD structural changes associated with SVs in the <i>LMNB1</i> locus, and shows that a duplication encompassing <i>LMNB1</i> is not sufficient per se to diagnose ADLD, thereby strongly affecting genetic counseling. Our study supports breaking TADs as an emerging pathogenic mechanism that should be considered when studying brain diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:855–870</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological condition that causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them, typically during periods of rest. The genetic basis and pathophysiology of RLS are incompletely understood. We sought to identify additional novel genetic risk factors associated with RLS susceptibility.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association meta-analysis of RLS cases (<i>n</i> = 9,851) and controls (<i>n</i> = 38,957) in 3 population-based biobanks (All of Us, Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, and CARTaGENE).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genome-wide association analysis identified 9 independent risk loci, of which 8 had been previously reported, and 1 was a novel risk locus (<i>LMX1B</i>, rs35196838, OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09–1.19, <i>p</i> value = 2.2 × 10<sup>−9</sup>). Furthermore, a transcriptome-wide association study also identified <i>GLO1</i> and a previously unreported gene, <i>ELFN1</i>. A genetic correlation analysis revealed significant common variant overlaps between RLS and neuroticism (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = 0.40, se = 0.08, <i>p</i> value = 5.4 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), depression (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = 0.35, se = 0.06, <i>p</i> value = 2.17 × 10<sup>−8</sup>), and intelligence (<i>r</i>
<sub>g</sub> = −0.20, se = 0.06, <i>p</i> value = 4.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study expands the understanding of the genetic architecture of RLS, and highlights the contributions of common variants to this prevalent neurological disorder. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:994–1005</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Susac syndrome (SuS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) present diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features. We aimed to enhance diagnostic precision by developing the SPAMS (SuS, PACNS, MS) score, a practical radiological tool.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter study included 99 patients (43 SuS, 37 MS, 19 PACNS) from South American countries. Relevant MRI features were identified through an elastic-net model determined key variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SPAMS score assigned 2 points for snowball lesions, 1 point for spokes-like lesions, or if there are more than 4 lesions in the corpus callosum, corpus callosum involvement, or cerebellar involvement. It subtracted 1 point if gadolinium-enhancing lesions or 4 points if Dawson's fingers are present. Bootstrapping validated the optimal cutoff at 2 points, exhibiting a diagnostic performance of area under the curve = 0.931, sensitivity = 88%, specificity = 89%, positive predictive value = 88%, negative predictive value = 89%, and accuracy = 88%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>When specific MRI findings coexisted, the SPAMS score differentiated SuS from MS and PACNS. Access to MRI and standard protocol sequences makes it a valuable tool for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially preventing disability progression and severe clinical outcomes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a triplet repeat expansion within the gene huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>). Antagonistic pleiotropy is a theory of aging that posits that some genes, facilitating individual fitness early in life through adaptive evolutionary changes, also augment detrimental aging-related processes. Antagonistic pleiotropy theory may explain a positive evolutionary pressure toward functionally advantageous brain development that is vulnerable to rapid degeneration. The current study investigated antagonistic pleiotropy in HD using a years-to-onset paradigm in a unique sample of children and young adults at risk for HD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitive, behavioral, motor, and brain structural measures from premanifest gene-expanded (n = 79) and gene nonexpanded (n = 112) participants (6–21 years) in the Kids-HD study were examined. All measures in the gene-expanded group were modeled using a mixed-effects regression approach to assess years-to-onset-based changes while controlling for normal growth. Simultaneously, structure–function associations were also examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Decades from motor onset, gene-expanded participants showed significantly better cognitive, behavioral, and motor scores versus gene nonexpanded controls, along with larger cerebral volumes and cortical features. After this initial peak, a prolonged deterioration was observed in both functional and structural measures. Far from onset, brain measures were positively correlated with functional measures, supporting the view that functional advantages were mediated by structural differences.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Mutant <i>HTT</i> may drive the development of a larger than normal brain that subserves superior early-life function. These findings support the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of <i>HTT</i> in HD, where this gene drives early advantage followed by accelerated aging processes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system is a recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system associated with numerous neurological diseases. However, little is known about glymphatic system development in neonates. We sought to evaluate diffusion along the perivascular space (ALPS) index, a proxy for glymphatic system function, in neonates and investigate its potential associations with maturation, sex, and preterm birth.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 418 neonates, including 92 preterm neonates (57 males) and 326 term neonates (175 males), from the Developing Human Connectome Project were used for evaluating ALPS index. Linear regression modeling was performed to assess group differences in the ALPS index according to preterm birth and sex. Pearson's and partial correlation analysis were performed to assess the association between the ALPS index and gestational age (GA) as well as postmenstrual age (PMA) at MRI. Moderation analysis was performed to assess the moderation effect of preterm birth on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to term neonates, preterm neonates exhibited lower ALPS indices (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The ALPS index positively correlated with PMA (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and GA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Preterm birth (<i>p</i> = 0.013) had a significant moderation effect on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA. Sex had no significant direct effect (<i>p</i> = 0.639) or moderation effect (<i>p</i> = 0.333) on ALPS index.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system development is a dynamic process in neonates, which can be moderated by preterm birth, the ALPS index could serve as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring this process. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:970–980</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27049?af=R">Multiparametric Characterization of Focal Cortical Dysplasia Using 3D MR Fingerprinting</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To develop a multiparametric machine-learning (ML) framework using high-resolution 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) fingerprinting (MRF) data for quantitative characterization of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>We included 119 subjects, 33 patients with focal epilepsy and histopathologically confirmed FCD, 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs), and 26 disease controls (DCs). Subjects underwent whole-brain 3 Tesla MRF acquisition, the reconstruction of which generated T1 and T2 relaxometry maps. A 3D region of interest was manually created for each lesion, and z-score normalization using HC data was performed. We conducted 2D classification with ensemble models using MRF T1 and T2 mean and standard deviation from gray matter and white matter for FCD versus controls. Subtype classification additionally incorporated entropy and uniformity of MRF metrics, as well as morphometric features from the morphometric analysis program (MAP). We translated 2D results to individual probabilities using the percentage of slices above an adaptive threshold. These probabilities and clinical variables were input into a support vector machine for individual-level classification. Fivefold cross-validation was performed and performance metrics were reported using receiver-operating-characteristic-curve analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>FCD versus HC classification yielded mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.945, 0.980, and 0.962, respectively; FCD versus DC classification achieved 0.918, 0.965, and 0.939. In comparison, visual review of the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected 48% (16/33) of the lesions by official radiology report. In the subgroup where both clinical MRI and MAP were negative, the MRF-ML models correctly distinguished FCD patients from HCs and DCs in 98.3% of cross-validation trials. Type II versus non-type-II classification exhibited mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.835, 0.823, and 0.83, respectively; type IIa versus IIb classification showed 0.85, 0.9, and 0.87. In comparison, the transmantle sign was present in 58% (7/12) of the IIb cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The MRF-ML framework presented in this study demonstrated strong efficacy in noninvasively classifying FCD from normal cortex and distinguishing FCD subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:944–957</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) can result from dominant, gain of function variants of neuronal ion channels. More than 450 de novo missense variants of the sodium channel gene <i>SCN8A</i> have been identified in individuals with DEE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied a mouse model carrying the patient <i>Scn8a</i> variant p.Asn1768Asp. An AAV-PHP.eB virus carrying an allele-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) was administered by intracerebroventricular injection. Cas9 was provided by an inherited transgene.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Allele-specific disruption of the reading frame of the pathogenic transcript generated out-of-frame indels in 1/4 to 1/3 of transcripts throughout the brain. This editing efficiency was sufficient to rescue lethality and seizures. Neuronal hyperexcitability was reduced in cells expressing the virus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The data demonstrate efficient allele-specific editing of a dominant missense variant and support the feasibility of allele-specific therapy for DEE epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:958–969</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To understand the etiological landscape and phenotypic differences between 2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) syndromes: DEE with spike–wave activation in sleep (DEE-SWAS) and epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All patients fulfilled International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) DEE-SWAS or EE-SWAS criteria with a Core cohort (n = 91) drawn from our Epilepsy Genetics research program, together with 10 etiologically solved patients referred by collaborators in the Expanded cohort (n = 101). Detailed phenotyping and analysis of molecular genetic results were performed. We compared the phenotypic features of individuals with DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS. Brain-specific gene co-expression analysis was performed for D/EE-SWAS genes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified the etiology in 42/91 (46%) patients in our Core cohort, including 29/44 (66%) with DEE-SWAS and 13/47 (28%) with EE-SWAS. A genetic etiology was identified in 31/91 (34%). D/EE-SWAS genes were highly co-expressed in brain, highlighting the importance of channelopathies and transcriptional regulators. Structural etiologies were found in 12/91 (13%) individuals. We identified 10 novel D/EE-SWAS genes with a range of functions: <i>ATP1A2</i>, <i>CACNA1A</i>, <i>FOXP1</i>, <i>GRIN1</i>, <i>KCNMA1</i>, <i>KCNQ3</i>, <i>PPFIA3</i>, <i>PUF60</i>, <i>SETD1B, and ZBTB18</i>, and 2 novel copy number variants, 17p11.2 duplication and 5q22 deletion. Although developmental regression patterns were similar in both syndromes, DEE-SWAS was associated with a longer duration of epilepsy and poorer intellectual outcome than EE-SWAS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS have highly heterogeneous genetic and structural etiologies. Phenotypic analysis highlights valuable clinical differences between DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS which inform clinical care and prognostic counseling. Our etiological findings pave the way for the development of precision therapies. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:932–943</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88318">DYRK1A interacts with the tuberous sclerosis complex and promotes mTORC1 activity</a></h4>

              
                DYRK1A, a ubiquitously expressed kinase<i>,</i> is linked to the dominant intellectual developmental disorder, microcephaly, and Down syndrome in humans. It regulates numerous cellular processes such as cell cycle, vesicle trafficking, and microtubule assembly. DYRK1A is a critical regulator of organ growth; however, how it regulates organ growth is not fully understood. Here, we show that the knockdown of <i>DYRK1A</i> in mammalian cells results in reduced cell size, which depends on mTORC1. Using proteomic approaches, we found that DYRK1A interacts with the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins, namely TSC1 and TSC2, which negatively regulate mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, we show that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462, a modification known to inhibit TSC activity and promote mTORC1 activity. We also found that the reduced cell growth upon knockdown of DYRK1A can be rescued by overexpression of RHEB, an activator of mTORC1. Our findings suggest that DYRK1A inhibits TSC complex activity through inhibitory phosphorylation on TSC2, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity. Furthermore, using the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction as a model, we show that the <i>mnb,</i> the fly homologs of <i>DYRK1A</i>, is rescued by RHEB overexpression, suggesting a conserved role of <i>DYRK1A</i> in TORC1 regulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96988">LncRNA Snhg3 aggravates hepatic steatosis via PPARγ signaling</a></h4>

              
                LncRNAs are involved in modulating the individual risk and the severity of progression in metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD), but their precise roles remain largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA <i>Snhg3</i> in the development and progression of MASLD, along with the underlying mechanisms. The result showed that <i>Snhg3</i> was significantly downregulated in the liver of high-fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Notably, palmitic acid promoted the expression of <i>Snhg3</i> and overexpression of <i>Snhg3</i> increased lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific <i>Snhg3</i> deficiency decreased body and liver weight, alleviated hepatic steatosis and promoted hepatic fatty acid metabolism in DIO mice, whereas overexpression induced the opposite effect. Mechanistically, <i>Snhg3</i> promoted the expression, stability and nuclear localization of SND1 protein via interacting with SND1, thereby inducing K63-linked ubiquitination modification of SND1. Moreover, <i>Snhg3</i> decreased the H3K27me3 level and induced SND1-mediated chromatin loose remodeling, thus reducing H3K27me3 enrichment at the <i>Pparg</i> promoter and enhancing PPARγ expression. The administration of PPARγ antagonist T0070907 improved <i>Snhg3</i>-aggravated hepatic steatosis. Our study revealed a new signaling pathway, <i>Snhg3</i>/SND1/H3K27me3/PPARγ, responsible for mice MASLD and indicates that lncRNA-mediated epigenetic modification has a crucial role in the pathology of MASLD.

	<p>Background: Uremic toxins resulting from chronic kidney disease (CKD) can cause cognitive and emotional disorders, as well as cardiovascular diseases. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol are notable uremic toxins found in patients with CKD. However, few studies have investigated whether reducing uremic toxins can alleviate cognitive and emotional disorders associated with CKD. Methods: We studied the effects of AST-120, which lowers IS levels, through behavioral tests, local field potentials, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and histological experiments in a 5/6 nephrectomy CKD model. Results: We confirmed AST-120&amp;amp;rsquo;s effectiveness in CKD by measuring serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and IS levels and performing renal tissue staining. Behavioral phenotypes indicated an alleviation of cognitive and anxiety disorders following AST-120 treatment in CKD-induced rats, which was further validated through local field potentials and field excitatory postsynaptic potential recordings. Double immunofluorescence staining for aquaporin-4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the hippocampus of CKD rats treated with AST-120 showed reduced coexpression. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic effects of AST-120 in lowering IS levels and improving cognitive and emotional impairments associated with CKD.</p>

                <p>In the presence of temporally organized stimuli, there is a tendency to entrain to the beat, even at the neurological level. Previous research has shown that when adults listen to rhythmic stimuli and are asked to imagine the beat, their neural responses are the same as when the beat is physically accented. The current study explores the neural processing of simple beat structures where the beat is physically accented or inferred from a previously presented physically accented beat structure in a passive listening context. We further explore the associations of these neural correlates with behavioral and self-reported measures of musicality. Fifty-seven participants completed a passive listening EEG paradigm, a behavioral rhythm discrimination task, and a self-reported musicality questionnaire. Our findings suggest that when the beat is physically accented, individuals demonstrate distinct neural responses to the beat in the beta (13&ndash;23&nbsp;Hz) and gamma (24&ndash;50&nbsp;Hz) frequency bands. We further find that the neural marker in the beta band is associated with individuals&rsquo; self-reported musical perceptual abilities. Overall, this study provides insights into the neural correlates of spontaneous beat processing and its connections with musicality.</p>

                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common focal epilepsy in adults, and people with TLE exhibit higher rates of reproductive endocrine dysfunction. Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons regulate reproductive function in mammals by regulating gonadotropin secretion from the anterior pituitary. Previous research demonstrated GnRH neuron hyperexcitability in both sexes in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE. Fast-inactivating A-type (<I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB>) and delayed rectifier K-type (<I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB>) K<sup>+</sup> currents play critical roles in modulating neuronal excitability, including in GnRH neurons. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GnRH neuron hyperexcitability is associated with reduced <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> conductances. At 2&nbsp;months after IHKA or control saline injection, when IHKA mice exhibit chronic epilepsy, we recorded GnRH neuron excitability, <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB>, and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. GnRH neurons from both IHKA male and diestrus female GnRH-GFP mice exhibited hyperexcitability compared with controls. In IHKA males, although maximum <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> current density was increased, <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> recovery from inactivation was significantly slower, consistent with a hyperexcitability phenotype. In IHKA females, however, both <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> and <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> were unchanged. Sex differences were not observed in <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> or <I>I</I><SUB>K</SUB> properties in controls, but IHKA mice exhibited sex effects in <I>I</I><SUB>A</SUB> properties. These results indicate that although the emergent phenotype of increased GnRH neuron excitability is similar in IHKA males and diestrus females, the underlying mechanisms are distinct. This study thus highlights sex-specific changes in voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents in GnRH neurons in a mouse model of TLE and suggesting potential sex differences in GnRH neuron ion channel properties.</p>

                <p>Animals have evolved innate responses to cues including social, food, and predator odors. In the natural environment, animals are faced with choices that involve balancing risk and reward where innate significance may be at odds with internal need. The ability to update the value of a cue through learning is essential for navigating changing and uncertain environments. However, the mechanisms involved in this modulation are not well defined in mammals. We have established a new olfactory assay that challenges a thirsty mouse to choose an aversive odor over an attractive odor in foraging for water, thus overriding their innate behavioral response to odor. Innately, mice prefer the attractive odor port over the aversive odor port. However, decreasing the probability of water at the attractive port leads mice to prefer the aversive port, reflecting a learned override of the innate response to the odors. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a fourth-order olfactory brain area, involved in flexible value association, with behaviorally relevant outputs throughout the limbic system. We performed optogenetic and chemogenetic silencing experiments that demonstrate the OFC is necessary for this learned modulation of innate aversion to odor. Further, we characterized odor evoked c-fos expression in learned and control mice and found significant suppression of activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral septum, and central and medial amygdala. These findings reveal that the OFC is necessary for the learned override of innate behavior and may signal to limbic structures to modulate innate response to odor.</p>

                Background Contamination of Cartagena Bay, Colombia with heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) presents a major environmental and public health concern, particularly for human communities residing on nearby islands and coastal areas. These populations face enhanced exposure risks owing to their traditional fishing practices and continuous interactions with polluted marine environments. This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of environmental exposure to Hg and Cd in populations from the island zone of the Cartagena district, Bolívar. Methods Ninety-four individuals from the four island communities (study group) and 30 individuals from the urban area of Cartagena (control group) participated in this study. The blood samples were collected to measure total mercury (T-Hg) and Cd concentrations, and a Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BMCyt) assay was used to evaluate exposure effects. Results Cadmiun levels in the blood of the study group were within the normal range and comparable to those of the control group (p > 0.05). However, the study group exhibited significantly higher T-Hg levels (7.34 μg/L) compared to the control group (2.01 μg/L), surpassing the accepted limit. Moreover, the study group showed a higher incidence of DNA damage and cell death biomarkers (p < 0.05). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between total blood Hg levels and the frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. Conclusion These results suggest that island populations of Cartagena are exposed to high levels of Hg and exhibit genotoxic damage, indicating a problem that must be addressed.

                Background Prediabetes, a reversible condition before the onset of diabetes, is a significant concern in healthcare globally. The global prediabetes epidemic has emerged and has considerably impacted health expenditures. Various risk factors play important roles in the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. Intensive lifestyle and pharmacological interventions can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes progression. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of prediabetes state of Medan in August 2023. Methods The sample consisted of 89 participants. This was an analytical cross-sectional study in the community that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The determination of prediabetes is based on the results of blood tests, namely, the examination of fasting blood sugar levels (FBGL), 2-hour postprandial oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C). Other examinations included lipid profiling (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Data processing was performed using SPSS via univariate and bivariate analyses (chi-square test). Results Of the 89 participants, the prevalence of prediabetes based on HbA1c, FBGL and 2-hours OGTT levels was 28.1%, 50.6%, and 28.1%, respectively. 82% of the participants were female, and 53.9% were overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI). The risk factors for prediabetes were age >64 years, female, physical inactivity, and diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg (p<0.05). Other risk factors such age <45-64 years, consumption of vegetables/fruits, BMI, HDL, LDL, trygliceride, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, achantosis nigricans, and waist-hip circumference did not associate significantly (p>0.05). Conclusion This study found that the prevalence of prediabetes was 67.4% in Medan. Age >64 years, female, physical inactivity, and diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg were the most important risk factors for prediabetes.

                Introduction The first 28 days of life are considered the neonatal period, when pediatric health is most vulnerable. While crises can undoubtedly arise during this time, many ED or urgent care visits could be avoided with sufficient preventive hospital care during the newborn period and suitable follow-up with a primary care physician. The use of emergency rooms for non-urgent care could be the cause of rising healthcare costs and ineffective resource use. Purpose This study aimed to determine the presenting features, management, and disposition of neonatal attendance in the emergency department. Methods This was a retrospective observational cross-sectional study of medical records identified via the emergency department of neonatal visits (≤28 days) to King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Khobar, Saudi Arabia, over 12 months (2021–2022). The Chi-square test was performed to compare various etiologies, with a 5% significance level. Results A total of 649 neonate visited pediatric emergency department with a mean age of 15.5 ± 7.4 days and almost equal distribution of the gender. The most common presentation was upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (26.8%), followed by physiological jaundice (20.2%), and colic (14%). A total of 205 (31.6%) neonates who visited the ED showed significant laboratory findings. Seventy-nine patients (12.2%) presenting with PED were admitted to the hospital. Conclusion Healthcare systems must devise strategies to address the growing number of non-urgent visits to emergency departments in a more efficient manner, while simultaneously reallocating scarce resources to higher-acuity cases. This emphasizes the necessity of health personnel educating caregivers. It’s also critical that medical professionals understand the common ailments that affect newborns and are skilled at correctly identifying ailments that could indicate a serious pathology.

                Introduction Antiseptic and antibacterial solutions are increasingly used in the treatment of various types of wounds. The successful stabilization of wounds using a combination Sodium Hypochlorite/Hypochlorous acid (NaOCl/HOCl) or superoxidized solution (SOS) has been reported, serving as an effective solution without irritating mammal cells and without posing a carcinogenic hazard. Presently, no systematic review or meta-analysis is available that compares the effectiveness of these antiseptic solutions. The present study aims to investigate the role of NaOCl/HOCl in the treatment of wounds. Methods The systematic review with extended to network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using NaOCl/HOCl, povidone-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexamethylene biguanide, alcohol, and silver compared with normal saline. The primary outcome was wound healing. Using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), the direct and indirect comparisons were conducted with the probability of selecting the best treatment. Results A total of 507 studies were identified from PUBMED and SCOPUS databases, and 64 articles were duplicates. Among 29 studies included, 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. NaOCl/HOCl had a higher chance of wound healing 1.07-1.30 times compared with all the regimens. NaOCl/HOCl has the probability of providing the best treatment, followed by silver and octenidine with SUCRAs of 36.9, 23.1, and 21.8, respectively. Conclusions NaOCl/HOCl ranks first and proves to have the highest efficacy, followed by silver, octenidine, and PHMB for treatment.

                Hydatid disease is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus and is found globally. Although the liver and lungs are the most prevalent sites of involvement, sub-cutaneous hydatid cysts are rare especially in the primary occurrence. Sub-cutaneous hydatid cysts usually are noticed as slow growing, painless, and mobile masses beneath the overlying skin which is usually normal and are generally found on the trunk and proximal extremities. To the best of our knowledge, very few cases of primary subcutaneous hydatid cysts of the thigh have been documented. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman from a rural setting, who has a large, painless swelling on her thigh. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of a primary subcutaneous hydatid cyst, which is an atypical presentation of the disease. The entire lesion was excised surgically without any evidence of recurrence for a long period postoperatively. This case illustrates the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis and the importance of early surgical management in these cases.

                Introduction Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is the material of choice for pulp therapy. However, Ca(OH)2 has drawbacks such as toxicity, poor sealing, and tunnel defect formation. Alternative materials have been developed to provide more biocompatible materials with better dentin formation ability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of composites containing gelatin (G), chitosan (CH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and Ca(OH)2, namely G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 (Extended data) on inflammation of the dental pulp (expression of COX-2, PGP 9.5, TNF-α, and neutrophil number). Materials and methods A total of 16 Wistar rat models of acute pulp injury were prepared and divided into two groups, treatment and control, 8 with each. In the treatment group, we applied a pulp-capping material using G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. On the 1st and 3rd days, rats were sacrificed. Tissue samples from 4 rats in each group were processed for histological preparation. COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α were observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and neutrophil numbers were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Image analysis of COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α expression was performed using ImageJ software. Results The results showed a decrease in COX-2 expression, but not significantly while PGP 9.5 and TNF-α expression were significantly higher than those in the control group. Neutrophil numbers were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion The G-CH-TEOS-Ca(OH)2 composite material may have potential as an exposed pulp medicament by reducing inflammation (COX-2 expression and number of neutrophils) and increasing the regeneration factor (TNF-α expression) and nerve (PGP 9.5 expression).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-518/v2?src=rss">The development of a roadmap for Health Technology Assessment implementation in Moldova [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Moldova strives for universal health coverage (UHC) and considers health technology assessment (HTA) an important policy instrument to inform the choice of services that should be covered to progressively realize UHC. It plays a key role in determining which technologies are coved, considering various dimensions often including cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and feasibility. This paper reports on work undertaken to develop a roadmap for HTA implementation, using evidence-informed deliberative processes (EDPs) as the guiding framework. Methods Between 2020 and 2022, we undertook several activities that informed the roadmap. We conducted a needs assessment and an assessment of European HTA best practices using a combination of desk research, interviews and surveys. We then conducted a document review of six selected HTA systems, complimented by expert interviews from three neighbouring countries. Results The roadmap provided a suggested HTA process, which included instructions on how to execute the different steps of the EDP framework to enhance the legitimacy of HTA-informed decision-making. The roadmap encompasses several aspects such as how to organize stakeholder involvement, how to identify and operationalize decision criteria, and how to make the decision process transparent. Guidance was given to the country on establishing a legal framework for HTA; a communication strategy; strengthening capacity and leveraging HTA expertise. The country was also given tailored advice on the positioning of the HTA-agency, first as an entity within the Ministry of Health or the National Agency of Public Health but with the long-term vision for it to be independent of any state institution. Conclusions Despite several challenges, including a partial disruption because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development of the roadmap for HTA implementation was completed and agreed upon by the Ministry of Health in Moldova. This work has helped motivate and support the country in HTA institutionalization.

                Background Misconduct in the academic community remains poorly understood among post-graduate dental students (PGDSs) in North Africa. Data on the knowledge of misconduct (KoM) level in this population is lacking. This study assessed KoM of Tunisian PGDSs’. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Monastir, involving 147 PGDSs registered in 2022. Students were recruited via email invitations and convenience sampling at a medical congress. A French survey with 11 questions on KoM, offering three-choice answers (yes/no/maybe) was administered. Each correct answer received one point, and a total score below six indicated a low-level of KoM. Results The mean±SD KoM score of the 106 students who accepted to participate in the study was 4.4±1.8, indicating a low-level of KoM. The majority of PGDSs (85.85%) demonstrated a low-level of KoM. A comparison between subjective and objective assessments of KoM levels revealed that a significant percentage of PGDSs underestimated their knowledge (62.26% vs. 85.85%, respectively). The two groups of PGDSs with low (n=91) and acceptable or excellent (n=15) KoM levels showed comparable characteristics in terms of age, sex, discipline, post-graduate-level, experience-level, graduation-status, and survey-response modality. Conclusion This study identified a low-level of KoM among North-African PGDSs. This emphasizes the need for further efforts to enhance awareness and promote better KoM in this population.

                <p>by Lachlan Webb, Andrew JK Phillips, James A Roberts</p>

Sleep patterns in infancy and early childhood vary greatly and change rapidly during development. In adults, sleep patterns are regulated by interactions between neuronal populations in the brainstem and hypothalamus, driven by the circadian and sleep homeostatic processes. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the sleep patterns and their variations across infancy and early childhood are poorly understood. We investigated whether a well-established mathematical model for sleep regulation in adults can model infant sleep characteristics and explain the physiological basis for developmental changes. By fitting longitudinal sleep data spanning 2 to 540 days after birth, we inferred parameter trajectories across age. We found that the developmental changes in sleep patterns are consistent with a faster accumulation and faster clearance of sleep homeostatic pressure in infancy and a weaker circadian rhythm in early infancy. We also find greater sensitivity to phase-delaying effects of light in infancy and early childhood. These findings reveal fundamental mechanisms that regulate sleep in infancy and early childhood. Given the critical role of sleep in healthy neurodevelopment, this framework could be used to pinpoint pathophysiological mechanisms and identify ways to improve sleep quality in early life.

                <p>by Anika T. Löwe, Léo Touzo, Paul S. Muhle-Karbe, Andrew M. Saxe, Christopher Summerfield, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Humans sometimes have an insight that leads to a sudden and drastic performance improvement on the task they are working on. Sudden strategy adaptations are often linked to insights, considered to be a unique aspect of human cognition tied to complex processes such as creativity or meta-cognitive reasoning. Here, we take a learning perspective and ask whether insight-like behaviour can occur in simple artificial neural networks, even when the models only learn to form input-output associations through gradual gradient descent. We compared learning dynamics in humans and regularised neural networks in a perceptual decision task that included a hidden regularity to solve the task more efficiently. Our results show that only some humans discover this regularity, whose behaviour was marked by a sudden and abrupt strategy switch that reflects an aha-moment. Notably, we find that simple neural networks with a gradual learning rule and a constant learning rate closely mimicked behavioural characteristics of human insight-like switches, exhibiting delay of insight, suddenness and selective occurrence in only some networks. Analyses of network architectures and learning dynamics revealed that insight-like behaviour crucially depended on a regularised gating mechanism and noise added to gradient updates, which allowed the networks to accumulate “silent knowledge” that is initially suppressed by regularised gating. This suggests that insight-like behaviour can arise from gradual learning in simple neural networks, where it reflects the combined influences of noise, gating and regularisation. These results have potential implications for more complex systems, such as the brain, and guide the way for future insight research.

                <p>by Xubin Zheng, Dian Meng, Duo Chen, Wan-Ki Wong, Ka-Ho To, Lei Zhu, JiaFei Wu, Yining Liang, Kwong-Sak Leung, Man-Hon Wong, Lixin Cheng</p>

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by an exaggerated immune response to pathogens, leading to organ damage and high mortality rates in the intensive care unit. Although deep learning has achieved impressive performance on prediction and classification tasks in medicine, it requires large amounts of data and lacks explainability, which hinder its application to sepsis diagnosis. We introduce a deep learning framework, called scCaT, which blends the capsulating architecture with Transformer to develop a sepsis diagnostic model using single-cell RNA sequencing data and transfers it to bulk RNA data. The capsulating architecture effectively groups genes into capsules based on biological functions, which provides explainability in encoding gene expressions. The Transformer serves as a decoder to classify sepsis patients and controls. Our model achieves high accuracy with an AUROC of 0.93 on the single-cell test set and an average AUROC of 0.98 on seven bulk RNA cohorts. Additionally, the capsules can recognize different cell types and distinguish sepsis from control samples based on their biological pathways. This study presents a novel approach for learning gene modules and transferring the model to other data types, offering potential benefits in diagnosing rare diseases with limited subjects.

Vividly imagining a song or a melody is a skill that many people accomplish with relatively little effort. However, we are only beginning to understand how the brain represents, holds, and manipulates these musical “thoughts.” Here, we decoded perceived and imagined melodies from magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain data (<i>N</i> = 71) to characterize their neural representation. We found that, during perception, auditory regions represent the sensory properties of individual sounds. In contrast, a widespread network including fronto-parietal cortex, hippocampus, basal nuclei, and sensorimotor regions hold the melody as an abstract unit during both perception and imagination. Furthermore, the mental manipulation of a melody systematically changes its neural representation, reflecting volitional control of auditory images. Our work sheds light on the nature and dynamics of auditory representations, informing future research on neural decoding of auditory imagination.

                Background Several students use hostel facilities offered by their colleges and universities while pursuing higher education. A crucial change is witnessed in their food habits during their stay at the campus, which is vastly different from their home experience. Method The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand the food choices of university students while following the qualitative research methodology and the phenomenological approach. The snowball sampling method is applied to select participants for the study. We selected twenty-six undergraduate and postgraduate students pursuing programs in technical and health science from a private university at Udupi with residence in the university campus for two to four years. Interviews with candidates were conducted online and audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results The transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to obtain themes, which were then conceptualized to develop the model based on the theory of planned behaviour. The duration of their stay on campus allowed students to gain a perspective on the food events and the food they consumed at the university dining facility (UDF) guided by factors, such as taste, price, availability of time(during academic activity), accessibility to healthy food, academic stress and lack of knowledge on nutrition. Two factors emerged from the interviews, one, there was no display in the dining facility about the nutritional value of the food served; and, second, students preferred to dine out on unhealthy food rather than at the university because food from outside the campus, even though unhealthy, was easier on the pocket. Conclusion The study provides insights into the role of UDF in serving healthy and nutritional food to students for better health and improved academic performance. This work brings to light the relationship between students’ food choices and their impact on academic performance.

<p>This study examined hypothalamus connectivity in adolescents with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Adolescent Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disabling illness of unknown etiology. Increasing evidence suggests hypothalamic involvement in ME/CFS pathophysiology, which has rarely been explored using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the condition. This work aimed to use MRI to examine hypothalamus connectivity in adolescents with ME/CFS and explore how this relates to fatigue severity and illness duration. 25 adolescents with ME/CFS and 23 healthy controls completed a neuroimaging protocol consisting of structural and multishell diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, in addition to the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale to assess fatigue severity. Information about illness duration was acquired at diagnosis. Preprocessing and streamlines tractography was performed using <i>QSIPrep</i> combined with a custom parcellation scheme to create structural networks. The number (degree) and weight (strength) of connections between lateralized hypothalamus regions and cortical and subcortical nodes were extracted, and relationships between connectivity measures, fatigue severity, and illness duration were performed using Bayesian regression models. We observed weak-to-moderate evidence of increased degree, but not strength, of connections from the bilateral anterior-inferior (left: <i>pd</i> [%] = 99.18, median [95% CI] = −22.68[−40.96 to 4.45]; right: <i>pd</i> [%] = 99.86, median [95% CI] = −23.35[−38.47 to 8.20]), left anterior-superior (<i>pd</i> [%] = 99.33, median [95% CI] = −18.83[−33.45 to 4.07]) and total left hypothalamus (<i>pd</i> [%] = 99.44, median [95% CI] = −47.18[−83.74 to 11.03]) in the ME/CFS group compared with controls. Conversely, bilateral posterior hypothalamus degree decreased with increasing ME/CFS illness duration (left: <i>pd</i> [%] = 98.13, median [95% CI]: −0.47[−0.89 to 0.03]; right: <i>pd</i> [%] = 98.50, median [95% CI]:-0.43[−0.82 to 0.05]). Finally, a weak relationship between right intermediate hypothalamus connectivity strength and fatigue severity was identified in the ME/CFS group (<i>pd</i> [%] = 99.35, median [95% CI] = −0.28[−0.51 to 0.06]), which was absent in controls. These findings suggest changes in hypothalamus connectivity may occur in adolescents with ME/CFS, warranting further investigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-958/v2?src=rss">The macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries: A panel data analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.
