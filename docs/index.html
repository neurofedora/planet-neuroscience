Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu<br />  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini<br /> The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Christian R   Burgess, Yoav   Livneh, Rohan N   Ramesh, Mark L   Andermann<br /> Physiological need states and associated motivational drives can bias visual processing of cues that help meet these needs. Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Jian   Ma, Zhongfu   Shen, Yong-Chun   Yu, Song-Hai   Shi<br /> Delineating the lineage of neural cells that captures the progressive steps in their specification is fundamental to understanding brain development, organization, and function. Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng<br /> Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Jee-Yeon   Hwang, R Suzanne   Zukin<br /> The restrictive element-1 silencing transcription factor)/NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) is a transcriptional repressor which acts via epigenetic remodeling to silence target genes. Emerging evidence indicates that REST is a master transcriptional regulator of neuron-specific genes not only in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, but also in differentiated neurons during the critical period in postnatal brain development, where it plays a role in fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and in normal aging, where it promotes neuroprotection by repressing genes involved in oxidative stress and β-amyloid toxicity. This review focuses on recent findings that dysregulation of REST and REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling provide a central mechanism critical to the progressive neurodegeneration associated with neurologic disorders and diseases including global ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Steffen BE   Wolff, Bence P   Ölveczky<br /> The development of increasingly sophisticated methods for recording and manipulating neural activity is revolutionizing neuroscience. By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Francesco   Petrelli, Paola   Bezzi<br /> Astrocytes, the largest glial population in human and murine brains, are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity. During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Le   Xiao, Peter   Scheiffele<br /> The view of cerebellar functions has been extended from controlling sensorimotor processes to processing ‘contextual’ information and generating predictions for a diverse range of behaviors. These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Carla EM   Golden, Joseph D   Buxbaum, Silvia   De Rubeis<br /> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are caused by a wide range of genetic mutations, a significant fraction of which reside in genes important for synaptic function. Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Yishi   Jin, Yingchuan B   Qi<br /> The ability of neurons to modify or remodel their synaptic connectivity is critical for the function of neural circuitry throughout the life of an animal. Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell<br /> When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. <br /><br />

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

The biological basis of consciousness is one of the most challenging and fundamental questions in 21st century science. A related pursuit aims to identify the neural correlates and causes of unconsciousness. We review current trends in the investigation of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological states of unconsciousness at the level of large-scale functional brain networks. We focus on the roles of brain connectivity, repertoire, graph-theoretical techniques, and neural dynamics in understanding the functional brain disconnections and reduced complexity that appear to characterize these states.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259671v1?rss=1">Variable training but not sleep improves consolidation of motor adaptation</a></h4>

Motor memory is an important learning feature. How its consolidation depends on sleep is still unsolved. Some motor tasks were previously shown to depend on sleep to some extent, whereas pure non-hippocampal dependent motor tasks, like motor adaptation, might not. However, recent research suggests that training schedules might affect the sleep dependency of motor adaptation tasks. This study investigated whether sleep differentially impacts memory consolidation on a motor adaptation task dependent on the training schedule. Healthy men were trained with their dominant right hand on a force field adaptation task and re-tested after an 11-h consolidation period either involving overnight sleep (Sleep group) or daytime wakefulness (Wake group). The Retest session comprised a Posttest and a Transfer test to the left hand. Half of the subjects in each group trained the adaptation to different force field magnitudes in a blocked schedule with low inter-trial variability (Sleep-Blocked; Wake-Blocked), the other half in a random schedule with high variability (Sleep-Random; Wake-Random). EEG records during task performance and overnight polysomnography was obtained. Consistent with the notion that sleep generally does not benefit motor adaptation, memory performance did not differ between Wake and Sleep groups, although Posttest performance specifically correlated with sleep spindles nesting in slow wave upstates. Increased, inter-trial variability at Training produced better performance at the Posttest and Transfer test. This improvement appeared to result from the participants increased ability to use feedback for ongoing movement corrections, and correlated with EEG alpha power over the left parietal cortex during the task.

An important unresolved question about neural processing is the mechanism by which distant brain areas coordinate their activities and relate their local processing to global neural events. A potential candidate for the local-global integration are slow rhythms such as respiration, which is also linked to sensory exploration. In this article, we asked if there are modulations of local cortical processing which are time-locked to (peripheral) sensory-motor exploratory rhythms. We studied rats freely behaving on an elevated platform where they would display exploratory and rest behaviors. Concurrent with behavior, we monitored orofacial sampling rhythms (whisking and sniffing) and local field potentials (LFP) from olfactory bulb, dorsal hippocampus, primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex and primary visual cortex. We defined exploration as simultaneous whisking and sniffing above 5 Hz and found that this activity peaked at about 8 Hz. We considered rest as the absence of whisking and sniffing, and in this case, mean respiration occurred at about 3 Hz. We found a consistent shift across all areas toward these rhythm peaks accompanying behavioral state changes. We also found, across areas, that LFP gamma (70-100 Hz) amplitude could time-lock to the animal's respiratory rhythm, a finding indicative of respiration-locked changes in local processing. The respiratory rhythm, although occurring at the same frequencies of hippocampal theta, was not spectrally coherent with it, implying a different oscillator. Our results are consistent with the notion of respiration as a binder or integrator of activity between distant brain regions.

Objective: Young children are often unable to remain still for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Various preparation methods have been reported to avoid sedation or anesthesia, with mixed success rates and feasibility. Here we describe a time-efficient preparation method and factors associated with successful scanning in young chdilren. We recruited 134 children aged 2.0-5.0 years for an MRI study. Some children completed a training session on a mock scanner, and all children received a 15-20 minute introduction to scanning procedures immediately before their scan. We compared success between children receiving mock scanner training or not, and evaluated demographic or cognitive factors that predicted success. Results: 97 children (72%) completed at least one sequence successfully; 64 children provided high-quality data for all 3 sequences. Cognitive scores were higher in successful children, but children who received mock scanner training were less likely to be successful. A case-controlled comparison of children matched on age, gender, and cognitive scores found no differences between children receiving training or not. We present a quick method for preparing young children for awake MRI scans. Our data suggests limited advantages of mock scanner preparation for healthy young children, and that cognitive abilities may help predict success.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/222448v1?rss=1">Independent control of slow and fast flight manoeuvres in insects: the roles of vision and antennal mechanoreception</a></h4>

Flying animals need constant sensory feedback about their body position and orientation for flight control. The visual system provides valuable but slow feedback. In contrast, mechanosensory channels can provide feedback at much shorter response times. How the contributions from the two senses are integrated is still an open question in most insect groups. In Diptera, fast mechanosensory feedback is provided by organs called halteres, and is crucial for the control of rapid flight manoeuvres, while vision controls manoeuvres in lower temporal frequency bands. Here we have investigated the visual-mechanosensory integration in an insect which lacks halteres: the hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. It is representative for a large group of insects that use mechanoreceptive Johnston's organs in their antennae to provide gyroscopic feedback on perturbations in body position. High-speed videos of freely-flying hawkmoths hovering at stationary or oscillating artificial flowers show that positional fidelity during flight was reduced in antennectomised animals, but was rescued after antennal re-attachment. Our experiments show that antennal mechanosensory feedback specifically supports fast flight manoeuvres (flower oscillations between 2-6 Hz), but not slow ones. Differences in the reliability of visual feedback (in different light intensities) affected all antennal conditions equally, suggesting there was no compensatory interaction between antennal and visual feedback under the conditions tested. These results establish the importance of antennal mechanosensors in providing rapid mechanosensory feedback for finer control of flight manoeuvres, acting in parallel to visual feedback.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors (D<sub>2</sub>Rs) contribute to the inverted U-shaped relationship between dopamine signaling and prefrontal function.

These results match earlier evidence in non-human primates and confirm the physiological relevance of this <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> co-expression network.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>How the variety of neurons that organize into neocortical layers and functional areas arises is a central question in the study of cortical development. While both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are known to influence this process, whether distinct neuronal progenitor groups contribute to neuron diversity and allocation is poorly understood. Using in vivo genetic fate-mapping combined with whole-cell patch clamp recording, we show that the firing pattern and apical dendritic morphology of excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are specified in part by their neural precursor lineage. Further, we show that separate precursors contribute to unique features of barrel cortex topography including the intralaminar position and thalamic innervation of the neurons they generate. Importantly, many of these lineage-specified characteristics are different from those previously measured for pyramidal neurons in layers 2–3 of the frontal cortex. Collectively, our data elucidate a dynamic temporal program in neuronal precursors that fine-tunes the properties of their progeny according to the lamina of destination.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Rhythmic synchronization of neurons is known to affect neuronal interactions. In the motor system, oscillatory power fluctuations modulate corticospinal excitability. However, previous research addressing phase-specific gain modulation in the motor system has resulted in contradictory findings. It remains unclear how many time windows of increased responsiveness each oscillatory cycle provides. Moreover, we still lack conclusive evidence as to whether the motor cortex entails an intrinsic response modulation along the rhythm cycle, as shown for spinal neurons. We investigated this question with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex at rest. Application of near-motor threshold stimuli revealed a frequency- and phase-specific gain modulation at both cortical and spinal level, independent of the spontaneous oscillatory power fluctuations at each level. We detected bilateral sensorimotor circuits in the lower beta-band (14–17 Hz) and unilateral corticospinal circuits in the upper beta-band (20–24 Hz). These findings provide novel evidence that intrinsic activity in the human motor cortex modulates input gain along the beta oscillatory cycle within distinct circuits. In accordance with periodic alternations of synchronous hyper- and depolarization, increased neuronal responsiveness occurred once per oscillatory beta cycle. This information may lead to new brain state-dependent and circuit-specific interventions for targeted neuromodulation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence consistent with the supportive role of eye movement in neural reactivation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Flexible interactions between brain regions enable neural systems to adaptively transfer and process information. However, the neural substrates that regulate adaptive communications between brain regions are understudied. In this human fMRI study, we investigated this issue by tracking time-varying, task-evoked changes in functional connectivity between localized occipitotemporal regions while participants performed different tasks on the same visually presented stimuli. We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal and the primary visual regions selectively increased during the processing of task-relevant information. Further, additional task demands selectively strengthen these targeted connectivity patterns. To identify candidate regions that contribute to this increase in inter-regional coupling, we regressed the task-specific time-varying connectivity strength between primary visual and occipitotemporal regions against voxel-wise activity patterns elsewhere in the brain. This allowed us to identify a set of frontal and parietal regions whose activity increased as a function of task-evoked functional connectivity. These results suggest that frontoparietal regions may provide top-down biasing signals to influence task-specific interactions between brain regions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Creativity is the ability to see the world in new ways. Creative individuals exhibit the ability to switch between different modes of thinking and shift their mental focus. This suggests a connection between creativity and dynamic interactions of brain networks. We report here the first investigation into the relationship between the reconfiguration of dynamic brain networks during the resting state and verbal creativity using two fMRI datasets involving 574 subjects. We find that verbal creativity correlates with temporal variability of the functional-connectivity (FC) patterns of the lateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. High variability of these regions indicates flexible connectivity patterns which may facilitate executive functions. Furthermore, verbal creativity correlates with the temporal variability of FC patterns within the default mode network (DMN), between the DMN and attention/sensorimotor network, and between control and sensory networks. High variability of FCs between the DMN and attention networks characterizes frequent adjustments of attention. Finally, dynamic interaction between the cerebellum and task control network also contributes to verbal creativity, suggesting a relationship between the cerebellum and creativity. This study reveals a close relationship between verbal creativity and high variability of cortical networks involved in spontaneous thought, attention and cognitive control.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Several human imaging studies have suggested that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is highly active when participants receive competing inputs, and that these signals may be important for influencing the downstream planning of actions. Despite increasing evidence from several neuroimaging studies, no study has examined ACC activity at the level of the single neuron in rodents performing similar tasks. To fill this gap, we recorded from single neurons in ACC while rats performed a stop-change task. We found higher firing on trials with competing inputs (STOP trials), and that firing rates were positively correlated with accuracy and movement speed, suggesting that when ACC was engaged, rats tended to slow down and perform better. Finally, firing was the strongest when STOP trials were preceded by GO trials and was reduced when rats adapted their behavior on trials subsequent to a STOP trial. These data provide the first evidence that activity of single neurons in ACC is elevated when 2 responses are in competition with each other when there is a need to change the course of action to obtain reward.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuron-glial related cell adhesion molecule NrCAM is a newly identified negative regulator of spine density that genetically interacts with Semaphorin3F (Sema3F), and is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To investigate a role for NrCAM in spine pruning during the critical adolescent period when networks are established, we generated novel conditional, inducible NrCAM mutant mice (Nex1Cre-ERT2: NrCAMflox/flox). We demonstrate that NrCAM functions cell autonomously during adolescence in pyramidal neurons to restrict spine density in the visual (V1) and medial frontal cortex (MFC). Guided by molecular modeling, we found that NrCAM promoted clustering of the Sema3F holoreceptor complex by interfacing with Neuropilin-2 (Npn2) and PDZ scaffold protein SAP102. NrCAM-induced receptor clustering stimulated the Rap-GAP activity of PlexinA3 (PlexA3) within the holoreceptor complex, which in turn, inhibited Rap1-GTPase and inactivated adhesive β1 integrins, essential for Sema3F-induced spine pruning. These results define a developmental function for NrCAM in Sema3F receptor signaling that limits dendritic spine density on cortical pyramidal neurons during adolescence.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the ongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations. A simple analytic account for how fast spike time correlations affect both microscopic and macroscopic network structure is lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory for STDP in recurrent networks and show the emergence of assemblies of strongly coupled neurons with shared stimulus preferences. After training, this connectivity is actively reinforced by spike train correlations during the spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding. Assembly formation has often been associated with firing rate-based plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary framework, where fine temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain learned structure in cortical networks.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) harbors neural stem cells (NSCs) that exhibit robust neurogenesis. However, the epigenetic mechanisms that maintain NSCs and regulate neurogenesis remain unclear. We report that label-retaining SVZ NSCs express Eed, the core component of Polycomb repressive complex 2. In vivo and in vitro conditional knockout and knockdown show Eed is necessary for maintaining NSC proliferation, neurogenesis and neurosphere formation. We discovered that Eed functions to maintain p21 protein levels in NSCs by repressing Gata6 transcription. Both Gata6 overexpression and p21 knockdown reduced neurogenesis, while Gata6 knockdown or p21 overexpression partially rescued neurogenesis after Eed loss. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Eed impaired injury induced SVZ proliferation and emigration.

Axon regeneration in the central nervous system is prevented in part by a developmental decline in the intrinsic regenerative ability of maturing neurons. This loss of axon growth ability likely reflects widespread changes in gene expression, but the mechanisms that drive this shift remain unclear. Chromatin accessibility has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in other cellular contexts, raising the possibility that chromatin structure may contribute to the age-dependent loss of regenerative potential. Here we establish an integrated bioinformatic pipeline that combines analysis of developmentally dynamic gene networks with transcription factor regulation and genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility. When applied to the developing cortex, this pipeline detected overall closure of chromatin in sub-networks of genes associated with axon growth. We next analyzed mature CNS neurons that were supplied with various pro-regenerative transcription factors. Unlike prior results with SOX11 and KLF7, here we found that neither JUN nor an activated form of STAT3 promoted substantial corticospinal tract regeneration. Correspondingly, chromatin accessibility in JUN or STAT3 target genes was substantially lower than in predicted targets of SOX11 and KLF7. Finally, we used the pipeline to predict pioneer factors that could potentially relieve chromatin constraints at growth-associated loci. Overall this integrated analysis substantiates the hypothesis that dynamic chromatin accessibility contributes to the developmental decline in axon growth ability and influences the efficacy of pro-regenerative interventions in the adult, while also pointing toward selected pioneer factors as high-priority candidates for future combinatorial experiments.

Intrinsic Connectivity Networks, patterns of correlated activity emerging from "resting-state" Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent time series, are increasingly being associated to cognitive, clinical, and behavioral aspects, and compared with the pattern of activity elicited by specific tasks. In this study we use a large cohort of publicly available data to test to which extent one can associate a brain region to one of these Intrinsic Connectivity Networks looking only at its connectivity pattern, and examine at how the correspondence between resting and task-based patterns can be mapped in this context. By trying a battery of different supervised classifiers relying only on task-based measurements, we show that the highest accuracy is reached with a simple neural network of one hidden layer. In addition, when testing the fitted model on resting state measurements, such architecture yields a performance close to 90% for areas connected to the task performed, which mainly involve the visual and sensorimotor cortex. This clearly confirms the correspondence of Intrinsic Connectivity Networks in both paradigms and opens a window for future clinical applications to subjects whose participation in a required task cannot be guaranteed.

Detecting rapid coincident changes across sensory modalities is essential to recognize sudden threats and events. Using two-photon calcium imaging in identified cell types in awake mice, we show that auditory cortex (AC) neurons projecting to primary visual cortex (V1) preferentially encode the abrupt onsets of sounds. In V1, a sub-population of layer 1 interneurons gates this selective cross-modal information by a suppression specific to the absence of visual inputs. However, when large auditory onsets coincide with visual stimuli, visual responses are strongly boosted in V1. Thus, a dynamic asymmetric circuit across AC and V1 specifically identifies visual events starting simultaneously to sudden sounds, potentially catalyzing localization of new sound sources in the visual field.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has long been implicated in migraine attacks with aura. The process by which CSD, a cortical event that occurs within the blood brain barrier (BBB), results in nociceptor activation outside the BBB is likely mediated by multiple molecules and cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether CSD activates immune cells inside the BBB (pia), outside the BBB (dura), or in both, and if so, when.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Investigating cellular events in the meninges shortly after CSD, we used <em>in-vivo</em> 2-photon imaging to identify changes in macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) that reside in the pia, arachnoid, and dura, and their anatomical relationship to TRPV1 axons.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>We found that activated meningeal macrophages retract their processes and become circular, and that activated meningeal DC stop migrating. We found that CSD activates pial macrophages instantaneously, pial, subarachnoid and dural DC 6-12 minutes later, and dural macrophages 20 minutes later. Dural macrophages and DC can appear in close proximity to TRPV1-positive axons.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The findings suggest that activation of pial macrophages may be more relevant to cases where aura and migraine begin simultaneously, that activation of dural macrophages may be more relevant to cases where headache begins 20-30 minutes after aura, and that activation of dural macrophages may be mediated by activation of migratory DC in the SAS and dura. The anatomical relationship between TRPV1-positive meningeal nociceptors, and dural macrophages and dendritic cells support a role for these immune cells in the modulation of head pain.

Trough RivLev<sub>(≤137ng/ml)</sub> occurred in 126/190 (66.3%) AIS- and 34/51 (66.7%) ICH-patients. Among AIS-patients, 108/190 (56.8%) had RivLev≤100ng/ml. In ICH-patients 33/51(64.7%) had RivLev≥75ng/ml. RivLev were associated with rivaroxaban dosage, inversely with renal function and time-since-last-intake (each p&lt;.05). INR≤1.0 had a specificity of 98.9% and a sensitivity of 25.7% to predict RivLev≤100ng/ml. INR≥1.4 had a sensitivity of 59.3% and specificity of 90.1% to predict RivLev≥75ng/ml.</p></div>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To investigate sleep disturbances that induce cognitive changes over four years in non-demented elderlies.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Data were acquired from a nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort of Korean elderlies (2,238 normal cognition [NC] and 655 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). At baseline and 4-year follow up assessments, sleep-related parameters (mid-sleep time, sleep duration, latency, subjective quality, efficiency and daytime dysfunction) and cognitive status were measured using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment, respectively. We used logistic regression models adjusted for covariates including age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, Geriatric Depression Scale, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, and physical activity.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: In participants with NC, long sleep latency (&gt; 30 min), long sleep duration (≥ 7.95 hr), and late mid-sleep time (after 3:00AM) at baseline were related to the risk of cognitive decline at 4-year follow-up assessment; odds ratio (OR) was 1.40 for long sleep latency, 1.67 for long sleep duration, and 0.61 for late mid-sleep time. These relationships remained significant when these variables maintained their status throughout the follow-up period. Newly developed long sleep latency also doubled the risk of cognitive decline. In those with MCI, however, only long sleep latency reduced the chance of reversion to NC (OR = 0.69).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: As early markers of cognitive decline, long sleep latency can be used for elderlies with NC or MCI, while long sleep duration and relatively early sleep time might be used for cognitively normal elderlies only.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) is a genetic focal epilepsy characterized by auditory symptoms. Two genes, <em>LGI1</em> and <em>RELN</em>, encoding secreted proteins, are implicated in the etiology of ADLTE, but half of the affected families remain genetically unsolved, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be clarified. We aimed to identify additional genes causing ADLTE to better understand the genetic basis and molecular pathway underlying this epileptic disorder.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: A cohort of Italian ADLTE families was examined by whole exome sequencing combined with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism-array linkage analysis.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: We identified two ADLTE-causing variants in the <em>MICAL-1</em> gene: a p.Gly150Ser substitution occurring in the enzymatically active monooxygenase (MO) domain, and a p.Ala1065fs frameshift indel in the C-terminal domain, which inhibits the oxidoreductase activity of the MO domain. Each variant segregated with ADLTE in a single family. Examination of candidate variants in additional genes excluded their implication in ADLTE. In cell-based assays, both variants significantly increased MICAL-1 oxidoreductase activity and induced cell contraction in COS7 cells, which likely resulted from deregulation of F-actin dynamics.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: MICAL-1 oxidoreductase activity induces disassembly of actin filaments, thereby regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in developing and adult neurons and in other cell types. This suggests that dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics is a likely mechanism by which <em>MICAL-1</em> pathogenic variants lead to ADLTE. This article is protected by copyright.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The pathophysiology of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is still unclear.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The nerve excitability test in SMA patients and a mouse model of SMA was carried out to explore the pathophysiology of nodal and internodal currents, and quantitative PCR, Western blotting and whole-cell patch-clamp recording were used for the identified hypothesis.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>The nerve excitability test in SMA patients showed increased inward rectification in the current-threshold relationship and increased overshoot after hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus, which indicates increased hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current; these findings correlated with disease severity. Increased inward rectification in the current-threshold relationship was reproducible in a mouse model of mild SMA and the abnormality preceded the decline of compound motor action potential amplitudes. Furthermore, quantitative PCR of spinal cord tissues and Western blotting of the spinal cord and sciatic nerves showed increased HCN1 and HCN2 expression in the SMA mice, and voltage-clamp recording in dissociated spinal motor neurons from SMA mice also showed increased HCN current density. Treatment with ZD7288, an HCN channel blocker, also reduced early mortality, improved motor function, and restored neuromuscular junction architecture in a mouse model of severe SMA.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This study shows that increased HCN current underlies the pathophysiology of SMA and can be a novel non-SMN-target for SMA therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

A significant portion of bone fractures fail to heal properly, increasing healthcare costs. Advances in fracture management have slowed because translation barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to facilitate discovery of biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models—Callus Analogs—were created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing an alternative way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80×80 μm region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog—a theory—of the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve ≥ 70% Similarity. We used an iterative refinement protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73–90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2–4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83–94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a fresh medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qhxB-qfzMYk" width="1" />

<p>by Bandan Chakrabortty, Ikram Blilou, Ben Scheres, Bela M. Mulder</p>

Plant morphogenesis is strongly dependent on the directional growth and the subsequent oriented division of individual cells. It has been shown that the plant cortical microtubule array plays a key role in controlling both these processes. This ordered structure emerges as the collective result of stochastic interactions between large numbers of dynamic microtubules. To elucidate this complex self-organization process a number of analytical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of cortical microtubules have been proposed. To date, however, these models have been restricted to two dimensional planes or geometrically simple surfaces in three dimensions, which strongly limits their applicability as plant cells display a wide variety of shapes. This limitation is even more acute, as both local as well as global geometrical features of cells are expected to influence the overall organization of the array. Here we describe a framework for efficiently simulating microtubule dynamics on triangulated approximations of arbitrary three dimensional surfaces. This allows the study of microtubule array organization on realistic cell surfaces obtained by segmentation of microscopic images. We validate the framework against expected or known results for the spherical and cubical geometry. We then use it to systematically study the individual contributions of global geometry, cell-edge induced catastrophes and cell-face induced stability to array organization in a cuboidal geometry. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze the highly non-trivial geometry of leaf pavement cells of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and <i>Hedera helix</i>. We show that our simulations can predict multiple features of the microtubule array structure in these cells, revealing, among others, strong constraints on the orientation of division planes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ogXqfE-FHg" width="1" />

<p>A key question in modern neuroscience is how cognitive changes in a human
brain can be quantified and captured by functional connectomes (FC) . A
systematic approach to measure pairwise functional distance at different brain
states is lacking. This would provide a straight-forward way to quantify
differences in cognitive processing across tasks; also, it would help in
relating these differences in task-based FCs to the underlying structural
network. Here we propose a framework, based on Jensen-Shannon divergence,to map
the task-rest connectivity divergence between tasks and resting-state FC. We
show how this information theoretical measure allows for quantifying
connectivity changes in distributed and centralized processing in functional
networks. We study resting-state and seven tasks from the Human Connectome
Project dataset to obtain the most divergent links across tasks. We investigate
how these changes are associated to different functional brain networks, and
use the proposed measure to infer changes in the information processing
regimes. Furthermore, we show how the FC divergence with respect to resting
state is shaped by structural connectivity, and to what extent this
relationship depends on the task. This framework provides a well grounded
mathematical quantification of connectivity changes associated to cognitive
processing in large-scale brain networks.

<p>The dynamics of networks of neuronal cultures has been recently shown to be
strongly dependent on the network geometry and in particular on their
dimensionality. However, this phenomenon has been so far mostly unexplored from
the theoretical point of view. Here we reveal the rich interplay between
network geometry and synchronization of coupled oscillators in the context of a
simplicial complex model of manifolds called Complex Network Manifold. The
networks generated by this model combine small world properties (infinite
Hausdorff dimension) and a high modular structure with finite and tunable
spectral dimension. We show that the networks display frustrated
synchronization for a wide range of the coupling strength of the oscillators,
and that the synchronization properties are directly affected by the spectral
dimension of the network.

<p>In this work we study the excitatory AMPA, and NMDA, and inhibitory GABAA
receptor mediated dynamical changes in neuronal networks of neonatal rat cortex
in vitro. Extracellular network-wide activity was recorded with 59 planar
electrodes simultaneously under different pharmacological conditions. We
analyzed the changes of overall network activity and network-wide burst
frequency between baseline and AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) or NMDA receptor (NMDA-R)
driven activity, as well as between the latter states and disinhibited
activity. Additionally, spatiotemporal structures of pharmacologically modified
bursts and recruitment of electrodes during the network bursts were studied.
Our results show that AMPA-R and NMDA-R receptors have clearly distinct roles
in network dynamics. AMPA-Rs are in greater charge to initiate network wide
bursts. Therefore NMDA-Rs maintain the already initiated activity. GABAA
receptors (GABAA-Rs) inhibit AMPA-R driven network activity more strongly than
NMDA-R driven activity during the bursts.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259119v1?rss=1">Specific octopaminergic neurons arbitrate between perseverance and reward in hungry Drosophila</a></h4>

In pursuit of palatable food, hungry animals mobilize significant energy resources and overcome obstacles, exhaustion and fear. Their perseverance depends on metabolic state, internal motivation and the expected benefit. Sustained commitment to a trying task is crucial, however, disengagement from one behavior to engage into another can be essential for optimal adaptation and survival. How neural circuits allow prioritizing perseverance over withdrawal based on the animal's need, however, is not understood. Using a single fly spherical treadmill, we show that hungry flies display increasing perseverance to track a food odor in the repeated absence of the predicted food reward. While this perseverance is mediated by a group of dopaminergic neurons, a subset of neurons expressing octopamine, the invertebrate noradrenaline, provide reward feedback and counteract dopamine-motivated food seeking. Our data and modeling suggest that two important neuromodulators tally internal and external signals to ultimately coordinate motivation-dependent antagonistic behavioral drives: perseverance vs. change of behavior.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment represents one of the largest unmet medical needs. Developing drugs capable of preventing A{beta} aggregation is an excellent approach to prevent and treat AD. Here, we show that gallic acid (GA), a naturally occurring polyphenolic small molecule rich in grape seeds and fruits, has the capacity to alleviate cognitive decline of APP/PS1 transgenic mouse through reduction of A{beta}1-42 aggregation and neurotoxicity. Oral administration of GA not only improved the spatial reference memory and spatial working memory of early stage AD mice (4-month-old), but also significantly reduced the more severe deficits in spatial learning, reference memory, short-term recognition and spatial working memory of the late stage AD mice (9-month-old). The hippocampal long-term-potentiation (LTP) was also significantly elevated in the GA-treated late stage APP/PS1 AD mice. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence densitometry analyses showed that GA can reduce A{beta}1-42 aggregation from forming toxic oligomers and fibrils. Indeed, pre-incubating GA with oligomeric A{beta}1-42 reduced A{beta}1-42-mediated intracellular calcium influx and neurotoxicity. Molecular docking studies identified that the 3,4,5-hydroxyle groups of GA were essential in noncovalently stabilizing GA binding to the Lys28-Ala42 salt bridge and the -COOH group is critical for disrupting the salt bridge of A{beta}1-42. The predicated covalent interaction through Schiff-base formation between the carbonyl group of the oxidized product and {omega}-amino group of Lys16 is also critical for the disruption of A{beta}1-42 S-shaped triple-{beta}-motif and toxicity. Together, these studies demonstrated that GA can prevent and protect the AD brain through disrupting A{beta}1-42 aggregation.

<p>by Fei Qi, Magdalena Motz, Kirsten Jung, Jürgen Lassak, Dmitrij Frishman</p>

Translation of consecutive prolines causes ribosome stalling, which is alleviated but cannot be fully compensated by the elongation factor P. However, the presence of polyproline motifs in about one third of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> proteins underlines their potential functional importance, which remains largely unexplored. We conducted an evolutionary analysis of polyproline motifs in the proteomes of 43 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains and found evidence of evolutionary selection against translational stalling, which is especially pronounced in proteins with high translational efficiency. Against the overall trend of polyproline motif loss in evolution, we observed their enrichment in the vicinity of translational start sites, in the inter-domain regions of multi-domain proteins, and downstream of transmembrane helices. Our analysis demonstrates that the time gain caused by ribosome pausing at polyproline motifs might be advantageous in protein regions bracketing domains and transmembrane helices. Polyproline motifs might therefore be crucial for co-translational folding and membrane insertion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDkLZ5Cs-1M" width="1" />

Bioinformatics is recognized as part of the essential knowledge base of numerous career paths in biomedical research and healthcare. However, there is little agreement in the field over what that knowledge entails or how best to provide it. These disagreements are compounded by the wide range of populations in need of bioinformatics training, with divergent prior backgrounds and intended application areas. The Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee has sought to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in terms of a set of bioinformatics core competencies that cut across many user personas and training programs. The initial competencies developed based on surveys of employers and training programs have since been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement. This report describes the current status of the competencies and presents a series of use cases illustrating how they are being applied in diverse training contexts. These use cases are intended to demonstrate how others can make use of the competencies and engage in the process of their continuing refinement and application. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H-O9q3LkWbg" width="1" />

<p>In the present paper, we propose a new theory named "Theory of indeterminate
natural transformation (TINT)" to investigate the dynamical creation of
meanings as association relationships between images, focusing on the metaphor
comprehension as an example. TINT models the meaning creation as a kind of
stochastic processes based on the mathematical structure defined by association
relationships as morphisms in category theory, so as to represent the
indeterminate nature of structure-structure interactions between the systems of
the meanings of images. Such interactions are formulated in terms of so-called
coslice categories and functors as structure-preserving correspondence between
them. The relationship between such functors is "indeterminate natural
transformation", the central notion in TINT, which models the creation of
meanings in a precise manner. For instance, the process of metaphor
comprehension is modeled by the construction of indeterminate natural
transformation from a canonically defined functor which we call the
base-of-metaphor functor.

<p>Understanding the origin, nature, and functional significance of complex
patterns of neural activity, as recorded by diverse electrophysiological and
neuroimaging techniques, is a central challenge in neuroscience. Such patterns
include collective oscillations emerging out of neural synchronization as well
as highly heterogeneous outbursts of activity interspersed by periods of
quiescence, called "neuronal avalanches." Much debate has been generated about
the possible scale invariance or criticality of such avalanches and its
relevance for brain function. Aimed at shedding light onto this, here we
analyze the large-scale collective properties of the cortex by using a
mesoscopic approach following the principle of parsimony of Landau-Ginzburg.
Our model is similar to that of Wilson-Cowan for neural dynamics but crucially,
includes stochasticity and space; synaptic plasticity and inhibition are
considered as possible regulatory mechanisms. Detailed analyses uncover a phase
diagram including down-state, synchronous, asynchronous, and up-state phases
and reveal that empirical findings for neuronal avalanches are consistently
reproduced by tuning our model to the edge of synchronization. This reveals
that the putative criticality of cortical dynamics does not correspond to a
quiescent-to-active phase transition as usually assumed in theoretical
approaches but to a synchronization phase transition, at which incipient
oscillations and scale-free avalanches coexist. Furthermore, our model also
accounts for up and down states as they occur (e.g., during deep sleep). This
approach constitutes a framework to rationalize the possible collective phases
and phase transitions of cortical networks in simple terms, thus helping to
shed light on basic aspects of brain functioning from a very broad perspective.

<p>It is inconceivable how chaotic the world would look to humans, faced with
innumerable decisions a day to be made under uncertainty, had they been lacking
the capacity to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant---a capacity which
computationally amounts to handling probabilistic independence relations. The
highly parallel and distributed computational machinery of the brain suggests
that a satisfying process-level account of human independence judgment should
also mimic these features. In this work, we present the first rational,
distributed, message-passing, process-level account of independence judgment,
called $\mathcal{D}^\ast$. Interestingly, $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ shows a curious,
but normatively-justified tendency for quick detection of dependencies,
whenever they hold. Furthermore, $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ outperforms all the
previously proposed algorithms in the AI literature in terms of worst-case
running time, and a salient aspect of it is supported by recent work in
neuroscience investigating possible implementations of Bayes nets at the neural
level. $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ nicely exemplifies how the pursuit of cognitive
plausibility can lead to the discovery of state-of-the-art algorithms with
appealing properties, and its simplicity makes $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ potentially a
good candidate for pedagogical purposes.

<p>Large-scale recordings of neuronal activity make it possible to gain insights
into the collective activity of neural ensembles. It has been hypothesized that
neural populations might be optimized to operate at a 'thermodynamic critical
point', and that this property has implications for information processing.
Support for this notion has come from a series of studies which identified
statistical signatures of criticality in the ensemble activity of retinal
ganglion cells. What are the underlying mechanisms that give rise to these
observations? Here we show that signatures of criticality arise even in simple
feed-forward models of retinal population activity. In particular, they occur
whenever neural population data exhibits correlations, and is randomly
sub-sampled during data analysis. These results show that signatures of
criticality are not necessarily indicative of an optimized coding strategy, and
challenge the utility of analysis approaches based on equilibrium
thermodynamics for understanding partially observed biological systems.

Two recent papers have tackled the fundamental questions of how place fields are formed in a new environment and what plasticity mechanisms contribute to this process. Bittner et al., in their recent publication, discovered a novel plasticity rule that, in contrast to previous rules, spans the behavioral, seconds-long, timescale. Sheffield et al. have monitored, for the first time, dendritic activity during place field formation, and show the emergence of spatially tuned local NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 neurons.

Modern neuroscientific techniques that specifically manipulate and measure neuronal activity in behaving animals now allow bridging of the gap from the cellular to the behavioral level. However, in doing so, they also pose new challenges. Research using incompletely defined manipulations in a high-dimensional space without clear hypotheses is likely to suffer from multiple well-known conceptual and statistical problems. In this context it is essential to develop hypotheses with testable implications across levels.

The hippocampus is one of the brain’s great mysteries. Historically, theories of its function included emotion, response inhibition, general memory and spatial perception/learning, with memory versus space emerging as a particular focus of more recent debates. A 1978 paper by Olton and colleagues captured this dichotomy by exploiting their newly developed radial maze task to reveal a profound deficit in the ability of hippocampally lesioned rats to execute a spatial memory task. This finding supported the emerging spatial map theory of hippocampal function, and helped pave the way for the subsequent uncovering of an entire brain system linking space and memory.

2018 marks the 40th anniversary of Trends in Neurosciences (TINS), which I had the honor of joining last summer as its editor. As part of the anniversary, we will be issuing a series of 40 short Science and Society articles, each highlighting a past paper (or two) published during one of the years 1978–2017. At its core, the series aims to showcase the breadth of neuroscientific research, and give a glimpse of the remarkable progress during the last few decades. The February issue of TINS launches the series, with four articles discussing papers from 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008.

Prior to the 21st century, genetic mechanisms that regulate sleep were largely unknown. In 1998, de Lecea et al. [1] (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95:322–327) and Sakurai et al. [2] (Cell 1998; 92: 573–585) reported the discovery of a gene they named hypocretin and orexin, respectively, which led to a revolution in our understanding of genetic and neuronal mechanisms that regulate sleep.

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females and is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding-protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Initially, MeCP2 had been shown to be a repressor of gene transcription. In their 2008 paper, Chahrour and colleagues (DOI: 10.1126/science.1153252) reported that MeCP2 could also function as a transcriptional activator.

The structural identification of the cationic channel of the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor involved its biochemical tagging by channel blockers, followed by site-directed mutagenesis analyses reported in two papers in 1988. The ion channel was demonstrated to be lined by the transmembrane segment MII, in which the binding sites of channel blockers are “framed” by anionic rings.

Using a novel extended movement task, Russo et al. show that neural activity in motor cortex is dominated by non-muscle-like signals. A computational approach reveals that these dominant features are expected and can be predicted given the constraint that neural activity produces muscle commands while obeying a smooth flow-field.

Application-specific validation of antibodies is a critical prerequisite for their successful use. Here we introduce an automated approach for characterization and screening of antibodies against synaptic molecules for high-resolution immunofluorescence array tomography. The method, based on a probabilistic synapse detection algorithm, is designed to provide a robust, flexible, and efficient tool for antibody characterization. By allowing the user to define the molecular composition and size of synapses expected to contain the antigen, the method is applicable to synaptic molecules with different distribution. The output of the algorithm are automatically computed characteristics such as synapse density and target specificity ratio, which reflect the sensitivity and specificity of immunolabeling with a given antibody. These measurements provide an objective way to characterize and compare the performance of different antibodies against the same target, and can be used to objectively select the antibodies best suited for AT, and potentially also for other immunolabeling applications.

In early Alzheimer's disease (AD) spatial navigation is impaired; however, the precise cause of this impairment is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that getting lost in new surroundings is one of the first impairments to emerge in AD. It is possible that getting lost in new surroundings represents a failure to use distal cues to get oriented in space. Therefore, we set out to look for impaired spatial orientation in a mouse model of amyloidosis (3xTg-AD). We assessed spatial reorientation in male and female 3xTg-AD mice. For this task, mice were trained to shuttle to the end of a track and back to an enclosed start box to receive a water reward. Then, mice were trained to stop in an unmarked reward zone to receive a brain stimulation reward. The time required to remain in the zone for a reward was increased across training, and the track was positioned in a random start location for each trial. Thus, distal but not local cues were informative. We found that 6-month female 3xTg-AD mice were impaired, but 6-month male 3xTg-AD mice were not, when compared to non-Tg age/sex-matched controls. Male and female mice had only intracellular pathology at this age; however, consistent with the lack of impairment in male mice, less pathology was observed. Finally, 3-month female mice also had less intracellular pathology than 6-month female mice, and were not impaired at spatial reorientation. Thus, AD may cause spatial disorientation as a result of impaired use of landmarks to maintain spatial orientation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258590v1?rss=1">Perceived timing of active head movement at different speeds</a></h4>

The central nervous system must determine which sensory events occur at the same time. Actively moving the head corresponds with large changes in the relationship between the observer and the environment, sensorimotor processing, and spatiotemporal perception. Numerous studies have shown that head movement onset must precede the onset of other sensory events in order to be perceived as simultaneous, indicating that head movement perception is slow. Active head movement perception has been shown to be slower than passive head movement perception and dependent on head movement velocity, where participants who move their head faster than other participants require the head to move even earlier than comparison stimuli to be perceived as simultaneous. These results suggest that head movement perception is slower (i.e., suppressed) when the head moves faster. The present study used a within-subjects design to measure the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) between active head movement speeds and a comparison sound stimulus. Our results clearly show that i) head movement perception is faster when the head moves faster within-subjects, ii) active head movement onset must still precede the onset of other sensory events (Average PSS: -123 to -52 ms) in order to be perceived as occurring simultaneously even at the fastest speeds (Average peak velocity: 76{degrees}/s to 257{degrees}/s). We conclude that head movement perception is slow, but that this delay is minimized with increased speed. While we do not provide evidence against sensory suppression, which requires active versus passive head movement comparison, our results do rule out velocity-based suppression.

Presenilin (PS), the catalytic subunit of {gamma}-secretase and its main substrate the amyloid precursor protein (APP) are mutated in a large majority of patients with familial Alzheimer disease. PS and APP interact with proteins of the neurotransmitter release machinery but the functional consequences of these interactions are unknown. Here we report that genetic deletion of presynaptic PS markedly decreases the axonal expression of the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), and impairs synaptic facilitation and replenishment of release-competent synaptic vesicles. These properties are fully restored by presynaptic re-expression of Syt7. The regulation of Syt7 expression occurs post-transcriptionally and depends on {gamma}-secretase activity. In the combined absence of both APP and PS1, the loss of Syt7 is prevented, indicating that the action of {gamma}-secretase on presynaptic mechanisms depends on its substrate APP. The molecular mechanism involves the substrate of PS, APP-{beta}Cterminal (APP-{beta}CTF), which interacts with Syt7 and accumulates in synaptic terminals under conditions of pharmacological or genetic inhibition of {gamma}-secretase. These results reveal a role of PS in presynaptic mechanisms through regulation of Syt7 by APP-dependent cleavage, and highlight aberrant synaptic vesicle processing as a possible new pathway in AD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258111v1?rss=1">Fatherhood alters gene expression within the MPOA</a></h4>

Female parenting is obligate in mammals, but fathering behavior among mammals is rare. Only 3-5% of mammalian species exhibit biparental care, including humans, and mechanisms of fathering behavior remain sparsely studied. However, in species where it does exist, paternal care is often crucial to the survivorship of offspring. The present study is the first to identify new gene targets involved in the regulation of fathering behavior in a biparental species using RNA sequencing. In order to determine the pattern of gene expression within the medial preoptic area that is specifically associated with fathering behavior, we identified differentially expressed genes in male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) that experienced one of three social conditions: virgin males, pair bonded males, and males with fathering experience. Differentially expressed genes from each comparison (i.e., Virgin vs Paired, Virgin vs Fathers, and Paired vs Fathers) were evaluated using the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, and Kegg pathways analysis to reveal metabolic pathways associated with specific differentially expressed genes. Using these tools, we identified a group of genes that are differentially expressed in voles with different amounts of social experience. These genes are involved in a variety of processes, with particular enrichment in genes associated with immune function, metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and the remodeling of dendritic spines. The identification of these genes and processes will lead to novel insights into the biological basis of fathering behavior.

To benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), individuals must not only learn new skills but also strategically implement them outside of session. Here, we tested a novel technique for personalizing CBT skills and facilitating their generalization to daily life. We hypothesized that showing participants the impact of specific CBT strategies on their own brain function using real-time functional magnetic imaging (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback would increase their metacognitive awareness, help them identify effective strategies, and motivate real-world use. In a within-subjects design, participants who had completed a clinical trial of a standardized course of CBT created a personal repertoire of negative autobiographical stimuli and mood regulation strategies. From each participant's repertoire, a set of experimental and control strategies were identified; only experimental strategies were practiced in the scanner. During the rt-fMRI neurofeedback session, participants used negative stimuli and strategies from their repertoire to manipulate activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a region implicated in emotional distress. The primary outcome measures were changes in participant ratings of strategy difficulty, efficacy, and frequency of use. As predicted, ratings for unscanned control strategies were stable across observations, whereas ratings for experimental strategies changed after neurofeedback. At follow-up one month after the session, efficacy and frequency ratings for scanned strategies were predicted by neurofeedback during the rt-fMRI session. These results suggest that rt-fMRI neurofeedback created a salient and durable learning experience for patients, extending beyond the scan session to guide and motivate CBT skill use weeks later. This metacognitive approach to neurofeedback offers a promising model for increasing clinical benefits from cognitive-behavioral therapy by personalizing skills and facilitating generalization.

Understanding the statistical structure of the environment is crucial for adaptive behavior. Humans and non-human decision-makers seem to track such structure through a process of probabilistic inference, which enables predictions about behaviorally relevant events. Deviations from such predictions cause surprise, which in turn helps improve the inference. Surprise about the timing of behaviorally relevant sensory events drives phasic responses of neuromodulatory brainstem systems, which project to the cerebral cortex. Here, we developed a computational model-based magnetoencephalography (MEG) approach for mapping the resulting cortical transients across space, time, and frequency, in the human brain. We used a Bayesian updating model to estimate the predicted timing of the next stimulus change in a simple visual detection task. This model yielded quantitative trial-by-trial estimates of temporal surprise. The model-based surprise variable predicted trial-by-trial variations in reaction time more strongly than the externally observable interval timings alone. Trial-by-trial variations in surprise were negatively correlated with the power of cortical population activity measured with MEG. This surprise-related power suppression occurred transiently around the behavioral response, specifically in the beta frequency band. It peaked in left lateral prefrontal as well as in frontal midline regions, and its cortical distribution was distinct from the movement-related suppression of beta power in motor cortex. Our results indicate that surprise about sensory event timing transiently suppresses ongoing beta-band oscillations in association cortex. This transient suppression of frontal beta-band oscillations might reflect an active reset triggered by surprise, and is in line with the idea that beta-oscillations help maintain cognitive sets.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/250878v1?rss=1">Functional organization of motion and disparity sensitivity in human visual cortex</a></h4>

Vision with two eyes makes perception of weak visual contrast signals easier and, due to the lateral separation of the eyes, allows for the triangulation of depth relationships. While binocular summation of contrast signals affords the observer increased sensitivity, binocular summation of spatial cues related to changes in depth is associated with decreased sensitivity to the corresponding retinal image displacements. Perceptual models of contrast and motion-in-depth sensitivity have explained this divergence in sensitivity by proposing that probabilistic neural noise limits summing and differencing operations on small signals. Because these models do not scale well for highly suprathreshold visual signals typical of the natural environment, we approached the question of how dynamic binocular image differences are coded using direct neural measurements. Here we use Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials in human participants to show that inter-ocular differences in retinal image motion that produce elevated perceptual thresholds generate strongly suppressed evoked response amplitudes compared to motion that is matched between the two eyes. This suppression is strongly dependent on the availability of well-defined spatial references in the image and is highly immature in 5-month-old infants. Because the suppression is of equal strength for horizontal and vertical directions of motion, it is not specific to the perception of motion in depth. Relational image cues play a critical role in early to intermediate perceptual processing stages, and these results suggest that a succession of spatial and inter-ocular differencing operations condition the visual signal representation, prior to the extraction of motion-in-depth.

<p>by Runmin Wei, Jingye Wang, Erik Jia, Tianlu Chen, Yan Ni, Wei Jia</p>

Left-censored missing values commonly exist in targeted metabolomics datasets and can be considered as missing not at random (MNAR). Improper data processing procedures for missing values will cause adverse impacts on subsequent statistical analyses. However, few imputation methods have been developed and applied to the situation of MNAR in the field of metabolomics. Thus, a practical left-censored missing value imputation method is urgently needed. We developed an iterative Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach (GSimp). We compared GSimp with other three imputation methods on two real-world targeted metabolomics datasets and one simulation dataset using our imputation evaluation pipeline. The results show that GSimp outperforms other imputation methods in terms of imputation accuracy, observation distribution, univariate and multivariate analyses, and statistical sensitivity. Additionally, a parallel version of GSimp was developed for dealing with large scale metabolomics datasets. The R code for GSimp, evaluation pipeline, tutorial, real-world and simulated targeted metabolomics datasets are available at: https://github.com/WandeRum/GSimp.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TpqgoEqOUBM" width="1" />

The Binary State Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE) model is a branching process based model that allows the diversification rates to be controlled by a binary trait. We develop a general approach, based on the BiSSE model, for predicting pathogenicity in bacterial populations from microsatellites profiling data. A comprehensive approach for predicting pathogenicity in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> populations is proposed using the state-dependent branching process model combined with microsatellites TRS-PCR profiling. Additionally, we have evaluated the possibility of using the BiSSE model for estimating parameters from genetic data. We analyzed a real dataset (from 251 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains) and confirmed previous biological observations demonstrating a prevalence of some virulence traits in specific bacterial sub-groups. The method may be used to predict pathogenicity of other bacterial taxa.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uz6bdMXl0nc" width="1" />

<p>The acquisition of goal-directed action requires encoding of the association between an action and its specific consequences or outcome. At a neural level, this encoding has been hypothesized to involve a prefrontal corticostriatal circuit involving the projection from the prelimbic cortex (PL) to the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS); however, no direct evidence for this claim has been reported. In a series of experiments, we performed functional disconnection of this pathway using targeted lesions of the anterior corpus callosum to disrupt contralateral corticostriatal projections with asymmetrical lesions of the PL and/or pDMS to block plasticity in this circuit in rats. We first demonstrated that unilaterally blocking the PL input to the pDMS prevented the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (pERK/pMAPK) induced by instrumental training. Next, we used a full bilateral disconnection of the PL from the pDMS and assessed goal-directed action using an outcome-devaluation test. Importantly, we found evidence that rats maintaining an ipsilateral and/or contralateral connection between the PL and the pDMS were able to acquire goal-directed actions. In contrast, bilateral PL–pDMS disconnection abolished the acquisition of goal-directed actions. Finally, we used a temporary pharmacological disconnection to disrupt PL inputs to the pDMS by infusing the NMDA antagonist dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid into the pDMS during instrumental training and found that this manipulation also disrupted goal-directed learning. These results establish that, in rats, the acquisition of new goal-directed actions depends on a prefrontal–corticostriatal circuit involving a connection between the PL and the pDMS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been hypothesized that the prelimbic cortex (PL) and posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) in rodents interact in a corticostriatal circuit to mediate goal-directed learning. However, no direct evidence supporting this claim has been reported. Using targeted lesions, we performed functional disconnection of the PL–pDMS pathway to assess its role in goal-directed learning. In the first experiment, we demonstrated that PL input to the pDMS is necessary for instrumental training-induced neuronal activity. Next, we disrupted ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral PL–pDMS connections and found that only bilateral PL–pDMS disconnection disrupted the acquisition of goal-directed actions, a finding we replicated in our final study using a pharmacological disconnection procedure.</p>

<p>Sensory perception relies on the precise neuronal encoding of modality-specific environmental features in primary sensory cortices. Some studies have reported the penetration of signals from other modalities even into early sensory areas. So far, no comprehensive account of maps induced by "foreign sources" exists. We addressed this question using surface-based topographic mapping techniques applied to ultra-high resolution fMRI neuroimaging data, measured in female participants. We show that fine-grained finger maps in human primary somatosensory cortex, area 3b, are somatotopically activated not only during tactile mechanical stimulation, but also when viewing the same fingers being touched. Visually-induced maps were weak in amplitude, but overlapped with the stronger tactile maps tangential to the cortical sheet when finger touches were observed in both first- and third-person perspectives. However, visually-induced maps did not overlap tactile maps when the observed fingers were only approached by an object but not actually touched. Our data provide evidence that "foreign source maps" in early sensory cortices are present in the healthy human brain, that their arrangement is precise, and that their induction is feature-selective. The computations required to generate such specific responses suggest that counterflow (feedback) processing may be much more spatially specific than has been often assumed.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Using ultra-high field fMRI, we provide empirical evidence that viewing touches activates topographically aligned single finger maps in human primary somatosensory cortical area 3b. This shows that "foreign source maps" in early sensory cortices are topographic, precise, and feature-selective in healthy human participants with intact sensory pathways.</p>

<p>Cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) and granule cells (GCs) represent good models to study neuronal development. Here, we report that the transcription factor myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (Meis1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mouse GC development. We found that Meis1 is expressed in GC lineage cells and astrocytes in the cerebellum during development. Targeted disruption of the Meis1 gene specifically in the GC lineage resulted in smaller cerebella with disorganized lobules. Knock-down/knock-out (KO) experiments for Meis1 and <i>in vitro</i> assays showed that Meis1 binds to an upstream sequence of Pax6 to enhance its transcription in GCPs/GCs and also suggested that the Meis1–Pax6 cascade regulates morphology of GCPs/GCs during development. In the conditional KO (cKO) cerebella, many Atoh1-positive GCPs were observed ectopically in the inner external granule layer (EGL) and a similar phenomenon was observed in cultured cerebellar slices treated with a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) inhibitor. Furthermore, expression of Smad proteins and Smad phosphorylation were severely reduced in the cKO cerebella and Meis1-knock-down GCPs cerebella. Reduction of phosphorylated Smad was also observed in cerebellar slices electroporated with a Pax6 knock-down vector. Because it is known that BMP signaling induces Atoh1 degradation in GCPs, these findings suggest that the Meis1–Pax6 pathway increases the expression of Smad proteins to upregulate BMP signaling, leading to degradation of Atoh1 in the inner EGL, which contributes to differentiation from GCPs to GCs. Therefore, this work reveals crucial functions of Meis1 in GC development and gives insights into the general understanding of the molecular machinery underlying neural differentiation from neural progenitors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report that myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (Meis1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mouse granule cell (GC) development. Here, we show Meis1 is expressed in GC precursors (GCPs) and GCs during development. Our knock-down and conditional knock-out (cKO) experiments and <i>in vitro</i> assays revealed that Meis1 is required for proper cerebellar structure formation and for <i>Pax6</i> transcription in GCPs and GCs. The Meis1–Pax6 cascade regulates the morphology of GCs. In the cKO cerebella, Smad proteins and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling are severely reduced and Atoh1-expressing GCPs are ectopically detected in the inner external granule layer. These findings suggest that Meis1 regulates degradation of Atoh1 via BMP signaling, contributing to GC differentiation in the inner EGL, and should provide understanding into GC development.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1264?rss=1">Selective Suppression of Local Interneuron Circuits in Human Motor Cortex Contributes to Movement Preparation</a></h4>

<p>Changes in neural activity occur in the motor cortex before movement, but the nature and purpose of this preparatory activity is unclear. To investigate this in the human (male and female) brain noninvasively, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the excitability of distinct sets of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons during the warning period of various reaction time tasks. Using two separate methods (H-reflex conditioning and directional effects of TMS), we show that a specific set of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons are suppressed during motor preparation, while another set of inputs remain unaffected. To probe the behavioral relevance of this suppression, we examined whether the strength of the selective preparatory inhibition in each trial was related to reaction time. Surprisingly, the greater the amount of selective preparatory inhibition, the faster the reaction time was. This suggests that the inhibition of inputs to corticospinal neurons is not involved in preventing the release of movement but may in fact facilitate rapid reactions. Thus, selective suppression of a specific set of motor cortical neurons may be a key aspect of successful movement preparation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Movement preparation evokes substantial activity in the motor cortex despite no apparent movement. One explanation for the lack of movement is that motor cortical output in this period is gated by an inhibitory mechanism. This notion was supported by previous noninvasive TMS studies of human motor cortex indicating a reduction of corticospinal excitability. On the contrary, our data support the idea that there is a coordinated balance of activity upstream of the corticospinal output neurons. This includes a suppression of specific local circuits that supports, rather than inhibits, the rapid generation of prepared movements. Thus, the selective suppression of local circuits appears to be an essential part of successful movement preparation instead of an external control mechanism.</p>

<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons produce the central output controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. A switch from estradiol negative to positive feedback initiates the GnRH surge, ultimately triggering ovulation. This occurs on a daily basis in ovariectomized, estradiol-treated (OVX+E) mice; GnRH neurons are suppressed in the morning and activated in the afternoon. To test the hypotheses that estradiol and time of day signals alter GnRH neuron responsiveness to stimuli, GFP-identified GnRH neurons in brain slices from OVX+E or OVX female mice were recorded during the morning or afternoon. No differences were observed in baseline membrane potential. Current-clamp revealed GnRH neurons fired more action potentials in response to current injection during positive feedback relative to all other groups, which were not different from each other despite reports of differing ionic conductances. Kisspeptin increased GnRH neuron response in cells from OVX and OVX+E mice in the morning but not afternoon. Paradoxically, excitability in kisspeptin knock-out mice was similar to the maximum observed in control mice but was unchanged by time of day or estradiol. A mathematical model applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate probability distributions for estradiol- and time of day–dependent parameters was used to predict intrinsic properties underlying excitability changes. A single identifiable distribution of solutions accounted for similar GnRH neuron excitability in all groups other than positive feedback despite different underlying conductance properties; this was attributable to interdependence of voltage-gated potassium channel properties. In contrast, redundant solutions may explain positive feedback, perhaps indicative of the importance of this state for species survival.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Infertility affects 15%–20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the final common pathway for central neural control of ovulation. We studied how estradiol feedback regulates GnRH excitability, a key determinant of neural firing rate using laboratory and computational approaches. GnRH excitability is upregulated during positive feedback, perhaps driving increased neural firing rate at this time. Kisspeptin increased GnRH excitability and was essential for estradiol regulation of excitability. Modeling predicts that multiple combinations of changes to GnRH intrinsic conductances can produce the firing response in positive feedback, suggesting the brain has many ways to induce ovulation.</p>

<p>Maintenance of a low intracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> concentration ([Cl<sup>–</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) is critical for enabling inhibitory neuronal responses to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated signaling. Cl<sup>–</sup> transporters, including KCC2, and extracellular impermeant anions ([A]<sub>o</sub>) of the extracellular matrix are both proposed to be important regulators of [Cl<sup>–</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Neurons of the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus express reduced levels of KCC2, indicating that GABAergic signaling may produce excitation in RT neurons. However, by performing perforated patch recordings and calcium imaging experiments in rats (male and female), we find that [Cl<sup>–</sup>]<sub>i</sub> remains relatively low in RT neurons. Although we identify a small contribution of [A]<sub>o</sub> to a low [Cl<sup>–</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in RT neurons, our results also demonstrate that reduced levels of KCC2 remain sufficient to maintain low levels of Cl<sup>–</sup>. Reduced KCC2 levels, however, restrict the capacity of RT neurons to rapidly extrude Cl<sup>–</sup> following periods of elevated GABAergic signaling. In a computational model of a local RT network featuring slow Cl<sup>–</sup> extrusion kinetics, similar to those we found experimentally, model RT neurons are predisposed to an activity-dependent switch from GABA-mediated inhibition to excitation. By decreasing the activity threshold required to produce excitatory GABAergic signaling, weaker stimuli are able to propagate activity within the model RT nucleus. Our results indicate the importance of even diminished levels of KCC2 in maintaining inhibitory signaling within the RT nucleus and suggest how this important activity choke point may be easily overcome in disorders such as epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Precise regulation of intracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> levels ([Cl<sup>–</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) preserves appropriate, often inhibitory, GABAergic signaling within the brain. However, there is disagreement over the relative contribution of various mechanisms that maintain low [Cl<sup>–</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. We found that the Cl<sup>–</sup> transporter KCC2 is an important Cl<sup>–</sup> extruder in the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus, despite this nucleus having remarkably low KCC2 immunoreactivity relative to other regions of the adult brain. We also identified a smaller contribution of fixed, impermeant anions ([A]<sub>o</sub>) to lowering [Cl<sup>–</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in RT neurons. Inhibitory signaling among RT neurons is important for preventing excessive activation of RT neurons, which can be responsible for generating seizures. Our work suggests that KCC2 critically restricts the spread of activity within the RT nucleus.</p>

<p>Oxytocin (OXT) receptors (OXTRs) are prominently expressed in hippocampal CA2 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, but little is known about its physiological function. As the functional necessity of hippocampal CA2 for social memory processing, we tested whether CA2 OXTRs may contribute to long-term social recognition memory (SRM) formation. Here, we found that conditional deletion of <i>Oxtr</i> from forebrain (<i>Oxtr</i><sup>–/–</sup>) or CA2/CA3a-restricted excitatory neurons in adult male mice impaired the persistence of long-term SRM but had no effect on sociability and preference for social novelty. Conditional deletion of CA2/CA3a <i>Oxtr</i> showed no changes in anxiety-like behavior assessed using the open-field, elevated plus maze and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. Application of a highly selective OXTR agonist [Thr<sup>4</sup>,Gly<sup>7</sup>]-OXT to hippocampal slices resulted in an acute and lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic responses in CA2 pyramidal neurons that relied on <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity. In addition, <i>Oxtr</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice displayed a defect in the induction of long-term potentiation, but not long-term depression, at the synapses between the entorhinal cortex and CA2 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, <i>Oxtr</i> deletion led to a reduced complexity of basal dendritic arbors of CA2 pyramidal neurons, but caused no alteration in the density of apical dendritic spines. Considering that the methodologies we have used to delete <i>Oxtr</i> do not rule out targeting the neighboring CA3a region, these findings suggest that OXTR signaling in the CA2/CA3a is crucial for the persistence of long-term SRM.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) are abundantly expressed in hippocampal CA2 and CA3 regions, but there are little known about their physiological function. Taking advantage of the conditional <i>Oxtr</i> knock-out mice, the present study highlights the importance of OXTR signaling in the induction of long-term potentiation at the synapses between the entorhinal cortex and CA2 pyramidal neurons and the persistence of long-term social recognition memory. Thus, OXTRs in the CA2/CA3a may provide a new target for therapeutic approaches to the treatment of social cognition deficits, which are often observed in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1202?rss=1">Attention Shifts Recruit the Monkey Default Mode Network</a></h4>

<p>A unifying function associated with the default mode network (DMN), which is more active during rest than under active task conditions, has been difficult to define. The DMN is activated during monitoring the external world for unexpected events, as a sentinel, and when humans are engaged in high-level internally focused tasks. The existence of DMN correlates in other species, such as mice, challenge the idea that internally focused, high-level cognitive operations, such as introspection, autobiographical memory retrieval, planning the future, and predicting someone else's thoughts, are evolutionarily preserved defining properties of the DMN. A recent human study demonstrated that demanding cognitive shifts could recruit the DMN, yet it is unknown whether this holds for nonhuman species. Therefore, we tested whether large changes in cognitive context would recruit DMN regions in female and male nonhuman primates. Such changes were measured as displacements of spatial attentional weights based on internal rules of relevance (spatial shifts) compared with maintaining attentional weights at the same location (stay events). Using fMRI in macaques, we detected that a cortical network, activated during shifts, largely overlapped with the DMN. Moreover, fMRI time courses sampled from independently defined DMN foci showed significant shift selectivity during the demanding attention task. Finally, functional clustering based on independent resting state data revealed that DMN and shift regions clustered conjointly, whereas regions activated during the stay events clustered apart. We therefore propose that cognitive shifting in primates generally recruits DMN regions. This might explain a breakdown of the DMN in many neurological diseases characterized by declined cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activation of the human default mode network (DMN) can be measured with fMRI when subjects shift thoughts between high-level internally directed cognitive states, when thinking about the self, the perspective of others, when imagining future and past events, and during mind wandering. Furthermore, the DMN is activated as a sentinel, monitoring the environment for unexpected events. Arguably, these cognitive processes have in common fast and substantial changes in cognitive context. As DMN activity has also been reported in nonhuman species, we tested whether shifts in spatial attention activated the monkey DMN. Core monkey DMN and shift-selective regions shared several functional properties, indicating that cognitive shifting, in general, might constitute one of the evolutionarily preserved functions of the DMN.</p>

<p>Prismatic adaption (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural plasticity and is used to help neglect rehabilitation. It leads to a recalibration of visuomotor coordination during pointing as well as to aftereffects on a number of sensorimotor and attention tasks, but whether these effects originate at a motor or attentional level remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to further characterize PA aftereffects by using an approach that allows distinguishing between effects on attentional and motor processes. We recorded EEG in healthy human participants (9 females and 7 males) while performing a new double step, anticipatory attention/motor preparation paradigm before and after adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms, with neutral lenses as a control. We then examined PA aftereffects through changes in known oscillatory EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting and motor preparation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Our results were twofold. First, we found PA to rightward-shifting prisms to selectively affect EEG signatures of motor but not attentional processes. More specifically, PA modulated preparatory motor EEG activity over central electrodes in the right hemisphere, contralateral to the PA-induced, compensatory leftward shift in pointing movements. No effects were found on EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting over occipitoparietal sites. Second, we found the PA effect on preparatory motor EEG activity to dominate in the beta frequency band. We conclude that changes to intentional visuomotor, rather than attentional visuospatial, processes underlie the PA aftereffect of rightward-deviating prisms in healthy participants.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prismatic adaptation (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural plasticity in both healthy participants and patients, due to its aftereffect impacting on a number of visuospatial and visuomotor functions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying PA aftereffects are poorly understood as only little neuroimaging evidence is available. Here, we examined, for the first time, the origin of PA aftereffects studying oscillatory brain activity. Our results show a selective modulation of preparatory motor activity following PA in healthy participants but no effect on attention-related activity. This provides novel insight into the PA aftereffect in the healthy brain and may help to inform interventions in neglect patients.</p>

<p>How the brain groups sequential sensory events into chunks is a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. This study investigates whether top–down attention or specific tasks are required for the brain to apply lexical knowledge to group syllables into words. Neural responses tracking the syllabic and word rhythms of a rhythmic speech sequence were concurrently monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). The participants performed different tasks, attending to either the rhythmic speech sequence or a distractor, which was another speech stream or a nonlinguistic auditory/visual stimulus. Attention to speech, but not a lexical-meaning-related task, was required for reliable neural tracking of words, even when the distractor was a nonlinguistic stimulus presented cross-modally. Neural tracking of syllables, however, was reliably observed in all tested conditions. These results strongly suggest that neural encoding of individual auditory events (i.e., syllables) is automatic, while knowledge-based construction of temporal chunks (i.e., words) crucially relies on top–down attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Why we cannot understand speech when not paying attention is an old question in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Speech processing is a complex process that involves multiple stages, e.g., hearing and analyzing the speech sound, recognizing words, and combining words into phrases and sentences. The current study investigates which speech-processing stage is blocked when we do not listen carefully. We show that the brain can reliably encode syllables, basic units of speech sounds, even when we do not pay attention. Nevertheless, when distracted, the brain cannot group syllables into multisyllabic words, which are basic units for speech meaning. Therefore, the process of converting speech sound into meaning crucially relies on attention.</p>

<p>The intercalated cells (ITCs) of the amygdala have been shown to be critical regulatory components of amygdalar circuits, which control appropriate fear responses. Despite this, the molecular processes guiding ITC development remain poorly understood. Here we establish the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 as a marker of ITCs during their migration from the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence through maturity. Using germline and conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse models, we show that <i>Tshz1</i> is required for the proper migration and differentiation of ITCs. In the absence of <i>Tshz1</i>, migrating ITC precursors fail to settle in their stereotypical locations encapsulating the lateral amygdala and BLA. Furthermore, they display reductions in the ITC marker Foxp2 and ectopic persistence of the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence marker Sp8. <i>Tshz1</i> mutant ITCs show increased cell death at postnatal time points, leading to a dramatic reduction by 3 weeks of age. In line with this, <i>Foxp2</i>-null mutants also show a loss of ITCs at postnatal time points, suggesting that <i>Foxp2</i> may function downstream of <i>Tshz1</i> in the maintenance of ITCs. Behavioral analysis of male <i>Tshz1</i> cKOs revealed defects in fear extinction as well as an increase in floating during the forced swim test, indicative of a depression-like phenotype. Moreover, <i>Tshz1</i> cKOs display significantly impaired social interaction (i.e., increased passivity) regardless of partner genetics. Together, these results suggest that <i>Tshz1</i> plays a critical role in the development of ITCs and that fear, depression-like and social behavioral deficits arise in their absence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show here that the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 is expressed during development of the intercalated cells (ITCs) within the mouse amygdala. These neurons have previously been shown to play a crucial role in fear extinction. <i>Tshz1</i> mouse mutants exhibit severely reduced numbers of ITCs as a result of abnormal migration, differentiation, and survival of these neurons. Furthermore, the loss of ITCs in mouse <i>Tshz1</i> mutants correlates well with defects in fear extinction as well as the appearance of depression-like and abnormal social interaction behaviors reminiscent of depressive disorders observed in human patients with distal 18q deletions, including the <i>Tshz1</i> locus.</p>

<p>Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons and their targets are involved in addiction and cue-induced relapse. However, afferents onto SNc dopamine neurons themselves appear insensitive to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, when afferents are collectively stimulated electrically. This contrasts with ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, whose glutamate afferents react robustly to cocaine. We used an optogenetic strategy to isolate identified SNc inputs and determine whether cocaine sensitivity in the mouse SNc circuit is conferred at the level of three glutamate afferents: dorsal raphé nucleus (DR), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN). We found that excitatory afferents to SNc dopamine neurons are sensitive to cocaine in an afferent-specific manner. A single exposure to cocaine <i>in vivo</i> led to PPN-innervated synapses reducing the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor-mediated current ratio. In contrast to work in the VTA, this was due to increased NMDA receptor function with no change in AMPA receptor function. STN synapses showed a decrease in calcium-permeable AMPA receptors after cocaine, but no change in the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio. Cocaine also increased the release probability at DR-innervated and STN-innervated synapses, quantified by decreases in paired-pulse ratios. However, release probability at PPN-innervated synapses remained unaffected. By examining identified inputs, our results demonstrate a functional distribution among excitatory SNc afferent nuclei in response to cocaine, and suggest a compelling architecture for differentiation and separate parsing of inputs within the nigrostriatal system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior studies have established that substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons are a key node in the circuitry that drives addiction and relapse, yet cocaine apparently has no effect on electrically stimulated excitatory inputs. Our study is the first to demonstrate the functional impact of a drug of abuse on synaptic mechanisms of identified afferents to the SNc. Optogenetic dissection of inputs originating from dorsal raphé, pedunculopontine, and subthalamic nuclei were tested for synaptic modifications following <i>in vivo</i> cocaine exposure. Our results demonstrate that cocaine differentially induces modifications to SNc synapses depending on input origin. This presents implications for understanding dopamine processing of motivated behavior; most critically, it indicates that dopamine neurons selectively modulate signal reception processed by afferent nuclei.</p>

<p>Acetylcholine is released in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is a key modulator of cognitive performance in primates. Cholinergic stimulation has been shown to have beneficial effects on performance of cognitive tasks, and cholinergic receptors are being actively explored as promising targets for ameliorating cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that cholinergic stimulation of PFC during performance of a cognitive task would augment neuronal activity and neuronal coding of task attributes. We iontophoretically applied the general cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol onto neurons in dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) of male rhesus macaques performing rule-guided prosaccades and antisaccades, a well established oculomotor task for testing cognitive control. Carbachol application had heterogeneous effects on neuronal excitability, with both excitation and suppression observed in significant proportions. Contrary to our prediction, neurons with rule-selective activity exhibited a reduction in selectivity during carbachol application. Cholinergic stimulation disrupted rule selectivity regardless of whether it had suppressive or excitatory effects on these neurons. In addition, cholinergic stimulation excited putative pyramidal neurons, whereas the activity of putative interneurons remained unchanged. Moreover, cholinergic stimulation attenuated saccade direction selectivity in putative pyramidal neurons due to nonspecific increases in activity. Our results suggest excessive cholinergic stimulation has detrimental effects on DLPFC representations of task attributes. These findings delineate the complexity and heterogeneity of neuromodulation of cerebral cortex by cholinergic stimulation, an area of active exploration with respect to the development of cognitive enhancers.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to be important for cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex. Removal of acetylcholine from prefrontal cortex can disrupt short-term memory performance and is reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons. Stimulation of cholinergic receptors is being explored to create cognitive enhancers for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other psychiatric diseases. Here, we stimulated cholinergic receptors in prefrontal cortex and examined its effects on neurons that are engaged in cognitive behavior. Surprisingly, cholinergic stimulation decreased neurons' ability to discriminate between rules. This work suggests that overstimulation of acetylcholine receptors could disrupt neuronal processing during cognition and is relevant to the design of cognitive enhancers based on stimulating the cholinergic system.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common adverse effect experienced by cancer patients receiving treatment with paclitaxel. The voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7) plays an important role in multiple preclinical models of neuropathic pain and in inherited human pain phenotypes, and its gene expression is increased in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of paclitaxel-treated rats. Hence, the potential of change in the expression and function of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 protein in DRGs from male rats with paclitaxel-related CIPN and from male and female humans with cancer-related neuropathic pain was tested here. Double immunofluorescence in CIPN rats showed that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 was upregulated in small DRG neuron somata, especially those also expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and in central processes of these cells in the superficial spinal dorsal horn. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat DRG neurons revealed that paclitaxel induced an enhancement of ProTx II (a selective Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channel blocker)-sensitive sodium currents. Bath-applied ProTx II suppressed spontaneous action potentials in DRG neurons occurring in rats with CIPN, while intrathecal injection of ProTx II significantly attenuated behavioral signs of CIPN. Complementarily, DRG neurons isolated from segments where patients had a history of neuropathic pain also showed electrophysiological and immunofluorescence results indicating an increased expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 associated with spontaneous activity. Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 was also colocalized in human cells expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and CGRP. Furthermore, ProTx II decreased firing frequency in human DRGs with spontaneous action potentials. This study suggests that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 may provide a potential new target for the treatment of neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy (paclitaxel)-induced neuropathic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work demonstrates that the expression and function of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 are increased in a preclinical model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), the most common treatment-limiting side effect of all the most common anticancer therapies. This is key as gain-of-function mutations in human Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 recapitulate both the distribution and pain percept as shown by CIPN patients. This work also shows that Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is increased in human DRG neurons only in dermatomes where patients are experiencing acquired neuropathic pain symptoms. This work therefore has major translational impact, indicating an important novel therapeutic avenue for neuropathic pain as a class.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1114?rss=1">Decoding Trans-Saccadic Memory</a></h4>

<p>We examine whether peripheral information at a planned saccade target affects immediate postsaccadic processing at the fovea on saccade landing. Current neuroimaging research suggests that presaccadic stimulation has a late effect on postsaccadic processing, in contrast to the early effect seen in behavioral studies. Human participants (both male and female) were instructed to saccade toward a face or a house that, on different trials, remained the same, changed, or disappeared during the saccade. We used a multivariate pattern analysis of electroencephalography data to decode face versus house processing directly after the saccade. The classifier was trained on separate trials without a saccade, where a house or face was presented at the fovea. When the saccade target remained the same across the saccade, we could reliably decode the target 123 ms after saccade offset. In contrast, when the target was changed during the saccade, the new target was decoded at a later time-point, 151 ms after saccade offset. The "same" condition advantage suggests that congruent presaccadic information facilitates processing of the postsaccadic stimulus compared with incongruent information. Finally, the saccade target could be decoded above chance even when it had been removed during the saccade, albeit with a slower time course (162 ms) and poorer signal strength. These findings indicate that information about the (peripheral) presaccadic stimulus is transferred across the saccade so that it becomes quickly available and influences processing at its expected new retinal position (the fovea).</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we provide neural evidence for early information transfer across saccades. Specifically, we examined the effect of presaccadic sensory information on the initial neuronal processing of a postsaccadic stimuli. Using electroencephalography and multivariate pattern analysis, we found the following: (1) that the identity of the presaccadic stimulus modulated the postsaccadic latency of stimulus relevant information; and (2) that a saccadic neural marker for a saccade target stimulus could be detected even when the stimulus had been removed during saccade. These results demonstrate that information about the peripheral presaccadic stimulus was transferred across the saccade and influenced processing at a new retinal position (the fovea) directly after the saccade landed.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1100?rss=1">Disruption of Interneuron Neurogenesis in Premature Newborns and Reversal with Estrogen Treatment</a></h4>

<p>Many Preterm-born children suffer from neurobehavioral disorders. Premature birth terminates the hypoxic <i>in utero</i> environment and supply of maternal hormones. As the production of interneurons continues until the end of pregnancy, we hypothesized that premature birth would disrupt interneuron production and that restoration of the hypoxic milieu or estrogen treatment might reverse interneuron generation. To test these hypotheses, we compared interneuronal progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminences (MGEs), lateral ganglionic eminences (LGEs), and caudal ganglionic eminences (CGEs) between preterm-born [born on embryonic day (E) 29; examined on postnatal day (D) 3 and D7] and term-born (born on E32; examined on D0 and D4) rabbits at equivalent postconceptional ages. We found that both total and cycling Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup>, Dlx2<sup>+</sup>, and Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells were more abundant in the MGEs of preterm rabbits at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0, but not in D7 preterm relative to D4 term pups. Total Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> progenitors were also more numerous in the LGEs of preterm pups at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0. Dlx2<sup>+</sup> cells in CGEs were comparable between preterm and term pups. Simulation of hypoxia by dimethyloxalylglycine treatment did not affect the number of interneuronal progenitors. However, estrogen treatment reduced the density of total and proliferating Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> and Dlx2<sup>+</sup> cells in the MGEs and enhanced Ascl1 transcription factor. Estrogen treatment also reduced Ki67, c-Myc, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, suggesting inhibition of the G1-to-S phase transition. Hence, preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the MGE and estrogen treatment reverses interneuron neurogenesis in preterm newborns by cell-cycle inhibition and elevation of Ascl1. We speculate that estrogen replacement might partially restore neurogenesis in human premature infants.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prematurity results in developmental delays and neurobehavioral disorders, which might be ascribed to disturbances in the development of cortical interneurons. Here, we show that preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and, more importantly, that estrogen treatment reverses this perturbation in the population of interneuron progenitors in the MGE. The estrogen seems to restore neurogenesis by inhibiting the cell cycle and elevating Ascl1 expression. As preterm birth causes plasma estrogen level to drop 100-fold, the estrogen replacement in preterm infants is physiological. We speculate that estrogen replacement might ameliorate disruption in production of interneurons in human premature infants.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1085?rss=1">A{beta} mediates F-actin disassembly in dendritic spines leading to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

<p>Dendritic spine loss is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1E9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1E9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1E9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Aβ load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.</p>

<p>Slo2 channels are large-conductance potassium channels abundantly expressed in the nervous system. However, it is unclear how their expression level in neurons is regulated. Here we report that HRPU-2, an RNA-binding protein homologous to mammalian heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), plays an important role in regulating the expression of SLO-2 (a homolog of mammalian Slo2) in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Loss-of-function (<i>lf</i>) mutants of <i>hrpu-2</i> were isolated in a genetic screen for suppressors of a sluggish phenotype caused by a hyperactive SLO-2. In <i>hrpu-2(lf)</i> mutants, SLO-2-mediated delayed outward currents in neurons are greatly decreased, and neuromuscular synaptic transmission is enhanced. These mutant phenotypes can be rescued by expressing wild-type HRPU-2 in neurons. HRPU-2 binds to <i>slo-2</i> mRNA, and <i>hrpu-2(lf)</i> mutants show decreased SLO-2 protein expression. In contrast, <i>hrpu-2(lf)</i> does not alter the expression of either the BK channel SLO-1 or the <i>Shaker</i> type potassium channel SHK-1. <i>hrpu-2(lf)</i> mutants are indistinguishable from wild type in gross motor neuron morphology and locomotion behavior. Together, these observations suggest that HRPU-2 plays important roles in SLO-2 function by regulating SLO-2 protein expression, and that SLO-2 is likely among a restricted set of proteins regulated by HRPU-2. Mutations of human Slo2 channel and hnRNP U are strongly linked to epileptic disorders and intellectual disability. The findings of this study suggest a potential link between these two molecules in human patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U) belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that play important roles in controlling gene expression. Recent studies have established a strong link between mutations of hnRNP U and human epilepsies and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear how mutations of hnRNP U may cause such disorders. This study shows that mutations of HRPU-2, a worm homolog of mammalian hnRNP U, result in dysfunction of a Slo2 potassium channel, which is critical to neuronal function. Because mutations of Slo2 channels are also strongly associated with epileptic encephalopathies and intellectual disability in humans, the findings of this study point to a potential mechanism underlying neurological disorders caused by hnRNP U mutations.</p>

<p>Estradiol feedback regulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and subsequent luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Estradiol acts via estrogen receptor α (ERα)-expressing afferents of GnRH neurons, including kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and arcuate nuclei, providing homeostatic feedback on episodic GnRH/LH release as well as positive feedback to control ovulation. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are important for estradiol feedback, but it is not known where they fit in the circuitry. Estradiol-negative feedback decreased glutamatergic transmission to AVPV and increased it to arcuate kisspeptin neurons; positive feedback had the opposite effect. Deletion of ERα in kisspeptin cells decreased glutamate transmission to AVPV neurons and markedly increased it to arcuate kisspeptin neurons, which also exhibited increased spontaneous firing rate. KERKO mice had increased LH pulse frequency, indicating loss of negative feedback. These observations indicate that ERα in kisspeptin cells is required for appropriate differential regulation of these neurons and neuroendocrine output by estradiol.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain regulates fertility through gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Ovarian estradiol regulates the pattern of GnRH (negative feedback) and initiates a surge of release that triggers ovulation (positive feedback). GnRH neurons do not express the estrogen receptor needed for feedback (estrogen receptor α [ERα]); kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular nuclei are postulated to mediate negative and positive feedback, respectively. Here we extend the network through which feedback is mediated by demonstrating that glutamatergic transmission to these kisspeptin populations is differentially regulated during the reproductive cycle and by estradiol. Electrophysiological and <i>in vivo</i> hormone profile experiments on kisspeptin-specific ERα knock-out mice demonstrate that ERα in kisspeptin cells is required for appropriate differential regulation of these neurons and for neuroendocrine output.</p>

<p>Low-dimensional yet rich dynamics often emerge in the brain. Examples include
oscillations and chaotic dynamics during sleep, epilepsy, and voluntary
movement. However, a general mechanism for the emergence of low dimensional
dynamics remains elusive. Here, we consider Wilson-Cowan networks and
demonstrate through numerical and analytical work that a type of homeostatic
regulation of the network firing rates can paradoxically lead to a rich
dynamical repertoire. The dynamics include mixed-mode oscillations, mixed-mode
chaos, and chaotic synchronization. This is true for single recurrently coupled
node, pairs of reciprocally coupled nodes without self-coupling, and networks
coupled through experimentally determined weights derived from functional
magnetic resonance imaging data. In all cases, the stability of the homeostatic
set point is analytically determined or approximated. The dynamics at the
network level are directly determined by the behavior of a single node system
through synchronization in both oscillatory and non-oscillatory states. Our
results demonstrate that rich dynamics can be preserved under homeostatic
regulation or even be caused by homeostatic regulation.

<p>We investigated, by using auditory models, how three perceptual parameters,
loudness, pitch and sharpness, determine human echolocation. We used acoustic
recordings from two previous studies, both from stationary situations, and
their resulting perceptual data as input to our analysis. An initial analysis
was on the room acoustics of the recordings. The parameters of interest were
sound pressure level, autocorrelation and spectral centroid. The auditory
models were used to analyze echolocation resulting from the perceptual
variables, i.e. loudness, pitch and sharpness. Relevant auditory models were
chosen to simulate each variable. Based on these results, we calculated
psychophysical thresholds for detecting a reflecting object with constant
physical size. A non-parametric method was used to determine thresholds for
distance, loudness, pitch and sharpness. Difference thresholds were calculated
for the psychophysical variables, since a 2-Alternative-Forced-Choice Paradigm
had originally been used. We found that (1) blind persons could detect objects
at lower loudness values, lower pitch strength, different sharpness values and
at further distances than sighted persons, (2) detection thresholds based on
repetition pitch, loudness and sharpness varied and depended on room acoustics
and type of sound stimuli, (3) repetition pitch was useful for detection at
shorter distances and was determined from the peaks in the temporal profile of
the autocorrelation function, (4) loudness at shorter distances provides
echolocation information, (5) at longer distances, timbre aspects, such as
sharpness, might be used to detect objects. We also discuss binaural
information, movements and the auditory model approach. Autocorrelation was
assumed as a proper measure for pitch, but the question is raised whether a
mechanism based on strobe integration is a viable possibility.

<p>Decoding specific task states from human fMRI (functional magnetic resonance
imaging) signals constitutes a major goal of neuroimaging. Previous studies of
task-state classification have focused largely on processed fMRI
characteristics (e.g. functional connectivity patterns, activity patterns) or a
single fMRI volume. Here, we assembled a novel deep neural network (DNN) for
classifying directly from 4-D fMRI time series, retaining both spatial and
temporal information of fMRI signals. We trained and tested the DNN classifier
by task fMRI data from human connectome project (HCP) S1200 dataset. Reading
just a single block of fMRI time series of each task for each individual, the
novel classification method identified the seven tasks with 91.75% accuracy in
test. Then we extracted task heatmaps of each time series by a guided
backpropagation approach, and found that the heatmaps had a high similarity
with the group average result of traditional contrast of parameter estimate
(COPE). Furthermore, the DNN could be applied to small dataset. The features
from the intermediate layer of the DNN were trained and used to train a support
vector machine (SVM) to classify four conditions within 300 blocks of task-fMRI
scans, data amount comparable to a usual neuroimaging research, and obtained a
95% accuracy. Our reported findings were the first to demonstrate the ability
of DNN to classify and extract heatmaps from a 4-D fMRI time series, as well as
its ability to be transfer trained by a small dataset. This approach should
enable decoding and mapping subject's task status and furthermore help with
classification and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric diseases.

<p>The Availability bias, manifested in the over-representation of extreme
eventualities in decision-making, is a well-known cognitive bias, and is
generally taken as evidence of human irrationality. In this work, we present
the first rational, metacognitive account of the Availability bias, formally
articulated at Marr's algorithmic level of analysis. Concretely, we present a
normative, metacognitive model of how a cognitive system should over-represent
extreme eventualities, depending on the amount of time available at its
disposal for decision-making. Our model also accounts for two well-known
framing effects in human decision-making under risk---the fourfold pattern of
risk preferences in outcome probability (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992) and in
outcome magnitude (Markovitz, 1952)---thereby providing the first
metacognitively-rational basis for those effects. Empirical evidence,
furthermore, confirms an important prediction of our model. Surprisingly, our
model is unimaginably robust with respect to its focal parameter. We discuss
the implications of our work for studies on human decision-making, and conclude
by presenting a counterintuitive prediction of our model, which, if confirmed,
would have intriguing implications for human decision-making under risk. To our
knowledge, our model is the first metacognitive, resource-rational process
model of cognitive biases in decision-making.

Classical accounts of biased competition (BC) require an input bias to resolve the competition between neuronal ensembles driving downstream processing. However, flexible and reliable selection of behaviorally-relevant ensembles can occur with unbiased stimulation: striatal D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) receive balanced cortical input, yet their activity determines the choice between GO and NO-GO pathways in the basal ganglia. We present a corticostriatal model identifying three candidate mechanisms that rely on physiological asymmetries to effect rate- and time-coded BC in the presence of balanced inputs. First, tonic input strength determines which MSN phenotype exhibit higher mean firing rate (FR). Second, low strength oscillatory inputs induce higher FR in D2 MSNs but higher coherence between D1 MSNs. Third, high strength inputs oscillating at distinct frequencies preferentially activate D1 or D2 MSN populations. Of these candidate mechanisms, only the latter accommodates observed rhythmic activity supporting rule-based decision making in prefrontal cortex.

Basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic projections to neocortex dynamically regulate information processing. However, the underlying synaptic and cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. While synaptically released acetylcholine (ACh) can recruit nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) expressed in distinct types of interneurons, previous work has not defined a clear role for muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) in the fast cholinergic control of cortical activity. To address this question, we employed a slice model of cortical activity and used optogenetics to selectively activate cholinergic afferents. We found that transient ACh increases led to a rapid and persistent suppression of cortical activity, mediated by mAChRs in layer 4 and by nAChRs in layer 2/3. Furthermore, mAChR-dependent cholinergic control was mediated at least in part by a short-latency and long-lasting inhibition of layer 4 excitatory neurons. Thus, the activation of postsynaptic mAChRs is central to the flexible cholinergic control of cortical activity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/257923v1?rss=1">Partially Overlapping Brain Networks for Singing and Cello Playing</a></h4>

This research uses an MR-Compatible cello to compare functional brain activation during singing and cello playing within the same individuals to determine the extent to which arbitrary auditory-motor associations, like those required to play the cello, co-opt functional brain networks that evolved for singing. Musical instrument playing and singing both require highly specific associations between sounds and movements. Because these are both used to produce musical sounds, it is often assumed in the literature that their neural underpinnings are highly similar. However, singing is an evolutionarily old human trait, and the auditory-motor associations used for singing are also used for speech and nonspeech vocalizations. This sets it apart from the arbitrary auditory-motor associations required to play musical instruments. The pitch distribution of the cello is uniquely similar to that of the human voice, but cello playing is completely independent of the vocal apparatus, and can therefore be used to dissociate the auditory-vocal network from that of the auditory-motor network. While in the MR-Scanner, 11 expert cellists listened to and subsequently produced individual tones either by singing or cello playing. All participants were able to sing and play the target tones in tune (&lt;50C deviation from target). We found that brain activity during cello playing directly overlaps with brain activity during singing in many areas within the auditory-vocal network. These areas include dorsal motor and premotor areas, SMA and Pre-SMA, STG, ACC, aINS, IPS(R), and Cerebellum but, notably, exclude the PAG and Basal Ganglia (Putamen). Second, that activity within the overlapping areas is positively correlated with, and therefore likely contributing to, both singing and playing in tune as shown by correlations with performance measures. Third, that activity in auditory areas is functionally connected with activity in dorsal motor and pre-motor areas, and that the connectivity between them is positively correlated with good performance. This functional connectivity suggests that the brain areas are working together to contribute to task performance and not just coincidently active. Last, our findings showed that cello playing may directly co-opt vocal areas (including larynx area of motor cortex), especially if training begins before age 7.

<p>by Yonathan Murin, Jeremy Kim, Josef Parvizi, Andrea Goldsmith</p>

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting about 1% of the world population. For patients with focal seizures that cannot be treated with antiepileptic drugs, the common treatment is a surgical procedure for removal of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this work we introduce an algorithm for automatic localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epileptic patients based on electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. The proposed algorithm builds upon the hypothesis that the abnormal excessive (or synchronous) neuronal activity in the brain leading to seizures <i>starts in the SOZ</i> and then <i>spreads</i> to other areas in the brain. Thus, when this abnormal activity starts, signals recorded at electrodes close to the SOZ should have a relatively large <i>causal influence</i> on the rest of the recorded signals. The SOZ localization is executed in two steps. First, the algorithm represents the set of electrodes using a directed graph in which nodes correspond to recording electrodes and the edges’ weights quantify the <i>pair-wise</i> causal influence between the recorded signals. Then, the algorithm infers the SOZ from the estimated graph using a variant of the <i>PageRank</i> algorithm followed by a novel post-processing phase. Inference results for 19 patients show a close match between the SOZ inferred by the proposed approach and the SOZ estimated by expert neurologists (success rate of 17 out of 19).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jWjec7d9uT0" width="1" />

<p>by Francesco Alessandro Massucci, Francesc Sagués, M. Ángeles Serrano</p>

The most frequent form of pairwise synthetic lethality (SL) in metabolic networks is known as plasticity synthetic lethality. It occurs when the simultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or genes is lethal, while the default of the functional partner is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Using computational techniques on bacterial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the functional partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure viability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant fraction of other interconnected reactions, forming what we call a SL cluster. Interestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of reactions and genes. This strong overlap mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and increased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided by essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions and genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the intersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient drug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved strategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RgV2wA7v53Q" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09632">In Praise of Artifice Reloaded: Caution with subjective image quality databases. (arXiv:1801.09632v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Subjective image quality databases are a major source of raw data on how the
visual system works in naturalistic environments. These databases describe the
sensitivity of many observers to a wide range of distortions (of different
nature and with different suprathreshold intensities) seen on top of a variety
of natural images. They seem like a dream for the vision scientist to check the
models in realistic scenarios.
</p>
<p>However, while these natural databases are great benchmarks for models
developed in some other way (e.g. by using the well-controlled artificial
stimuli of traditional psychophysics), they should be carefully used when
trying to fit vision models. Given the high dimensionality of the image space,
it is very likely that some basic phenomenon (e.g. sensitivity to distortions
in certain environments) are under-represented in the database. Therefore, a
model fitted on these large-scale natural databases will not reproduce these
under-represented basic phenomena that could otherwise be easily illustrated
with well selected artificial stimuli.
</p>
<p>In this work we study a specific example of the above statement. A
wavelet+divisive normalization layer of a sensible cascade of linear+nonlinear
layers fitted to maximize the correlation with subjective opinion of observers
on a large image quality database fails to reproduce basic crossmasking. Here
we outline a solution for this problem using artificial stimuli. Then, we show
that the resulting model is also a competitive solution for the large-scale
database. In line with Rust and Movshon (2005), our report (misrepresentation
of basic visual phenomena in subjectively-rated natural image databases) is an
additional argument in praise of artifice.

<p>Subnetwork extraction using community detection methods is commonly used to
study the brain's modular structure. Recent studies indicated that certain
brain regions are known to interact with multiple subnetworks. However, most
existing methods are mainly for non-overlapping subnetwork extraction. In this
paper, we present an approach for overlapping brain subnetwork extraction using
cliques, which we defined as co-activated node groups performing multiple
tasks. We proposed a multisource subnetwork extraction approach based on the
co-activated clique, which (1) uses task co-activation and task connectivity
strength information for clique identification, (2) automatically detects
cliques of different sizes having more neuroscientific justifications, and (3)
shares the subnetwork membership, derived from a fusion of rest and task data,
among the nodes within a clique for overlapping subnetwork extraction. On real
data, compared to the commonly used overlapping community detection techniques,
we showed that our approach improved subnetwork extraction in terms of
group-level and subject-wise reproducibility. We also showed that our
multisource approach identified subnetwork overlaps within brain regions that
matched well with hubs defined using functional and anatomical information,
which enables us to study the interactions between the subnetworks and how hubs
play their role in information flow across different subnetworks. We further
demonstrated that the assignments of interacting/individual nodes using our
approach correspond with the posterior probability derived independently from
our multimodal random walker based approach.

<p>Olfactory receptor usage is highly non-uniform, with some receptor types
being orders of magnitude more abundant than others. Intriguingly, in mammals
the receptors are replaced regularly and the receptor distribution changes in
response to olfactory experience. We propose a theoretical model that explains
these experimental observations. Our model suggests that the receptor
distribution is tuned to maximize the amount of information about the olfactory
environment, in accordance with the efficient coding hypothesis. The optimal
receptor distribution depends on natural odor statistics, implying that a
change in environment should lead to changes in receptor abundances. The effect
is more pronounced when olfactory receptors respond strongly to a smaller
number of odors. Our model also predicts that, between closely-related species,
those with more neurons in the olfactory epithelium should express more
receptor types. We show that simple dynamical rules for neural birth and death
processes converge to the predicted optimum.

<p>Entropy is a classical measure to quantify the amount of information or
complexity of a system. Various entropy-based measures such as functional and
spectral entropy have been proposed in brain network analysis. However, they
are less widely used than traditional graph theoretic measures such as global
and local efficiencies because they are not well-defined on a graph or
difficult to interpret its biological meaning. In this paper, we propose a new
entropy-based graph invariant, called volume entropy. It measures the
exponential growth rate of the number of graph paths, based on the assumption
that information flows through a graph forever. We model the information
propagation on a brain graph by the generalized Markov system associated to a
new edge transition matrix. The volume entropy is estimated by the stationary
equation of the generalized Markov system. Moreover, its stationary
distribution shows the information capacity of edge and the direction of
information flow on a brain graph. The simulation results show that the volume
entropy distinguishes the underlying graph topology and geometry better than
the existing graph measures. In the clinical application, the volume entropy of
brain graphs was significantly related to healthy normal aging from 20s to 60s.
In addition, the stationary distribution of information propagation gives a new
insight into the information flow of functional brain graph.

<p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling
neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by insufficient top-down modulation of
the amygdala activity by the prefrontal cortex. Real-time fMRI neurofeedback
(rtfMRI-nf) is an emerging method with potential for modifying the
amygdala-prefrontal interactions. We report the first controlled emotion
self-regulation study in veterans with combat-related PTSD utilizing rtfMRI-nf
of the amygdala activity. PTSD patients in the experimental group (EG, n=20)
learned to upregulate BOLD activity of the left amygdala (LA) using rtfMRI-nf
during a happy emotion induction task. PTSD patients in the control group (CG,
n=11) were provided with a sham rtfMRI-nf. The study included three rtfMRI-nf
training sessions, and EEG recordings were performed simultaneously with fMRI.
PTSD severity was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).
The EG participants showed a significant reduction in total CAPS ratings,
including significant reductions in avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms.
Overall, 80% of the EG participants demonstrated clinically meaningful
reductions in CAPS ratings, compared to 38% in the CG. During the first
session, fMRI connectivity of the LA with the orbitofrontal cortex and the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was progressively enhanced, and this
enhancement significantly and positively correlated with initial CAPS ratings.
Left-lateralized enhancement in upper alpha EEG coherence also exhibited a
significant positive correlation with initial CAPS ratings. Reduction in PTSD
severity between the first and last rtfMRI-nf sessions significantly correlated
with enhancement in functional connectivity between the LA and the left DLPFC.
Our results demonstrate that the rtfMRI-nf of the amygdala activity has the
potential to correct the amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity
deficiencies specific to PTSD.

<p>The availability of technological means to enhance and repair human cognitive
function raises questions about the perceived morality of their use. In this
study, we administered a survey to the public in which subjects were asked to
report how willing they would be to enhance and/or repair specific cognitive
abilities. Among 894 responders, we found that subjects were more willing to
use technologies to repair other people than themselves, and especially to
enhance or repair functions more "core" to authentic identity in others.
Subjects' ratings of the moral acceptability of specific uses was related to
their reported willingness to use brain stimulation. These findings suggest
that the public endorses an altruistic approach to applying brain stimulation
for cognitive gains. Further, this study establishes a basis to guide moral
psychological studies of cognitive modification and social processes that guide
attitudes toward and uses of brain stimulation.

<p>Seizure and synchronization are related to each other in complex manner.
Altered synchrony has been implicated in loss of consciousness during partial
seizures. However, the mechanism of altered consciousness following termination
of seizures has not been studied well. In this work we used bivariate mutual
information as a measure of synchronization to understand the neural correlate
of altered consciousness during and after termination of mesial temporal lobe
onset seizures. First, we have compared discrete bivariate mutual information
(MI) measure with amplitude correlation (AC), phase synchronization (PS),
nonlinear correlation and coherence, and established MI as a robust measure of
synchronization. Next, we have extended MI to more than two signals by
principal component method. The extended MI was applied on intracranial
electroencephalogram (iEEG) before, during and after 23 temporal lobe seizures
recorded from 11 patients. The analyses were carried out in delta, theta,
alpha, beta and gamma bands. In 77% of the complex partial seizures MI was
higher towards the seizure offset than in the first half of the seizure in the
seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels in beta and gamma bands, whereas MI remained
higher in the beginning or in the middle of the seizure than towards the offset
across the least involved channels in the same bands. Synchronization seems
built up outside the SOZ, gradually spread and culminated in SOZ and remained
high beyond offset leading to impaired consciousness in 82% of the complex
partial temporal lobe seizures. Consciousness impairment was scored according
to a method previously applied to assess the same in patients with temporal
lobe epilepsy during seizure.

<p>While modern imaging technologies such as fMRI have opened exciting new
possibilities for studying the brain in vivo, histological sections remain the
best way to study the anatomy of the brain at the level of single neurons. The
histological atlas changed little since 1909 and localizing brain regions is a
still a labor intensive process performed only by experienced neuro-anatomists.
Existing digital atlases such as the Allen Brain atlas are limited to low
resolution images which cannot identify the detailed structure of the neurons.
We have developed a digital atlas methodology that combines information about
the 3D organization of the brain and the detailed texture of neurons in
different structures. Using the methodology we developed an atlas for the mouse
brainstem and mid-brain, two regions for which there are currently no good
atlases. Our atlas is "active" in that it can be used to automatically align a
histological stack to the atlas, thus reducing the work of the neuroanatomist.

Mutations in TMC cause deafness in mammals with an elusive mechanism. In this report, Yue et al. found that C. elegans TMC promotes egg laying through maintaining rhythmic calcium activity. Mechanistically, TMC proteins modulate resting membrane potential via a background leak conductance.

Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7RLEkfWxsdM" width="1" />

<p>by Alon Diament, Anna Feldman, Elisheva Schochet, Martin Kupiec, Yoav Arava, Tamir Tuller</p>

Ribosome queuing is a fundamental phenomenon suggested to be related to topics such as genome evolution, synthetic biology, gene expression regulation, intracellular biophysics, and more. However, this phenomenon hasn't been quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability to detect ribosome queuing. On the other hand, most of the models in the field assume and analyze a certain level of queuing. Here we present an experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics. The approach was implemented on the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> transcriptome. Our data shows that ribosome queuing is more frequent than previously thought: the measured ratio of ribosomes within dRPFs to mRPFs is 0.2–0.35, suggesting that at least one to five translating ribosomes is in a traffic jam; these queued ribosomes cannot be captured by traditional methods. We found that specific regions are enriched with queued ribosomes, such as the 5’-end of ORFs, and regions upstream to mRPF peaks, among others. While queuing is related to higher density of ribosomes on the transcript (characteristic of highly translated genes), we report cases where traffic jams are relatively more severe in lowly expressed genes and possibly even selected for. In addition, our analysis demonstrates that higher adaptation of the coding region to the intracellular tRNA levels and longer genes are associated with lower queuing levels. Our analysis also suggests that the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> transcriptome undergoes selection for eliminating traffic jams. Thus, our proposed approach is an essential tool for high resolution analysis of ribosome traffic during mRNA translation and understanding its evolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGKWmrKeD6Y" width="1" />

<p>by Rahila Rahimova, Simon Fontanel, Corinne Lionne, Lars Peter Jordheim, Suzanne Peyrottes, Laurent Chaloin</p>

The ecto-5’-nucleotidase CD73 plays an important role in the production of immune-suppressive adenosine in tumor micro-environment, and has become a validated drug target in oncology. Indeed, the anticancer immune response involves extracellular ATP to block cell proliferation through T-cell activation. However, in the tumor micro-environment, two extracellular membrane-bound enzymes (CD39 and CD73) are overexpressed and hydrolyze efficiently ATP into AMP then further into immune-suppressive adenosine. To circumvent the impact of CD73-generated adenosine, we applied an original bioinformatics approach to identify new allosteric inhibitors targeting the dimerization interface of CD73, which should impair the large dynamic motions required for its enzymatic function. Several hit compounds issued from virtual screening campaigns showed a potent inhibition of recombinant CD73 with inhibition constants in the low micromolar range and exhibited a non-competitive inhibition mode. The structure-activity relationships studies indicated that several amino acid residues (D366, H456, K471, Y484 and E543 for polar interactions and G453-454, I455, H456, L475, V542 and G544 for hydrophobic contacts) located at the dimerization interface are involved in the tight binding of hit compounds and likely contributed for their inhibitory activity. Overall, the gathered information will guide the upcoming lead optimization phase that may lead to potent and selective CD73 inhibitors, able to restore the anticancer immune response.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MmJFMNHwHpM" width="1" />

Despite half-a-century of research since the seminal work of Hubel and Wiesel, the role of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in shaping the visual signals is not properly understood. Placed on route from retina to primary visual cortex in the early visual pathway, a striking feature of the dLGN circuit is that both the relay cells (RCs) and interneurons (INs) not only receive feedforward input from retinal ganglion cells, but also a prominent feedback from cells in layer 6 of visual cortex. This feedback has been proposed to affect synchronicity and other temporal properties of the RC firing. It has also been seen to affect spatial properties such as the center-surround antagonism of thalamic receptive fields, i.e., the suppression of the response to very large stimuli compared to smaller, more optimal stimuli. Here we explore the spatial effects of cortical feedback on the RC response by means of a a comprehensive network model with biophysically detailed, single-compartment and multicompartment neuron models of RCs, INs and a population of orientation-selective layer 6 simple cells, consisting of pyramidal cells (PY). We have considered two different arrangements of synaptic feedback from the ON and OFF zones in the visual cortex to the dLGN: phase-reversed (‘push-pull’) and phase-matched (‘push-push’), as well as different spatial extents of the corticothalamic projection pattern. Our simulation results support that a phase-reversed arrangement provides a more effective way for cortical feedback to provide the increased center-surround antagonism seen in experiments both for flashing spots and, even more prominently, for patch gratings. This implies that ON-center RCs receive direct excitation from OFF-dominated cortical cells and indirect inhibitory feedback from ON-dominated cortical cells. The increased center-surround antagonism in the model is accompanied by spatial focusing, i.e., the maximum RC response occurs for smaller stimuli when feedback is present.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2Ye3WzHcxNo" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The architecture of neocortical projection neurons is subject of a complex gene control. Here we demonstrated that <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span>, a transcription factor gene which patterns the early rostral brain and sets the pace of telencephalic neuronogenesis, specifically stimulates dendrite elongation. This phenomenon occurs in vivo like in vitro, and it is detectable even upon moderate changes of <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span> expression levels. We found that <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span> acts by stimulating <span style="font-style: italic;">Hes1</span>, which in turn upregulates pCreb1, a well-known pro-dendritogenic effector, and downregulates <span style="font-style: italic;">Syt</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ndr1</span>, namely two established antagonizers of dendrite elongation. Moreover, <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span>-driven pCreb1 upregulation requires PKA and AKT, and correlates with reduced PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activity. These findings contribute to clarify normal neurodevelopmental and activity-related regulation of neuritogenesis. They further suggest that an abnormal sizing of the dendritic tree of neocortical projection neurons may occur in West and Rett syndrome patients with anomalous <span style="font-style: italic;">FOXG1</span> allele dosages and contribute to their neurolopathological profiles.</span>

<p>by Guillaume Marçais, Arthur L. Delcher, Adam M. Phillippy, Rachel Coston, Steven L. Salzberg, Aleksey Zimin</p>

The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98% identical across 96% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ad66bIHbWNc" width="1" />

Atilgan et al. demonstrate that temporal coherence between auditory and visual stimuli shapes the representation of a sound scene in auditory cortex. Auditory cortex is identified as a site of multisensory binding, with inputs from visual cortex underpinning these effects.

<p>by Koich Saeki, Akira Sasaki</p>

Viruses have two modes spread in a host body, one is to release infectious particles from infected cells (global infection) and the other is to infect directly from an infected cell to an adjacent cell (local infection). Since the mode of spread affects the evolution of life history traits, such as virulence, it is important to reveal what level of global and local infection is selected. Previous studies of the evolution of global and local infection have paid little attention to its dependency on the measures of spatial configuration. Here we show the evolutionarily stable proportion of global and local infection, and how it depends on the distribution of target cells. Using an epidemic model on a regular lattice, we consider the infection dynamics by pair approximation and check the evolutionarily stable strategy. We also conduct the Monte-Carlo simulation to observe evolutionary dynamics. We show that a higher local infection is selected as target cells become clustered. Surprisingly, the selected strategy depends not only on the degree of clustering but also the abundance of target cells per se.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QvuUxAMbOWQ" width="1" />

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Although gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is generally regarded as an alternative biomarker for alcohol consumption, its independent role in vascular diseases emerged recently. However, its role in stroke remains unknown. The aim of this study is to clarify the impact of GGT on stroke in a large-sized, national, standardized population cohort in Korea.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provides full-coverage health insurance service for all citizens. Using data from the NHIS, the NHIS-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) was designed by randomly selecting 2% of Koreans, carefully considering demographic characteristics. We analyzed eligible individuals from this standardized cohort. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the longitudinal study investigating the relationship between GGT and stroke.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Among the 456,100 eligible participants, 7,459 patients (1.64%) developed stroke as follows: 5,789 ischemic strokes, 1,046 intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), and 624 subarachnoid hemorrhages. GGT was independently correlated with increased risk of stroke after adjustment for alcohol consumption and stroke risk factors (hazard ratio (HR), 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29–1.51). The risks of both ischemic stroke (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.32–1.58) and ICH (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18–1.80) were significantly elevated with increasing GGT. Despite some effect modifications by sex, age and alcohol, the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke in association with GGT remained significant in all subgroups.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: In a standard Korean population, GGT was a novel biomarker predicting stroke risk, independently from alcohol consumption and other risk factors. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves symptoms in dystonia patients. However, the physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral implantation of GPi DBS.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: The cortical evoked potentials from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning-test paired-pulse paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor cortical stimulation at specific time intervals.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: GPi stimulation produced two peaks of cortical evoked potentials with latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 ms in the motor cortical area. Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 ms after single-pulse GPi DBS and cortical inhibition was observed at ∼25 ms interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation with cortical stimulation at these two time intervals produced long term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability and plasticity at specific time intervals. These effects may be related to the mechanism of action of DBS. Combination of DBS with cortical stimulation at appropriate timing has therapeutic potential and could be explored in the future as a method to enhance the effects of neuromodulation for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>To assess the association between incident Parkinson's disease (PD) and subsequent incident epileptic seizures.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We identified patients aged ≥40 years with an incident diagnosis of PD between 1995 and 2016 and a matched comparison group of PD-free individuals. We calculated crude incidence rates (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of epileptic seizures in PD patients and the PD-free comparison group, and corresponding crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs). In the nested case-control analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (adj. ORs) of incident PD among cases with incident epileptic seizures and seizure-free controls overall and stratified by various, seizure-provoking comorbidities.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Among 23,086 incident PD patients and 92,343 PD-free individuals, we identified 898 patients with incident epileptic seizures. The crude IR of epileptic seizures in PD patients was 266.7/100,000 person years (95% CI 235.6-297.7), and in PD-free individuals 112.4/100,000 person years (95% CI 103.5-121.3) [IRR: 2.37, 95% CI 2.06-2.37]. The adj. OR of epileptic seizures was 1.68 [95% CI 1.43-1.98]) in PD patients compared with PD-free individuals. PD patients with comorbid brain disorders (adj. OR 12.36 [95% CI 8.74-17.48]) or with &gt;1 seizure-provoking comorbidity (adj. OR 13.24 [95% CI 10.15-17.25]) were at the highest risk of epileptic seizures compared with PD-free individuals with no seizure-provoking comorbidities.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>This study suggests that incident PD is associated with an increased risk of incident epileptic seizures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Recent studies have underlined the effect of systemic inflammation on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in Alzheimer's disease.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in forty-two patients with Alzheimer's disease (sixteen with mild cognitive impairment and twenty-six with dementia), and compared them with twenty-two age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Blood samples from Alzheimer's diseases patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: the ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4<sup>high</sup>/CD62L<sup>low</sup> senescent and the CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with Alzheimer's disease — changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a broad class of inherited metabolic diseases caused by the defective activity of lysosomal enzymes. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are present in roughly 50% of LSD patients and represent an unmet medical need for them. We explored the therapeutic potential of Metallothioneins (MTs), a newly identified family of proteins with reported neuroprotective roles, in the murine models of two LSDs with CNS involvement.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: MT-1 over-expressing transgenic mice (MTtg) were crossed with the murine models of Batten and Krabbe diseases. Changes in the survival and in the manifestations of the disease in the MTtg setting were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of MT-1 CNS gene delivery in one of these LSD models.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Constitutive expression of MT-1 exerted favorable phenotypic effects in both LSD models. MT-LSD mice showed a 5-10% increase in survival and slower disease progression as compared to not-transgenic LSD mice. Rescue of Purkinje cells from degeneration and apoptosis was also observed in the MT- LSD models. This phenotypic amelioration was accompanied by a modulation of the disease-associated activated inflammatory microglia phenotype, and by a reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly for the clinical translation of our findings, the very same effects were obtained when MTs were delivered to the brains by systemic AAV gene transfer.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: MTs can be considered novel therapeutic agents (and targets) in LSDs and potentiate the effects of approaches aiming at correction of the disease-causing enzyme deficiency in the CNS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: CD16<sup>+</sup>/CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages (MΦ)s and microglia accumulate in the brains of patients with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), a neuropathological correlate of the most severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HIV-D). Recently, we found that some parenchymal microglia in brain of HIV<sup>+</sup> subjects without encephalitis (HIV/noE) but with varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment express CD16 and CD163, even in the absence of detectable virus production. To further our understanding of microglial activation in HIV, we investigated expression of specific genes by profiling parenchymal microglia from archival brain tissue of patients with HIVE, HIV/noE, and HIV<sup>-</sup> controls.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Single-population microarray analyses were performed on ∼2,500 laser capture microdissected CD163<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup> or CD68<sup>+</sup> MΦs/microglia per case, using terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification and a custom-designed array platform.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Several classes of microglial transcripts in HIVE and HIV/noE, were altered, relative to HIV<sup>-</sup> subjects, including factors related to cell stress, immune activation, and apoptosis. Additionally, several neurotrophic factors are reduced in HIV infection, suggesting an additional mechanism of neuropathogenesis. The majority of transcripts altered in HIVE displayed intermediate changes in HIV/noE.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Our results support the notion that microglia contribute to the maintenance of brain homeostasis and their potential loss of function in the context of chronic inflammation contributes to neuropathogenesis. Furthermore, they indicate the utility of profiling MΦs/microglia to increase our understanding of microglia function, as well as ascertain alterations in specific pathways, genes, and, ostensibly, encoded proteins that may be amenable to targeted treatment modalities in diseases affecting the brain.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Extracellular recording studies have revealed diverse and selective neural responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake animals. However, we have limited knowledge on subthreshold events that give rise to these responses, especially in non-human primates, as intracellular recordings in awake animals pose substantial technical challenges. We developed a novel intracellular recording technique in awake marmosets to systematically study subthreshold activity of A1 neurons that underlies their diverse and selective spiking responses. Our findings showed that in contrast to predominantly transient depolarization observed in A1 of anesthetized animals, both transient and sustained depolarization (during or beyond the stimulus period) were observed. Comparing with spiking responses, subthreshold responses were often longer lasting in duration and more broadly tuned in frequency, and showed narrower intensity tuning in non-monotonic neurons and lower response threshold in monotonic neurons. These observations demonstrated the enhancement of stimulus selectivity from subthreshold to spiking responses in individual A1 neurons. Furthermore, A1 neurons classified as regular- or fast-spiking subpopulation based on their spike shapes exhibited distinct response properties in frequency and intensity domains. These findings provide valuable insights into cortical integration and transformation of auditory information at the cellular level in auditory cortex of awake non-human primates.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous studies have demonstrated that cortical thickness (CT) is under strong genetic control across the life span. However, little is known about genetic influences that cause changes in cortical thickness (Î”CT) during brain development. We obtained 482 longitudinal MRI scans at ages 9, 12, and 17 years from 215 twins and applied structural equation modeling to estimate genetic influences on (1) cortical thickness between regions and across time, and (2) changes in cortical thickness between ages. Although cortical thickness is largely mediated by the same genetic factor throughout late childhood and adolescence, we found evidence for influences of distinct genetic factors on regions across space and time. In addition, we found genetic influences for cortical thinning during adolescence that is mostly due to fluctuating influences from the same genetic factor, with evidence of local influences from a second emerging genetic factor. This fluctuating core genetic factor and emerging novel genetic factor might be implicated in the rapid cognitive and behavioral development during childhood and adolescence, and could potentially be targets for investigation into the manifestation of psychiatric disorders that have their origin in childhood and adolescence.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Quantifying the genetic architecture of the cerebral cortex is necessary for understanding disease and changes to the brain across the lifespan. Prior work shows that both surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT) are heritable. However, we do not yet understand the extent to which region-specific genetic factors (i.e., independent of global effects) play a dominant role in the regional patterning or inter-regional associations across the cortex. Using a population sample of young adult twins (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 923), we show that the heritability of SA and CT varies widely across regions, generally independent of measurement error. When global effects are controlled for, we detected a complex pattern of genetically mediated clusters of inter-regional associations, which varied between hemispheres. There were generally weak associations between the SA of different regions, except within the occipital lobe, whereas CT was positively correlated within lobar divisions and negatively correlated across lobes, mostly due to genetic covariation. These findings were replicated in an independent sample of twins and siblings (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 698) from the Human Connectome Project. The different genetic contributions to SA and CT across regions reveal the value of quantifying sources of covariation to appreciate the genetic complexity of cortical structures.</span>

<p>by Jagdish Suresh Patel, Celeste J. Brown, F. Marty Ytreberg, Deborah L. Stenkamp</p>

Vision is the dominant sensory modality in many organisms for foraging, predator avoidance, and social behaviors including mate selection. Vertebrate visual perception is initiated when light strikes rod and cone photoreceptors within the neural retina of the eye. Sensitivity to individual colors, i.e., peak spectral sensitivities (λ<sub>max</sub>) of visual pigments, are a function of the type of chromophore and the amino acid sequence of the associated opsin protein in the photoreceptors. Large differences in peak spectral sensitivities can result from minor differences in amino acid sequence of cone opsins. To determine how minor sequence differences could result in large spectral shifts we selected a spectrally-diverse group of 14 teleost Rh2 cone opsins for which sequences and λ<sub>max</sub> are experimentally known. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out after embedding chromophore-associated homology structures within explicit bilayers and water. These simulations revealed structural features of visual pigments, particularly within the chromophore, that contributed to diverged spectral sensitivities. Statistical tests performed on all the observed structural parameters associated with the chromophore revealed that a two-term, first-order regression model was sufficient to accurately predict λ<sub>max</sub> over a range of 452–528 nm. The approach was accurate, efficient and simple in that site-by-site molecular modifications or complex quantum mechanics models were not required to predict λ<sub>max</sub>. These studies identify structural features associated with the chromophore that may explain diverged spectral sensitivities, and provide a platform for future, functionally predictive opsin modeling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zs0zKBCg8z8" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0oaYFiuLVmE/article">Sequence determinants of protein phase behavior from a coarse-grained model</a></h4>

<p>by Gregory L. Dignon, Wenwei Zheng, Young C. Kim, Robert B. Best, Jeetain Mittal</p>

Membraneless organelles important to intracellular compartmentalization have recently been shown to comprise assemblies of proteins which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oaYFiuLVmE" width="1" />

<div class="section" id="ana25131-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>To evaluate the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis and compare it to that of infectious encephalitis.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25131-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We performed a population-based comparative study of the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis and subgroups were defined by 2016 diagnostic criteria, and infectious encephalitis diagnosis required a confirmed infectious pathogen. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence and incidence rates were calculated. Patients with encephalitis of uncertain etiology were excluded.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25131-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>The prevalence of autoimmune encephalitis on January 1, 2014 of 13.7/100,000 was not significantly different from that of all infectious encephalitides (11.6/100,000; <em>p</em> = 0.63) or the viral subcategory (8.3/100,000; <em>p</em> = 0.17). The incidence rates (1995–2015) of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis were 0.8/100,000 and 1.0/100,000 person-years, respectively (<em>p</em> = 0.58). The number of relapses or recurrent hospitalizations was higher for autoimmune than infectious encephalitis (<em>p</em> = 0.03). The incidence of autoimmune encephalitis increased over time from 0.4/100,000 person-years (1995–2005) to 1.2/100,000 person-years (2006–2015; <em>p</em> = 0.02), attributable to increased detection of autoantibody-positive cases. The incidence (2.8 vs 0.7/100,000 person-years, <em>p</em> = 0.01) and prevalence (38.3 vs 13.7/100,000, <em>p</em> = 0.04) of autoimmune encephalitis was higher among African Americans than Caucasians. The prevalence of specific neural autoantibodies was as follows: myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, 1.9/100,000; glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, 1.9/100,000; unclassified neural autoantibody, 1.4/100,000; leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1, 0.7/100,000; collapsin response-mediator protein 5, 0.7/100,000; N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, 0.6/100,000; antineuronal nuclear antibody type 2, 0.6/100,000; and glial fibrillary acidic protein α, 0.6/100,000.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25122-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Glycogen in astrocyte processes contributes to maintenance of low extracellular glutamate and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations around excitatory synapses. Sleep deprivation (SD), a common migraine trigger, induces transcriptional changes in astrocytes, reducing glycogen breakdown. We hypothesize that when glycogen utilization cannot match synaptic energy demand, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> can rise to levels that activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels and downstream inflammatory pathway, which might be one of the mechanisms initiating migraine headaches.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25122-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We suppressed glycogen breakdown by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylation with 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB) and by SD.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25122-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>DAB caused neuronal pannexin-1 large pore opening and activation of the downstream inflammatory pathway as shown by procaspase-1 cleavage and HMGB1 release from neurons. Six-hour SD induced pannexin-1 mRNA. DAB and SD also lowered the cortical spreading depression (CSD) induction threshold, which was reversed by glucose or lactate supplement, suggesting that glycogen-derived energy substrates are needed to prevent CSD generation. Supporting this, knocking down the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2 with an antisense oligonucleotide or inhibiting glucose transport from vessels to astrocytes with intracerebroventricularly delivered phloretin reduced the CSD threshold. In vivo recordings with a K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive/selective fluoroprobe, Asante Potassium Green-4, revealed that DAB treatment or SD caused a significant rise in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> during whisker stimulation, illustrating the critical role of glycogen in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> clearance.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25122-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Synaptic metabolic stress caused by insufficient glycogen-derived energy substrate supply can activate neuronal pannexin-1 channels as well as lower the CSD threshold. Therefore, conditions that limit energy supply to synapses (eg, SD) may predispose to migraine attacks, as suggested by genetic studies associating glucose or lactate transporter deficiency with migraine.

<div class="section" id="ana25127-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Single, large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of mitochondrial disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the genetic defect and molecular phenotype to improve understanding of pathogenic mechanisms associated with single, large-scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25127-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We investigated 23 muscle biopsies taken from adult patients (6 males/17 females with a mean age of 43 years) with characterized single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in skeletal muscle biopsies was quantified by immunoreactivity levels for complex I and complex IV proteins. Single muscle fibers with varying degrees of deficiency were selected from 6 patient biopsies for determination of mtDNA deletion level and copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25127-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>We have defined 3 “classes” of single, large-scale deletion with distinct patterns of mitochondrial deficiency, determined by the size and location of the deletion. Single fiber analyses showed that fibers with greater respiratory chain deficiency harbored higher levels of mtDNA deletion with an increase in total mtDNA copy number. For the first time, we have demonstrated that threshold levels for complex I and complex IV deficiency differ based on deletion class.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25127-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Combining genetic and immunofluorescent assays, we conclude that thresholds for complex I and complex IV deficiency are modulated by the deletion of complex-specific protein-encoding genes. Furthermore, removal of mt-tRNA genes impacts specific complexes only at high deletion levels, when complex-specific protein-encoding genes remain. These novel findings provide valuable insight into the pathogenic mechanisms associated with these mutations. Ann Neurol 2018;83:115–130</p></div></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Fast inhibitory GABAergic transmission plays a fundamental role in neural circuits. Current theories of cortical function assume that fast GABAergic inhibition acts via GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on postsynaptic neurons, while presynaptic effects of GABA depend on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation. Manipulations of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity in vivo produced different effects on cortical function, which were generally ascribed to the mode of action of a drug, more than its site of action. Here we show that in rodent primary visual cortex, α4-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can be located on subsets of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic terminals and decrease synaptic transmission. Our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into the effects of changes in cortical inhibition; the ability to modulate inputs onto cortical circuits locally, via presynaptic regulation of release by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Any given area in human cortex may receive input from multiple, functionally heterogeneous areas, potentially representing different processing threads. Alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta oscillations (13–20 Hz) have been hypothesized by other investigators to gate local cortical processing, but their influence on cortical responses to input from other cortical areas is unknown. To study this, we measured the effect of local oscillatory power and phase on cortical responses elicited by single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) at distant cortical sites, in awake human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for epilepsy surgery. In 4 out of 5 subjects, the amplitudes of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited by distant SPES were reproducibly modulated by the power, but not the phase, of local oscillations in alpha and beta frequencies. Specifically, CCEP amplitudes were higher when average oscillatory power just before distant SPES (−110 to −10 ms) was high. This effect was observed in only a subset (0–33%) of sites with CCEPs and, like the CCEPs themselves, varied with stimulation at different distant sites. Our results suggest that although alpha and beta oscillations may gate local processing, they may also enhance the responsiveness of cortex to input from distant cortical sites.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Rat somatosensory genital cortex contains a large sexually monomorphic representation of the penis in males and the clitoris in females. Genital cortex microstimulation-evoked movements of legs, trunk and genitals, which showed sex-specific differences related to mating behaviors and included thrusting in males and lordosis-like movements in females. Erections/tumescence of penis or clitoris could not be evoked, however. Anterograde tracer injections into penis/clitoris cortex revealed eleven corticocortical and 10 subcortical projection targets, which were qualitatively similar in both sexes. Corticocortical genital-cortex-projections innervated about 3% of the cortical surface and most were analog to other somatosensory projections targeting motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex and perirhinal cortex. Corticocortical projections that differed from other parts of somatosensory cortex targeted male scrotum cortex, female vulva cortex, the somatosensory–ear–auditory-cortex-region and the caudal parietal area. Aligning cytoarchitectonic borders with motor topography, sensory genital responses and corticocortical projections identified a candidate region for genital motor cortex. Most subcortical genital-cortex-projections were analog to other thalamic, tectal or pontine projections of somatosensory cortex. Genital-cortex-specific subcortical projections targeted amygdala and nucleus submedius and accumbens. Microstimulation-effects and projections support a sexual function of genital cortex and suggest that genital cortex is a major hub of sexual sensorimotor processing in rodents.</span>

While evidence identifying candidate brain areas for each of these processes is well established, the precise mechanistic role carried out by each brain region is still debated. In this article, we present a computational model that clarifies the unique contribution of frontoparietal cortex regions to intertemporal decision making. The model we develop samples reward and delay information stochastically on a moment-by-moment basis. As preference for the choice alternatives evolves, dynamic inhibitory processes are executed by way of asymmetric lateral inhibition. We find that it is these lateral inhibition processes that best explain the contribution of frontoparietal regions to intertemporal decision making exhibited in our data.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Encoding hand position by the cerebral cortex is essential not only for the neural representation of the body image but also for different actions based on eye–hand coordination. These include reaching for visual objects as well as complex movement sequences, such as tea-making, tool use, and object construction, among many others. All these functions depend on a continuous refreshing of the hand position representation, relying on both predictive signaling and afferent information. The hand position influence on neural activity in the parietofrontal system, together with eye position signals, are the basic elements of an eye–hand matrix from which all the above functions can emerge and could be regarded as key features of a network with several entry points, command nodes and outflow pathways, as confirmed by the discovery of a direct parietospinal projection for the control of hand action. The integrity of this system is crucial for daily life, as testified by the consequences of cortical lesions, spanning from severe paralysis to complex forms of apraxia. In this review, I will sketch my personal understanding of the scientific and conceptual trajectory of a line of investigation with many unexpected influences on cortical function and disease, from motor behavior to cognition.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, as well as animal studies, indicate that the amygdala and frontomedial brain regions are critically involved in conditioned fear and that frontomedial oscillations in the theta range (4–8 Hz) may support communication between these brain regions. However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG–fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS−E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS−N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS−) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.</span>

<p>by Roman Goulard, Jean-Louis Vercher, Stéphane Viollet</p>

To avoid crashing onto the floor, a free falling fly needs to trigger its wingbeats quickly and control the orientation of its thrust accurately and swiftly to stabilize its pitch and hence its speed. Behavioural data have suggested that the vertical optic flow produced by the fall and crossing the visual field plays a key role in this anti-crash response. Free fall behavior analyses have also suggested that flying insect may not rely on graviception to stabilize their flight. Based on these two assumptions, we have developed a model which accounts for hoverflies´ position and pitch orientation recorded in 3D with a fast stereo camera during experimental free falls. Our dynamic model shows that optic flow-based control combined with closed-loop control of the pitch suffice to stabilize the flight properly. In addition, our model sheds a new light on the visual-based feedback control of fly´s pitch, lift and thrust. Since graviceptive cues are possibly not used by flying insects, the use of a vertical reference to control the pitch is discussed, based on the results obtained on a complete dynamic model of a virtual fly falling in a textured corridor. This model would provide a useful tool for understanding more clearly how insects may or not estimate their absolute attitude.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4F046xHmM_I" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/847yCSUjhhw/article">What drives the perceptual change resulting from speech motor adaptation? Evaluation of hypotheses in a Bayesian modeling framework</a></h4>

<p>by Jean-François Patri, Pascal Perrier, Jean-Luc Schwartz, Julien Diard</p>

Shifts in perceptual boundaries resulting from speech motor learning induced by perturbations of the auditory feedback were taken as evidence for the involvement of motor functions in auditory speech perception. Beyond this general statement, the precise mechanisms underlying this involvement are not yet fully understood. In this paper we propose a quantitative evaluation of some hypotheses concerning the motor and auditory updates that could result from motor learning, in the context of various assumptions about the roles of the auditory and somatosensory pathways in speech perception. This analysis was made possible thanks to the use of a Bayesian model that implements these hypotheses by expressing the relationships between speech production and speech perception in a joint probability distribution. The evaluation focuses on how the hypotheses can (1) predict the location of perceptual boundary shifts once the perturbation has been removed, (2) account for the magnitude of the compensation in presence of the perturbation, and (3) describe the correlation between these two behavioral characteristics. Experimental findings about changes in speech perception following adaptation to auditory feedback perturbations serve as reference. Simulations suggest that they are compatible with a framework in which motor adaptation updates both the auditory-motor internal model and the auditory characterization of the perturbed phoneme, and where perception involves both auditory and somatosensory pathways.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/847yCSUjhhw" width="1" />

Depressed individuals typically show poor memory for positive events, potentiated memory for negative events, and impaired recollection. These phenomena are clinically important but poorly understood. Compelling links between stress and depression suggest promising candidate mechanisms. Stress can suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibit dopamine neurons, and sensitize the amygdala. We argue that these phenomena may impair pattern separation, disrupt the encoding of positive experiences, and bias retrieval toward negative events, respectively, thus recapitulating core aspects of memory disruption in depression.
