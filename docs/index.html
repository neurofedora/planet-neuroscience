<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The principle of constraint-induced therapy is widely practiced in rehabilitation. In hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) with impaired contralateral corticospinal projection due to unilateral injury, function improves after imposing a temporary constraint on limbs from the less affected hemisphere. This type of partially-reversible impairment in motor control by early brain injury bears a resemblance to the experience-dependent plastic acquisition and modification of neuronal response selectivity in the visual cortex. Previously, such mechanism was modeled within the framework of BCM (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro) theory, a rate-based synaptic modification theory. Here, we demonstrate a minimally complex yet sufficient neural network model which provides a fundamental explanation for inter-hemispheric competition using a simplified spike-based model of information transmission and plasticity. We emulate the restoration of function in hemiplegic CP by simulating the competition between cells of the ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal tracts. We use a high-speed hardware neural simulation to provide realistic numbers of spikes and realistic magnitudes of synaptic modification. We demonstrate that the phenomenon of constraint-induced partial reversal of hemiplegia can be modeled by simplified neural descending tracts with 2 layers of spiking neurons and synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We further demonstrate that persistent hemiplegia following unilateral cortical inactivation or deprivation is predicted by the STDP-based model but is inconsistent with BCM model. Although our model is a highly simplified and limited representation of the corticospinal system, it offers an explanation of how constraint as an intervention can help the system to escape from a suboptimal solution. This is a display of an emergent phenomenon from the synaptic competition.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience that involves dynamic interactions between sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional processes. Pain experiences have a high degree of variability depending on their context and prior anticipation. Viewing pain perception as a perceptual inference problem, we propose a predictive coding paradigm to characterize evoked and non-evoked pain. We record the local field potentials (LFPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of freely behaving rats—two regions known to encode the sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. We further use predictive coding to investigate the temporal coordination of oscillatory activity between the S1 and ACC. Specifically, we develop a phenomenological predictive coding model to describe the macroscopic dynamics of bottom-up and top-down activity. Supported by recent experimental data, we also develop a biophysical neural mass model to describe the mesoscopic neural dynamics in the S1 and ACC populations, in both naive and chronic pain-treated animals. Our proposed predictive coding models not only replicate important experimental findings, but also provide new prediction about the impact of the model parameters on the physiological or behavioral read-out—thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the uncertainty of expectation, placebo or nocebo effect, and chronic pain.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">An important problem in systems neuroscience is to understand how information is communicated among brain regions, and it has been proposed that communication is mediated by neuronal oscillations, such as rhythms in the gamma band. We sought to investigate this idea by using a network model with two components, a source (sending) and a target (receiving) component, both built to resemble local populations in the cerebral cortex. To measure the effectiveness of communication, we used population-level correlations in spike times between the source and target. We found that after correcting for a response time that is independent of initial conditions, spike-time correlations between the source and target are significant, due in large measure to the alignment of firing events in their gamma rhythms. But, we also found that regular oscillations cannot produce the results observed in our model simulations of cortical neurons. Surprisingly, it is the <em class="a-plus-plus">irregularity</em> of gamma rhythms, the absence of internal clocks, together with the <em class="a-plus-plus">malleability</em> of these rhythms and their tendency to align with external pulses — features that are known to be present in gamma rhythms in the real cortex — that produced the results observed. These findings and the mechanistic explanations we offered are our primary results. Our secondary result is a mathematical relationship between correlations and the sizes of the samples used for their calculation. As improving technology enables recording simultaneously from increasing numbers of neurons, this relationship could be useful for interpreting results from experimental recordings.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Excitatory synaptic signaling in cortical circuits is thought to be metabolically expensive. Two fundamental brain functions, learning and memory, are associated with long-term synaptic plasticity, but we know very little about energetics of these slow biophysical processes. This study investigates the energy requirement of information storing in plastic synapses for an extended version of BCM plasticity with a decay term, stochastic noise, and nonlinear dependence of neuron’s firing rate on synaptic current (adaptation). It is shown that synaptic weights in this model exhibit bistability. In order to analyze the system analytically, it is reduced to a simple dynamic mean-field for a population averaged plastic synaptic current. Next, using the concepts of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we derive the energy rate (entropy production rate) for plastic synapses and a corresponding Fisher information for coding presynaptic input. That energy, which is of chemical origin, is primarily used for battling fluctuations in the synaptic weights and presynaptic firing rates, and it increases steeply with synaptic weights, and more uniformly though nonlinearly with presynaptic firing. At the onset of synaptic bistability, Fisher information and memory lifetime both increase sharply, by a few orders of magnitude, but the plasticity energy rate changes only mildly. This implies that a huge gain in the precision of stored information does not have to cost large amounts of metabolic energy, which suggests that synaptic information is not directly limited by energy consumption. Interestingly, for very weak synaptic noise, such a limit on synaptic coding accuracy is imposed instead by a derivative of the plasticity energy rate with respect to the mean presynaptic firing, and this relationship has a general character that is independent of the plasticity type. An estimate for primate neocortex reveals that a relative metabolic cost of BCM type synaptic plasticity, as a fraction of neuronal cost related to fast synaptic transmission and spiking, can vary from negligible to substantial, depending on the synaptic noise level and presynaptic firing.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">An inverse procedure is developed and tested to recover functional and structural information from global signals of brains activity. The method assumes a leaky-integrate and fire model with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, coupled via a directed network. Neurons are endowed with a heterogenous current value, which sets their associated dynamical regime. By making use of a heterogenous mean-field approximation, the method seeks to reconstructing from global activity patterns the distribution of in-coming degrees, for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the distribution of the assigned currents. The proposed inverse scheme is first validated against synthetic data. Then, time-lapse acquisitions of a zebrafish larva recorded with a two-photon light sheet microscope are used as an input to the reconstruction algorithm. A power law distribution of the in-coming connectivity of the excitatory neurons is found. Local degree distributions are also computed by segmenting the whole brain in sub-regions traced from annotated atlas.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Observations of finely-timed spike relationships in population recordings have been used to support partial reconstruction of neural microcircuit diagrams. In this approach, fine-timescale components of paired spike train interactions are isolated and subsequently attributed to synaptic parameters. Recent perturbation studies strengthen the case for such an inference, yet the complete set of measurements needed to calibrate statistical models is unavailable. To address this gap, we study features of pairwise spiking in a large-scale <em class="a-plus-plus">in vivo</em> dataset where presynaptic neurons were explicitly decoupled from network activity by juxtacellular stimulation. We then construct biophysical models of paired spike trains to reproduce the observed phenomenology of <em class="a-plus-plus">in vivo</em> monosynaptic interactions, including both fine-timescale spike-spike correlations and firing irregularity. A key characteristic of these models is that the paired neurons are coupled by rapidly-fluctuating background inputs. We quantify a monosynapse’s causal effect by comparing the postsynaptic train with its counterfactual, when the monosynapse is removed. Subsequently, we develop statistical techniques for estimating this causal effect from the pre- and post-synaptic spike trains. A particular focus is the justification and application of a nonparametric separation of timescale principle to implement synaptic inference. Using simulated data generated from the biophysical models, we characterize the regimes in which the estimators accurately identify the monosynaptic effect. A secondary goal is to initiate a critical exploration of neurostatistical assumptions in terms of biophysical mechanisms, particularly with regards to the challenging but arguably fundamental issue of fast, unobservable nonstationarities in background dynamics.</p>

<p>by Yao Jiang, Hui-Fang Liu, Rong Liu</p>

The binding affinities of protein-nucleic acid interactions could be altered due to missense mutations occurring in DNA- or RNA-binding proteins, therefore resulting in various diseases. Unfortunately, a systematic comparison and prediction of the effects of mutations on protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions (these two mutation classes are termed MPDs and MPRs, respectively) is still lacking. Here, we demonstrated that these two classes of mutations could generate similar or different tendencies for binding free energy changes in terms of the properties of mutated residues. We then developed regression algorithms separately for MPDs and MPRs by introducing novel geometric partition-based energy features and interface-based structural features. Through feature selection and ensemble learning, similar computational frameworks that integrated energy- and nonenergy-based models were established to estimate the binding affinity changes resulting from MPDs and MPRs, but the selected features for the final models were different and therefore reflected the specificity of these two mutation classes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology was extended to the identification of mutations that significantly decreased the binding affinities. Extensive validations indicated that our algorithm generally performed better than the state-of-the-art methods on both the regression and classification tasks.

<p>by James H. Joly, Brandon T. L. Chew, Nicholas A. Graham</p>

The metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells creates metabolic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted. However, our understanding of metabolic dependencies and the pathway crosstalk that creates these vulnerabilities in cancer cells remains incomplete. Here, by integrating gene expression data with genetic loss-of-function and pharmacological screening data from hundreds of cancer cell lines, we identified metabolic vulnerabilities at the level of pathways rather than individual genes. This approach revealed that metabolic pathway dependencies are highly context-specific such that cancer cells are vulnerable to inhibition of one metabolic pathway only when activity of another metabolic pathway is altered. Notably, we also found that the no single metabolic pathway was universally essential, suggesting that cancer cells are not invariably dependent on any metabolic pathway. In addition, we confirmed that cell culture medium is a major confounding factor for the analysis of metabolic pathway vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, we found robust associations between metabolic pathway activity and sensitivity to clinically approved drugs that were independent of cell culture medium. Lastly, we used parallel integration of pharmacological and genetic dependency data to confidently identify metabolic pathway vulnerabilities. Taken together, this study serves as a comprehensive characterization of the landscape of metabolic pathway vulnerabilities in cancer cell lines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QSI4-3h-Ths" width="1" />

<p>by Rohan N. Shah, Alexander J. Ruthenburg</p>

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed molecular biology and contributed to many seminal insights into genomic regulation and function. Apart from whole-genome sequencing, an NGS workflow involves alignment of the sequencing reads to the genome of study, after which the resulting alignments can be used for downstream analyses. However, alignment is complicated by the repetitive sequences; many reads align to more than one genomic locus, with 15–30% of the genome not being uniquely mappable by short-read NGS. This problem is typically addressed by discarding reads that do not uniquely map to the genome, but this practice can lead to systematic distortion of the data. Previous studies that developed methods for handling ambiguously mapped reads were often of limited applicability or were computationally intensive, hindering their broader usage. In this work, we present SmartMap: an algorithm that augments industry-standard aligners to enable usage of ambiguously mapped reads by assigning weights to each alignment with Bayesian analysis of the read distribution and alignment quality. SmartMap is computationally efficient, utilizing far fewer weighting iterations than previously thought necessary to process alignments and, as such, analyzing more than a billion alignments of NGS reads in approximately one hour on a desktop PC. By applying SmartMap to peak-type NGS data, including MNase-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq in three organisms, we can increase read depth by up to 53% and increase the mapped proportion of the genome by up to 18% compared to analyses utilizing only uniquely mapped reads. We further show that SmartMap enables the analysis of more than 140,000 repetitive elements that could not be analyzed by traditional ChIP-seq workflows, and we utilize this method to gain insight into the epigenetic regulation of different classes of repetitive elements. These data emphasize both the dangers of discarding ambiguously mapped reads and their power for driving biological discovery.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lxHOpbOVKoI" width="1" />

Mass Based Imaging (MBI) technologies such as Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) allow for the simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of 40 or more proteins in biological tissue, providing insight into cellular phenotypes and organization <i>in situ</i>. Imaging artifacts, resulting from the sample, assay or instrumentation complicate downstream analyses and require correction by domain experts. Here, we present MBI Analysis User Interface (MAUI), a series of graphical user interfaces that facilitate this data pre-processing, including the removal of channel crosstalk, noise and antibody aggregates. Our software streamlines these steps and accelerates processing by enabling real-time and interactive parameter tuning across multiple images.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OJnoGHD_DtQ" width="1" />

<p>by Benjamin Deneu, Maximilien Servajean, Pierre Bonnet, Christophe Botella, François Munoz, Alexis Joly</p>

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are statistical models suited for learning complex visual patterns. In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted “punctual models”). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (“ablation experiments”). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q7xKUcr8Ifw" width="1" />

<p>by Tsuyoshi Ikegami, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Tricia L. Gibo, Toshinori Yoshioka, Rieko Osu, Mitsuo Kawato</p>

Humans have the amazing ability to learn the dynamics of the body and environment to develop motor skills. Traditional motor studies using arm reaching paradigms have viewed this ability as the process of ‘internal model adaptation’. However, the behaviors have not been fully explored in the case when reaches fail to attain the intended target. Here we examined human reaching under two force fields types; one that induces failures (i.e., target errors), and the other that does not. Our results show the presence of a distinct failure-driven adaptation process that enables quick task success after failures, and before completion of internal model adaptation, but that can result in persistent changes to the undisturbed trajectory. These behaviors can be explained by considering a hierarchical interaction between internal model adaptation and the failure-driven adaptation of reach direction. Our findings suggest that movement failure is negotiated using hierarchical motor adaptations by humans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/y64_0QXQutQ" width="1" />

<p>by David P. Shorten, Richard E. Spinney, Joseph T. Lizier</p>

Transfer entropy (TE) is a widely used measure of directed information flows in a number of domains including neuroscience. Many real-world time series for which we are interested in information flows come in the form of (near) instantaneous events occurring over time. Examples include the spiking of biological neurons, trades on stock markets and posts to social media, amongst myriad other systems involving events in continuous time throughout the natural and social sciences. However, there exist severe limitations to the current approach to TE estimation on such event-based data via discretising the time series into time bins: it is not consistent, has high bias, converges slowly and cannot simultaneously capture relationships that occur with very fine time precision as well as those that occur over long time intervals. Building on recent work which derived a theoretical framework for TE in continuous time, we present an estimation framework for TE on event-based data and develop a <i>k</i>-nearest-neighbours estimator within this framework. This estimator is provably consistent, has favourable bias properties and converges orders of magnitude more quickly than the current state-of-the-art in discrete-time estimation on synthetic examples. We demonstrate failures of the traditionally-used source-time-shift method for null surrogate generation. In order to overcome these failures, we develop a local permutation scheme for generating surrogate time series conforming to the appropriate null hypothesis in order to test for the statistical significance of the TE and, as such, test for the conditional independence between the history of one point process and the updates of another. Our approach is shown to be capable of correctly rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis of conditional independence even in the presence of strong pairwise time-directed correlations. This capacity to accurately test for conditional independence is further demonstrated on models of a spiking neural circuit inspired by the pyloric circuit of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, succeeding where previous related estimators have failed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/it9Dz-VffxU" width="1" />

Most vertebrate RNA viruses show pervasive suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, closely resembling the dinucleotide composition of host cell transcriptomes. In contrast, CpG suppression is absent in both invertebrate mRNA and RNA viruses that exclusively infect arthropods. Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by invertebrate vectors and thus encounter potentially conflicting evolutionary pressures in the different cytoplasmic environments. Using a newly developed Zika virus (ZIKV) model, we have investigated how demands for CpG suppression in vertebrate cells can be reconciled with potentially quite different compositional requirements in invertebrates and how this affects ZIKV replication and transmission. Mutant viruses with synonymously elevated CpG or UpA dinucleotide frequencies showed attenuated replication in vertebrate cell lines, which was rescued by knockout of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Conversely, in mosquito cells, ZIKV mutants with elevated CpG dinucleotide frequencies showed substantially enhanced replication compared to wild type. Host-driven effects on virus replication attenuation and enhancement were even more apparent in mouse and mosquito models. Infections with CpG- or UpA-high ZIKV mutants in mice did not cause typical ZIKV-induced tissue damage and completely protected mice during subsequent challenge with wild-type virus, which demonstrates their potential as live-attenuated vaccines. In contrast, the CpG-high mutants displayed enhanced replication in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes and a larger proportion of mosquitoes carried infectious virus in their saliva. These findings show that mosquito cells are also capable of discriminating RNA based on dinucleotide composition. However, the evolutionary pressure on the CpG dinucleotides of viral genomes in arthropod vectors directly opposes the pressure present in vertebrate host cells, which provides evidence that an adaptive compromise is required for arbovirus transmission. This suggests that the genome composition of arbo flaviviruses is crucial to maintain the balance between high-level replication in the vertebrate host and persistent replication in the mosquito vector.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/acvgEhXaVv8" width="1" />

Persisters represent a small subpopulation of non- or slow-growing bacterial cells that are tolerant to killing by antibiotics. Despite their prominent role in the recalcitrance of chronic infections to antibiotic therapy, the mechanism of their formation has remained elusive. We show that sorted cells of <i>Escherichia coli</i> with low levels of energy-generating enzymes are better able to survive antibiotic killing. Using microfluidics time-lapse microscopy and a fluorescent reporter for in vivo ATP measurements, we find that a subpopulation of cells with a low level of ATP survives killing by ampicillin. We propose that these low ATP cells are formed stochastically as a result of fluctuations in the abundance of energy-generating components. These findings point to a general “low energy” mechanism of persister formation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wLiBOMyGtAE" width="1" />

<p>by Abigail Leavitt LaBella, Dana A. Opulente, Jacob L. Steenwyk, Chris Todd Hittinger, Antonis Rokas</p>

Reverse ecology is the inference of ecological information from patterns of genomic variation. One rich, heretofore underutilized, source of ecologically relevant genomic information is codon optimality or adaptation. Bias toward codons that match the tRNA pool is robustly associated with high gene expression in diverse organisms, suggesting that codon optimization could be used in a reverse ecology framework to identify highly expressed, ecologically relevant genes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between optimal codon usage in the classic galactose metabolism (<i>GAL</i>) pathway and known ecological niches for 329 species of budding yeasts, a diverse subphylum of fungi. We find that optimal codon usage in the <i>GAL</i> pathway is positively correlated with quantitative growth on galactose, suggesting that <i>GAL</i> codon optimization reflects increased capacity to grow on galactose. Optimal codon usage in the <i>GAL</i> pathway is also positively correlated with human-associated ecological niches in yeasts of the CUG-Ser1 clade and with dairy-associated ecological niches in the family Saccharomycetaceae. For example, optimal codon usage of <i>GAL</i> genes is greater than 85% of all genes in the genome of the major human pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> (CUG-Ser1 clade) and greater than 75% of genes in the genome of the dairy yeast <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i> (family Saccharomycetaceae). We further find a correlation between optimization in the <i>GAL</i>actose pathway genes and several genes associated with nutrient sensing and metabolism. This work suggests that codon optimization harbors information about the metabolic ecology of microbial eukaryotes. This information may be particularly useful for studying fungal dark matter—species that have yet to be cultured in the lab or have only been identified by genomic material.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yGiZ_5eCky0" width="1" />

Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are biased and difficult to reproduce due to methodological flaws and poor reporting. There is increasing attention for responsible research practices and implementation of reporting guidelines, but whether these efforts have improved the methodological quality of RCTs (e.g., lower risk of bias) is unknown. We, therefore, mapped risk-of-bias trends over time in RCT publications in relation to journal and author characteristics. Meta-information of 176,620 RCTs published between 1966 and 2018 was extracted. The risk-of-bias probability (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of patients/personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment) was assessed using a risk-of-bias machine learning tool. This tool was simultaneously validated using 63,327 human risk-of-bias assessments obtained from 17,394 RCTs evaluated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Moreover, RCT registration and CONSORT Statement reporting were assessed using automated searches. Publication characteristics included the number of authors, journal impact factor (JIF), and medical discipline. The annual number of published RCTs substantially increased over 4 decades, accompanied by increases in authors (5.2 to 7.8) and institutions (2.9 to 4.8). The risk of bias remained present in most RCTs but decreased over time for allocation concealment (63% to 51%), random sequence generation (57% to 36%), and blinding of outcome assessment (58% to 52%). Trial registration (37% to 47%) and the use of the CONSORT Statement (1% to 20%) also rapidly increased. In journals with a higher impact factor (&gt;10), the risk of bias was consistently lower with higher levels of RCT registration and the use of the CONSORT Statement. Automated risk-of-bias predictions had accuracies above 70% for allocation concealment (70.7%), random sequence generation (72.1%), and blinding of patients/personnel (79.8%), but not for blinding of outcome assessment (62.7%). In conclusion, the likelihood of bias in RCTs has generally decreased over the last decades. This optimistic trend may be driven by increased knowledge augmented by mandatory trial registration and more stringent reporting guidelines and journal requirements. Nevertheless, relatively high probabilities of bias remain, particularly in journals with lower impact factors. This emphasizes that further improvement of RCT registration, conduct, and reporting is still urgently needed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KTBxyMjg_Vs" width="1" />

Delineating human cardiac pathologies and their basic molecular mechanisms relies on research conducted in model organisms. Yet translating findings from preclinical models to humans present a significant challenge, in part due to differences in cardiac protein expression between humans and model organisms. Proteins immediately determine cellular function, yet their large-scale investigation in hearts has lagged behind those of genes and transcripts. Here, we set out to bridge this knowledge gap: By analyzing protein profiles in humans and commonly used model organisms across cardiac chambers, we determine their commonalities and regional differences. We analyzed cardiac tissue from each chamber of human, pig, horse, rat, mouse, and zebrafish in biological replicates. Using mass spectrometry–based proteomics workflows, we measured and evaluated the abundance of approximately 7,000 proteins in each species. The resulting knowledgebase of cardiac protein signatures is accessible through an online database: atlas.cardiacproteomics.com. Our combined analysis allows for quantitative evaluation of protein abundances across cardiac chambers, as well as comparisons of cardiac protein profiles across model organisms. Up to a quarter of proteins with differential abundances between atria and ventricles showed opposite chamber-specific enrichment between species; these included numerous proteins implicated in cardiac disease. The generated proteomics resource facilitates translational prospects of cardiac studies from model organisms to humans by comparisons of disease-linked protein networks across species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4yRRIsy7RPQ" width="1" />

<p>Machine Learning (ML) is becoming increasingly important in daily life. In
this context, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a popular approach within
ML methods to realize an artificial intelligence. Usually, the topology of ANNs
is predetermined. However, there are problems where it is difficult to find a
suitable topology. Therefore, Topology and Weight Evolving Artificial Neural
Network (TWEANN) algorithms have been developed that can find ANN topologies
and weights using genetic algorithms. A well-known downside for large-scale
problems is that TWEANN algorithms often evolve inefficient ANNs and require
long runtimes.
</p>
<p>To address this issue, we propose a new TWEANN algorithm called Artificial
Life Form (ALF) with the following technical advancements: (1) speciation via
structural and semantic similarity to form better candidate solutions, (2)
dynamic adaptation of the observed candidate solutions for better convergence
properties, and (3) integration of solution quality into genetic reproduction
to increase the probability of optimization success. Experiments on large-scale
ML problems confirm that these approaches allow the fast solving of these
problems and lead to efficient evolved ANNs.

<p>We wish to explore the contribution that asocial and social learning might
play as a mechanism for self-adaptation in the search for variable-length
structures by an evolutionary algorithm. An extremely challenging, yet simple
to understand problem landscape is adopted where the probability of randomly
finding a solution is approximately one in a trillion. A number of learning
mechanisms operating on variable-length structures are implemented and their
performance analysed. The social learning setup, which combines forms of both
social and asocial learning in combination with evolution is found to be most
performant, while the setups exclusively adopting evolution are incapable of
finding solutions.

<p>In this study, we analyze behaviours of the well-known CMA-ES by extracting
the time-series features on its dynamic strategy parameters. An extensive
experiment was conducted on twelve CMA-ES variants and 24 test problems taken
from the BBOB (Black-Box Optimization Bench-marking) testbed, where we used two
different cutoff times to stop those variants. We utilized the tsfresh package
for extracting the features and performed the feature selection procedure using
the Boruta algorithm, resulting in 32 features to distinguish either CMA-ES
variants or the problems. After measuring the number of predefined targets
reached by those variants, we contrive to predict those measured values on each
test problem using the feature. From our analysis, we saw that the features can
classify the CMA-ES variants, or the function groups decently, and show a
potential for predicting the performance of those variants. We conducted a
hierarchical clustering analysis on the test problems and noticed a drastic
change in the clustering outcome when comparing the longer cutoff time to the
shorter one, indicating a huge change in search behaviour of the algorithm. In
general, we found that with longer time series, the predictive power of the
time series features increase.

<p>We propose a novel surrogate-assisted Evolutionary Algorithm for solving
expensive combinatorial optimization problems. We integrate a surrogate model,
which is used for fitness value estimation, into a state-of-the-art P3-like
variant of the Gene-Pool Optimal Mixing Algorithm (GOMEA) and adapt the
resulting algorithm for solving non-binary combinatorial problems. We test the
proposed algorithm on an ensemble learning problem. Ensembling several models
is a common Machine Learning technique to achieve better performance. We
consider ensembles of several models trained on disjoint subsets of a dataset.
Finding the best dataset partitioning is naturally a combinatorial non-binary
optimization problem. Fitness function evaluations can be extremely expensive
if complex models, such as Deep Neural Networks, are used as learners in an
ensemble. Therefore, the number of fitness function evaluations is typically
limited, necessitating expensive optimization techniques. In our experiments we
use five classification datasets from the OpenML-CC18 benchmark and
Support-vector Machines as learners in an ensemble. The proposed algorithm
demonstrates better performance than alternative approaches, including Bayesian
optimization algorithms. It manages to find better solutions using just several
thousand fitness function evaluations for an ensemble learning problem with up

<p>Generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) circumstances after training
remains a challenge for artificial agents. To improve the robustness displayed
by plastic Hebbian neural networks, we evolve a set of Hebbian learning rules,
where multiple connections are assigned to a single rule. Inspired by the
biological phenomenon of the genomic bottleneck, we show that by allowing
multiple connections in the network to share the same local learning rule, it
is possible to drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters, while
obtaining a more robust agent. During evolution, by iteratively using simple
K-Means clustering to combine rules, our Evolve and Merge approach is able to
reduce the number of trainable parameters from 61,440 to 1,920, while at the
same time improving robustness, all without increasing the number of
generations used. While optimization of the agents is done on a standard
quadruped robot morphology, we evaluate the agents' performances on slight
morphology modifications in a total of 30 unseen morphologies. Our results add
to the discussion on generalization, overfitting and OOD adaptation. To create
agents that can adapt to a wider array of unexpected situations, Hebbian
learning combined with a regularising "genomic bottleneck" could be a promising
research direction.

<p>Criticality has been conjectured as an integral part of neuronal network
dynamics. Operating at a critical threshold requires precise parameter tuning
and a corresponding mechanism remains an open question. Recent studies have
suggested that topological features observed in brain networks give rise to a
Griffiths phase, leading to power-laws in brain activity dynamics and the
operational benefits of criticality in an extended parameter region. Motivated
by growing evidence of neural correlates of different states of consciousness,
we investigate how topological changes affect the expression of a Griffiths
phase. We analyze the activity decay in modular networks using a
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible propagation model and find that we can control
the extension of the Griffiths phase by altering intra- and intermodular
connectivity. We find that by adjusting system parameters, we can counteract
changes in critical behavior and maintain a stable critical region despite
changes in network topology. Our results give insight into how structural
network properties affect the emergence of a Griffiths phase and how its
features are linked to established topological network metrics. We discuss how
those findings can contribute to understand the observed changes in functional
brain networks. Finally, we indicate how our results could be useful in the
study of disease spreading.

<p>This work proposes to use evolutionary computation as a pathway to allow a
new perspective on the modeling of energy expenditure and recovery of an
individual athlete during exercise. We revisit a theoretical concept called the
"three component hydraulic model" which is designed to simulate metabolic
systems during exercise and which is able to address recently highlighted
shortcomings of currently applied performance models. This hydraulic model has
not been entirely validated on individual athletes because it depends on
physiological measures that cannot be acquired in the required precision or
quantity. This paper introduces a generalized interpretation and formalization
of the three component hydraulic model that removes its ties to concrete
metabolic measures and allows to use evolutionary computation to fit its
parameters to an athlete.

<p>Recent advances in quantum computing have drawn considerable attention to
building realistic application for and using quantum computers. However,
designing a suitable quantum circuit architecture requires expert knowledge.
For example, it is non-trivial to design a quantum gate sequence for generating
a particular quantum state with as fewer gates as possible. We propose a
quantum architecture search framework with the power of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to address this challenge. In the proposed framework, the DRL
agent can only access the Pauli-$X$, $Y$, $Z$ expectation values and a
predefined set of quantum operations for learning the target quantum state, and
is optimized by the advantage actor-critic (A2C) and proximal policy
optimization (PPO) algorithms. We demonstrate a successful generation of
quantum gate sequences for multi-qubit GHZ states without encoding any
knowledge of quantum physics in the agent. The design of our framework is
rather general and can be employed with other DRL architectures or optimization
methods to study gate synthesis and compilation for many quantum states.

<p>Association Rule Mining is a machine learning method for discovering the
interesting relations between the attributes in a huge transaction database.
Typically, algorithms for Association Rule Mining generate a huge number of
association rules, from which it is hard to extract structured knowledge and
present this automatically in a form that would be suitable for the user.
Recently, an information cartography has been proposed for creating structured
summaries of information and visualizing with methodology called "metro maps".
This was applied to several problem domains, where pattern mining was
necessary. The aim of this study is to develop a method for automatic creation
of metro maps of information obtained by Association Rule Mining and, thus,
spread its applicability to the other machine learning methods. Although the
proposed method consists of multiple steps, its core presents metro map
construction that is defined in the study as an optimization problem, which is
solved using an evolutionary algorithm. Finally, this was applied to four
well-known UCI Machine Learning datasets and one sport dataset. Visualizing the
resulted metro maps not only justifies that this is a suitable tool for
presenting structured knowledge hidden in data, but also that they can tell
stories to users.

<p>We estimate that 208,000 deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices have been implanted to address neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders worldwide. DBS Think Tank presenters pooled data and determined that DBS expanded in its scope and has been applied to multiple brain disorders in an effort to modulate neural circuitry. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 providing a space where clinicians, engineers, researchers from industry and academia discuss current and emerging DBS technologies and logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The emphasis is on cutting edge research and collaboration aimed to advance the DBS field. The Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank was held virtually on September 1 and 2, 2020 (Zoom Video Communications) due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting focused on advances in: (1) optogenetics as a tool for comprehending neurobiology of diseases and on optogenetically-inspired DBS, (2) cutting edge of emerging DBS technologies, (3) ethical issues affecting DBS research and access to care, (4) neuromodulatory approaches for depression, (5) advancing novel hardware, software and imaging methodologies, (6) use of neurophysiological signals in adaptive neurostimulation, and (7) use of more advanced technologies to improve DBS clinical outcomes. There were 178 attendees who participated in a DBS Think Tank survey, which revealed the expansion of DBS into several indications such as obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and Alzheimer’s disease. This proceedings summarizes the advances discussed at the Eighth Annual DBS Think Tank.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68536">Multiscale analysis of single and double maternal-zygotic <i>Myh9</i> and <i>Myh10</i> mutants during mouse preimplantation development</a></h4>

During the first days of mammalian development, the embryo forms the blastocyst, the structure responsible for implanting the mammalian embryo. Consisting of an epithelium enveloping the pluripotent inner cell mass and a fluid-filled lumen, the blastocyst results from a series of cleavages divisions, morphogenetic movements and lineage specification. Recent studies identified the essential role of actomyosin contractility in driving the cytokinesis, morphogenesis and fate specification leading to the formation of the blastocyst. However, the preimplantation development of contractility mutants has not been characterized. Here, we generated single and double maternal-zygotic mutants of non-muscle myosin II heavy chains (NMHC) to characterize them with multiscale imaging. We find that <i>Myh9</i> (NMHC II-A) is the major NMHC during preimplantation development as its maternal-zygotic loss causes failed cytokinesis, increased duration of the cell cycle, weaker embryo compaction and reduced differentiation, whereas <i>Myh10</i> (NMHC II-B) maternal-zygotic loss is much less severe. Double maternal-zygotic mutants for <i>Myh9</i> and <i>Myh10</i> show a much stronger phenotype, failing most attempts of cytokinesis. We find that morphogenesis and fate specification are affected but nevertheless carry on in a timely fashion, regardless of the impact of the mutations on cell number. Strikingly, even when all cell divisions fail, the resulting single-celled embryo can initiate trophectoderm differentiation and lumen formation by accumulating fluid in increasingly large vacuoles. Therefore, contractility mutants reveal that fluid accumulation is a cell-autonomous process and that the preimplantation program carries on independently of successful cell division.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/67310">Genetic determinants facilitating the evolution of resistance to carbapenem antibiotics</a></h4>

In this era of rising antibiotic resistance, in contrast to our increasing understanding of mechanisms that cause resistance, our understanding of mechanisms that influence the propensity to evolve resistance remains limited. Here, we identified genetic factors that facilitate the evolution of resistance to carbapenems, the antibiotic of 'last resort,' in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, the major carbapenem resistant species. In clinical isolates, we found that high-level transposon insertional mutagenesis plays an important role in contributing to high-level resistance frequencies in several major and emerging carbapenem-resistant lineages. A broader spectrum of resistance-conferring mutations for select carbapenems such as ertapenem also enables higher resistance frequencies and importantly, creates stepping-stones to achieve high-level resistance to all carbapenems. These mutational mechanisms can contribute to the evolution of resistance, in conjunction with the loss of systems that restrict horizontal resistance gene uptake, such as the CRISPR-Cas system. Given the need for greater antibiotic stewardship, these findings argue that in addition to considering the current efficacy of an antibiotic for a clinical isolate in antibiotic selection, considerations of future efficacy are also important. The genetic background of a clinical isolate and the exact antibiotic identity can and should also be considered as it is a determinant of a strain's propensity to become resistant. Together, these findings thus provide a molecular framework for understanding acquisition of carbapenem resistance in <i>K. pneumoniae </i>with important implications for diagnosing and treating this important class of pathogens.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66448">Repeated introductions and intensive community transmission fueled a mumps virus outbreak in Washington State</a></h4>

In 2016/2017, Washington State experienced a mumps outbreak despite high childhood vaccination rates, with cases more frequently detected among school-aged children and members of the Marshallese community. We sequenced 166 mumps virus genomes collected in Washington and other US states, and traced mumps introductions and transmission within Washington. We uncover that mumps was introduced into Washington approximately 13 times, primarily from Arkansas, sparking multiple co-circulating transmission chains. Although age and vaccination status may have impacted transmission, our dataset could not quantify their precise effects. Instead, the outbreak in Washington was overwhelmingly sustained by transmission within the Marshallese community. Our findings underscore the utility of genomic data to clarify epidemiologic factors driving transmission, and pinpoint contact networks as critical for mumps transmission. These results imply that contact structures and historic disparities may leave populations at increased risk for respiratory virus disease even when a vaccine is effective and widely used.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66313">Evolutionarily conserved sperm factors, DCST1 and DCST2, are required for gamete fusion</a></h4>

To trigger gamete fusion, spermatozoa need to activate the molecular machinery in which sperm IZUMO1 and oocyte JUNO (IZUMO1R) interaction plays a critical role in mammals. Although a set of factors involved in this process has recently been identified, no common factor that can function in both vertebrates and invertebrates has yet been reported. Here, we first demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved factors dendrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein domain-containing 1 (DCST1) and dendrocyte expressed seven transmembrane protein domain-containing 2 (DCST2) are essential for sperm–egg fusion in mice, as proven by gene disruption and complementation experiments. We also found that the protein stability of another gamete fusion-related sperm factor, SPACA6, is differently regulated by DCST1/2 and IZUMO1. Thus, we suggest that spermatozoa ensure proper fertilization in mammals by integrating various molecular pathways, including an evolutionarily conserved system that has developed as a result of nearly one billion years of evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66014">Competitive binding of STATs to receptor phospho-Tyr motifs accounts for altered cytokine responses</a></h4>

Cytokines elicit pleiotropic and non-redundant activities despite strong overlap in their usage of receptors, JAKs and STATs molecules. We use IL-6 and IL-27 to ask how two cytokines activating the same signaling pathway have different biological roles. We found that IL-27 induces more sustained STAT1 phosphorylation than IL-6, with the two cytokines inducing comparable levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. Mathematical and statistical modelling of IL-6 and IL-27 signaling identified STAT3 binding to GP130, and STAT1 binding to IL-27Rα, as the main dynamical processes contributing to sustained pSTAT1 levels by IL-27. Mutation of Tyr613 on IL-27Rα decreased IL-27-induced STAT1 phosphorylation by 80% but had limited effect on STAT3 phosphorylation. Strong receptor/STAT coupling by IL-27 initiated a unique gene expression program, which required sustained STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression and was enriched in classical Interferon Stimulated Genes. Interestingly, the STAT/receptor coupling exhibited by IL-6/IL-27 was altered in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). IL-6/IL-27 induced a more potent STAT1 activation in SLE patients than in healthy controls, which correlated with higher STAT1 expression in these patients. Partial inhibition of JAK activation by sub-saturating doses of Tofacitinib specifically lowered the levels of STAT1 activation by IL-6. Our data show that receptor and STATs concentrations critically contribute to shape cytokine responses and generate functional pleiotropy in health and disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65005">Structure of HIV-1 gp41 with its membrane anchors targeted by neutralizing antibodies</a></h4>

The HIV-1 gp120/gp41 trimer undergoes a series of conformational changes in order to catalyze gp41-induced fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Here, we present the crystal structure of gp41 locked in a fusion intermediate state by an MPER-specific neutralizing antibody. The structure illustrates the conformational plasticity of the six membrane anchors arranged asymmetrically with the fusion peptides and the transmembrane regions pointing into different directions. Hinge regions located adjacent to the fusion peptide and the transmembrane region facilitate the conformational flexibility that allows high affinity binding of broadly neutralizing anti-MPER antibodies. Molecular dynamics simulation of the MPER Ab-stabilized gp41 conformation reveals a possible transition pathway into the final post-fusion conformation with the central fusion peptides forming a hydrophobic core with flanking transmembrane regions. This suggests that MPER-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies can block final steps of refolding of the fusion peptide and the transmembrane region, which is required for completing membrane fusion.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64564">Downregulation of glial genes involved in synaptic function mitigates Huntington's Disease pathogenesis</a></h4>

Most research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on neurons, yet glia help form and maintain the synapses whose loss is so prominent in these conditions. To investigate the contributions of glia to Huntington's disease (HD), we profiled the gene expression alterations of <i>Drosophila</i> expressing human mutant <i>Huntingtin</i> (m<i>HTT</i>) in either glia or neurons and compared these changes to what is observed in HD human and HD mice striata. A large portion of conserved genes are concordantly dysregulated across the three species; we tested these genes in a high-throughput behavioral assay and found that downregulation of genes involved in synapse assembly mitigated pathogenesis and behavioral deficits. To our surprise, reducing d<i>NRXN3</i> function in glia was sufficient to improve the phenotype of flies expressing m<i>HTT</i> in neurons, suggesting that mHTT's toxic effects in glia ramify throughout the brain. This supports a model in which dampening synaptic function is protective because it attenuates the excitotoxicity that characterizes HD.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61983">Defective apoptotic cell contractility provokes sterile inflammation leading to liver damage and tumour suppression</a></h4>

Apoptosis is characterized by profound morphological changes, but their physiological purpose is unknown. To characterize the role of apoptotic cell contraction, ROCK1 was rendered caspase non-cleavable (ROCK1nc) by mutating Aspartate 1113, which revealed that ROCK1 cleavage was necessary for forceful contraction and membrane blebbing. When homozygous ROCK1nc mice were treated with the liver-selective apoptotic stimulus of diethylnitrosamine, ROCK1nc mice had more profound liver damage with greater neutrophil infiltration than wild-type mice. Inhibition of the damage associated molecular pattern protein HMGB1 or signalling by its cognate receptor TLR4 lowered neutrophil infiltration and reduced liver damage. ROCK1nc mice also developed fewer diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumours, while HMGB1 inhibition increased HCC tumour numbers. Thus, ROCK1 activation and consequent cell contraction are required to limit sterile inflammation and damage amplification following tissue-scale cell death. Additionally, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for acute sterile inflammation as an efficient tumour suppressive mechanism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61942">Spontaneous and evoked activity patterns diverge over development</a></h4>

The immature brain is highly spontaneously active. Over development this activity must be integrated with emerging patterns of stimulus-evoked activity, but little is known about how this occurs. Here we investigated this question by recording spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the larval zebrafish tectum from 4 to 15 days post fertilisation. Correlations within spontaneous and evoked activity epochs were comparable over development, and their neural assemblies properties refined in similar ways. However both the similarity between evoked and spontaneous assemblies, and also the geometric distance between spontaneous and evoked patterns, decreased over development. At all stages of development evoked activity was of higher dimension than spontaneous activity. Thus spontaneous and evoked activity do not converge over development in this system, and these results do not support the hypothesis that spontaneous activity evolves to form a Bayesian prior for evoked activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61769">DCC regulates astroglial development essential for telencephalic morphogenesis and corpus callosum formation</a></h4>

The forebrain hemispheres are predominantly separated during embryogenesis by the interhemispheric fissure (IHF). Radial astroglia remodel the IHF to form a continuous substrate between the hemispheres for midline crossing of the corpus callosum (CC) and hippocampal commissure (HC). DCC and NTN1 are molecules that have an evolutionarily conserved function in commissural axon guidance. The CC and HC are absent in <i>Dcc </i>and <i>Ntn1 </i>knockout mice, while other commissures are only partially affected, suggesting an additional aetiology in forebrain commissure formation. Here, we find that these molecules play a critical role in regulating astroglial development and IHF remodelling during CC and HC formation. Human subjects with <i>DCC</i> mutations display disrupted IHF remodelling associated with CC and HC malformations. Thus, axon guidance molecules such as DCC and NTN1 first regulate the formation of a midline substrate for dorsal commissures prior to their role in regulating axonal growth and guidance across it.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Prior studies have reported an association between visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and cognitive performance in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), but the specific mechanisms that account for this relationship remain unclear. We examined the relationship between VEP latency and cognitive performance in a large sample of PwMS, hypothesizing that VEP latency indexes not only visual system functioning but also general neural efficiency. Standardized performance index scores were obtained for the domains of memory, executive function, visual-spatial processing, verbal function, attention, information processing speed, and motor skills, as well as global cognitive performance (NeuroTrax battery). VEP P100 component latency was obtained using a standard checkerboard pattern-reversal paradigm. Prolonged VEP latency was significantly associated with poorer performance in multiple cognitive domains, and with the number of cognitive domains in which performance was ≥ 1 SD below the normative mean. Relationships between VEP latency and cognitive performance were significant for information processing speed, executive function, attention, motor skills, and global cognitive performance after controlling for disease duration, visual acuity, and inter-ocular latency differences. This study provides evidence that VEP latency delays index general neural inefficiency that is associated with cognitive disturbances in PwMS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Hand use is a widespread act in many vertebrate lineages and subserves behaviors including locomotion, predation, feeding, nest construction, and grooming. In order to determine whether hand use is similarly used in social behavior, the present paper describes hand use in the social play of rats. In the course of rough and tumble play sessions, rats are found to make as many as twenty different movements a minute with each hand for the purposes of manipulating a partner into a subordinate position or defending against a partner’s attack. The hand movements comprise signaling movements of touching, offensive manipulating of a partner to control a play engagement, and defensive hand movements directed toward blocking, pushing and pulling to parry an attack. For signaling, attack and defense, hand movements have a structure that is similar to the structure of hand movements used for other purposes including eating, but in their contact points on an opponent, they are tailored for partner control. Given the time devoted to play by rats, play likely features the social rat behavior with the most extensive use of hand movements. This extensive use of hand movements for social play is discussed in relation to the ubiquity of hand use in adaptive behavior, the evolution of hand use in the play of mammals, and in relation to extending the multifunctional theory of the purposes of play to include the education of skilled hand movements for various adult functions including as feeding.</p>

Although the neural circuitry underlying fear memory formation is important in fear-related mental disorders, it is incompletely understood. Here, we utilized trace fear conditioning to study the formation of trace fear memory. We identified the entorhinal cortex (EC) as a critical component of sensory signaling to the amygdala. Moreover, we used the loss of function and rescue experiments to demonstrate that release of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) from the EC is required for trace fear memory formation. We discovered that CCK-positive neurons extend from the EC to the lateral nuclei of the amygdala (LA), and inhibition of CCK21 dependent signaling in the EC prevented long-term potentiation of sensory signals to the LA and formation of trace fear memory. Altogether, we suggest a model where sensory stimuli trigger the release of CCK from EC neurons, which potentiates sensory signals to the LA, ultimately influencing neural plasticity and trace fear memory formation.

Adaptive myelination has been reported in response to experimental manipulations of neuronal activity, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resultant alterations in myelination require investigation. To study this, we used the Xenopus laevis tadpole, which is a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of this retinotectal system. Here, we report the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the Xenopus retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Characterization of the myelination progression revealed an appropriate developmental window to address the effects of early patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. To alter patterned activity, we showed tadpoles stroboscopic stimuli and measured the calcium responses of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals. We identified strobe frequencies that elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses, reared animals in these strobe conditions for 7 d, and subsequently observed differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.

Accurate control over everyday goal-directed actions is mediated by sensory-motor predictions of intended consequences and their comparison with actual outcomes. Such online comparisons of the expected and re-afferent, immediate, sensory feedback are conceptualized as internal forward models. Current predictive coding theories describing such models typically address the processing of immediate sensory-motor goals, yet voluntary actions are also oriented towards long-term conceptual goals and intentions, for which the sensory consequence is sometimes absent or cannot be fully predicted. Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying actions with distal conceptual goals is far from being clear. Specifically, it is still unknown whether sensory-motor circuits also encode information regarding the global meaning of the action, detached from the immediate, movement-related goal. Therefore, using fMRI and behavioral measures, we examined identical actions (either right or left-hand button presses) performed for two different semantic intentions ('yes'/'no' response to questions regarding visual stimuli). Importantly, actions were devoid of differences in the immediate sensory outcome. Our findings revealed voxel patterns differentiating the two semantic goals in the frontoparietal cortex and visual pathways including the Lateral-occipital complex, in both hemispheres. Behavioral results suggest that the results cannot be explained by kinetic differences such as force. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing that semantic meaning is embedded in the neural representation of actions independent of immediate sensory outcome and kinetic differences.

Peripheral sensory neurons located in dorsal root ganglia relay sensory information from the peripheral tissue to the brain. Satellite glial cells (SGC) are unique glial cells that form an envelope completely surrounding each sensory neuron soma. This organization allows for close bidirectional communication between the neuron and it surrounding glial coat. Morphological and molecular changes in SGC have been observed in multiple pathological conditions such as inflammation, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, viral infection and nerve injuries. There is evidence that changes in SGC contribute to chronic pain by augmenting neuronal activity in various rodent pain models. SGC also play a critical role in axon regeneration. Whether findings made in rodent model systems are relevant to human physiology have not been investigated. Here we present a detailed characterization of the transcriptional profile of SGC in mouse, rat and human at the single cell level. Our findings suggest that key features of SGC in rodent models are conserved in human. Our study provides the potential to leverage on rodent SGC properties and identify potential targets for the treatment of nerve repair and alleviation of painful conditions.

Animal behavior emerges from a seamless interaction between musculoskeletal elements, neural network dynamics, and the environment. Accessing and understanding the interplay between these intertwined systems requires the development of integrative neuromechanical simulations. Until now, there has been no such simulation framework for the widely studied model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present NeuroMechFly, a data-driven computational model of an adult female fly that is designed to synthesize rapidly growing experimental datasets and to test theories of neuromechanical behavioral control. NeuroMechFly combines a set of modules including an exoskeleton with articulating body parts---limbs, halteres, wings, abdominal segments, head, proboscis, and antennae---muscle models, and neural networks within a physics-based simulation environment. Using this computational framework, we (i) predict the minimal limb degrees-of-freedom needed for real Drosophila behaviors, (ii) estimate expected contact reaction forces, torques, and tactile signals during replayed Drosophila walking and grooming, and (iii) discover neural network and muscle parameters that can drive tripod walking. Thus, NeuroMechFly is a powerful testbed for building an understanding of how behaviors emerge from interactions between complex neuromechanical systems and their physical surroundings.

Chemical synapses exhibit a diverse array of internal mechanisms that affect the dynamics of transmission efficacy. Many of these processes, such as release of neurotransmitter and vesicle recycling, depend strongly on activity-dependent influx and accumulation of Ca2+. To model how each of these processes may affect the processing of information in neural circuits, and how their dysfunction may lead to disease states, requires a computationally efficient modelling framework, capable of generating accurate phenomenology without incurring a heavy computational cost per synapse. Constructing a phenomenologically realistic model requires the precise characterization of the timing and probability of neurotransmitter release. Difficulties arise in that functional forms of instantaneous release rate can be difficult to extract from noisy data without running many thousands of trials, and in biophysical synapses, facilitation of per-vesicle release probability is confounded by depletion. To overcome this, we obtained traces of free Ca2+ concentration in response to various action potential stimulus trains from a molecular MCell model of a hippocampal mossy fiber axon. Ca2+ sensors were placed at varying distance from a voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) cluster, and Ca2+ was buffered by calbindin. Then, using the calcium traces to drive deterministic state vector models of synaptotagmin 1 and 7 (Syt-1/7), which respectively mediate synchronous and asynchronous release in excitatory hippocampal synapses, we obtained high-resolution profiles of instantaneous release rate, to which we applied functional fits. Synchronous vesicle release occurred predominantly within half a micron of the source of spike-evoked Ca2+ influx, while asynchronous release occurred more consistently at all distances. Both fast and slow mechanisms exhibited multi-exponential release rate curves, whose magnitudes decayed exponentially with distance from the Ca2+ source. Profile parameters facilitate on different time scales according to a single, general facilitation function. These functional descriptions lay the groundwork for efficient mesoscale modelling of vesicular release dynamics.

Brain activity flow models estimate the movement of task-evoked activity over brain connections to help explain the emergence of task-related functionality. Activity flow estimates have been shown to accurately predict task-evoked brain activations across a wide variety of brain regions and task conditions. However, these predictions have had limited explanatory power, given known issues with causal interpretations of the standard functional connectivity measures used to parameterize activity flow models. We show here that functional/effective connectivity (FC) measures grounded in causal principles facilitate mechanistic interpretation of activity flow models. Starting from Pearson correlation (the current field standard), we progress from FC measures with poor to excellent causal grounding, demonstrating a continuum of causal validity using simulations and empirical fMRI data. Finally, we apply a causal FC method to a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex region, demonstrating causal network mechanisms contributing to its strong activation during a 2-back (relative to a 0-back) working memory task. Together, these results reveal the promise of parameterizing activity flow models using causal FC methods to identify network mechanisms underlying cognitive computations in the human brain.

Transient neocortical events with high spectral power in the 15-29Hz beta band are among the most reliable predictors of sensory perception. Prestimulus beta event rates in primary somatosensory cortex correlate with sensory suppression, most effectively 100-300ms before stimulus onset. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this perceptual association are unknown. We combined human magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements with biophysical neural modeling to test potential cellular and circuit mechanisms that underlie observed correlations between prestimulus beta events and tactile detection. Extending prior studies, we found that simulated bursts from higher-order, non-lemniscal thalamus were sufficient to drive beta event generation and to recruit slow supragranular inhibition acting on a 300ms time scale to suppress sensory information. Further analysis showed that the same beta generating mechanism can lead to facilitated perception for a brief period when beta events occur simultaneously with tactile stimulation before inhibition is recruited. These findings were supported by close agreement between model-derived predictions and empirical MEG data. The post-event suppressive mechanism explains an array of studies that associate beta with decreased processing, while the during-event faciliatory mechanism may demand a reinterpretation of the role of beta events in the context of coincident timing.

HD is a genetically inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats in the exon-1 of huntingtin protein (HTT). The expanded polyQ enhances the amyloidogenic propensity of HTT exon 1 (HTTex1), which forms a heterogeneous mixture of assemblies with some being neurotoxic. While predominantly intracellular, monomeric and aggregated mutant HTT species are also present in the cerebrospinal fluids of HD patients, however, their biological properties are not well understood. To explore the role of extracellular mutant HTT in aggregation and toxicity, we investigated the possible uptake and amplification of recombinant HTTex1 assemblies in cell culture models. We found seedingcompetent species in the sonicated HTTex1 fibrils, which preferentially entered human neurons and triggered the amplification of neurotoxic assemblies; astrocytes or epithelial cells were not permissive to the HTTex1 seeding. The aggregation of HTTex1 seeds in neurons depleted endogenous HTT protein with non-pathogenic polyQ repeat, activated apoptotic caspase-3 pathway and induced nuclear fragmentation. Using a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies and genetic mutation, we identified epitopes within the N-terminal 17 amino acids and proline-rich domain of HTTex1 mediating neural seeding. Synaptosome preparations from the brains of HD mice also contained similar neurotoxic seeding-competent mutant HTT species. Our findings suggest that amyloidogenic extracellular mutant HTT assemblies may selectively enter neurons, propagate and produce neurotoxic assemblies.

Study Objectives: Alcohol abuse is a significant public health problem, particularly in populations in which sleep deprivation is common as such as shift workers and aged individuals. Although research demonstrates the effect of alcohol on sleep, little is known about the role of sleep in alcohol sensitivity and toxicity. We investigated sleep as a factor modulating alcohol toxicity using Drosophila melanogaster, a model system ideal for studies of sleep, alcohol and aging. Methods: Following 24 hours of sleep deprivation using mechanical stimulation, Drosophila were exposed to binge-like alcohol exposures. Behavioral sensitivity, tolerance, and mortality were assessed. The effects of chronic sleep deprivation on alcohol toxicity were investigated using a short sleep mutant insomniac. Pharmacological induction of sleep for prior to alcohol exposure was accomplished using a GABAA-receptor agonist, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP) to determine if increased sleep mitigated the effects of alcohol toxicity on middle-aged flies and flies with environmentally disrupted circadian clocks mimicking groups more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol. Results: Acute sleep deprivation increased alcohol-induced mortality following alcohol exposure. However, sleep deprivation had no effect on alcohol absorbance or clearance. Sleep deprivation also abolished functional tolerance measured 24 hours after the initial alcohol exposure, although tolerance at 4 h was observed. Pharmacologically increasing sleep prior to alcohol exposure decreased alcohol-induced mortality. Conclusions: Sleep quantity prior to alcohol exposure affects alcohol toxicity with decreased sleep increasing alcohol toxicity and dampened 24-hour alcohol tolerance. In contrast, increased sleep mitigated alcohol-induced mortality even in vulnerable groups such as aging flies and those with circadian dysfunction.

The current study aimed to further address important questions regarding the therapeutic efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids for various behavioral and neuroimmune aspects of the Fmr1 phenotype. To address these questions, our experimental design utilized two different omega-3 fatty acid administration timepoints, compared to both standard laboratory chow controls (Standard) and a diet controlling for the increase in fat content (Control Fat). In the first paradigm, post-weaning supplementation (after postnatal day 21) with the omega-3 fatty acid diet (Omega-3) reversed deficits in startle threshold, but not deficits in prepulse inhibition, and the effect on startle threshold was not specific to the Omega-3 diet. However, post-weaning supplementation with both experimental diets also impaired acquisition of a fear response, recall of the fear memory and contextual fear conditioning compared to the Standard diet. The post-weaning Omega-3 diet reduced hippocampal expression of IL-6 and this reduction of IL-6 was significantly associated with diminished performance in the fear conditioning task. In the prenatal experimental paradigm, the Omega-3 diet attenuated hyperactivity and acquisition of a fear response. Additionally, prenatal exposure to the Control Fat diet (similar to a Western diet) further diminished nonsocial anxiety in the Fmr1 knockout. This study provides significant evidence that dietary fatty acids throughout the lifespan can significantly impact the behavioral and neuroimmune phenotype of the Fmr1 knockout model.

Many species synchronize their physiology and behavior to specific hours. It is commonly assumed that sunlight acts as the main entrainment signal for ~24h clocks. However, the moon provides similarly regular time information, and increasingly studies report correlations between diel behavior and lunidian cycles. Yet, mechanistic insight into the possible influences of the moon on ~24hr timers is scarce. We studied Platynereis dumerilii and uncover that the moon, besides its role in monthly timing, also schedules the exact hour of nocturnal swarming onset to the nights' darkest times. Moonlight adjusts a plastic clock, exhibiting &lt;24h (moonlit) or &gt;24h (no moon) periodicity. Abundance, light sensitivity, and genetic requirement indicate Platynereis r-Opsin1 as receptor to determine moonrise, while the cryptochrome L-Cry is required to discriminate between moon- and sunlight valence. Comparative experiments in Drosophila suggest that Cryptochrome's requirement for light valence interpretation is conserved. Its exact biochemical properties differ, however, between species with dissimilar timing ecology. Our work advances the molecular understanding of lunar impact on fundamental rhythmic processes, including those of marine mass spawners endangered by anthropogenic change.

The ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) controls diverse behaviors and physiologic functions, suggesting the existence of multiple VMH neural subtypes with distinct functions. Combing Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification with RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq) data with snRNA-seq data, we identified 24 mouse VMH neuron clusters. Further analysis, including snRNA-seq data from macaque tissue, defined a more tractable VMH parceling scheme consisting of 6 major genetically- and anatomically-differentiated VMH neuron classes with good cross-species conservation. In addition to two major ventrolateral classes, we identified three distinct classes of dorsomedial VMH neurons. Consistent with previously-suggested unique roles for leptin receptor (Lepr)-expressing VMH neurons, Lepr expression marked a single dorsomedial class. We also identified a class of glutamatergic VMH neurons that resides in the tuberal region, anterolateral to the neuroanatomical core of the VMH.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.16.439809v1?rss=1">A Cryptochrome adopts distinct moon- and sunlight states and functions as moonlight interpreter in monthly oscillator entrainment</a></h4>

Measuring time by the moon's monthly cycles is a wide-spread phenomenon and crucial for successful reproduction in countless marine organisms. In several species, such as the mass-spawning bristle worm Platynereis dumerilii, an endogenous monthly oscillator synchronizes reproduction to specific days. Classical work showed that this oscillator is set by full moon. But how do organisms recognize this specific moon phase? We uncover L-Cry's involvement: photoreduction and recovery kinetics of its co-factor FAD differ strongly when purified L-Cry is exposed to naturalistic moonlight, naturalistic sunlight, or their different successions. L-Cry's sun- versus moonlight states correlate with distinct sub-cellular localizations, indicating differential signalling. These properties enable a discrimination between sun- and moonlight, as well as moonlight duration as a moon phase indicator. Consistently, l-cry mutants re-entrain their circalunar phase less well than wild-type to naturalistic moonlight. But under artificially strong nocturnal light, l-cry mutants re-entrain faster than wildtype, suggesting that L-Cry at least partly blocks "wrong" light from impacting on this oscillator. Our work provides a new level of functional understanding of moon-regulated biological processes.

Abstract
The cetacean visual system is a product of selection pressures favoring underwater vision, yet relatively little is known about it across taxa. Previous studies report several mutations in the opsin genetic sequence in cetaceans, suggesting the evolutionary complete or partial loss of retinal cone photoreceptor function in mysticete and odontocete lineages, respectively. Despite this, limited anatomical evidence suggests cone structures are partially maintained but with absent outer and inner segments in the bowhead retina. The functional consequence and anatomical distributions associated with these unique cone morphologies remain unclear. The current study further investigates the morphology and distribution of cone photoreceptors in the bowhead whale and beluga retina and evaluates the potential functional capacity of these cells' alternative to photoreception. Refined histological and advanced microscopic techniques revealed two additional cone morphologies in the bowhead and beluga retina that have not been previously described. Two proteins involved in magnetosensation were present in these cone structures suggesting the possibility for an alternative functional role in responding to changes in geomagnetic fields. These findings highlight a revised understanding of the unique evolution of cone and gross retinal anatomy in cetaceans, and provide prefatory evidence of potential functional reassignment of these cells.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25100?af=R">Defining vitamin D receptor expression in the brain using a novel VDRCre mouse</a></h4>

We generated a novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) VDRCre knockin mouse for the interrogation of VDR anatomy in the brain. In this article, we demonstrate through immunohistochemistry that VDRCre‐driven reporter expression colocalizes with VDR mRNA throughout the brain. Additionally, we demonstrate that tdTomato (+) neurons respond rapidly to vitamin D, which does not occur in tdTomato (−) neurons.







Abstract
Vitamin D action has been linked to several diseases regulated by the brain including obesity, diabetes, autism, and Parkinson's. However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDRCre). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDRCre mouse brain (as reported by a cre‐dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR‐expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor‐α, and β‐endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato+ neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR‐expressing cells and to characterize their functions.

Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone in the central nervous system and periphery of Biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.







Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within Biomphalaria, S. mansoni larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as “parasitic castration.” As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate Biomphalaria reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in Biomphalaria alexandrina that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH2 (designated Biom‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against Biom‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of Biomphalaria glabrata. GnRH‐like immunoreactive fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of Biomphalaria could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.

Acute exposure to Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) significantly decreases cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor density at inhibitory terminals and mitochondria. Besides, dendrites are significantly larger, have more spines and contain more mitochondria. CB1 receptors (arrows), inhibitory terminals (ter, red shading), mitochondria (m, purple shading), dendrites (blue shading), dendritic spines (sp, blue shading). Scale bars = 500 nm.







Abstract
The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however, it remains unclear whether (1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and (2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB1 receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB1 receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria, and astrocytes. The percentage of CB1 receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB1 receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria. Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria, and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB1 receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25094?af=R">Neuroplasticity in N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor signaling in subregions of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla following sedentary versus physically active conditions</a></h4>

The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.







Abstract
The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartic acid receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1, and the excitatory scaffold protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (4 weeks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10–12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques, western blotting, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95, and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.

Light and electron microscopic studies reveal that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear (a) and extranuclear (b) gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner. AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; GPER, G‐protein–coupled estrogen receptor.







Abstract
Within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), estrogen receptor (ER) β and other gonadal hormone receptors play a role in central cardiovascular processes. However, the influence of sex and age on the cellular and subcellular relationships of ERβ with ERα, G‐protein ER (GPER1), as well as progestin and androgen receptors (PR and AR) in the PVN is uncertain. In young (2‐ to 3‐month‐old) females and males, ERβ‐enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) containing neurons were approximately four times greater than ERα‐labeled and PR‐labeled nuclei in the PVN. In subdivisions of the PVN, young females, compared to males, had: (1) more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in neuroendocrine rostral regions; (2) fewer ERα‐labeled nuclei in neuroendocrine and autonomic projecting medial subregions; and (3) more ERα‐labeled nuclei in an autonomic projecting caudal region. In contrast, young males, compared to females, had approximately 20 times more AR‐labeled nuclei, which often colocalized with ERβ‐EGFP in neuroendocrine (approximately 70%) and autonomic (approximately 50%) projecting subregions. Ultrastructurally, in soma and dendrites, PVN ERβ‐EGFP colocalized primarily with extranuclear AR (approximately 85% soma) and GPER1 (approximately 70% soma). Aged (12‐ to 24‐month‐old) males had more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in a rostral neuroendocrine subregion compared to aged females and females with accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) and in a caudal autonomic subregion compared to post‐AOF females. Late‐aged (18‐ to 24‐month‐old) females compared to early‐aged (12‐ to 14‐month‐old) females and AOF females had fewer AR‐labeled nuclei in neuroendrocrine and autonomic projecting subregions. These findings indicate that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear and extranuclear gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25092?af=R">Visual opsin expression and morphological characterization of retinal photoreceptors in the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis, Gray)</a></h4>

A multidisciplinary approach was applied to assign the expression of different visual opsin classes to specific photoreceptor subtypes in Geotria australis. Five discrete photoreceptor subtypes were identified in the retina, each containing one of five classes of visual opsin. This suggests that G. australis has the potential for complex color vision.







Abstract
Lampreys are extant members of the agnathan (jawless) vertebrates that diverged ~500 million years ago, during a critical stage of vertebrate evolution when image‐forming eyes first emerged. Among lamprey species assessed thus far, the retina of the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey, Geotria australis, is unique, in that it possesses morphologically distinct photoreceptors and expresses five visual photopigments. This study focused on determining the number of different photoreceptors present in the retina of G. australis and whether each cell type expresses a single opsin class. Five photoreceptor subtypes were identified based on ultrastructure and differential expression of one of each of the five different visual opsin classes (lws, sws1, sws2, rh1, and rh2) known to be expressed in the retina. This suggests, therefore, that the retina of G. australis possesses five spectrally and morphologically distinct photoreceptors, with the potential for complex color vision. Each photoreceptor subtype was shown to have a specific spatial distribution in the retina, which is potentially associated with changes in spectral radiance across different lines of sight. These results suggest that there have been strong selection pressures for G. australis to maintain broad spectral sensitivity for the brightly lit surface waters that this species inhabits during its marine phase. These findings provide important insights into the functional anatomy of the early vertebrate retina and the selection pressures that may have led to the evolution of complex color vision.

Respiratory motor activity can be modulated by higher brain inputs. We hypothesized that forebrain regions send descending inputs to the respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Our data imply that (a) volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the midbrain periaqueductal gray; (b) commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, whisking, swallowing) target the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, predominantly; and (c) limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream brainstem respiratory networks, including the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, and caudal raphé nuclei. We provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.







Abstract
Eupnea is generated by neural circuits located in the ponto‐medullary brainstem, but can be modulated by higher brain inputs which contribute to volitional control of breathing and the expression of orofacial behaviors, such as vocalization, sniffing, coughing, and swallowing. Surprisingly, the anatomical organization of descending inputs that connect the forebrain with the brainstem respiratory network remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that descending forebrain projections target multiple distributed respiratory control nuclei across the neuroaxis. To test our hypothesis, we made discrete unilateral microinjections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus (KFn), the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐BötC, or caudal midline raphé nuclei. We quantified the regional distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the forebrain 12–14 days postinjection. Overall, our data reveal that descending inputs from cortical areas predominantly target the PAG and KFn. Differential forebrain regions innervating the PAG (prefrontal, cingulate cortices, and lateral septum) and KFn (rhinal, piriform, and somatosensory cortices) imply that volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the PAG, while the KFn may receive commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g., sniffing, swallowing). Additionally, we observed that the limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream bulbar respiratory networks. Collectively, these data provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.

N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.







Abstract
Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50–100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.

Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. We found age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA, and CD36 protein differed by region, age, and sex and was primarily expressed intravascularly. These variations may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.

Abstract
The chemical synapse is the principal form of contact between neurons of the central nervous system. These synapses are typically configured as presynaptic axon terminations onto postsynaptic dendrites or somata, giving rise to axo‐dendritic and axo‐somatic synapses, respectively. Beyond these common synapse configurations are less‐studied, non‐canonical synapse types that are prevalent throughout the brain and significantly contribute to neural circuit function. Among these are the axo‐axonic synapses, which consist of an axon terminating on another axon or axon terminal. Here, we review evidence for axo‐axonic synapse contributions to neural signaling in the mammalian nervous system and survey functional neural circuit motifs enabled by these synapses. We also detail how recent advances in microscopy, transgenics, and biological sensors may be used to identify and functionally assay axo‐axonic synapses.

We accomplished visualization and reconstruction of noradrenergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB) by infection of adeno‐associated viruses into the locus coeruleus of dopamine beta hydroxylase‐Cre mice. An individual noradrenergic axon traveled while forming several branches and was distributed in multiple glomeruli that were located in different areas of the glomerular layer in the OB.







Abstract
Olfactory input is processed in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb (OB) and relayed to higher centers in the brain by projection neurons. Conversely, centrifugal inputs from other brain regions project to the OB. We have previously analyzed centrifugal inputs into the OB from several brain regions using single‐neuron labeling. In this study, we analyzed the centrifugal noradrenergic (NA) fibers derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), because their projection pathways and synaptic connections in the OB have not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the NA centrifugal projections by single‐neuron labeling and immunoelectron microscopy. Individual NA neurons labeled by viral infection were three‐dimensionally traced using Neurolucida software to visualize the projection pathway from the LC to the OB. Also, centrifugal NA fibers were visualized using an antibody for noradrenaline transporter (NET). NET immunoreactive (‐ir) fibers contained many varicosities and synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, electron tomography demonstrated that NET‐ir fibers formed asymmetrical synapses of varied morphology. Although these synapses were present at varicosities, the density of synapses was relatively low throughout the OB. The maximal density of synapses was found in the external plexiform layer; about 17% of all observed varicosities contained synapses. These results strongly suggest that NA‐containing fibers in the OB release NA from both varicosities and synapses to influence the activities of OB neurons. The present study provides a morphological basis for olfactory modulation by centrifugal NA fibers derived from the LC.

During brain development, synapses form and are refined through the accumulation of different proteins. Here we examined the dynamic distribution of Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) in the developing forebrain of zebrafish larvae with a focus on regions associated with social behavior. We show that Syt2a colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a protein important for behavior. Further, we found that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior, with an increase of Syt2a expression coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.







Abstract
As they form, synapses go through various stages of maturation and refinement. These steps are linked to significant changes in synaptic function, potentially resulting in emergence and maturation of behavioral outputs. Synaptotagmins are calcium‐sensing proteins of the synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery, and changes in Synaptotagmin proteins at synapses have significant effects on vesicle release and synaptic function. Here, we examined the distribution of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) during development of the zebrafish nervous system. Syt2a is widely distributed throughout the midbrain and hindbrain early during larval development but very weakly expressed in the forebrain. Later in development, Syt2a expression levels in the forebrain increase, particularly in regions associated with social behavior, and most intriguingly, around the time social behavior becomes apparent. We provide evidence that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior in the ventral forebrain and show that Syt2a is colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a biosynthetic enzyme in the dopamine pathway. Our results suggest a developmentally important role for Syt2a in maturing synapses in the forebrain, coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.

The Superficial Interneurons (SINs) of the zebrafish tectum comprise a diverse population. Here we demonstrate that despite their wide range of reported tuning properties and morphology, most SINs respond to light offset and possess large receptive fields. SINs were previously thought to be solely inhibitory, yet we report that a subset express glutamatergic markers. Finally, these cells are unlikely to be intrinsically photosensitive as removal of retinal input, eliminated nearly all light on and off responses in SINs.  (Image: Eva Laurell)







Abstract
The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, have been implicated in a range of visual functions, including size discrimination, directional selectivity, and looming‐evoked escape. This raises the question if SIN subpopulations, despite their morphological similarities and shared anatomical position in the retinotectal processing stream, carry out diverse, task‐specific functions in visual processing, or if they have simple tuning properties in common. Here we have further characterized the SINs through functional imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and neurotransmitter typing in two transgenic lines, the widely used Gal4s1156t and the recently reported LCRRH2‐RH2‐2:GFP. We found that about a third of the SINs strongly responded to changes in whole‐field light levels, with a strong preference for OFF over ON stimuli. Interestingly, individual SINs were selectively tuned to a diverse range of narrow luminance decrements. Overall responses to whole‐field luminance steps did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of its neurites. We ruled out the possibility that intrinsic photosensitivity of Gal4s1156t+ SINs contribute to the measured visual responses. We found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, a substantial minority express an excitatory neuronal marker, the vesicular glutamate transporter, expanding the possible roles of SIN function in the tectal circuitry. In conclusion, SINs represent a molecularly, morphologically, and functionally heterogeneous class of interneurons, with subpopulations that detect a range of specific visual features, to which we have now added narrow luminance decrements.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25158?af=R">Upregulation of eIF4E, but not other translation initiation factors, in dendritic spines during memory formation</a></h4>

Memory formation requires initiation of new protein synthesis as well as protein synthesis in dendrites, but it is unknown whether initiation can happen within dendritic spines. We combined immunolabeling with serial section 3D electron microscopy to examine the distribution of three initiation factors, eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α in dendritic spines of the lateral amygdala during formation of a Pavlovian conditioning memory. Top row: Electron micrographs showing labeled spines (arrows) with synapses (arrowheads). Bottom left: Segment of dendrite reconstructed from serial sections with synapses shown in red. Bottom right: The percentage of spines containing labeling for eIF4E was higher after training, but there were no differences for eIF4G1 or eIF2α labeling.







Abstract
Local translation can provide a rapid, spatially targeted supply of new proteins in distal dendrites to support synaptic changes that underlie learning. Learning and memory are especially sensitive to manipulations of translational control mechanisms, particularly those that target the initiation step, and translation initiation at synapses could be a means of maintaining synapse specificity during plasticity. Initiation predominantly occurs via recruitment of ribosomes to the 5’ mRNA cap by complexes of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G1 is a particularly important target of translational control pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E‐eIF4G1 binding impairs formation of memory for aversive Pavlovian conditioning as well as the accompanying increase in polyribosomes in the heads of dendritic spines in the lateral amygdala (LA). This is consistent with a role for initiation at synapses in memory formation, but whether eIFs are even present near synapses is unknown. To determine whether dendritic spines contain eIFs and whether eIF distribution is affected by learning, we combined immunolabeling with serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume reconstructions of LA dendrites after Pavlovian conditioning. Labeling for eIF4E, eIF4G1, and eIF2α – another key target of regulation – occurred in roughly half of dendritic spines, but learning effects were only found for eIF4E, which was upregulated in the heads of dendritic spines. Our results support the possibility of regulated translation initiation as a means of synapse‐specific protein targeting during learning and are consistent with the model of eIF4E availability as a central point of control.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Dysregulation of the oxidant-antioxidant system contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral stroke (CS). Epigenetic changes of redox homeostasis genes, such as glutamate-cysteine ligase (<em class="a-plus-plus">GCLM</em>), glutathione-S-transferase-P1 (<em class="a-plus-plus">GSTP1</em>), thioredoxin reductase 1 (<em class="a-plus-plus">TXNRD1</em>), and myeloperoxidase (<em class="a-plus-plus">MPO</em>), may be biomarkers of CS. In this study, we assessed the association of DNA methylation levels of these genes with CS and clinical features of CS. We quantitatively analyzed DNA methylation patterns in the promoter or regulatory regions of 4 genes (<em class="a-plus-plus">GCLM</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">GSTP1</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">TXNRD1</em>, and <em class="a-plus-plus">MPO</em>) in peripheral blood leukocytes of 59 patients with CS in the acute phase and in 83 relatively healthy individuals (controls) without cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.  We found that in both groups, the methylation level of CpG sites in genes <em class="a-plus-plus">TXNRD1</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">GSTP1</em> was ≤ 5%. Lower methylation levels were registered at a CpG site (chr1:94,374,293, GRCh37 [hg19]) in <em class="a-plus-plus">GCLM</em> in patients with ischemic stroke compared with the control group (9% [7%; 11.6%] (median and interquartile range) versus 14.7% [10.4%; 23%], respectively, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05). In the leukocytes of patients with CS, the methylation level of CpG sites in the analyzed region of <em class="a-plus-plus">MPO</em> (chr17:56,356,470, GRCh3 [hg19]) on average was significantly lower (23.5% [19.3%; 26.7%]) than that in the control group (35.6% [30.4%; 42.6%], <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05). We also found increased methylation of <em class="a-plus-plus">MPO</em> in smokers with CS (27.2% [23.5%; 31.1%]) compared with nonsmokers with CS (21.7% [18.1%; 24.8%]). Thus, hypomethylation of CpG sites in <em class="a-plus-plus">GCLM</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">MPO</em> in blood leukocytes is associated with CS in the acute phase.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Evidence for the influence of unaware signals on behaviour has been reported in both patient groups and healthy observers using the Redundant Signal Effect (RSE). The RSE refers to faster manual reaction times to the onset of multiple simultaneously presented target than those to a single stimulus. These findings are robust and apply to unimodal and multi-modal sensory inputs. A number of studies on neurologically impaired cases have demonstrated that RSE can be found even in the absence of conscious experience of the redundant signals. Here, we investigated behavioural changes associated with awareness in healthy observers by using Continuous Flash Suppression to render observers unaware of redundant targets. Across three experiments, we found an association between reaction times to the onset of a consciously perceived target and the reported level of visual awareness of the redundant target, with higher awareness being associated with faster reaction times. However, in the absence of any awareness of the redundant target, we found no evidence for speeded reaction times and even weak evidence for an inhibitory effect (slowing down of reaction times) on response to the seen target. These findings reveal marked differences between healthy observers and blindsight patients in how aware and unaware information from different locations is integrated in the RSE.</p>

Sensory systems dynamically optimize their processing properties in order to process a wide range of environmental and behavioral conditions. However, attempts to infer the function of these systems via modeling often treat system components as having static processing properties. This is particularly evident in the Drosophila motion detection circuit, where the core algorithm for motion detection is still debated, and where inputs to motion detecting neurons remain underdescribed. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we measured the state- and stimulus-dependent filtering properties of inputs to the OFF motion-detecting T5 cell in Drosophila. Simply summing these inputs within the framework of a connectomic-constrained model of the circuit demonstrates that changes in the shape of input temporal filters are sufficient to explain conflicting theories of T5 function. Therefore, with our measurements and our model, we reconcile motion computation with the anatomy of the circuit.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.16.440038v1?rss=1">Structural brain connectivity in children with developmental dyscalculia</a></h4>

Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder specific to arithmetic learning even with normal intelligence and age-appropriate education. Difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood. Underlying neurobiological mechanisms of DD, however, are poorly understood. This study aimed to identify possible structural connectivity alterations in DD. We evaluated 10 children with pure DD (11.3 {+/-} 0.7 years) and 16 typically developing (TD) peers (11.2 {+/-} 0.6 years) using diffusion tensor imaging. We first assessed white matter microstructure with tract-based spatial statistics. Then we used probabilistic tractography to evaluate tract lengths and probabilistic connectivity maps in specific regions. At whole brain level, we found no significant microstructural differences in white matter between children with DD and TD peers. Also, seed-based connectivity probabilities did not differ between groups. However, we did find significant differences in regions-of-interest tracts which had previously been related to math ability in children. The major findings of our study were reduced white matter coherence and shorter tract lengths of the left superior longitudinal/arcuate fasciculus and left anterior thalamic radiation in the DD group. Furthermore, lower white matter coherence and shorter pathways corresponded with the lower math performance as a result of the correlation analyses. These results from regional analyses indicate that learning, memory and language-related pathways in the left hemisphere might underlie DD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.16.439914v1?rss=1">Extended frontal networks for visual and auditory working memory</a></h4>

Working memory (WM) supports the persistent representation of transient sensory information. Visual and auditory stimuli place different demands on WM and recruit different brain networks. Separate auditory- and visual-biased WM networks extend into the frontal lobes, but several challenges confront attempts to parcellate human frontal cortex, including fine-grained organization and between-subject variability. Here, we use differential intrinsic functional connectivity from two visual-biased and two auditory-biased frontal structures to identify additional candidate sensory-biased regions in frontal cortex. We then examine direct contrasts of task fMRI during visual vs. auditory 2-back WM to validate those candidate regions. Three visual-biased and five auditory-biased regions are robustly activated bilaterally in the frontal lobes of individual subjects (N=14, 7 women). These regions exhibit a sensory preference during passive exposure to task stimuli, and that preference is stronger during WM. Hierarchical clustering analysis of intrinsic connectivity among novel and previously identified bilateral sensory-biased regions confirms that they functionally segregate into visual and auditory networks, even though the networks are anatomically interdigitated. We also observe that the fronto-temporal auditory WM network is highly selective and exhibits strong functional connectivity to structures serving non-WM functions, while the fronto-parietal visual WM network hierarchically merges into the multiple-demand cognitive system.

Real-world events are complex, featuring elements that may be unique to, or shared across, multiple situations. In the present study, we used fMRI to identify how different event components are represented in real-time and during memory retrieval. Twenty participants viewed and recalled eight videos depicting real-world events, combining people, contexts, and context types. Multi-voxel pattern similarity analyses revealed specific  person representations, persistent across contexts, in regions of an Anterior-Temporal Network. Conversely, we found specific  context representations, persistent across people, in regions of a Posterior-Medial Network. We also found schema-like generalization across contexts in medial prefrontal cortex, and episodic specificity in the hippocampus. Event patterns were reinstated during recall, and hippocampal reinstatement predicted the number of details retrieved. Finally, we observed distinct representational timescales across the hippocampus and cortical regions. These findings reveal mechanisms for scaffolding different aspects of lifelike event representations in cortico-hippocampal networks as experiences are observed and recalled.

A photograph of the brain of a mouse perfused with blue latex and clarified to visualize the entire vascular system. This mouse had received an injection of a viral vector targeting vascular endothelium with a mutation of the KRAS gene that was recently implicated in the genesis of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in humans. The tangles of blue dye seen in multiple locations in the brain represent AVMs. This method allows the detailed investigation of the development of AVMs. See Park et al., (pp. 926–941, this issue) for details.

Objective
Blood tests to monitor disease activity, attack severity, or treatment impact in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) have not been developed. This study investigated the relationship between serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) concentration and NMOSD activity and assessed the impact of inebilizumab treatment.


Methods
N‐MOmentum was a prospective, multicenter, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized clinical trial in adults with NMOSD. sGFAP levels were measured by single‐molecule arrays (SIMOA) in 1,260 serial and attack‐related samples from 215 N‐MOmentum participants (92% aquaporin 4‐immunoglobulin G‐seropositive) and in control samples (from healthy donors and patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis).


Results
At baseline, 62 participants (29%) exhibited high sGFAP concentrations (≥170 pg/ml; ≥2 standard deviations above healthy donor mean concentration) and were more likely to experience an adjudicated attack than participants with lower baseline concentrations (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.09 [1.6–6.1], p = 0.001). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) concentrations increased within 1 week of an attack (baseline: 168.4, IQR = 128.9–449.7 pg/ml; attack: 2,160.1, IQR = 302.7–9,455.0 pg/ml, p = 0.0015) and correlated with attack severity (median fold change from baseline [FC], minor attacks: 1.06, IQR = 0.9–7.4; major attacks: 34.32, IQR = 8.7–107.5, p = 0.023). This attack‐related increase in sGFAP occurred primarily in placebo‐treated participants (FC: 20.2, IQR = 4.4–98.3, p = 0.001) and was not observed in inebilizumab‐treated participants (FC: 1.1, IQR = 0.8–24.6, p &gt; 0.05). Five participants (28%) with elevated baseline sGFAP reported neurological symptoms leading to nonadjudicated attack assessments.


Interpretation
Serum GFAP may serve as a biomarker of NMOSD activity, attack risk, and treatment effects. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:895–910

Objective
Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) studies show that interictal ripples propagate across the brain of children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), and the onset of this propagation (ripple onset zone [ROZ]) estimates the epileptogenic zone. It is still unknown whether we can map this propagation noninvasively. The goal of this study is to map ripples (ripple zone [RZ]) and their propagation onset (ROZ) using high‐density EEG (HD‐EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and to estimate their prognostic value in pediatric epilepsy surgery.


Methods
We retrospectively analyzed simultaneous HD‐EEG and MEG data from 28 children with MRE who underwent icEEG and epilepsy surgery. Using electric and magnetic source imaging, we estimated virtual sensors (VSs) at brain locations that matched the icEEG implantation. We detected ripples on VSs, defined the virtual RZ and virtual ROZ, and estimated their distance from icEEG. We assessed the predictive value of resecting virtual RZ and virtual ROZ for postsurgical outcome. Interictal spike localization on HD‐EEG and MEG was also performed and compared with ripples.


Results
We mapped ripple propagation in all patients with HD‐EEG and in 27 (96%) patients with MEG. The distance from icEEG did not differ between HD‐EEG and MEG when mapping the RZ (26–27mm, p = 0.6) or ROZ (22–24mm, p = 0.4). Resecting the virtual ROZ, but not virtual RZ or the sources of spikes, was associated with good outcome for HD‐EEG (p = 0.016) and MEG (p = 0.047).


Interpretation
HD‐EEG and MEG can map interictal ripples and their propagation onset (virtual ROZ). Noninvasively mapping the ripple onset may augment epilepsy surgery planning and improve surgical outcome of children with MRE. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:911–925

Objective
Many multiple sclerosis (MS) genetic susceptibility variants have been identified, but understanding disease heterogeneity remains a key challenge. Relapses are a core feature of MS and a common primary outcome of clinical trials, with prevention of relapses benefiting patients immediately and potentially limiting long‐term disability accrual. We aim to identify genetic variation associated with relapse hazard in MS by analyzing the largest study population to date.


Methods
We performed a genomewide association study (GWAS) in a discovery cohort and investigated the genomewide significant variants in a replication cohort. Combining both cohorts, we captured a total of 2,231 relapses occurring before the start of any immunomodulatory treatment in 991 patients. For assessing time to relapse, we applied a survival analysis utilizing Cox proportional hazards models. We also investigated the association between MS genetic risk scores and relapse hazard and performed a gene ontology pathway analysis.


Results
The low‐frequency genetic variant rs11871306 within WNT9B reached genomewide significance in predicting relapse hazard and replicated (meta‐analysis hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.70–2.78, p = 2.07 × 10−10). A pathway analysis identified an association of the pathway “response to vitamin D” with relapse hazard (p = 4.33 × 10−6). The MS genetic risk scores, however, were not associated with relapse hazard.


Interpretation
Genetic factors underlying disease heterogeneity differ from variants associated with MS susceptibility. Our findings imply that genetic variation within the Wnt signaling and vitamin D pathways contributes to differences in relapse occurrence. The present study highlights these cross‐talking pathways as potential modulators of MS disease activity. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:884–894

Objective
The aim was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for electrographic seizures and other electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) undergoing clinically indicated continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring and to assess whether EEG findings are associated with outcomes.


Methods
We identified 197 patients with COVID‐19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes.


Results
Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre‐existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44–11.51], p &lt; 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03–0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36–0.49]).


Interpretation
This multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID‐19 undergoing clinically indicated cEEG and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:872–883

Objective
Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and neurological deficits in children and young adults, however, no pharmacological intervention is available to treat these patients. Although more than 95% of bAVMs are sporadic without family history, the pathogenesis of sporadic bAVMs is largely unknown, which may account for the lack of therapeutic options. KRAS mutations are frequently observed in cancer, and a recent unprecedented finding of these mutations in human sporadic bAVMs offers a new direction in the bAVM research. Using a novel adeno‐associated virus targeting brain endothelium (AAV‐BR1), the current study tested if endothelial KRASG12V mutation induces sporadic bAVMs in mice.


Methods
Five‐week‐old mice were systemically injected with either AAV‐BR1‐GFP or ‐KRASG12V. At 8 weeks after the AAV injection, bAVM formation and characteristics were addressed by histological and molecular analyses. The effect of MEK/ERK inhibition on KRASG12V‐induced bAVMs was determined by treatment of trametinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved MEK/ERK inhibitor.


Results
The viral‐mediated KRASG12V overexpression induced bAVMs, which were composed of a tangled nidus mirroring the distinctive morphology of human bAVMs. The bAVMs were accompanied by focal angiogenesis, intracerebral hemorrhages, altered vascular constituents, neuroinflammation, and impaired sensory/cognitive/motor functions. Finally, we confirmed that bAVM growth was inhibited by trametinib treatment.


Interpretation
Our innovative approach using AAV‐BR1 confirms that KRAS mutations promote bAVM development via the MEK/ERK pathway, and provides a novel preclinical mouse model of bAVMs which will be useful to develop a therapeutic strategy for patients with bAVM. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:926–941

Objective
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an unpredictable and devastating comorbidity of epilepsy that is believed to be due to cardiorespiratory failure immediately after generalized convulsive seizures.


Methods
We performed cardiorespiratory monitoring of seizure‐induced death in mice carrying either a p.Arg1872Trp or p.Asn1768Asp mutation in a single Scn8a allele—mutations identified from patients who died from SUDEP—and of seizure‐induced death in pentylenetetrazole‐treated wild‐type mice.


Results
The primary cause of seizure‐induced death for all mice was apnea, as (1) apnea began during a seizure and continued for tens of minutes until terminal asystole, and (2) death was prevented by mechanical ventilation. Fatal seizures always included a tonic phase that was coincident with apnea. This tonic phase apnea was not sufficient to produce death, as it also occurred during many nonfatal seizures; however, all seizures that were fatal had tonic phase apnea. We also made the novel observation that continuous tonic diaphragm contraction occurred during tonic phase apnea, which likely contributes to apnea by preventing exhalation, and this was only fatal when breathing did not resume after the tonic phase ended. Finally, recorded seizures from a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy with a previously undocumented SCN8A likely pathogenic variant (p.Leu257Val) revealed similarities to those of the mice, namely, an extended tonic phase that was accompanied by apnea.


Interpretation
We conclude that apnea coincident with the tonic phase of a seizure, and subsequent failure to resume breathing, are the determining events that cause seizure‐induced death in Scn8a mutant mice. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1023–1035

Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess early predictors of 9‐year disability in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis.


Methods
Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments of 123 pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis were obtained at disease onset and after 1 and 2 years. A 9‐year clinical follow‐up was also performed. Cox proportional hazard and multivariable regression models were used to assess independent predictors of time to first relapse and 9‐year outcomes.


Results
Time to first relapse was predicted by optic nerve lesions (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10, p = 0.02) and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (HR = 0.31, p = 0.005). Predictors of annualized relapse rate were: at baseline, presence of cerebellar (β = −0.15, p &lt; 0.001), cervical cord lesions (β = 0.16, p = 0.003), and high‐efficacy treatment exposure (β = −0.14, p = 0.01); considering also 1‐year variables, number of relapses (β = 0.14, p = 0.002), and the previous baseline predictors; considering 2‐year variables, time to first relapse (2‐year: β = −0.12, p = 0.01) entered, whereas high‐efficacy treatment exposure exited the model. Predictors of 9‐year disability worsening were: at baseline, presence of optic nerve lesions (odds ratio [OR] = 6.45, p = 0.01); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) changes (1‐year: OR = 26.05, p &lt; 0.001; 2‐year: OR = 16.38, p = 0.02), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions in 2 years (2‐year: OR = 4.91, p = 0.02). Predictors of higher 9‐year EDSS score were: at baseline, EDSS score (β = 0.58, p &lt; 0.001), presence of brainstem lesions (β = 0.31, p = 0.04), and number of cervical cord lesions (β = 0.22, p = 0.05); considering 1‐year and 2‐year variables, EDSS changes (1‐year: β = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001; 2‐year: β = 0.55, p &lt; 0.001), and ≥ 2 new T2‐lesions (1‐year: β = 0.28, p = 0.03; 2‐year: β = 0.35, p = 0.01).


Interpretation
A complete baseline MRI assessment and an accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first 2 years of disease contribute to predict 9‐year prognosis in pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1011–1022

Objective
This study was undertaken to describe a novel biomarker of germ cell tumor and associated paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS).


Methods
Archival sera from patients with germ cell tumor–associated PNS were evaluated. We identified a common autoantigen in a human testicular cancer cell line (TCam‐2) by Western blot and mass spectrometry. Its identity was confirmed by recombinant‐protein Western blot, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and cell‐based assay. Autoantibody specificity was confirmed by analyzing assorted control sera/cerebrospinal fluid.


Results
Leucine zipper 4 (LUZP4)–immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detected in 28 patients' sera, 26 of whom (93%) were men. The median age at neurological symptom onset was 45 years (range = 28–84). Median titer (ELISA) was 1:300 (1:50 to &gt;1:6,400, normal value &lt; 1:50). Coexistent kelchlike protein 11–IgG was identified in 18 cases (64%). The most common presenting phenotype was rhombencephalitis (17/28, 61%). Other presentations included limbic encephalitis (n = 5, 18%), seizures and/or encephalitis (n = 2, 7%), and motor neuronopathy/polyradiculopathy (n = 4, 14%). The most common malignancy among cancer‐evaluated PNS patients was seminoma (21/27, 78%). Nine of the 21 seminomas detected by whole‐body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan (43%) were extratesticular. Both female patients had ovarian teratoma. Regressed testicular germ cell tumors were found in 4 patients. Exposure of T‐cell–dendritic‐cell cocultures from chronic immunosuppression‐naïve LUZP4‐IgG–seropositive patients to recombinant LUZP4 protein evoked a marked increase in CD69 expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when compared to vehicle‐exposed and healthy control cultures.


Interpretation
LUZP4‐IgG represents a novel serological biomarker of PNS and has high predictive value for germ cell tumors. The demonstrated antigen‐specific T‐cell responses support a CD8+ T‐cell–mediated cytotoxic paraneoplastic and antitumor potential. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1001–1010

Objective
The present work was undertaken to study the genetic contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.


Methods
We studied in 96 monozygotic twin‐pairs relationships between amyloid‐beta (Aβ) aggregation as measured by the Aβ1–42/1–40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (beta‐secretase 1, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–38) and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes.


Results
Twenty‐seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 twin‐pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin‐pairs, Aβ production markers and total‐tau (t‐tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 0.73–0.86, all p &lt; 0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 181‐phosphorylated‐tau (p‐tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 0.50–0.64, all p &lt; 0.0001). Cross‐twin cross‐trait analysis showed that Aβ1–38 in one twin correlated with Aβ1–42/1–40 ratios, and t‐tau and p‐tau levels in their cotwins (r range = −0.28 to 0.58, all p &lt; .007). Within‐pair differences in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 0.49–0.61, all p &lt; 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:987–1000

Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body spectrum diseases (LBDs) are associated with a specific risk for clinical depression. In the present clinicopathological study with 73 patients with LBD, we observed that the substantia nigra pars compacta dopamine neuron density was markedly lower in patients who had comorbid depression antemortem than in nondepressed patients (1.52 vs 2.32 n/mm2, p = 0.004). There were no differences in cognition, motor disease severity, antiparkinsonian medications, or disease duration between groups.

Objective
The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains problematic, with current diagnostic criteria (revised El Escorial [rEEC] and Awaji) being complex and prone to error. Consequently, the diagnostic utility of the recently proposed Gold Coast criteria was determined in ALS.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed 506 patients (302 males, 204 females) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Gold Coast criteria to that of the Awaji and rEEC criteria (defined by the proportion of patients categorized as definite, probable, or possible ALS) in accordance with standards of reporting of diagnostic accuracy criteria.


Results
The sensitivity of Gold Coast criteria (92%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 88.7–94.6%) was comparable to that of Awaji (90.3%, 95% CI = 86.69–93.2%) and rEEC (88.6, 95% CI = 84.8–91.7%) criteria. Additionally, the Gold Coast criteria sensitivity was maintained across different subgroups, defined by site of onset, disease duration, and functional disability. In atypical ALS phenotypes, the Gold Coast criteria exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity.


Interpretation
The present study established the diagnostic utility of the Gold Coast criteria in ALS, with benefits evident in bulbar and limb onset disease patients, as well as atypical phenotypes. The Gold Coast criteria should be considered in clinical practice and therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:979–986

Objective
Dysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable clinical presentation and currently unpredictable progression. This variability and unpredictability presents difficulties for prognostication and clinical trial design. The Jain Clinical Outcomes Study of Dysferlinopathy aims to establish the validity of the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) scale and identify factors that influence the rate of disease progression using NSAD.


Methods
We collected a longitudinal series of functional assessments from 187 patients with dysferlinopathy over 3 years. Rasch analysis was used to develop the NSAD, a motor performance scale suitable for ambulant and nonambulant patients. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the impact of patient factors on outcome trajectories.


Results
The NSAD detected significant change in clinical progression over 1 year. The steepest functional decline occurred during the first 10 years after symptom onset, with more rapid decline noted in patients who developed symptoms at a younger age (p = 0.04). The most rapidly deteriorating group over the study was patients 3 to 8 years post symptom onset at baseline.


Interpretation
The NSAD is the first validated limb girdle specific scale of motor performance, suitable for use in clinical practice and clinical trials. Longitudinal analysis showed it may be possible to identify patient factors associated with greater functional decline both across the disease course and in the short‐term for clinical trial preparation. Through further work and validation in this cohort, we anticipate that a disease model incorporating functional performance will allow for more accurate prognosis for patients with dysferlinopathy.

Objective
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease, with the ε4 allele increasing risk in a dose‐dependent fashion. In addition to ApoE4 playing a crucial role in amyloid‐β deposition, recent evidence suggests that it also plays an important role in tau pathology and tau‐mediated neurodegeneration. It is not known, however, whether therapeutic reduction of ApoE4 would exert protective effects on tau‐mediated neurodegeneration.


Methods
Herein, we used antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against human APOE to reduce ApoE4 levels in the P301S/ApoE4 mouse model of tauopathy. We treated P301S/ApoE4 mice with ApoE or control ASOs via intracerebroventricular injection at 6 and 7.5 months of age and performed brain pathological assessments at 9 months of age.


Results
Our results indicate that treatment with ApoE ASOs reduced ApoE4 protein levels by ~50%, significantly protected against tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration, decreased neuroinflammation, and preserved synaptic density. These data were also corroborated by a significant reduction in levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein in plasma of ASO‐treated mice.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of interleukin (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, IL‐12, chemokine (C‐X‐C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL‐6, CXCL8, and active tumor growth factor β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system in COVID‐19 can appear early, as a parainfectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1041–1045

Cerebral palsy (CP) neurologic care and research efforts typically focus on children. However, most people with CP are adults. Adults with CP are at increased risk of new neurologic conditions, such as stroke and myelopathy, that require ongoing neurologic surveillance to distinguish them from baseline motor impairments. Neurologic factors could also contribute to the motor function decline, chronic pain, and chronic fatigue that are commonly experienced by adults with CP. Based on a systematic literature review, we suggest (1) guidelines for neurologic surveillance and neurologist referral and (2) clinical research questions regarding the evolving neurologic risks for adults with CP.

Limited data exists regarding the disease course of Huntington's Disease (HD) in children and young adults. Here, we evaluate the trajectory of various cognitive skill development as a function of cytosine‐adenine‐guanine (CAG) repeat length in children and adolescents that carry the mutation that causes HD. We discovered that the development of verbal skills seems to plateau earlier as CAG repeat length increases. These findings increase our understanding of the relationship between neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment and may have far‐reaching implications for future gene‐therapy treatment strategies.

Objective
Understanding how different parts of the immune system contribute to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease is a burning challenge with important therapeutic implications. We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types.


Methods
We used summary statistics from the most recent meta‐analysis of genomewide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types, as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease‐associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus.


Results
We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these 2 cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3.


Interpretation
Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor, and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:942–951

We surveyed neurologists who completed a global health experience as residents or fellows to assess the impact of the experience. A total of 100% (n = 72) would recommend the experience to others. Most reported improved clinical (86%) and examination (82%) skills. All gained an understanding of different health care systems, and 83% reported deeper commitment to underserved populations. A total of 41 participants (57%) reported more judicious use of resources upon return to the United States. Global health electives had a positive impact on neurology trainees. More attention to the host country perspective and predeparture training may help inform program structure and participant expectations in the future. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:851–855

<p>by Takumi Sase, Keiichi Kitajo</p>

Metastability in the brain is thought to be a mechanism involved in dynamic organization of cognitive and behavioral functions across multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, it is not clear how such organization is realized in underlying neural oscillations in a high-dimensional state space. It was shown that macroscopic oscillations often form phase-phase coupling (PPC) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) which result in synchronization and amplitude modulation, respectively, even without external stimuli. These oscillations can also make spontaneous transitions across synchronous states at rest. Using resting-state electroencephalographic signals and the autism-spectrum quotient scores acquired from healthy humans, we show experimental evidence that the PAC combined with PPC allows amplitude modulation to be transient, and that the metastable dynamics with this transient modulation is associated with autistic-like traits. In individuals with a longer attention span, such dynamics tended to show fewer transitions between states by forming delta-alpha PAC. We identified these states as two-dimensional metastable states that could share consistent patterns across individuals. Our findings suggest that the human brain dynamically organizes inter-individual differences in a hierarchy of macroscopic oscillations with multiple timescales by utilizing metastability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/d44_o2307G4" width="1" />

Transcript stability is associated with many biological processes, and the factors affecting mRNA stability have been extensively studied. However, little is known about the features related to human long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) stability. By inhibiting transcription and collecting samples in 10 time points, genome-wide RNA-seq studies was performed in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and RNA half-life datasets were constructed. The following observations were obtained. First, the half-life distributions of both lncRNAs and messanger RNAs (mRNAs) with one exon (lnc-human1 and m-human1) were significantly different from those of both lncRNAs and mRNAs with more than one exon (lnc-human2 and m-human2). Furthermore, some factors such as full-length transcript secondary structures played a contrary role in lnc-human1 and m-human2. Second, through the half-life comparisons of nucleus- and cytoplasm-specific and common lncRNAs and mRNAs, lncRNAs (mRNAs) in the nucleus were found to be less stable than those in the cytoplasm, which was derived from transcripts themselves rather than cellular location. Third, kmers-based protein−RNA or RNA−RNA interactions promoted lncRNA stability from lnc-human1 and decreased mRNA stability from m-human2 with high probability. Finally, through applying deep learning−based regression, a non-linear relationship was found to exist between the half-lives of lncRNAs (mRNAs) and related factors. The present study established lncRNA and mRNA half-life regulation networks in the A549 cell line and shed new light on the degradation behaviors of both lncRNAs and mRNAs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_x3OBdaRtTI" width="1" />

Long regulatory elements (LREs), such as CpG islands, polydA:dT tracts or AU-rich elements, are thought to play key roles in gene regulation but, as opposed to conventional binding sites of transcription factors, few methods have been proposed to formally and automatically characterize them. We present here a computational approach named DExTER (Domain Exploration To Explain gene Regulation) dedicated to the identification of candidate LREs (cLREs) and apply it to the analysis of the genomes of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> and other eukaryotes. Our analyses show that all tested genomes contain several cLREs that are somewhat conserved along evolution, and that gene expression can be predicted with surprising accuracy on the basis of these long regions only. Regulation by cLREs exhibits very different behaviours depending on species and conditions. In <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> and other Apicomplexan organisms as well as in <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, the process appears highly dynamic, with different cLREs involved at different phases of the life cycle. For multicellular organisms, the same cLREs are involved in all tissues, but a dynamic behavior is observed along embryonic development stages. In <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i>, whose genome is known to be strongly depleted of transcription factors, cLREs are predictive of expression with an accuracy above 70%, and our analyses show that they are associated with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation signals. Moreover, we assessed the biological relevance of one LRE discovered by DExTER in <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> using an <i>in vivo</i> reporter assay.

<p>by Vladislav Uzunangelov, Christopher K. Wong, Joshua M. Stuart</p>

Advancements in sequencing have led to the proliferation of multi-omic profiles of human cells under different conditions and perturbations. In addition, many databases have amassed information about pathways and gene “signatures”—patterns of gene expression associated with specific cellular and phenotypic contexts. An important current challenge in systems biology is to leverage such knowledge about gene coordination to maximize the predictive power and generalization of models applied to high-throughput datasets. However, few such integrative approaches exist that also provide interpretable results quantifying the importance of individual genes and pathways to model accuracy. We introduce AKLIMATE, a first kernel-based stacked learner that seamlessly incorporates multi-omics feature data with prior information in the form of pathways for either regression or classification tasks. AKLIMATE uses a novel multiple-kernel learning framework where individual kernels capture the prediction propensities recorded in random forests, each built from a specific pathway gene set that integrates all omics data for its member genes. AKLIMATE has comparable or improved performance relative to state-of-the-art methods on diverse phenotype learning tasks, including predicting microsatellite instability in endometrial and colorectal cancer, survival in breast cancer, and cell line response to gene knockdowns. We show how AKLIMATE is able to connect feature data across data platforms through their common pathways to identify examples of several known and novel contributors of cancer and synthetic lethality.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vLL7me8Kt6o" width="1" />

ParAB<i>S</i>, the most widespread bacterial DNA segregation system, is composed of a centromeric sequence, <i>parS</i>, and two proteins, the ParA ATPase and the ParB DNA binding proteins. Hundreds of ParB proteins assemble dynamically to form nucleoprotein <i>parS</i>-anchored complexes that serve as substrates for ParA molecules to catalyze positioning and segregation events. The exact nature of this ParB<i>S</i> complex has remained elusive, what we address here by revisiting the Stochastic Binding model (SBM) introduced to explain the non-specific binding profile of ParB in the vicinity of <i>parS</i>. In the SBM, DNA loops stochastically bring loci inside a sharp cluster of ParB. However, previous SBM versions did not include the negative supercoiling of bacterial DNA, leading to use unphysically small DNA persistences to explain the ParB binding profiles. In addition, recent super-resolution microscopy experiments have revealed a ParB cluster that is significantly smaller than previous estimations and suggest that it results from a liquid-liquid like phase separation. Here, by simulating the folding of long (≥ 30 kb) supercoiled DNA molecules calibrated with realistic DNA parameters and by considering different possibilities for the physics of the ParB cluster assembly, we show that the SBM can quantitatively explain the ChIP-seq ParB binding profiles without any fitting parameter, aside from the supercoiling density of DNA, which, remarkably, is in accord with independent measurements. We also predict that ParB assembly results from a non-equilibrium, stationary balance between an influx of produced proteins and an outflux of excess proteins, i.e., ParB clusters behave like liquid-like protein condensates with unconventional “leaky” boundaries.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O6fP88-FrSc" width="1" />

<p>by Diego Vidaurre</p>

An important question in neuroscience is whether or not we can interpret spontaneous variations in the pattern of correlation between brain areas, which we refer to as functional connectivity or FC, as an index of dynamic neuronal communication in fMRI. That is, can we measure time-varying FC reliably? And, if so, can FC reflect information transfer between brain regions at relatively fast-time scales? Answering these questions in practice requires dealing with the statistical challenge of having high-dimensional data and a comparatively lower number of time points or volumes. A common strategy is to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and then apply some model, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) or a mixture model of Gaussian distributions, to find a set of distinct FC patterns or states. The distinct spatial properties of these FC states together with the time-resolved switching between them offer a flexible description of time-varying FC. In this work, I show that in this context PCA can suffer from systematic biases and loss of sensitivity for the purposes of finding time-varying FC. To get around these issues, I propose a novel variety of the HMM, named HMM-PCA, where the states are themselves PCA decompositions. Since PCA is based on the data covariance, the state-specific PCA decompositions reflect distinct patterns of FC. I show, theoretically and empirically, that fusing dimensionality reduction and time-varying FC estimation in one single step can avoid these problems and outperform alternative approaches, facilitating the quantification of transient communication in the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zRfYbVrBeMo" width="1" />

Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system results from subpial hemosiderin deposition due to chronic low‐grade bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The confluent and marginal subpial hemosiderin is best appreciated on iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging sequences. With widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging, the disorder is increasingly being recognized, including in asymptomatic individuals. Gait ataxia, often with hearing impairment is a common clinical presentation. A clinical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage is generally not present. A macrovascular pathology is generally not causative. The most common etiology is dural disease, often dural tears. Prior or less commonly ongoing symptoms of craniospinal hypovolemia may be present. Common etiologies for dural tears include disc disease and trauma, including surgical trauma. Patients with dural tears due to herniated and calcified discs often have a ventral intraspinal fluid collection due to cerebrospinal fluid leak. A precise identification of the dural tear relies on multi‐modality imaging. It has been speculated that chronic bleeding from fragile blood vessels around the dural tear may be the likely underlying mechanism. Surgical correction of the bleeding source is a logical therapeutic strategy. Clinical outcomes are variable though neuroimaging evidence of successful dural tear repair is noted. The currently available data regarding use of deferiprone in patients with superficial siderosis is insufficient to recommend its routine use in patients.

<p>Recent enhancements in neuroscience, like the development of new and powerful
recording techniques of the brain activity combined with the increasing
anatomical knowledge provided by atlases and the growing understanding of
neuromodulation principles, allow studying the brain at a whole new level,
paving the way to the creation of extremely detailed effective network models
directly from observed data. Leveraging the advantages of this integrated
approach, we propose a method to infer models capable of reproducing the
complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the slow waves observed in the experimental
recordings of the cortical hemisphere of a mouse under anesthesia. To reliably
claim the good match between data and simulations, we implemented a versatile
ensemble of analysis tools, applicable to both experimental and simulated data
and capable to identify and quantify the spatio-temporal propagation of waves
across the cortex. In order to reproduce the observed slow wave dynamics, we
introduced an inference procedure composed of two steps: the inner and the
outer loop. In the inner loop, the parameters of a mean-field model are
optimized by likelihood maximization, exploiting the anatomical knowledge to
define connectivity priors. The outer loop explores "external" parameters,
seeking for an optimal match between the simulation outcome and the data,
relying on observables (speed, directions, and frequency of the waves) apt for
the characterization of cortical slow waves; the outer loop includes a periodic
neuro-modulation for better reproduction of the experimental recordings. We
show that our model is capable to reproduce most of the features of the
non-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network.
Also, the proposed method allows to infer which are the relevant modifications
of parameters when the brain state changes, e.g. according to anesthesia
levels.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07423">The Role of Context in Detecting Previously Fact-Checked Claims. (arXiv:2104.07423v1 [cs.CL])</a></h4>

<p>Recent years have seen the proliferation of disinformation and misinformation
online, thanks to the freedom of expression on the Internet and to the rise of
social media. Two solutions were proposed to address the problem: (i) manual
fact-checking, which is accurate and credible, but slow and non-scalable, and
(ii) automatic fact-checking, which is fast and scalable, but lacks
explainability and credibility. With the accumulation of enough manually
fact-checked claims, a middle-ground approach has emerged: checking whether a
given claim has previously been fact-checked. This can be made automatically,
and thus fast, while also offering credibility and explainability, thanks to
the human fact-checking and explanations in the associated fact-checking
article. This is a relatively new and understudied research direction, and here
we focus on claims made in a political debate, where context really matters.
Thus, we study the impact of modeling the context of the claim: both on the
source side, i.e., in the debate, as well as on the target side, i.e., in the
fact-checking explanation document. We do this by modeling the local context,
the global context, as well as by means of co-reference resolution, and
reasoning over the target text using Transformer-XH. The experimental results
show that each of these represents a valuable information source, but that
modeling the source-side context is more important, and can yield 10+ points of
absolute improvement.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07381">On the Assessment of Benchmark Suites for Algorithm Comparison. (arXiv:2104.07381v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Benchmark suites, i.e. a collection of benchmark functions, are widely used
in the comparison of black-box optimization algorithms. Over the years,
research has identified many desired qualities for benchmark suites, such as
diverse topology, different difficulties, scalability, representativeness of
real-world problems among others. However, while the topology characteristics
have been subjected to previous studies, there is no study that has
statistically evaluated the difficulty level of benchmark functions, how well
they discriminate optimization algorithms and how suitable is a benchmark suite
for algorithm comparison. In this paper, we propose the use of an item response
theory (IRT) model, the Bayesian two-parameter logistic model for multiple
attempts, to statistically evaluate these aspects with respect to the empirical
success rate of algorithms. With this model, we can assess the difficulty level
of each benchmark, how well they discriminate different algorithms, the ability
score of an algorithm, and how much information the benchmark suite adds in the
estimation of the ability scores. We demonstrate the use of this model in two
well-known benchmark suites, the Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) for
continuous optimization and the Pseudo Boolean Optimization (PBO) for discrete
optimization. We found that most benchmark functions of BBOB suite have high
difficulty levels (compared to the optimization algorithms) and low
discrimination. For the PBO, most functions have good discrimination parameters
but are often considered too easy. We discuss potential uses of IRT in
benchmarking, including its use to improve the design of benchmark suites, to
measure multiple aspects of the algorithms, and to design adaptive suites.

<p>Simulating and imitating the neuronal network of humans or mammals is a
popular topic that has been explored for many years in the fields of pattern
recognition and computer vision. Inspired by neuronal conduction
characteristics in the primary visual cortex of cats, pulse-coupled neural
networks (PCNNs) can exhibit synchronous oscillation behavior, which can
process digital images without training. However, according to the study of
single cells in the cat primary visual cortex, when a neuron is stimulated by
an external periodic signal, the interspike-interval (ISI) distributions
represent a multimodal distribution. This phenomenon cannot be explained by all
PCNN models. By analyzing the working mechanism of the PCNN, we present a novel
neuron model of the primary visual cortex consisting of a continuous-coupled
neural network (CCNN). Our model inherited the threshold exponential decay and
synchronous pulse oscillation property of the original PCNN model, and it can
exhibit chaotic behavior consistent with the testing results of cat primary
visual cortex neurons. Therefore, our CCNN model is closer to real visual
neural networks. For image segmentation tasks, the algorithm based on CCNN
model has better performance than the state-of-art of visual cortex neural
network model. The strength of our approach is that it helps neurophysiologists
further understand how the primary visual cortex works and can be used to
quantitatively predict the temporal-spatial behavior of real neural networks.
CCNN may also inspire engineers to create brain-inspired deep learning networks
for artificial intelligence purposes.

<p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promising results in restoring
motor function to individuals with spinal cord injury. These systems have
traditionally focused on the restoration of upper extremity function; however,
the lower extremities have received relatively little attention. Early
feasibility studies used noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs to
restore walking function to people with paraplegia. However, the limited
spatiotemporal resolution of EEG signals restricted the application of these
BCIs to elementary gait tasks, such as the initiation and termination of
walking. To restore more complex gait functions, BCIs must accurately decode
additional degrees of freedom from brain signals. In this study, we used
subdurally recorded electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals from able-bodied subjects
to design a decoder capable of predicting the walking state and step rate
information. We recorded ECoG signals from the motor cortices of two
individuals as they walked on a treadmill at different speeds. Our offline
analysis demonstrated that the state information could be decoded from &gt;16
minutes of ECoG data with an unprecedented accuracy of 99.8%. Additionally,
using a Bayesian filter approach, we achieved an average correlation
coefficient between the decoded and true step rates of 0.934. When combined,
these decoders may yield decoding accuracies sufficient to safely operate
present-day walking prostheses.

<p>Advances in experimental neuroscience have transformed our ability to explore
the structure and function of neural circuits. At the same time, advances in
machine learning have unleashed the remarkable computational power of
artificial neural networks (ANNs). While these two fields have different tools
and applications, they present a similar challenge: namely, understanding how
information is embedded and processed through high-dimensional representations
to solve complex tasks. One approach to addressing this challenge is to utilize
mathematical and computational tools to analyze the geometry of these
high-dimensional representations, i.e., neural population geometry. We review
examples of geometrical approaches providing insight into the function of
biological and artificial neural networks: representation untangling in
perception, a geometric theory of classification capacity, disentanglement and
abstraction in cognitive systems, topological representations underlying
cognitive maps, dynamic untangling in motor systems, and a dynamical approach
to cognition. Together, these findings illustrate an exciting trend at the
intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and geometry, in which neural
population geometry provides a useful population-level mechanistic descriptor
underlying task implementation. Importantly, geometric descriptions are
applicable across sensory modalities, brain regions, network architectures and
timescales. Thus, neural population geometry has the potential to unify our
understanding of structure and function in biological and artificial neural
networks, bridging the gap between single neurons, populations and behavior.

<p>Relating explicit psychological mechanisms and observable behaviours is a
central aim of psychological and behavioural science. We implemented the
principles of the Projective Consciousness Model into artificial agents
embodied as virtual humans, as a proof-of-concept for a methodological
framework aimed at simulating behaviours and assessing underlying psychological
parameters, in the context of experiments in virtual reality. We focus on
simulating the role of Theory of Mind (ToM) in the choice of strategic
behaviours of approach and avoidance to optimise the satisfaction of agents'
preferences. We designed an experiment in a virtual environment that could be
used with real humans, allowing us to classify behaviours as a function of
order of ToM, up to the second order. We show that our agents demonstrate
expected behaviours with consistent parameters of ToM in this experiment. We
also show that the agents can be used to estimate correctly each other order of
ToM. A similar approach could be used with real humans in virtual reality
experiments not only to enable human participants to interact with parametric,
virtual humans as stimuli, but also as a mean of inference to derive
model-based psychological assessments of the participants.

<p>The quality of generative models (such as Generative adversarial networks and
Variational Auto-Encoders) depends heavily on the choice of a good probability
distance. However some popular metrics like the Wasserstein or the Sliced
Wasserstein distances, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, the Kullback-Leibler
divergence, lack convenient properties such as (geodesic) convexity, fast
evaluation and so on. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a class of
distances that have built-in convexity. We investigate the relationship with
some known paradigms (sliced distances - a synonym for Radon distances -,
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, energy distances). The distances are shown
to possess fast implementations and are included in an adapted Variational
Auto-Encoder termed Radon Sobolev Variational Auto-Encoder (RS-VAE) which
produces high quality results on standard generative datasets.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The visuomotor processes involved in grasping a 2-D target are known to be fundamentally different than those involved in grasping a 3-D object, and this has led to concerns regarding the generalizability of 2-D grasping research. This study directly compared participants’ fixation positions and digit placement during interaction with either physical square objects or 2-D virtual versions of these objects. Participants were instructed to either simply grasp the stimulus or grasp and slide it to another location. Participants’ digit placement and fixation positions did not significantly differ as a function of stimulus type when grasping in the center of the display. However, gaze and grasp positions shifted toward the near side of non-central virtual stimuli, while consistently remaining close to the horizontal midline of the physical stimulus. Participants placed their digits at less stable locations when grasping the virtual stimulus in comparison to the physical stimulus on the right side of the display, but this difference disappeared when grasping in the center and on the left. Similar outward shifts in digit placement and lowered fixations were observed when sliding both stimulus types, suggesting participants incorporated similar adjustments in grasp selection in anticipation of manipulation in both Physical and Virtual stimulus conditions. These results suggest that while fixation position and grasp point selection differed between stimulus type as a function of stimulus position, certain eye-hand coordinated behaviours were maintained when grasping both physical and virtual stimuli.</p>

<p>Face recognition is an essential activity of social living, common to many primate species. Underlying processes in the brain have been investigated using various techniques and compared between species. Functional imaging studies have shown face-selective cortical regions and their degree of correspondence across species. However, the temporal dynamics of face processing, particularly processing speed, are likely different between them. Across sensory modalities activation of primary sensory cortices in macaque monkeys occurs at about 3/5 the latency of corresponding activation in humans, though this human simian difference may diminish or disappear in higher cortical regions. We recorded scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) to presentation of faces in macaques and estimated the peak latency of ERP components. Comparisons of latencies between macaques and humans indicated that the 3:5 ratio is preserved in higher cognitive regions of face processing between those species.</p>

<p>Two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging is a leading technique for recording neuronal activities in vivo with cellular or subcellular resolution. However, during experiments, the images often suffer from corruption due to complex noises. Therefore, the analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data requires preprocessing steps, such as denoising, to extract biologically relevant information. We present an approach that facilitates imaging data restoration through image denoising performed by a neural network combining spatiotemporal filtering and model blind learning. Tests with synthetic and real two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach enables efficient restoration of imaging data. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by evaluating the qualities of the denoising performance of the models quantitatively. Therefore, our method provides an invaluable tool for denoising two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data by model blind spatiotemporal processing.</p>

Background<p>An increase in blood brain barrier permeability commonly precedes neuro-inflammation and cognitive impairment in models of dementia. Common methods to estimate capillary permeability have potential confounders, or require laborious and subjective semi-manual analysis.</p>New method<p>Here we used snap frozen mouse and rat brain sections that were double-immunofluorescent labeled for immunoglobulin G (IgG; plasma protein) and laminin-α4 (capillary basement membrane). A Machine Learning Image Analysis program (Zeiss ZEN Intellisis) was trained to recognize and segment laminin-α4 to equivocally identify blood vessels in large sets of images. An IgG subclass based on a threshold intensity was segmented and quantitated only in extravascular regions. The residual parenchymal IgG fluorescence is indicative of blood-to-brain extravasation of IgG and was accurately quantitated.</p>Results<p>Automated machine-learning and threshold based segmentation of only parenchymal IgG extravasation accentuates otherwise indistinct capillary permeability, particularly frequent in minor BBB leakage. Comparison with Existing Methods: Large datasets can be processed and analyzed quickly and robustly to provide an overview of vascular permeability throughout the brain. All human bias or ambiguity involved in classifying and measuring leakage is removed.</p>Conclusion<p>Here we describe a fast and precise method of visualizing and quantitating BBB permeability in mouse and rat brain tissue, while avoiding the confounding influence of unphysiological conditions such as perfusion and eliminating any human related bias from analysis.</p>

<p>The central nervous system uses feedback processes that occur at multiple time scales to control interactions with the environment. The long-latency response (LLR) is the fastest process that directly involves cortical areas, with a motoneuron response measurable 50 ms following an imposed limb displacement. Several behavioral factors concerning perturbation mechanics and the active role of muscles prior or during the perturbation can modulate the long-latency response amplitude (LLRa) in the upper limbs, but the interactions among many of these factors had not been systematically studied before. We conducted a behavioral study on thirteen healthy individuals to determine the effect and interaction of four behavioral factors – background muscle torque, perturbation direction, perturbation velocity, and task instruction – on the LLRa evoked from the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscles after velocity-controlled wrist displacements. The effects of the four factors were quantified using both a 0D statistical analysis on the average perturbation-evoked EMG signal in the period corresponding to an LLR, and using a timeseries analysis of EMG signals. All factors significantly modulated LLRa, and their combination nonlinearly contributed to modulating the LLRa. Specifically, all the three-way interaction terms that could be computed without including the interaction between instruction and velocity significantly modulated the LLR. Analysis of the three-way interaction terms of the 0D model indicated that for the ECU muscle, the LLRa evoked when subjects are asked to maintain their muscle activation in response to the perturbations was greater than the one observed when subjects yielded to the perturbations (p &lt; 0.001), but this effect was not measured for muscles undergoing shortening or in absence of background muscle activation. Moreover, higher perturbation velocity increased the LLRa evoked from the stretched muscle in presence of a background torque (p &lt; 0.001), but no effects of velocity were measured in absence of background torque. Also, our analysis identified significant modulations of LLRa in muscles shortened by the perturbation, including an interaction between torque and velocity, and an effect of both torque and velocity. The time-series analysis indicated the significance of additional transient effects in the LLR region for muscles undergoing shortening.</p>

<p>Cross-sectional studies indicate that normal aging is accompanied by decreases in brain structure. Longitudinal studies, however, are relatively rare and inconsistent regarding their outcomes. Particularly the heterogeneity of methods, sample characteristics and the high inter-individual variability in older adults prevent the deduction of general trends. Therefore, the current study aimed to compare longitudinal age-related changes in brain structure (measured through cortical thickness) in two large independent samples of healthy older adults (n = 161 each); the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and 1000BRAINS at the Research Center Juelich, Germany. Annual percentage changes in the two samples revealed stable to slight decreases in cortical thickness over time. After correction for major covariates, i.e., baseline age, sex, education, and image quality, sample differences were only marginally present. Results suggest that general trends across time might be generalizable over independent samples, assuming the same methodology is used, and similar sample characteristics are present.</p>

<p>Purpose: We aimed to find out the distributed functional connectome of white matter in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD).</p><p>Methods: 20 patients with FD and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included into the study. The functional connectome of white matter and graph theory were used to these participants. Two-sample t-test was used for the detection the abnormal graph properties in FD. Pearson correlation was used for the relationship between properties and the clinical and neuropshychological information.</p><p>Results: Patients with FD and healthy controls showed small-world properties in functional connectome of white matter. Compared with healthy controls, the FD group showed decreased global properties (Cp, S, Eglobal, and Elocal). Four pairs of fiber bundles that are connected to the frontal lobe, insula, and thalamus were affected in the FD group. Duration and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index positively correlated with the betweenness centrality of white matter regions of interest.</p><p>Conclusion: FD patients turned to a non-optimized functional organization of WM brain network. Frontal lobe, insula, and thalamus were key regions in brain information exchange of FD. It provided some novel imaging evidences for the mechanism of FD.</p>

<p>Monocular deprivation (MD) of vision during early postnatal life induces amblyopia, and most neurons in the primary visual cortex lose their responses to the closed eye. Anatomically, the somata of neurons in the closed-eye recipient layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) shrink and their axons projecting to the visual cortex retract. Although it has been difficult to restore visual acuity after maturation, recent studies in rodents and cats showed that a period of exposure to complete darkness could promote recovery from amblyopia induced by prior MD. However, in cats, which have an organization of central visual pathways similar to humans, the effect of dark rearing only improves monocular vision and does not restore binocular depth perception. To determine whether dark rearing can completely restore the visual pathway, we examined its effect on the three major concomitants of MD in individual visual neurons, eye preference of visual cortical neurons and soma size and axon morphology of LGN neurons. Dark rearing improved the recovery of visual cortical responses to the closed eye compared with the recovery under binocular conditions. However, geniculocortical axons serving the closed eye remained retracted after dark rearing, whereas reopening the closed eye restored the soma size of LGN neurons. These results indicate that dark rearing incompletely restores the visual pathway, and thus exerts a limited restorative effect on visual function.</p>

<p>Visual information is conveyed from the eye to the brain through the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that course through the optic nerve and synapse onto neurons in multiple subcortical visual relay areas. RGCs cannot regenerate their axons once they are damaged, similar to most mature neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), and soon undergo cell death. These phenomena of neurodegeneration and regenerative failure are widely viewed as being determined by cell-intrinsic mechanisms within RGCs or to be influenced by the extracellular environment, including glial or inflammatory cells. However, a new concept is emerging that the death or survival of RGCs and their ability to regenerate axons are also influenced by the complex circuitry of the retina and that the activation of a multicellular signaling cascade involving changes in inhibitory interneurons – the amacrine cells (AC) – contributes to the fate of RGCs. Here, we review our current understanding of the role that interneurons play in cell survival and axon regeneration after optic nerve injury.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that places a heavy burden on patients and society. Hippocampal neuronal loss is a hallmark of AD progression. Therefore, understanding the mechanism underlying hippocampal neuronal death would be of great importance for the diagnosis and treatment of AD. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism via which nuclear factor kappa β (NF-κB) promotes hippocampal neuronal oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD. We collected serum samples from 101 healthy elderly people and 112 patients with AD at the Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology between January 2017 and January 2020. Commercially available human hippocampal neurons (HHNs) were used to establish an AD model (AD-HHN) following Aβ25–35 treatment. The mRNA expression levels of NF-κB and pyroptosis markers [NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1β, and interleukin-18] mRNA and the expression level of miR-146a-5p in the serum samples of patients with AD and AD-HHNs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Oxidative stress indices (reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase) were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The expression of proteins [NF-κB, TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), and pyroptosis markers] was tested by western blotting. The relationship between miR-146a-5p and TIGAR was investigated using a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. We found that NF-κB and miR-146a-5p were highly expressed, while TIGAR was low expressed in patients with AD and AD-HHNs. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of NF-κB and miR-146a-5p, but a negative correlation between NF-κB mRNA and TIGAR mRNA in patients with AD, as well as miR-146a-5p and TIGAR mRNA in patients with AD. In AD-HNNs, miR-146a-5p targeted and downregulated the expression of TIGAR. Knockdown of NF-κB or overexpression of TIGAR markedly attenuated oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD-HHNs, while concurrent overexpression of miR-146a-5p inhibited these effects. In conclusion, NF-κB-induced upregulation of miR-146a-5p promoted oxidative stress and pyroptosis in AD-HNNs by targeting TIGAR.</p>

<p>The Vagal Trigone, often referred to as Ala Cinerea, is a triangular-shaped area of the floor of the fourth ventricle that is strictly involved in the network of chardiochronotropic, baroceptive, respiratory, and gastrointestinal control systems of the medulla oblongata. While it is frequently identified as the superficial landmark for the underlying Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, this correspondence is not univocal in anatomical literature and is often oversimplified in neuroanatomy textbooks and neurosurgical atlases. As the structure represents an important landmark for neurosurgical procedures involving the floor of the fourth ventricle, accurate morphological characterization is required to avoid unwanted side effects (e.g., bradychardia, hypertension) during neuorphysiological monitoring and cranial nerve nuclei stimulation in intraoperative settings. The aim of this study was to address the anatomo-topographical relationships of the Vagal Trigone with the underlying nuclei. For this purpose, we have conducted an anatomo-microscopical examination of serial sections deriving from 54 Human Brainstems followed by 3D reconstruction and rendering of the specimens. Our findings indicate that the Vagal Trigone corresponds only partially with the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus, while most of its axial profile is occupied by the dorsal regions of the Solitary Tract Nucleus. Furthermore, basing on literature and our findings we speculate that the neuroblasts of the Dorsal Motor Nucleus of the Vagus undergo neurobiotaxic migration induced by the neuroblasts of the dorsolaterally located solitary tract nucleus, giving rise to the Ala Cinerea, a topographically defined area for parasympathetic visceral control.</p>

<p>Exercise has multiple beneficial effects on health including decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Such effects are thought to be mediated (at least in part) by myokines, a collection of cytokines and other small proteins released from skeletal muscles. As an endocrine organ, skeletal muscle synthesizes and secretes a wide range of myokines which contribute to different functions in different organs, including the brain. One such myokine is the recently discovered protein Irisin, which is secreted into circulation from skeletal muscle during exercise from its membrane bound precursor Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5). Irisin contributes to metabolic processes such as glucose homeostasis and browning of white adipose tissue. Irisin also crosses the blood brain barrier and initiates a neuroprotective genetic program in the hippocampus that culminates with increased expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, exercise and FNDC5/Irisin have been shown to have several neuroprotective effects against injuries in ischemia and neurodegenerative disease models, including Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, Irisin has anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. In this review we present and summarize recent findings on the multiple effects of Irisin on neural function, including signaling pathways and mechanisms involved. We also discuss how exercise can positively influence brain function and mental health via the “skeletal muscle-brain axis.” While there are still many unanswered questions, we put forward the idea that Irisin is a potentially essential mediator of the skeletal muscle-brain crosstalk.</p>

<p>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction increases mortality and morbidity in perioperative patients and has become a major concern for patients and caregivers. Previous studies demonstrated that synaptic plasticity is closely related to cognitive function, anesthesia and surgery inhibit synaptic function. In central nervous system, autophagy is vital to synaptic plasticity, homeostasis of synapticproteins, synapse elimination, spine pruning, proper axon guidance, and when dysregulated, is associated with behavioral and memory functions disorders. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) negatively regulates the process of autophagy. This study aimed to explore whether rapamycin can ameliorate anesthesia/surgery-induced cognitive deficits by inhibiting mTOR, activating autophagy and rising synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus. Aged C57BL/6J mice were used to establish POCD models with exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) was used to measure reference memory after anesthesia and surgery. The levels of mTOR phosphorylation (p-mTOR), Beclin-1 and LC3-II were examined on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7 by western blotting. The levels of synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus were also examined by western blotting. Here we showed that anesthesia/surgery impaired reference memory and induced the activation of mTOR, decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins such as Beclin-1 and LC3-II. A corresponding decline in the expression of neuronal/synaptic, plasticity-related proteins such as SYN and PSD-95 was also observed. Pretreating mice with rapamycin inhibited the activation of mTOR and restored autophagy function, also increased the expression of SYN and PSD-95. Furthermore, anesthesia/surgery-induced learning and memory deficits were also reversed by rapamycin pretreatment. In conclusion, anesthesia/surgery induced mTOR hyperactivation and autophagy impairments, and then reduced the levels of SYN and PSD-95 in the hippocampus. An mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, ameliorated anesthesia/surgery-related cognitive impairments by inhibiting the mTOR activity, inducing activation of autophagy, enhancing SYN and PSD-95 expression.</p>

The essential Smc5/6 complex is required in response to replication stress and is best known for ensuring the fidelity of homologous recombination. Using single-molecule tracking in live fission yeast to investigate Smc5/6 chromatin association, we show that Smc5/6 is chromatin associated in unchallenged cells and this depends on the non-SMC protein Nse6. We define a minimum of two Nse6-dependent sub-pathways, one of which requires the BRCT-domain protein Brc1. Using defined mutants in genes encoding the core Smc5/6 complex subunits we show that the Nse3 double-stranded DNA binding activity and the arginine fingers of the two Smc5/6 ATPase binding sites are critical for chromatin association. Interestingly, disrupting the ssDNA binding activity at the hinge region does not prevent chromatin association but leads to elevated levels of gross chromosomal rearrangements during replication restart. This is consistent with a downstream function for ssDNA binding in regulating homologous recombination.

Remembering the temporal order of a sequence of events is a task easily performed by humans in everyday life, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unclear. This problem is particularly intriguing as human behavior often proceeds on a time scale of seconds, which is in stark contrast to the much faster millisecond time-scale of neuronal processing in our brains. One long-held hypothesis in sequence learning suggests that a particular temporal fine-structure of neuronal activity - termed 'phase precession' - enables the compression of slow behavioral sequences down to the fast time scale of the induction of synaptic plasticity. Using mathematical analysis and computer simulations, we find that - for short enough synaptic learning windows - phase precession can improve temporal-order learning tremendously and that the asymmetric part of the synaptic learning window is essential for temporal-order learning. To test these predictions, we suggest experiments that selectively alter phase precession or the learning window and evaluate memory of temporal order.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64714">Rapid recycling of glutamate transporters on the astroglial surface</a></h4>

Glutamate uptake by astroglial transporters confines excitatory transmission to the synaptic cleft. The efficiency of this mechanism depends on the transporter dynamics in the astrocyte membrane, which remains poorly understood. Here, we visualise the main glial glutamate transporter GLT1 by generating its pH-sensitive fluorescent analogue, GLT1-SEP. FRAP-based imaging shows that 70-75% of GLT1-SEP dwell on the surface of rat brain astroglia, recycling with a lifetime of ~22 s. Genetic deletion of the C-terminus accelerates GLT1-SEP membrane turnover while disrupting its surface pattern, as revealed by single-molecule localisation microscopy. Excitatory activity boosts surface mobility of GLT1-SEP, involving its C-terminus, metabotropic glutamate receptors, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calcineurin-phosphatase activity, but not the broad-range kinase activity. The results suggest that membrane turnover, rather than lateral diffusion, is the main 'redeployment' route for the immobile fraction (20-30%) of surface-expressed GLT1. This finding reveals an important mechanism helping to control extrasynaptic escape of glutamate.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61973">Improving oligo-conjugated antibody signal in multimodal single-cell analysis</a></h4>

Simultaneous measurement of surface proteins and gene expression within single cells using oligo-conjugated antibodies offers high-resolution snapshots of complex cell populations. Signal from oligo-conjugated antibodies is quantified by high-throughput sequencing and is highly scalable and sensitive. We investigated the response of oligo-conjugated antibodies towards four variables: concentration, staining volume, cell number at staining, and tissue. We find that staining with recommended antibody concentrations causes unnecessarily high background and amount of antibody used can be drastically reduced without loss of biological information. Reducing staining volume only affects antibodies targeting abundant epitopes used at low concentrations and is counteracted by reducing cell numbers. Adjusting concentrations increases signal, lowers background, and reduces costs. Background signal can account for a major fraction of total sequencing and is primarily derived from antibodies used at high concentrations. This study provides new insight into titration response and background of oligo-conjugated antibodies and offers concrete guidelines to improve such panels.

KASH proteins in the outer nuclear membrane comprise the cytoplasmic half of LINC complexes that connect nuclei to the cytoskeleton. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ANC-1, an ortholog of Nesprin-1/2, contains actin-binding and KASH domains at opposite ends of a long spectrin-like region. Deletion of either the KASH or calponin homology (CH) domains does not completely disrupt nuclear positioning, suggesting neither KASH nor CH domains are essential. Deletions in the spectrin-like region of ANC-1 led to significant defects, but only recapitulated the null phenotype in combination with mutations in the trans-membrane span. In <i>anc-1</i> mutants, the ER, mitochondria, and lipid droplets were unanchored, moving throughout the cytoplasm. The data presented here support a cytoplasmic integrity model where ANC-1 localizes to the ER membrane and extends into the cytoplasm to position nuclei, ER, mitochondria, and likely other organelles in place.

Ribozyme switches are a class of RNA-encoded genetic switch that support conditional regulation of gene expression across diverse organisms. An improved elucidation of the relationships between sequence, structure, and activity can improve our capacity for <i>de novo</i> rational design of ribozyme switches. Here, we generated data on the activity of hundreds of thousands of ribozyme sequences. Using automated structural analysis and machine learning, we leveraged these large datasets to develop predictive models that estimate the <i>in vivo</i> gene-regulatory activity of a ribozyme sequence. These models supported the <i>de novo</i> design of ribozyme libraries with low mean basal gene-regulatory activities and new ribozyme switches that exhibit changes in gene-regulatory activity in the presence of a target ligand, producing functional switches for four out of five aptamers. Our work examines how biases in the model and the dataset that affect prediction accuracy can arise and demonstrates that machine learning can be applied to RNA sequences to predict gene-regulatory activity, providing the basis for design tools for functional RNAs.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to orchestrate cognitive dynamics. However, in tests of bistable visual perception, no direct evidence supporting such presumable causal roles of the PFC has been reported. Here, using a novel brain-state-dependent neural stimulation system, we found that three PFC regions--right frontal eye fields and anterior/posterior dorsolateral PFCs (a/pDLPFCs)--have causal effects on perceptual dynamics but the behavioural effects are detectable only when we modulated the PFC activity in brain-state-/state-history-dependent manners. Also, we revealed that the brain-dynamics-dependent behavioural causality is underpinned by transient changes in the brain state dynamics, and such neural changes are determined by structural transformations of hypothetical energy landscapes. Moreover, we identified different functions of the three PFC areas: in particular, we found that aDLPFC enhances the integration of the two PFC-active brain states, whereas pDLPFC promotes the diversity between them. This work resolves the controversy over the PFC roles in spontaneous perceptual switching and underlines brain state dynamics in fine investigations of brain-behaviour causality.

Impact statementPrefrontal causal roles are changing during bistable visual perception, which was determined by large-scale brain state dynamics and attributable to hypothetical energy landscapes that underpin the brain state dynamics.

Alterations in the function of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is largely associated with the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating disease of the human motor system that leads to motoneurons degeneration and reduced life expectancy by molecular mechanisms not well known. Regarding to that, we found that the expression levels of the glutamic acid decarboxylase enzyme (GAD1), responsible to convert glutamate to {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), were downregulated in TBPH-null flies and motoneurons derived from ALS patients carrying mutations in TDP-43 suggesting that defects in the regulation of GAD1 may lead to neurodegeneration by affecting neurotransmitter balance. In this study, we observed that TBPH was required to regulate GAD1 pre-mRNA splicing and GABA levels in Drosophila brains. Interestingly, we discovered that pharmacological treatments aimed to modulate GABA neurotransmission were able to revert locomotion deficiencies in TBPH-minus flies revealing novel mechanisms and therapeutic strategies in ALS.

Observers can learn the locations where salient distractors appear frequently to reduce potential interference - an effect attributed to better suppression of distractors at frequent locations. But how distractor suppression is implemented in the visual cortex and frontoparietal attention networks remains unclear. We used fMRI and a regional distractor-location learning paradigm (Sauter et al. 2018, 2020) with two types of distractors defined in either the same (orientation) or a different (colour) dimension to the target to investigate this issue. fMRI results showed that BOLD signals in early visual cortex were significantly reduced for distractors (as well as targets) occurring at the frequent versus rare locations, mirroring behavioural patterns. This reduction was more robust with same-dimension distractors. Crucially, behavioural interference was correlated with distractor-evoked visual activity only for same- (but not different-) dimension distractors. Moreover, with different- (but not same-) dimension distractors, a colour-processing area within the fusiform gyrus was activated more when a colour distractor was present versus absent and with a distractor occurring at a rare versus frequent location. These results support statistical learning of frequent distractor locations involving regional suppression in the early visual cortex and point to differential neural mechanisms of distractor handling with different-versus same-dimension distractors.

In stem cell research, DNA-binding dyes offer the ability to purify live stem cells using flow cytometry as they form a low-fluorescence side population due to the activity of ABC transporters. Adult neural stem cells exist within the lateral ventricle and dentate gyrus of the adult brain yet the ability of DNA-binding dyes to identify these adult stem cells as side populations remain untested. The following experiments utilize the efflux of a DNA-binding dye, Vyrbant DyeCycle Violet (DCV), to isolate bona fide side populations in the adult mouse dentate gyrus and SVZ and test their sensitivity to ABC transporter inhibitors. A distinct side population was found in both the adult lateral ventricle and dentate gyrus using DCV fluorescence and forward scatter instead of the conventional dual fluorescence approach. These side populations responded strongly to inhibition with the ABC transporter antagonists, verapamil and fumitremorgin C. The cells in the side population were identified as cerebrovascular endothelial cells characterized by their expression of CD31. These findings, therefore, suggest that the side population analysis provides an efficient method to purify endothelial cells, but not adult neural stem cells.

The Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the major allelic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD). APOE4 associates with a pro-inflammatory phenotype increasingly considered as critical in AD initiation and progression. Yet, the mechanisms driving an APOE4-dependent neuroinflammation remain unelucidated. Leveraging patient specific human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) we demonstrate inflammatory chronicity and hyperactivated responses upon cytokines in human APOE4 astrocytes via a novel mechanism. We uncovered that APOE4 represses Transgelin 3 (TAGLN3), a new interacting partner of I{kappa}B, thus increasing the NF-kB activity. The transcriptional repression of TAGLN3 was shown to result from an APOE4-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The functional relevance of TAGLN3 was demonstrated by the attenuation of APOE4-driven neuroinflammation after TAGLN3 supplementation. Importantly, TAGLN3 downregulation was confirmed in the brain of AD patients. Our findings highlight the APOE4-TAGLN3 axis as a new pathogenic pathway that paves the way for the development of therapeutics to prevent maladaptive inflammatory responses in APOE4 carriers, while placing TAGLN3 downregulation as a potential biomarker of AD.

In response to injury, neurons activate a program of organized axon self-destruction initiated by the NAD+ hydrolase SARM1. In healthy neurons SARM1 is autoinhibited, but single amino acid changes can abolish autoinhibition leading to constitutively-active SARM1 enzymes that promote degeneration when expressed in cultured neurons. To investigate whether naturally-occurring human variants might similarly disrupt SARM1 autoinhibition and potentially contribute to risk for neurodegenerative disease, we assayed the enzymatic activity of 29 rare SARM1 alleles identified among 8,507 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Ten missense variants or small in-frame deletions exhibit constitutive NADase activity, including more than half of those that are unique to the ALS patients or that occur in multiple patients. Expression of these constitutively active ALS-associated SARM1 alleles in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is pro-degenerative and cytotoxic. Intrathecal injection of an AAV expressing the common SARM1 reference allele is innocuous to mice, but a construct harboring SARM1V184G, the constitutively active variant found most frequently in the ALS patients, causes axon loss, motor dysfunction, and sustained neuroinflammation. These results implicate rare hypermorphic SARM1 alleles as candidate genetic risk factors for ALS and other neurodegenerative conditions.

EEG has been central to investigations of the time course of various neural functions underpinning visual word recognition. Recently the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm has been increasingly adopted for word recognition studies due to its high signal-to-noise ratio. Such studies, however, have been typically framed around a single source in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT). Here, we combine SSVEP recorded from 16 adult native English speakers with a data-driven spatial filtering approach--Reliable Components Analysis (RCA)--to elucidate distinct functional sources with overlapping yet separable time courses and topographies that emerge when contrasting words with pseudofont visual controls. The first component topography was maximal over left vOT regions with an early latency (approximately 180 msec). A second component was maximal over more dorsal parietal regions with a longer latency (approximately 260 msec). Both components consistently emerged across a range of parameter manipulations including changes in the spatial overlap between successive stimuli, and changes in both base and deviation frequency. We then contrasted word-in-nonword and word-in-pseudoword to test the hierarchical processing mechanisms underlying visual word recognition. Results suggest that these hierarchical contrasts fail to evoke a unitary component that might be reasonably associated with lexical access.

Natural vision involves the activation of a wide range of higher-level regions processing objects, motion, faces and actions. Here, we pursue a data-driven approach to explore how higher-level visual processes relate to the underlying structural and functional connectivity. Using a free-viewing paradigm in four awake rhesus macaque monkeys, we investigate how different visual scenes change functional connectivity. Additionally, we explore how such functional connectivity, as measured through fMRI, is related to the structural connectivity, as measured through diffusion weighted imaging. At first, we evaluate the consistency of the elicited free-viewing pattern using standard analytical techniques. We also evaluate the underlying structural connectivity via diffusion data by tracking white matter bundle projections from the visual cortex. We then reconstruct free-viewing and structural networks and quantify their properties. Centrality measures over the entire fMRI time-series revealed a consistent functional network engaged during free-viewing that included widespread hub regions across frontal (FEF, 46v), parietal (LIP, Tpt), and occipitotemporal cortex (MT, V4 and TE) among others. Interestingly, a small number of highly-weighted and long-length inter-hemispheric connections indicated the presence of long-range integrative properties during free-viewing. We hypothesized that during free-viewing, networks had the capacity to change their local and distal connections depending on the on-going changes in visual scenes. To capture these network dynamics, we depart from the static modular architecture of the structural networks and demonstrate that hubs in free-viewing networks reorganize according to the presence of objects, motion, and faces in the movie scenes indicating poly-functional properties. Lastly, we compare each NHP subject network and observe high consistency between individuals across the same network type with closer correspondence between structural networks (e.g., diffusion based and those partially assembled from tract-tracing). In summary, our network analyses revealed ongoing changes in large-scale functional organization present during free-viewing in the macaque monkey and highlight the advantages of multi-contrast imaging in awake monkeys for investigating dynamical processes in visual cognition. To further promote the use of naturalistic free-viewing paradigms and increase the development of macaque neuroimaging resources, we share our datasets in the PRIME-DE consortium.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been proven to improve mental health and quality of life. This study examined how mindfulness training and various types of mindfulness practices altered brain activity. Specifically, the spectral powers of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) of the MBSR group who underwent an 8-week mindfulness training--including mindful breathing and body-scan--were evaluated and compared with those of the waitlist controls. Empirical results indicated that the long-term mindfulness intervention effect significantly elevated the resting-state beta powers and reduced resting-state delta powers in both practices; such changes were not observed in the waitlist control. Compared with mindful breathing, body-scanning resulted in an overall decline in EEG spectral powers at both delta and gamma bands among trained participants. Together with our preliminary data of expert mediators, the aforementioned spectral changes were salient after intervention, but mitigated along with expertise. Additionally, after receiving training, the MBSR groups mindfulness and emotion regulation levels improved significantly, which were correlated with the EEG spectral changes in the theta, alpha, and low-beta bands. This study elaborated the neurophysiological correlates of mindfulness practices, suggesting that MBSR might function as a unique internal processing that involves increased vigilant capability and induces alterations similar to other cognitive training.

Three-dimensional cell technologies as pre-clinical models are emerging tools for mimicking the structural and functional complexity of the nervous system. The accurate exploration of phenotypes in engineered 3D neuronal cultures, however, demands morphological, molecular and especially functional measurements. Particularly crucial is measurement of electrical activity of individual neurons with millisecond resolution. Current techniques rely on customized electrophysiological recording set-ups, characterized by limited throughput and poor integration with other readout modalities. Here we describe a novel approach, using multiwell glass microfluidic microelectrode arrays, allowing non-invasive electrical recording from engineered 3D neural tissues. We demonstrate parallelized studies with reference compounds, calcium imaging and optogenetic stimulation. Additionally, we show how microplate compatibility allows automated handling and high-content analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. This microphysiological platform opens up new avenues for high-throughput studies on the functional, morphological and molecular details of neurological diseases and their potential treatment by therapeutic compounds.

Detecting neuro-degenerative disorders in early-stage and asymptomatic patients is challenging. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) has shown great success in generating biomarkers for cellular organization at the microscale level using complex biophysical models, but there has never been a consensus on a clinically usable standard model. Here, we propose a new framework (MVD-Fuse) to integrate measures of diverse diffusion models to detect alterations of white matter microstructure. The spatial maps generated by each measure are considered as a different diffusion representation (view), the fusion of these views being used to detect differences between clinically distinct groups. We investigate three different strategies for performing intermediate fusion: neural networks (NN), multiple kernel learning (MKL) and multi-view boosting (MVB). As a proof of concept, we applied MVD-Fuse to a classification of premanifest Huntingtons disease (pre-HD) individuals and healthy controls in the TRACK-ON cohort. Our results indicate that the MVD-Fuse boosts predictive power, especially with MKL (0.90 AUC vs 0.85 with the best single diffusion measure). Overall, our results suggest that an improved characterization of pathological brain microstructure can be obtained by combining various measures from multiple diffusion models.

Parkinsons disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by gait dysfunction in later stages of the disease. PD hallmarks include a decrease in stride length, run speed, and swing time; an increase in stride time, stance time, and base of support; dopaminergic degeneration in the basal ganglia; and cholinergic degeneration in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). A progressive animal model of PD is needed to identify treatments for gait dysfunction. The goal of this study was to quantify progressive gait degeneration in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 knockout (P1KO) rats and investigate neurodegeneration as potential underlying mechanisms. Gait analysis was performed in male P1KO and wild-type rats at 5 and 8 months of age and immunohistochemical analysis at 8 months. Multiple parameters of volitional gait were measured using a runway system. P1KO rats exhibited significant gait deficits at 5 months, but not 8 months. Gait abnormalities improved over time suggesting compensation during behavioral testing. At 8 months a 15% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum, a 27% loss of TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and no significant loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive cells in the PPN was found. Dopaminergic cell loss may contribute to gait deficits in the P1KO model, but not cholinergic cell loss. The P1KO rat with the greatest dopamine loss exhibited the most pronounced PD-like gait deficits, highlighting variability within the model. Further analysis is required to determine the suitability of the P1KO rat as a progressive model of gait abnormalities in PD.

Abstract
A prevailing view in cognitive neuroscience suggests that different forms of learning are mediated by dissociable memory systems, with a mesolimbic (i.e., midbrain and basal ganglia) system supporting incremental trial‐and‐error reinforcement learning and a hippocampal‐based system supporting episodic memory. Yet, growing evidence suggests that the hippocampus may also be important for trial‐and‐error learning, particularly value or reward‐based learning. In the present report, we use a lesion‐based neuropsychological approach to clarify hippocampal contributions to such learning. Six amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe damage and a group of healthy controls were administered a simple value‐based learning task involving probabilistic trial‐and‐error acquisition of stimulus–response‐outcome (reward or none) contingencies modeled after Li et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, 2011, 108
(1), 55–60). As predicted, patients were significantly impaired on the task, demonstrating reduced learning of the contingencies. Our results provide further supportive evidence that the hippocampus' role in cognition extends beyond episodic memory tasks and call for further refinement of theoretical models of hippocampal functioning.

Abstract
Glutamatergic hilar mossy cells (MCs) have axons that terminate both near and far from their cell body but stay within the DG, making synapses primarily in the molecular layer. The long‐range axons are considered the primary projection, and extend throughout the DG ipsilateral to the soma, and project to the contralateral DG. The specificity of MC axons for the inner molecular layer (IML) has been considered to be a key characteristic of the DG. In the present study, we made the surprising finding that dorsal MC axons are an exception to this rule. We used two mouse lines that allow for Cre‐dependent viral labeling of MCs and their axons: dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2‐Cre) and calcitonin receptor‐like receptor (Crlr‐Cre). A single viral injection into the dorsal DG to label dorsal MCs resulted in labeling of MC axons in both the IML and middle molecular layer (MML). Interestingly, this broad termination of dorsal MC axons occurred throughout the septotemporal DG. In contrast, long‐range axons of ventral MCs terminated in the IML, consistent with the literature. Taken together, these results suggest that dorsal and ventral MCs differ significantly in their axonal projections. Since MC projections in the ML are thought to terminate primarily on GCs, the results suggest a dorsal–ventral difference in MC activation of GCs. The surprising difference in dorsal and ventral MC projections should therefore be considered when evaluating dorsal–ventral differences in DG function.

Abstract
Sodium salicylate, one of the non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, is widely prescribed in the clinic, but a high dose of usage can cause hyperactivity in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus. At present, the neural mechanism underlying the induced hyperactivity is not fully understood, in particular, in the hippocampus under an in vivo condition. In this study, we found that systemic administration of sodium salicylate increased the field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and the population spike amplitude in a dose‐dependent manner in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area of rats with in vivo field potential extracellular recordings, which indicates that sodium salicylate enhances basal synaptic transmission and neural excitation. In the presence of picrotoxin, a GABA‐A receptor antagonist, sodium salicylate failed to increase the initial slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential and the amplitude of the population spike in vivo. To further explore how sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation, we made whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings from hippocampal slices. We found that perfusion of the slice with sodium salicylate decreased electrically evoked GABA receptor‐mediated currents, increased paired‐pulse ratio, and lowered frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Together, these results demonstrate that sodium salicylate enhances the neural excitation through suppressing GABAergic synaptic transmission in presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in the hippocampal dentate gyrus area. Our findings may help understand the side effects caused by sodium salicylate in the central nervous system.

Abstract
Memorizing the locations of environmental cues is crucial for survival and depends on the hippocampus. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the hippocampus of freely moving mice during an object location task. The power of beta‐band (23–30 Hz) oscillations increased immediately before approaching objects in a memory‐encoding phase. The exploration‐induced beta oscillations gradually decreased during the memory‐encoding session. Mice that exhibited stronger beta oscillation power exhibited better performance in the subsequent memory‐retrieval test. These results suggest that beta oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 region are involved in the memory encoding of object‐location associations.

Abstract
Reelin plays a key role in neuronal migration and lamination in the cortex and hippocampus. Animal studies have shown that reelin expression decreases with age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of reelin in all layers of the human hippocampal formation across three age groups. We used immunohistochemistry in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded hippocampal tissue from infants (1–10 months; n = 9), children (4–10 years; n = 4), and adults (45–60 years; n = 6) to stain for reelin. Expression was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm2) in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (ML), the hippocampal fissure (HF), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), CA4/Hilus and the stratum pyramidale layer of CA3, CA2, and CA1. Expression of reelin was highest in the HF irrespective of age, followed by the SLM and ML. Minimal to no expression was seen in the stratum pyramidale layer of CA1‐3. With age, reelin expression decreased and was statistically significant from infancy to childhood in the HF (p = .02). This study confirms that reelin expression decreases with age in the human hippocampus, and shows for the first time that the major decrease occurs between infancy and early childhood.

Abstract
Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations represents a key neurophysiological mechanism that promotes the temporal organization of oscillatory activity. For this reason, PAC has been implicated in item/context integration for episodic processes, including coordinating activity across multiple cortical regions. While data in humans has focused principally on PAC within a single brain region, data in rodents has revealed evidence that the phase of the hippocampal theta oscillation modulates gamma oscillations in the cortex (and vice versa). This pattern, termed cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), has not previously been observed in human subjects engaged in mnemonic processing. We use a unique dataset with intracranial electrodes inserted simultaneously into the hippocampus and seven cortical regions across 40 human subjects to (1) test for the presence of significant cross‐regional PAC (xPAC), (2) to establish that the magnitude of xPAC predicts memory encoding success, (3) to describe specific frequencies within the broad 2–9 Hz theta range that govern hippocampal‐cortical interactions in xPAC, and (4) compare anterior versus posterior hippocampal xPAC patterns. We find that strong functional xPAC occurs principally between the hippocampus and other mesial temporal structures, namely entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, and that xPAC is overall stronger for posterior hippocampal connections. We also show that our results are not confounded by alternative factors such as inter‐regional phase synchrony, local PAC occurring within cortical regions, or artifactual theta oscillatory waveforms.

Abstract
While total white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with hippocampal atrophy, less is known about how the regional distribution of WMH volume may differentially affect the hippocampus in healthy aging. Additionally, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers may be at an increased risk for greater WMH volumes and hippocampal atrophy in aging. The present study sought to investigate whether regional WMH volume mediates the relationship between age and hippocampal volume and if this association is moderated by APOE ε4 status in a group of 190 cognitively healthy adults (APOE ε4 status [carrier/non‐carrier] = 59/131), ages 50–89. Analyses revealed that temporal lobe WMH volume significantly mediated the relationship between age and average bilateral hippocampal volume, and this effect was moderated by APOE ε4 status (−0.020 (SE = 0.009), 95% CI, [−0.039, −0.003]). APOE ε4 carriers, but not non‐carriers, showed negative indirect effects of age on hippocampal volume through temporal lobe WMH volume (APOE ε4 carriers: −0.016 (SE = 0.007), 95% CI, [−0.030, −0.003]; APOE ε4 non‐carriers: .005 (SE = 0.006), 95% CI, [−0.006, 0.017]). These findings remained significant after additionally adjusting for sex, years of education, hypertension status and duration, cholesterol status, diabetes status, Body Mass Index, history of smoking, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐IV Full Scale IQ. There were no significant moderated mediation effects for frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe WMH volumes, with or without covariates. Our findings indicate that in cognitively healthy older adults, elevated WMH volume regionally localized to the temporal lobes in APOE ε4 carriers is associated with reduced hippocampal volume, suggesting greater vulnerability to brain aging and the risk for Alzheimer's disease.

Cardiac anatomy plays a crucial role in determining cardiac function. However, there is a poor understanding of how specific and localised anatomical changes affect different cardiac functional outputs. In this work, we test the hypothesis that in a statistical shape model (SSM), the modes that are most relevant for describing anatomy are also most important for determining the output of cardiac electromechanics simulations. We made patient-specific four-chamber heart meshes (<i>n</i> = 20) from cardiac CT images in asymptomatic subjects and created a SSM from 19 cases. Nine modes captured 90% of the anatomical variation in the SSM. Functional simulation outputs correlated best with modes 2, 3 and 9 on average (<i>R</i> = 0.49 ± 0.17, 0.37 ± 0.23 and 0.34 ± 0.17 respectively). We performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify the different modes responsible for different simulated electrical and mechanical measures of cardiac function. Modes 2 and 9 were the most important for determining simulated left ventricular mechanics and pressure-derived phenotypes. Mode 2 explained 28.56 ± 16.48% and 25.5 ± 20.85, and mode 9 explained 12.1 ± 8.74% and 13.54 ± 16.91% of the variances of mechanics and pressure-derived phenotypes, respectively. Electrophysiological biomarkers were explained by the interaction of 3 ± 1 modes. In the healthy adult human heart, shape modes that explain large portions of anatomical variance do not explain equivalent levels of electromechanical functional variation. As a result, in cardiac models, representing patient anatomy using a limited number of modes of anatomical variation can cause a loss in accuracy of simulated electromechanical function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eTlBJyE2pCY" width="1" />

<p>by Claudio Bassot, Arne Elofsson</p>

Repeat proteins are abundant in eukaryotic proteomes. They are involved in many eukaryotic specific functions, including signalling. For many of these proteins, the structure is not known, as they are difficult to crystallise. Today, using direct coupling analysis and deep learning it is often possible to predict a protein’s structure. However, the unique sequence features present in repeat proteins have been a challenge to use direct coupling analysis for predicting contacts. Here, we show that deep learning-based methods (trRosetta, DeepMetaPsicov (DMP) and PconsC4) overcomes this problem and can predict intra- and inter-unit contacts in repeat proteins. In a benchmark dataset of 815 repeat proteins, about 90% can be correctly modelled. Further, among 48 PFAM families lacking a protein structure, we produce models of forty-one families with estimated high accuracy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NC-_vO_A2A8" width="1" />

<p>by Aref Pariz, Ingo Fischer, Alireza Valizadeh, Claudio Mirasso</p>

Brain networks exhibit very variable and dynamical functional connectivity and flexible configurations of information exchange despite their overall fixed structure. Brain oscillations are hypothesized to underlie time-dependent functional connectivity by periodically changing the excitability of neural populations. In this paper, we investigate the role of the connection delay and the detuning between the natural frequencies of neural populations in the transmission of signals. Based on numerical simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the amount of information transfer between two oscillating neural populations could be determined by their connection delay and the mismatch in their oscillation frequencies. Our results highlight the role of the collective phase response curve of the oscillating neural populations for the efficacy of signal transmission and the quality of the information transfer in brain networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rB0tSDpOfkI" width="1" />

Objective
This multi‐language study employed simple speech recording and high‐end pattern analysis to provide sensitive and reliable non‐invasive biomarkers of prodromal vs. manifest alpha‐synucleinopathy in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) and early‐stage Parkinson's disease (PD).


Methods
We performed a multicentre study across the Czech, English, German, French and Italian languages at seven centres in Europe and North America. A total of 448 participants (337 males) including 150 with iRBD (mean duration of iRBD across language groups 0.5–3.4 years), 149 with PD (mean duration of disease across language groups 1.7–2.5 years), and 149 healthy controls were recorded; 350 of the participants completed the 12‐month follow‐up. We developed a fully‐automated acoustic quantitative assessment approach for the seven distinctive patterns of hypokinetic dysarthria.


Results
No language differences that impacted clinical parkinsonian phenotypes were found. Compared to the controls, we found significant abnormalities of an overall acoustic speech severity measure via composite dysarthria index for both iRBD (p = 0.002) and PD (p &lt; 0.001). By contrast, only PD (p &lt; 0.001) was perceptually distinct in a blinded subjective analysis. We found significant group differences between PD and controls for monopitch (p &lt; 0.001), prolonged pauses (p &lt; 0.001) and imprecise consonants (p = 0.03); only monopitch was able to differentiate iRBD patients from controls (p = 0.004). At the 12‐month follow‐up, a slight progression of overall acoustic speech impairment was noted for the iRBD (p = 0.04) and PD (p = 0.03) groups.


Interpretation
Automated speech analysis may provide a useful additional biomarker of parkinsonism for the assessment of disease progression and therapeutic interventions.

In 2016, Puelles et al. sought to determine the relationship of avian and mammalian pallial regions using the expression profile of the NR4A2 nuclear orphan receptor, concluding that the lateral avian mesopallium was most like the mammalian claustrum, not layer 2 of the cortex as found by Suzuki and Hirata (2014). However, we found that the NR4A2 expression patterns were characteristic of an activity‐dependent gene. Looking at different behavioral contexts in the zebra finch, we found induced expression of NR4A2 in regions across the pallium associated with visual, somatosensory, and motor activity, confounding and contradicting previous findings. Accordingly, we do not believe NR4A2 is a suitable gene for assessing homologous brain anatomy without understanding the animal's behavioral state.







Abstract
The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (2016) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (2013) and Chen et al. (2013) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (2013) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity‐dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity‐dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26082?af=R">Cerebrovascular Neuroprotection after Acute Concussion in Adolescents</a></h4>

Objective
To assess acute cerebrovascular function in concussed adolescents (14‐21 years of age), whether it related to resting cerebral hemodynamics, and whether it recovered chronically.


Methods
Cerebral vasoreactivity and autoregulation, based on middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity, were assessed in 28 concussed participants (≤14 days of injury) and 29 matched controls. The participants in the concussion group returned for an 8‐week follow‐up assessment. Over the course of those 8‐weeks, participants recorded aerobic exercise frequency and duration.


Results
Between group demographic, clinical, and hemodynamic variables were not significantly different. Vasoreactivity was significantly higher in the concussed group (p=0.02). Within the concussed group, 60% of the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity was explained by vasoreactivity and two components of autoregulation – falling slope and effectiveness of autoregulation (adjusted R2=0.60, p&lt;0.001). Moreover, lower mean arterial pressure, lower responses to increases in arterial pressure, and lower vasoreactivity were significantly associated with larger symptom burden (adjusted R2=0.72, p&lt;0.01). By the 8‐week timepoint, symptom burden, but not vasoreactivity, improved in all but four concussed participants (p&lt;0.01). 8‐week change in vasoreactivity was positively associated with aerobic exercise volume (adjusted R2=0.19, p=0.02).


Interpretation
Concussion resulted in changes in cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms, which in turn explained the variability in resting cerebral blood flow velocity and acute symptom burden. Furthermore, these alterations persisted chronically despite symptom resolution, but was positively modified by aerobic exercise volume.

<p>When we experience an event, it feels like our previous experiences, our
interpretations of that event (e.g., aesthetics, emotions), and our current
state will determine how we will remember it. However, recent work has revealed
a strong sway of the visual world itself in influencing what we remember and
forget. Certain items -- including certain faces, words, images, and movements
-- are intrinsically memorable or forgettable across observers, regardless of
individual differences. Further, neuroimaging research has revealed that the
brain is sensitive to memorability both rapidly and automatically during late
perception. These strong consistencies in memory across people may reflect the
broad organizational principles of our sensory environment, and may reveal how
the brain prioritizes information before encoding items into memory. In this
chapter, I will discuss our current state-of-the-art understanding of
memorability for visual information, and what these findings imply about how we
perceive and remember visual events.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06831">When Non-Elitism Meets Time-Linkage Problems. (arXiv:2104.06831v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Many real-world applications have the time-linkage property, and the only
theoretical analysis is recently given by Zheng, et al. (TEVC 2021) on their
proposed time-linkage OneMax problem, OneMax$_{(0,1^n)}$. However, only two
elitist algorithms (1+1)EA and ($\mu$+1)EA are analyzed, and it is unknown
whether the non-elitism mechanism could help to escape the local optima existed
in OneMax$_{(0,1^n)}$. In general, there are few theoretical results on the
benefits of the non-elitism in evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we
analyze on the influence of the non-elitism via comparing the performance of
the elitist (1+$\lambda$)EA and its non-elitist counterpart (1,$\lambda$)EA. We
prove that with probability $1-o(1)$ (1+$\lambda$)EA will get stuck in the
local optima and cannot find the global optimum, but with probability $1$,
(1,$\lambda$)EA can reach the global optimum and its expected runtime is
$O(n^{3+c}\log n)$ with $\lambda=c \log_{\frac{e}{e-1}} n$ for the constant
$c\ge 1$. Noting that a smaller offspring size is helpful for escaping from the
local optima, we further resort to the compact genetic algorithm where only two
individuals are sampled to update the probabilistic model, and prove its
expected runtime of $O(n^3\log n)$. Our computational experiments also verify
the efficiency of the two non-elitist algorithms.

<p>Most evolutionary algorithms have multiple parameters and their values
drastically affect the performance. Due to the often complicated interplay of
the parameters, setting these values right for a particular problem (parameter
tuning) is a challenging task . This task becomes even more complicated when
the optimal parameter values change significantly during the run of the
algorithm since then a dynamic parameter choice (parameter control) is
necessary.
</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a lazy but effective solution, namely choosing all
parameter values (where this makes sense) in each iteration randomly from a
suitably scaled power-law distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach, we perform runtime analyses of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$
genetic algorithm with all three parameters chosen in this manner. We show this
algorithm on the one hand can imitate simple hill-climbers like the $(1+1)$ EA,
giving the same asymptotic runtime on problems like OneMax, LeadingOnes, or
Minimum Spanning Tree. On the other hand, this algorithm is also very efficient
on jump functions, where the best static parameters are very different from
those necessary to optimize simple problems. We prove a performance guarantee
that is comparable, sometimes even better, than the best performance known for
static parameters. We complement our theoretical results with a rigorous
empirical study confirming what the asymptotic runtime results suggest.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06585">A Novel Generalised Meta-Heuristic Framework for Dynamic Capacitated Arc Routing Problems. (arXiv:2104.06585v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>The capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a challenging combinatorial
optimisation problem abstracted from typical real-world applications, like
waste collection and mail delivery. However, few studies considered dynamic
changes during the vehicles' service, which can make the original schedule
infeasible or obsolete. The few existing studies are limited by dynamic
scenarios that can suffer single types of dynamic events, and by algorithms
that rely on special operators or representations, being unable to benefit from
the wealth of contributions provided by the static CARP literature. Here, we
provide the first mathematical formulation for dynamic CARP (DCARP) and design
a simulation system to execute the CARP solutions and generate DCARP instances
with several common dynamic events. We then propose a novel framework able to
generalise all existing static CARP optimisation algorithms so that they can
cope with DCARP instances. The framework has the option to enhance optimisation
performance for DCARP instances based on a restart strategy that makes no use
of past history, and a sequence transfer strategy that benefits from past
optimisation experience. Empirical studies are conducted on a wide range of
DCARP instances. The results highlight the need for tackling dynamic changes
and show that the proposed framework significantly improves over existing
algorithms.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06510">Robotic needle steering in deformable tissues with extreme learning machines. (arXiv:2104.06510v1 [cs.RO])</a></h4>

<p>Control strategies for robotic needle steering in soft tissues must account
for complex interactions between the needle and the tissue to achieve accurate
needle tip positioning. Recent findings show faster robotic command rate can
improve the control stability in realistic scenarios. This study proposes the
use of Extreme Learning Machines to provide fast commands for robotic needle
steering. A synthetic dataset based on the inverse finite element simulation
control framework is used to train the model. Results show the model is capable
to infer commands 66% faster than the inverse simulation and reaches acceptable
precision even on previously unseen trajectories.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Emerging evidence suggests that the cerebellum may contribute to variety of cognitive capacities, including social cognition. Nonverbal learning disability (NVLD) is characterized by visual-spatial and social impairment. Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown that children with NVLD have altered cerebellar resting-state functional connectivity, which is associated with various symptom domains. However, little is known about cerebellar white matter microstructure in NVLD and whether it contributes to social deficits. Twenty-seven children (12 with NVLD, 15 typically developing (TD)) contributed useable diffusion tensor imaging data. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to quantify fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cerebellar peduncles. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist, providing a measure of social difficulty. Children with NVLD had greater fractional anisotropy in the left and right inferior cerebellar peduncle. Furthermore, right inferior cerebellar peduncle FA was associated with social impairment as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist Social Problems subscale. Finally, the association between NVLD diagnosis and greater social impairment was mediated by right inferior cerebellar peduncle FA. These findings provide additional evidence that the cerebellum contributes both to social cognition and to the pathophysiology of NVLD.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Friedreich ataxia is an inherited neurodegenerative disease, with cerebral and cerebellar pathology evident. Despite an increased understanding of its neuropathology, disease progression in this disease remains poorly understood. This study aimed to characterise longitudinal change in brain structure using a multi-modal approach across cerebral and cerebellar grey and white matter.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">T1-weighted, diffusion-tensor, and magnetisation transfer magnetic resonance images were obtained from 28 individuals with Friedreich ataxia and 29 age- and gender-matched controls at two time-points, 2 years apart. Region-of-interest and exploratory between-group comparisons assessed changes in brain macrostructure (cerebellar lobule volume, cerebral cortical thickness/gyrification, brain white matter volume) and microstructure (white matter fractional anisotropy, mean/axial/radial diffusivity, magnetisation transfer ratio). Rates of change were correlated against change in neurological severity, Time 1 severity, and onset age.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Individuals with Friedreich ataxia had a greater rate of white matter volume loss than controls in the superior cerebellar peduncles and right peri-thalamic/posterior cerebral regions, and greater reduction in left primary motor cortex gyrification. Greater cerebellar/brainstem white matter volume loss and right dorsal premotor gyrification loss was observed amongst individuals with less severe neurological symptoms at Time 1. Conversely, cerebral atrophy and changes in axial diffusivity were observed in individuals with more severe Time 1 symptoms. Progression in radial diffusivity was more pronounced amongst individuals with earlier disease onset. Greater right ventral premotor gyrification loss correlated with greater neurological progression.</p>

<p>A quantitative evaluation of motility is crucial for studies employing experimental animals. Here, we describe the development of an in-cage motility monitoring method for new world monkeys using off-the-shelf components, and demonstrate its capability for long-term operation (e.g., a year). Based on this novel system, we characterized the motility of the common marmoset over different time scales (seconds, hours, days, and weeks). Monitoring of seven young animals belonging to two different age groups (sub-adult and young-adult) over a 231-day period revealed: (1) strictly diurnal activity (97.3% of movement during daytime), (2) short-cycle (∼20 s) transition in activity, and (3) bimodal diurnal activity including a “siesta” break. Additionally, while the mean duration of short-cycle activity, net daily activity, and diurnal activity changed over the course of development, 24-h periodicity remained constant. Finally, the method allowed for detection of progressive motility deterioration in a transgenic marmoset. Motility measurement offers a convenient way to characterize developmental and pathological changes in animals, as well as an economical and labor-free means for long-term evaluation in a wide range of basic and translational studies.</p>

<p>For more than two decades, there has been converging evidence for an essential role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions. The cerebellum is not only important in learning and sensorimotor processes, some growing evidences show its implication in conditional learning and reward, which allows building our expectations about behavioral outcomes. More recent work has demonstrated that the cerebellum is also required for the sense of agency, a cognitive process that allows recognizing an action as our own, suggesting that the cerebellum might serve as an interface between sensorimotor function and cognition. A unifying model that would explain the role of the cerebellum across these processes has not been fully established. Nonetheless, an important heritage was given by the field of motor control: the forward model theory. This theory stipulates that movements are controlled based on the constant interactions between our organism and its environment through feedforward and feedback loops. Feedforward loops predict what is going to happen, while feedback loops confront the prediction with what happened so that we can react accordingly. From an anatomical point of view, the cerebellum is at an ideal location at the interface between the motor and sensory systems, as it is connected to cerebral, striatal, and spinal entities via parallel loops, so that it can link sensory and motor systems with cognitive processes. Recent findings showing that the cerebellum participates in building the sense of agency as a predictive and comparator system will be reviewed together with past work on motor control within the context of the forward model theory.</p>

<p>The history of neural activity determines the synaptic plasticity mechanisms employed in the brain. Previous studies report a rapid reduction in the strength of excitatory synapses onto layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1) following two days of dark exposure and subsequent re-exposure to light. The abrupt increase in visually driven activity is predicted to drive homeostatic plasticity, however, the parameters of neural activity that trigger these changes are unknown. To determine this, we first recorded spike trains in vivo from V1 layer 4 (L4) of dark exposed (DE) mice of both sexes that were re-exposed to light through homogeneous or patterned visual stimulation. We found that delivering the spike patterns recorded in vivo to L4 of V1 slices was sufficient to reduce the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) of V1 L2/3 neurons in DE mice, but not in slices obtained from normal reared (NR) controls. Unexpectedly, the same stimulation pattern produced an up-regulation of mEPSC amplitudes in V1 L2/3 neurons from mice that received 2 h of light re-exposure (LE). A Poisson spike train exhibiting the same average frequency as the patterns recorded in vivo was equally effective at depressing mEPSC amplitudes in L2/3 neurons in V1 slices prepared from DE mice. Collectively, our results suggest that the history of visual experience modifies the responses of V1 neurons to stimulation and that rapid homeostatic depression of excitatory synapses can be driven by non-patterned input activity.</p>

<p>Synaptic active zone (AZ) contains multiple specialized release sites for vesicle fusion. The utilization of release sites is regulated to determine spatiotemporal organization of the two main forms of synchronous release, uni-vesicular (UVR) and multi-vesicular (MVR). We previously found that the vesicle-associated molecular motor myosin V regulates temporal utilization of release sites by controlling vesicle anchoring at release sites in an activity-dependent manner. Here we show that acute inhibition of myosin V shifts preferential location of vesicle docking away from AZ center toward periphery, and results in a corresponding spatial shift in utilization of release sites during UVR. Similarly, inhibition of myosin V also reduces preferential utilization of central release sites during MVR, leading to more spatially distributed and temporally uniform MVR that occurs farther away from the AZ center. Using a modeling approach, we provide a conceptual framework that unites spatial and temporal functions of myosin V in vesicle release by controlling the gradient of release site release probability across the AZ, which in turn determines the spatiotemporal organization of both UVR and MVR. Thus myosin V regulates both temporal and spatial utilization of release sites during two main forms of synchronous release.</p>

<p>Blast-mediated traumatic brain injuries (bTBI) cause long-lasting physical, cognitive, and psychological disorders, including persistent visual impairment. No known therapies are currently utilized in humans to lessen the lingering and often serious symptoms. With TBI mortality decreasing due to advancements in medical and protective technologies, there is growing interest in understanding the pathology of visual dysfunction after bTBI. However, this is complicated by numerous variables, e.g., injury location, severity, and head and body shielding. This review summarizes the visual outcomes observed by various, current experimental rodent models of bTBI, and identifies data showing that bTBI activates inflammatory and apoptotic signaling leading to visual dysfunction. Pharmacologic treatments blocking inflammation and cell death pathways reported to alleviate visual deficits in post-bTBI animal models are discussed. Notably, techniques for assessing bTBI outcomes across exposure paradigms differed widely, so we urge future studies to compare multiple models of blast injury, to allow data to be directly compared.</p>

<p>Neurons have high metabolic demands that are almost exclusively met by glucose supplied from the bloodstream. Glucose is utilized in complex metabolic interactions between neurons and glia cells, described by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis. The neural retina faces similar energy demands to the rest of the brain, with additional high anabolic needs to support continuous renewal of photoreceptor outer segments. This demand is met by a fascinating variation of the ANLS in which photoreceptors are the central part of a metabolic landscape, using glucose and supplying surrounding cells with metabolic intermediates. In this review we summarize recent evidence on how neurons, in particular photoreceptors, meet their energy and biosynthetic requirements by comprising a metabolic landscape of interdependent cells.</p>

<p>Protein–protein interaction networks and signaling complexes are essential for normal brain function and are often dysregulated in neurological disorders. Nevertheless, unraveling neuron- and synapse-specific proteins interaction networks has remained a technical challenge. New techniques, however, have allowed for high-resolution and high-throughput analyses, enabling quantification and characterization of various neuronal protein populations. Over the last decade, mass spectrometry (MS) has surfaced as the primary method for analyzing multiple protein samples in tandem, allowing for the precise quantification of proteomic data. Moreover, the development of sophisticated protein-labeling techniques has given MS a high temporal and spatial resolution, facilitating the analysis of various neuronal substructures, cell types, and subcellular compartments. Recent studies have leveraged these novel techniques to reveal the proteomic underpinnings of well-characterized neuronal processes, such as axon guidance, long-term potentiation, and homeostatic plasticity. Translational MS studies have facilitated a better understanding of complex neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Proteomic investigation of these diseases has not only given researchers new insight into disease mechanisms but has also been used to validate disease models and identify new targets for research.</p>

<p>Neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) regulate each other and have been implicated in several neuronal mechanisms, including neuroplasticity. We have investigated the effects of BDNF on serotonergic neurons by deleting BDNF receptor TrkB from serotonergic neurons in the adult brain. The transgenic mice show increased 5-HT and Tph2 levels with abnormal behavioral phenotype. In spite of increased food intake, the transgenic mice are significantly leaner than their wildtype littermates, which may be due to increased metabolic activity. Consistent with increased 5-HT, the proliferation of hippocampal progenitors is significantly increased, however, long-term survival of newborn cells is unchanged. Our data indicates that BDNF-TrkB signaling regulates the functional phenotype of 5-HT neurons with long-term behavioral consequences.</p>

<p>Recent decades have witnessed an increasing number of large to very large imaging studies, prominently in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. The datasets collected during these studies form essential resources for the research aiming at new biomarkers. Collecting, hosting, managing, processing, or reviewing those datasets is typically achieved through a local neuroinformatics infrastructure. In particular for organizations with their own imaging equipment, setting up such a system is still a hard task, and relying on cloud-based solutions, albeit promising, is not always possible. This paper proposes a practical model guided by core principles including user involvement, lightweight footprint, modularity, reusability, and facilitated data sharing. This model is based on the experience from an 8-year-old research center managing cohort research programs on Alzheimer’s disease. Such a model gave rise to an ecosystem of tools aiming at improved quality control through seamless automatic processes combined with a variety of code libraries, command line tools, graphical user interfaces, and instant messaging applets. The present ecosystem was shaped around XNAT and is composed of independently reusable modules that are freely available on GitLab/GitHub. This paradigm is scalable to the general community of researchers working with large neuroimaging datasets.</p>

<p>The vital role of reward in guiding visual attention has been supported by previous literatures. Here, we examined the motivational impact of monetary reward feedback stimuli on visual attention selection using an event-related potential (ERP) component called stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and a standard contextual cueing (CC) paradigm. It has been proposed that SPN reflects affective and motivational processing. We focused on whether incidentally learned context knowledge could be affected by reward. Both behavior and brain data demonstrated that contexts followed by reward feedback not only gave rise to faster implicit learning but also obtained a larger CC effect.</p>

Purpose<p>This study aimed to investigate whether oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) generated during a motor imagery (MI) task is associated with the motor learning level of the task.</p>Methods<p>We included 16 right-handed healthy participants who were trained to perform a ball rotation (BR) task. Hemodynamic brain activity was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor changes in oxy-Hb concentration during the BR MI task. The experimental protocol used a block design, and measurements were performed three times before and after the initial training of the BR task as well as after the final training. The BR count during training was also measured. Furthermore, subjective vividness of MI was evaluated three times after NIRS measurement using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</p>Results<p>The results showed that the number of BRs increased significantly with training (P &lt; 0.001). VAS scores also improved with training (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, oxy-Hb concentration and the region of interest (ROI) showed a main effect (P = 0.001). An interaction was confirmed (P &lt; 0.001), and it was ascertained that the change in oxy-Hb concentrations due to training was different for each ROI. The most significant predictor of subjective MI vividness was supplementary motor area (SMA) oxy-Hb concentration (coefficient = 0.365).</p>Discussion<p>Hemodynamic brain activity during MI tasks may be correlated with task motor learning levels, since significant changes in oxy-Hb concentrations were observed following initial and final training in the SMA. In particular, hemodynamic brain activity in the SMA was suggested to reflect the MI vividness of participants.</p>

<p>Striatal dopamine transporters (DAT) powerfully regulate dopamine signaling, and can contribute risk to degeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD). DATs can interact with the neuronal protein α-synuclein, which is associated with the etiology and molecular pathology of idiopathic and familial PD. Here, we tested whether DAT function in governing dopamine (DA) uptake and release is modified in a human-α-synuclein-overexpressing (SNCA-OVX) transgenic mouse model of early PD. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) in ex vivo acute striatal slices to detect DA release, and biochemical assays, we show that several aspects of DAT function are promoted in SNCA-OVX mice. Compared to background control α-synuclein-null mice (Snca-null), the SNCA-OVX mice have elevated DA uptake rates, and more pronounced effects of DAT inhibitors on evoked extracellular DA concentrations ([DA]<sub>o</sub>) and on short-term plasticity (STP) in DA release, indicating DATs play a greater role in limiting DA release and in driving STP. We found that DAT membrane levels and radioligand binding sites correlated with α-synuclein level. Furthermore, DAT function in Snca-null and SNCA-OVX mice could also be promoted by applying cholesterol, and using Tof-SIMS we found genotype-differences in striatal lipids, with lower striatal cholesterol in SNCA-OVX mice. An inhibitor of cholesterol efflux transporter ABCA1 or a cholesterol chelator in SNCA-OVX mice reduced the effects of DAT-inhibitors on evoked [DA]<sub>o</sub>. Together these data indicate that human α-synuclein in a mouse model of PD promotes striatal DAT function, in a manner supported by extracellular cholesterol, suggesting converging biology of α-synuclein and cholesterol that regulates DAT function and could impact DA function and PD pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a type of neurodegenerative disease that is associated with the accumulation of amyloid plaques. Increasing non-amyloidogenic processing and/or manipulating amyloid precursor protein signaling could reduce AD amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment. D-penicillamine (D-Pen) is a water-soluble metal chelator and can reduce the aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) with metals in vitro. However, the potential mechanism of D-Pen for treating neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. In here, a novel type of chitosan-based hydrogel to carry D-Pen was designed and the D-Pen-CS/β-glycerophosphate hydrogel were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and HPLC. Behavior tests investigated the learning and memory levels of APP/PS1 mice treated through the D-Pen hydrogel nasal delivery. In vivo and in vitro findings showed that nasal delivery of D-Pen-CS/β-GP hydrogel had properly chelated metal ions that reduced Aβ deposition. Furthermore, D-Pen mainly regulated A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) expression via melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1α) and the downstream PKA/ERK/CREB pathway. The present data demonstrated D-Pen significantly improved the cognitive ability of APP/PS1 mice and reduced Aβ generation through activating ADAM10 and accelerating non-amyloidogenic processing. Hence, these findings indicate the potential of D-Pen as a promising agent for treating AD.</p>

Objective<p>Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with high spatial resolution and feasible penetration depth. To date, the mechanisms of TUS modulated neural oscillations are not fully understood. This study designed a very low acoustic intensity (AI) TUS system that produces considerably reduced AI Ultrasound pulses (I<sub>SPTA</sub> &lt; 0.5 W/cm2) when compared to previous methods used to measure regional neural oscillation patterns under different TUS parameters.</p>Methods<p>We recorded the local field potential (LFP) of five brain nuclei under TUS with three groups of simulating parameters. Spectrum estimation, time-frequency analysis (TFA), and relative power analysis methods have been applied to investigate neural oscillation patterns under different stimulation parameters.</p>Results<p>Under PRF, 500 Hz and 1 kHz TUS, high-amplitude LFP activity with the auto-rhythmic pattern appeared in selected nuclei when I<sub>SPTA</sub> exceeded 12 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. With TFA, high-frequency energy (slow gamma and high gamma) was significantly increased during the auto-rhythmic patterns. We observed an initial plateau in nuclei response when I<sub>SPTA</sub> reached 16.4 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for RPF 500 Hz and 20.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for RPF 1 kHz. The number of responding nuclei started decreasing while I<sub>SPTA</sub> continued increasing. Under 1.5 kHz TUS, no auto-rhythmic patterns have been observed, but slow frequency power was increased during TUS. TUS inhibited most of the frequency band and generated obvious slow waves (theta and delta band) when stimulated at RPF = 1.5 kHz, I<sub>SPTA</sub> = 8.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>Conclusion<p>These results demonstrate that very low intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (VLTUS) exerts significant neuromodulator effects under specific parameters in rat models and may be a valid tool to study neuronal physiology.</p>

Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a highly conserved mutagenic DNA lesion tolerance pathway, which employs specialized, low-fidelity DNA polymerases to synthesize across lesions. Current models suggest that activity of these polymerases is predominantly associated with ongoing replication, functioning either at or behind the replication fork. Here we provide evidence for DNA damage-dependent function of a specialized polymerase, DnaE2, in replication-independent conditions. We develop an assay to follow lesion repair in non-replicating <i>Caulobacter </i>and observe that components of the replication machinery localize on DNA in response to damage. These localizations persist in the absence of DnaE2 or if catalytic activity of this polymerase is mutated. Single-stranded DNA gaps for SSB binding and low-fidelity polymerase-mediated synthesis are generated by nucleotide excision repair, as replisome components fail to localize in the absence of NER. This mechanism of gap-filling facilitates cell cycle restoration when cells are released into replication-permissive conditions. Thus, such cross-talk (between activity of NER and specialized polymerases in subsequent gap-filling) helps preserve genome integrity and enhances survival in a replication-independent manner.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66321">Channel Nuclear Pore Complex subunits are required for transposon silencing in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

The Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) is the principal gateway between nucleus and cytoplasm that enables exchange of macromolecular cargo. Composed of multiple copies of ~30 different nucleoporins (Nups), the NPC acts as a selective portal, interacting with factors which individually license passage of specific cargo classes. Here we show that two Nups of the inner channel, Nup54 and Nup58, are essential for transposon silencing via the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway in the <i>Drosophila</i> ovary. In ovarian follicle cells, loss of Nup54 and Nup58 results in compromised piRNA biogenesis exclusively from the <i>flamenco</i> locus, whereas knockdowns of other NPC subunits have widespread consequences. This provides evidence that some nucleoporins can acquire specialised roles in tissue-specific contexts. Our findings consolidate the idea that the NPC has functions beyond simply constituting a barrier to nuclear/cytoplasmic exchange, as genomic loci subjected to strong selective pressure can exploit NPC subunits to facilitate their expression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65487">Inverse regulation of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> biofilm dispersal by polyamine signals</a></h4>

The global pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> undergoes cycles of biofilm formation and dispersal in the environment and the human host. Little is understood about biofilm dispersal. Here, we show that MbaA, a periplasmic polyamine sensor, and PotD1, a polyamine importer, regulate <i>V. cholerae</i> biofilm dispersal. Spermidine, a commonly produced polyamine, drives <i>V. cholerae</i> dispersal, whereas norspermidine, an uncommon polyamine produced by vibrios, inhibits dispersal. Spermidine and norspermidine differ by one methylene group. Both polyamines control dispersal via MbaA detection in the periplasm and subsequent signal relay. Our results suggest that dispersal fails in the absence of PotD1 because endogenously produced norspermidine is not reimported, periplasmic norspermidine accumulates, and it stimulates MbaA signaling. These results suggest that <i>V. cholerae</i> uses MbaA to monitor environmental polyamines, blends of which potentially provide information about numbers of 'self' and 'other'. This information is used to dictate whether or not to disperse from biofilms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63076">Neuronal complexity is attenuated in preclinical models of migraine and restored by HDAC6 inhibition</a></h4>

Migraine is the third most prevalent disease worldwide but the mechanisms that underlie migraine chronicity are poorly understood. Cytoskeletal flexibility is fundamental to neuronal-plasticity and is dependent on dynamic microtubules. Histone-deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) decreases microtubule dynamics by deacetylating its primary substrate, α-tubulin. We use validated mouse models of migraine to show that HDAC6-inhibition is a promising migraine treatment and reveal an undiscovered cytoarchitectural basis for migraine chronicity. The human migraine trigger, nitroglycerin, produced chronic migraine-associated pain and decreased neurite growth in headache-processing regions, which were reversed by HDAC6 inhibition. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), a physiological correlate of migraine aura, also decreased cortical neurite growth, while HDAC6-inhibitor restored neuronal complexity and decreased CSD. Importantly, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist also restored blunted neuronal complexity induced by nitroglycerin. Our results demonstrate that disruptions in neuronal cytoarchitecture are a feature of chronic migraine, and effective migraine therapies might include agents that restore microtubule/neuronal plasticity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61401">Exceptional stability of a perilipin on lipid droplets depends on its polar residues, suggesting multimeric assembly</a></h4>

Numerous proteins target lipid droplets (LDs) through amphipathic helices (AHs). It is generally assumed that AHs insert bulky hydrophobic residues in packing defects at the LD surface. However, this model does not explain the targeting of perilipins, the most abundant and specific amphipathic proteins of LDs, which are weakly hydrophobic. A striking example is Plin4, whose gigantic and repetitive AH lacks bulky hydrophobic residues. Using a range of complementary approaches, we show that Plin4 forms a remarkably immobile and stable protein layer at the surface of cellular or in vitro generated oil droplets, and decreases LD size. Plin4 AH stability on LDs is exquisitely sensitive to the nature and distribution of its polar residues. These results suggest that Plin4 forms stable arrangements of adjacent AHs via polar/electrostatic interactions, reminiscent of the organization of apolipoproteins in lipoprotein particles, thus pointing to a general mechanism of AH stabilization via lateral interactions.

Mice lacking the microglial receptor CX3CR1 display several phenotypes in the auditory brainstem. They have normal pruning in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and increased expression of mature astrocyte markers. They have normal auditory brainstem recording (ABR) thresholds, but the ABR latencies are decreased. They show increased expression of inhibitory presynaptic terminal markers, possibly reflecting impaired inhibitory pruning. Finally, CX3CR1−/− mice lack the tonotopic gradients seen for cell body size and calyx of Held size in the MNTB.







Abstract
The precise and specialized circuitry in the auditory brainstem develops through adaptations of cellular and molecular signaling. We previously showed that elimination of microglia during development impairs synaptic pruning that leads to maturation of the calyx of Held, a large encapsulating synapse that terminates on neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia depletion also led to a decrease in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for mature astrocytes. Here, we investigated the role of signaling through the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), which is expressed by microglia and mediates communication with neurons. CX3CR1−/− and wild‐type mice were studied before and after hearing onset and at 9 weeks of age. Levels of GFAP were significantly increased in the MNTB in mutants at 9 weeks. Pruning was unaffected at the calyx of Held, but we found an increase in expression of glycinergic synaptic marker in mutant mice at P14, suggesting an effect on maturation of inhibitory inputs. We observed disrupted tonotopic gradients of neuron and calyx size in MNTB in mutant mice. Auditory brainstem recording (ABR) revealed that CX3CR1−/− mice had normal thresholds and amplitudes but decreased latencies and interpeak latencies, particularly for the highest frequencies. These results demonstrate that disruption of fractalkine signaling has a significant effect on auditory brainstem development. Our findings highlight the importance of neuron–microglia–astrocyte communication in pruning of inhibitory synapses and establishment of tonotopic gradients early in postnatal development.

Voltage imaging enables monitoring neural activity at sub-millisecond and sub-cellular scale, unlocking the study of subthreshold activity, synchrony, and network dynamics with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. However, high data rates (&gt;800MB/s) and low signal-to-noise ratios create bottlenecks for analyzing such datasets. Here we present <i>VolPy</i>, an automated and scalable pipeline to pre-process voltage imaging datasets. <i>VolPy</i> features motion correction, memory mapping, automated segmentation, denoising and spike extraction, all built on a highly parallelizable, modular, and extensible framework optimized for memory and speed. To aid automated segmentation, we introduce a corpus of 24 manually annotated datasets from different preparations, brain areas and voltage indicators. We benchmark <i>VolPy</i> against ground truth segmentation, simulations and electrophysiology recordings, and we compare its performance with existing algorithms in detecting spikes. Our results indicate that <i>VolPy</i>’s performance in spike extraction and scalability are state-of-the-art.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/owh1qdr10M0" width="1" />

<p>by Benjamin R. Pittman-Polletta, Yangyang Wang, David A. Stanley, Charles E. Schroeder, Miles A. Whittington, Nancy J. Kopell</p>

Current hypotheses suggest that speech segmentation—the initial division and grouping of the speech stream into candidate phrases, syllables, and phonemes for further linguistic processing—is executed by a hierarchy of oscillators in auditory cortex. Theta (∼3-12 Hz) rhythms play a key role by phase-locking to recurring acoustic features marking syllable boundaries. Reliable synchronization to quasi-rhythmic inputs, whose variable frequency can dip below cortical theta frequencies (down to ∼1 Hz), requires “flexible” theta oscillators whose underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. Using biophysical computational models, we found that the flexibility of phase-locking in neural oscillators depended on the types of hyperpolarizing currents that paced them. Simulated cortical theta oscillators flexibly phase-locked to slow inputs when these inputs caused both (i) spiking and (ii) the subsequent buildup of outward current sufficient to delay further spiking until the next input. The greatest flexibility in phase-locking arose from a synergistic interaction between intrinsic currents that was not replicated by synaptic currents at similar timescales. Flexibility in phase-locking enabled improved entrainment to speech input, optimal at mid-vocalic channels, which in turn supported syllabic-timescale segmentation through identification of vocalic nuclei. Our results suggest that synaptic and intrinsic inhibition contribute to frequency-restricted and -flexible phase-locking in neural oscillators, respectively. Their differential deployment may enable neural oscillators to play diverse roles, from reliable internal clocking to adaptive segmentation of quasi-regular sensory inputs like speech.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xayrvjSozD8" width="1" />

<p>In this paper, we present Co-scale conv-attentional image Transformers
(CoaT), a Transformer-based image classifier equipped with co-scale and
conv-attentional mechanisms. First, the co-scale mechanism maintains the
integrity of Transformers' encoder branches at individual scales, while
allowing representations learned at different scales to effectively communicate
with each other; we design a series of serial and parallel blocks to realize
the co-scale attention mechanism. Second, we devise a conv-attentional
mechanism by realizing a relative position embedding formulation in the
factorized attention module with an efficient convolution-like implementation.
CoaT empowers image Transformers with enriched multi-scale and contextual
modeling capabilities. On ImageNet, relatively small CoaT models attain
superior classification results compared with the similar-sized convolutional
neural networks and image/vision Transformers. The effectiveness of CoaT's
backbone is also illustrated on object detection and instance segmentation,
demonstrating its applicability to the downstream computer vision tasks.

<p>Variational autoencoders employ an encoding neural network to generate a
probabilistic representation of a data set within a low-dimensional space of
latent variables followed by a decoding stage that maps the latent variables
back to the original variable space. Once trained, a statistical ensemble of
simulated data realizations can be obtained by randomly assigning values to the
latent variables that are subsequently processed by the decoding section of the
network. To determine the accuracy of such a procedure when applied to lattice
models, an autoencoder is here trained on a thermal equilibrium distribution of
Ising spin realizations. When the output of the decoder for synthetic data is
interpreted probabilistically, spin realizations can be generated by randomly
assigning spin values according to the computed likelihood. The resulting state
distribution in energy-magnetization space then qualitatively resembles that of
the training samples. However, because correlations between spins are
suppressed, the computed energies are unphysically large for low-dimensional
latent variable spaces. The features of the learned distributions as a function
of temperature, however, provide a qualitative indication of the presence of a
phase transition and the distribution of realizations with characteristic
cluster sizes.

<p>Many decisions involve choosing an uncertain course of actions in deep and
wide decision trees, as when we plan to visit an exotic country for vacation.
In these cases, exhaustive search for the best sequence of actions is not
tractable due to the large number of possibilities and limited time or
computational resources available to make the decision. Therefore, planning
agents need to balance breadth (exploring many actions at each level of the
tree) and depth (exploring many levels in the tree) to allocate optimally their
finite search capacity. We provide efficient analytical solutions and numerical
analysis to the problem of allocating finite sampling capacity in one shot to
large decision trees. We find that in general the optimal policy is to allocate
few samples per level so that deep levels can be reached, thus favoring depth
over breadth search. In contrast, in poor environments and at low capacity, it
is best to broadly sample branches at the cost of not sampling deeply, although
this policy is marginally better than deep allocations. Our results provide a
theoretical foundation for the optimality of deep imagination for planning and
show that it is a generally valid heuristic that could have evolved from the
finite constraints of cognitive systems.

<p>There is significant need for principled uncertainty reasoning in machine
learning systems as they are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains.
A new approach with uncertainty-aware neural networks shows promise over
traditional deterministic methods, yet several important gaps in the theory and
implementation of these networks remain. We discuss three issues with a
proposed solution to extract aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties from
regression-based neural networks. The aforementioned proposal derives a
technique by placing evidential priors over the original Gaussian likelihood
function and training the neural network to infer the hyperparemters of the
evidential distribution. Doing so allows for the simultaneous extraction of
both uncertainties without sampling or utilization of out-of-distribution data
for univariate regression tasks. We describe the outstanding issues in detail,
provide a possible solution, and generalize the technique for the multivariate
case.

<p>High-stakes applications require AI-generated models to be interpretable.
Current algorithms for the synthesis of potentially interpretable models rely
on objectives or regularization terms that represent interpretability only
coarsely (e.g., model size) and are not designed for a specific user. Yet,
interpretability is intrinsically subjective. In this paper, we propose an
approach for the synthesis of models that are tailored to the user by enabling
the user to steer the model synthesis process according to her or his
preferences. We use a bi-objective evolutionary algorithm to synthesize models
with trade-offs between accuracy and a user-specific notion of
interpretability. The latter is estimated by a neural network that is trained
concurrently to the evolution using the feedback of the user, which is
collected using uncertainty-based active learning. To maximize usability, the
user is only asked to tell, given two models at the time, which one is less
complex. With experiments on two real-world datasets involving 61 participants,
we find that our approach is capable of learning estimations of
interpretability that can be very different for different users. Moreover, the
users tend to prefer models found using the proposed approach over models found
using non-personalized interpretability indices.

<p>Data-driven modeling of spatiotemporal physical processes with general deep
learning methods is a highly challenging task. It is further exacerbated by the
limited availability of data, leading to poor generalizations in standard
neural network models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new approach called
the Finite Volume Neural Network (FINN). The FINN method adopts the numerical
structure of the well-known Finite Volume Method for handling partial
differential equations, so that each quantity of interest follows its own
adaptable conservation law, while it concurrently accommodates learnable
parameters. As a result, FINN enables better handling of fluxes between control
volumes and therefore proper treatment of different types of numerical boundary
conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a subsurface
contaminant transport problem, which is governed by a non-linear
diffusion-sorption process. FINN does not only generalize better to differing
boundary conditions compared to other methods, it is also capable to explicitly
extract and learn the constitutive relationships (expressed by the retardation
factor). More importantly, FINN shows excellent generalization ability when
applied to both synthetic datasets and real, sparse experimental data, thus
underlining its relevance as a data-driven modeling tool.

<p>Electroencephalography signals allow to explore the functional activity of
the brain cortex in a non-invasive way. However, the analysis of these signals
is not straightforward due to the presence of different artifacts and the very
low signal-to-noise ratio. Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC) methods provide a way
to extract information from EEG, related to the synchronization among frequency
bands. However, CFC methods are usually applied in a local way, computing the
interaction between phase and amplitude at the same electrode. In this work we
show a method to compute PAC features among electrodes to study the functional
connectivity. Moreover, this has been applied jointly with Principal Component
Analysis to explore patterns related to Dyslexia in 7-years-old children. The
developed methodology reveals the temporal evolution of PAC-based connectivity.
Directions of greatest variance computed by PCA are called eigenPACs here,
since they resemble the classical \textit{eigenfaces} representation. The
projection of PAC data onto the eigenPACs provide a set of features that has
demonstrates their discriminative capability, specifically in the Beta-Gamma
bands.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebellar dysfunction results in impairments in co-ordination or ‘ataxia’. Bedside examination of cerebellar function has changed little since the early nineteenth century with the exception being the oculomotor examination which has become instrumented. Otherwise, competence and confidence in performing the clinical assessment relies heavily on the skill and experience of the clinician. Potentially, instrumented objective measurement will more accurately assess the severity of ataxia and the changes brought about by advancing therapies in pharmaceutical trials and in rehabilitation intervention. This study describes instrumented versions of several bedside tests of cerebellar function, including rhythmic tapping of the hand (RTH), finger-nose test (FNT), dysdiadochokinesia (DDK), ramp tracking (RMT), ballistic tracking (BT), rhythmic tapping of the foot (RTF) and the heel shin (HST) examination which were validated against scores from Ataxia Rating Scales (ARS) such as the Scale of Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). While all of the instrumented tests accurately distinguished between ataxic subjects and controls, there was a difference in performance, with the best four performing upper limb tests being RTH, FNT, DDK and BT. A combination of BT plus RTH provided the best correlation with the SARA and outperformed a combination of all the bedside tests (Spearman 0.8; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001 compared to 0.68; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001 for the combined set) in identifying the presence and severity of ataxia. This indicates that there is redundancy in the information provided by the bedside tests and that adding other tests to BT plus RTH does not add accuracy to the assessment of ataxia. This analysis highlighted the need for metrics that could be generalised to each of the assessments of ataxia, so, in turn, domains of stability, timing, accuracy and rhythmicity (STAR domains) were developed and compared to the SARA. The STAR criteria could potentially influence the future of instrumented assessment in CA and pave the way for further research into the objective measurement of the cerebellar examination.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Multiple methods have been developed in an attempt to quantify stimulus-induced neural coordination and to understand internal coordination of neuronal responses by examining the synchronization phenomena in neural discharge patterns. In this work we propose a novel approach to estimate the degree of concomitant firing between two neural units, based on a modified form of mutual information (MI) applied to a two-state representation of the firing activity. The binary profile of each single unit unfolds its discharge activity in time by decomposition into the state of neural quiescence/low activity and state of moderate firing/bursting. Then, the MI computed between the two binary streams is normalized by their minimum entropy and is taken as positive or negative depending on the prevalence of identical or opposite concomitant states. The resulting measure, denoted as Concurrent Firing Index based on MI (CFI<sub class="a-plus-plus">MI</sub>), relies on a single input parameter and is otherwise assumption-free and symmetric. Exhaustive validation was carried out through controlled experiments in three simulation scenarios, showing that CFI<sub class="a-plus-plus">MI</sub> is independent on firing rate and recording duration, and is sensitive to correlated and anti-correlated firing patterns. Its ability to detect non-correlated activity was assessed using ad-hoc surrogate data. Moreover, the evaluation of CFI<sub class="a-plus-plus">MI</sub> on experimental recordings of spiking activity in retinal ganglion cells brought insights into the changes of neural synchrony over time. The proposed measure offers a novel perspective on the estimation of neural synchrony, providing information on the co-occurrence of firing states in the two analyzed trains over longer temporal scales compared to existing measures.</p>

<p>Cervical discogenic pain (CDP) is mainly induced by cervical disc degeneration. However, how CDP modulates the functional interactions within the pain network remains unclear. In the current study, we studied the changed resting-state functional connectivities of pain network with 40 CDP patients and 40 age-, gender-matched healthy controls. We first defined the pain network with the seeds of the posterior insula (PI). Then, whole brain and seed-to-target functional connectivity analyses were performed to identify the differences in functional connectivity between CDP and healthy controls. Finally, correlation analyses were applied to reveal the associations between functional connectivities and clinical measures. Whole-brain functional connectivity analyses of PI identified increased functional connectivity between PI and thalamus (THA) and decreased functional connectivity between PI and middle cingulate cortex (MCC) in CDP patients. Functional connectivity analyses within the pain network further revealed increased functional connectivities between bilateral PI and bilateral THA, and decreased functional connectivities between left PI and MCC, between left postcentral gyrus (PoCG) and MCC in CDP patients. Moreover, we found that the functional connectivities between right PI and left THA, between left PoCG and MCC were negatively and positively correlated with the visual analog scale, respectively. Our findings provide direct evidence of how CDP modulates the pain network, which may facilitate understanding of the neural basis of CDP.</p>

<p>Functional human brain mapping is commonly performed during invasive monitoring with intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) electrodes prior to resective surgery for drug­ resistant epilepsy. The current gold standard, electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM), is time ­consuming, sometimes elicits pain, and often induces after discharges or seizures. Moreover, there is a risk of overestimating eloquent areas due to propagation of the effects of stimulation to a broader network of language cortex. Passive iEEG spatial-temporal functional mapping (STFM) has recently emerged as a potential alternative to ESM. However, investigators have observed less correspondence between STFM and ESM maps of language than between their maps of motor function. We hypothesized that incongruities between ESM and STFM of language function may arise due to propagation of the effects of ESM to cortical areas having strong effective connectivity with the site of stimulation. We evaluated five patients who underwent invasive monitoring for seizure localization, whose language areas were identified using ESM. All patients performed a battery of language tasks during passive iEEG recordings. To estimate the effective connectivity of stimulation sites with a broader network of task-activated cortical sites, we measured cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited across all recording sites by single-pulse electrical stimulation at sites where ESM was performed at other times. With the combination of high gamma power as well as CCEPs results, we trained a logistic regression model to predict ESM results at individual electrode pairs. The average accuracy of the classifier using both STFM and CCEPs results combined was 87.7%, significantly higher than the one using STFM alone (71.8%), indicating that the correspondence between STFM and ESM results is greater when effective connectivity between ESM stimulation sites and task-activated sites is taken into consideration. These findings, though based on a small number of subjects to date, provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that incongruities between ESM and STFM may arise in part from propagation of stimulation effects to a broader network of cortical language sites activated by language tasks, and suggest that more studies, with larger numbers of patients, are needed to understand the utility of both mapping techniques in clinical practice.</p>

<p>This paper proposed a novel tactile-stimuli P300 paradigm for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), which potentially targeted at people with less learning ability or difficulty in maintaining attention. The new paradigm using only two types of stimuli was designed, and different targets were distinguished by frequency and spatial information. The classification algorithm was developed by introducing filters for frequency bands selection and conducting optimization with common spatial pattern (CSP) on the tactile evoked EEG signals. It features a combination of spatial and frequency information, with the spatial information distinguishing the sites of stimuli and frequency information identifying target stimuli and disturbances. We investigated both electrical stimuli and vibration stimuli, in which only one target site was stimulated in each block. The results demonstrated an average accuracy of 94.88% for electrical stimuli and 95.21% for vibration stimuli, respectively.</p>

<p>Mismatch brain responses to unpredicted rare stimuli are suggested to be a neural indicator of prediction error, but this has rarely been studied in the somatosensory modality. Here, we investigated how the brain responds to unpredictable and predictable rare events. Magnetoencephalography responses were measured in adults frequently presented with somatosensory stimuli (FRE) that were occasionally replaced by two consecutively presented rare stimuli [unpredictable rare stimulus (UR) and predictable rare stimulus (PR); p = 0.1 for each]. The FRE and PR were electrical stimulations administered to either the little finger or the forefinger in a counterbalanced manner between the two conditions. The UR was a simultaneous electrical stimulation to both the forefinger and the little finger (for a smaller subgroup, the UR and FRE were counterbalanced for the stimulus properties). The grand-averaged responses were characterized by two main components: one at 30–100 ms (M55) and the other at 130–230 ms (M150) latency. Source-level analysis was conducted for the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). The M55 responses were larger for the UR and PR than for the FRE in both the SI and the SII areas and were larger for the UR than for the PR. For M150, both investigated areas showed increased activity for the UR and the PR compared to the FRE. Interestingly, although the UR was larger in stimulus energy (stimulation of two fingers at the same time) and had a larger prediction error potential than the PR, the M150 responses to these two rare stimuli did not differ in source strength in either the SI or the SII area. The results suggest that M55, but not M150, can possibly be associated with prediction error signals. These findings highlight the need for disentangling prediction error and rareness-related effects in future studies investigating prediction error signals.</p>

Objectives<p>Working memory is essential for daily life skills like reading comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving. Healthy aging of the brain goes along with working memory decline that can affect older people’s independence in everyday life. Interventions in the form of cognitive training are a promising tool for delaying age-related working memory decline, yet the underlying structural plasticity of white matter is hardly studied.</p>Methods<p>We conducted a longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging study to investigate the effects of an intensive four-week adaptive working memory training on white matter integrity quantified by global and tract-wise mean diffusivity. We compared diffusivity measures of fiber tracts that are associated with working memory of 32 young and 20 older participants that were randomly assigned to a working memory training group or an active control group.</p>Results<p>The behavioral analysis showed an increase in working memory performance after the four-week adaptive working memory training. The neuroanatomical analysis revealed a decrease in mean diffusivity in the working memory training group after the training intervention in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus for the older adults. There was also a decrease in mean diffusivity in the working memory training group in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus for the older and young participants after the intervention.</p>Conclusion<p>This study shows that older people can benefit from working memory training by improving their working memory performance that is also reflected in terms of improved white matter integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, where the first is an essential component of the frontoparietal network known to be essential in working memory.</p>

<p>The brain is a non-linear dynamical system with a self-restoration process, which protects itself from external damage but is often a bottleneck for clinical treatment. To treat the brain to induce the desired functionality, formulation of a self-restoration process is necessary for optimal brain control. This study proposes a computational model for the brain's self-restoration process following the free-energy and degeneracy principles. Based on this model, a computational framework for brain control is established. We posited that the pre-treatment brain circuit has long been configured in response to the environmental (the other neural populations') demands on the circuit. Since the demands persist even after treatment, the treated circuit's response to the demand may gradually approximate the pre-treatment functionality. In this framework, an energy landscape of regional activities, estimated from resting-state endogenous activities by a pairwise maximum entropy model, is used to represent the pre-treatment functionality. The approximation of the pre-treatment functionality occurs via reconfiguration of interactions among neural populations within the treated circuit. To establish the current framework's construct validity, we conducted various simulations. The simulations suggested that brain control should include the self-restoration process, without which the treatment was not optimal. We also presented simulations for optimizing repetitive treatments and optimal timing of the treatment. These results suggest a plausibility of the current framework in controlling the non-linear dynamical brain with a self-restoration process.</p>

<p>The CA1, an important subregion of the hippocampus, is anatomically and functionally heterogeneous in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Here, to dissect the distinctions between the dorsal (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1) in anatomical connections, we systematically analyzed the direct inputs to dCA1 and vCA1 projection neurons (PNs) with the rabies virus-mediated retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing system in Thy1-Cre mice. Our mapping results revealed that the input proportions and distributions of dCA1 and vCA1 PNs varied significantly. Inside the hippocampal region, dCA1 and vCA1 PNs shared the same upstream brain regions, but with distinctive distribution patterns along the rostrocaudal axis. The intrahippocampal inputs to the dCA1 and vCA1 exhibited opposite trends, decreasing and increasing gradually along the dorsoventral axis, respectively. For extrahippocampal inputs, dCA1 and vCA1 shared some monosynaptic projections from certain regions such as pallidum, striatum, hypothalamus, and thalamus. However, vCA1, not dCA1, received innervations from the subregions of olfactory areas and amygdala nuclei. Characterization of the direct input networks of dCA1 and vCA1 PNs may provide a structural basis to understand the differential functions of dCA1 and vCA1.</p>

<p>Neural crest development involves a series of dynamic, carefully coordinated events that result in human disease when not properly orchestrated. Cranial neural crest cells acquire unique multipotent developmental potential upon specification to generate a broad variety of cell types. Studies of early mammalian neural crest and nervous system development often use the Cre-loxP system to lineage trace and mark cells for further investigation. Here, we carefully profile the activity of two common neural crest Cre-drivers at the end of neurulation in mice. RNA sequencing of labeled cells at E9.5 reveals that Wnt1-Cre2 marks cells with neuronal characteristics consistent with neuroepithelial expression, whereas Sox10-Cre predominantly labels the migratory neural crest. We used single-cell mRNA and single-cell ATAC sequencing to profile the expression of Wnt1 and Sox10 and identify transcription factors that may regulate the expression of Wnt1-Cre2 in the neuroepithelium and Sox10-Cre in the migratory neural crest. Our data identify cellular heterogeneity during cranial neural crest development and identify specific populations labeled by two Cre-drivers in the developing nervous system.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disorders worldwide and poses a major challenge for both affected individuals and their caregivers. AD is a progressive neurological disorder associated with high rates of brain atrophy. Despite its durable influence on human health, understanding AD has been complicated by its enigmatic and multifactorial nature. Neurofibrillary tangles and the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein are typical pathological features and fundamental causes of cognitive impairment in AD patients. Dysbiosis of oral and gut microbiota has been reported to induce and accelerate the formation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. For instance, some oral microbes can spread to the brain through cranial nerves or cellular infections, which has been suggested to increase the risk of developing AD. Importantly, the interaction between intestinal microbiota and brain cells has been recognized as influencing the development of AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, the metabolites produced by certain intestinal microorganisms can affect the activity of microglia and further mediate neuroinflammation, which is a leading cause of neuronal necrosis and AD pathogenesis. Which pathogens and associated pathways are involved in the development and progression of AD remains to be elucidated; however, it is well-known that gut microbiota and their metabolites can affect the brain by both direct and indirect means. Understanding the specific mechanisms involved in the interaction between these pathogens and the nervous system is vital for the early intervention in AD. In this review, we aim to comprehensively discuss the possible mechanistic pathways underlying the oral-brain, the gut-brain and the oral-gut-brain associations.</p>

<p>Stem cell transplantation offers promise in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Here we utilized systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression to study the biological effect of stem cell treatments in animal models of ischemic stroke. A total of 98 eligible publications were included by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to August 1, 2020. There are about 141 comparisons, involving 5,200 animals, that examined the effect of stem cell transplantation on neurological function and infarct volume as primary outcome measures in animal models for stroke. Stem cell-based therapy can improve both neurological function (effect size, −3.37; 95% confidence interval, −3.83 to −2.90) and infarct volume (effect size, −11.37; 95% confidence interval, −12.89 to −9.85) compared with controls. These results suggest that stem cell therapy could improve neurological function deficits and infarct volume, exerting potential neuroprotective effect for experimental ischemic stroke, but further clinical studies are still needed.</p>

<p>It is widely thought that brain repair does not occur, but myelin regeneration provides clear evidence to the contrary. Spontaneous remyelination may occur after injury or in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the efficiency of remyelination varies considerably between MS patients and between the lesions of each patient. Myelin repair is essential for optimal functional recovery, so a profound understanding of the cells and mechanisms involved in this process is required for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we describe how animal models and modern cell tracing and imaging methods have helped to identify the cell types involved in myelin regeneration. In addition to the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells identified in the 1990s as the principal source of remyelinating cells in the central nervous system (CNS), other cell populations, including subventricular zone-derived neural progenitors, Schwann cells, and even spared mature oligodendrocytes, have more recently emerged as potential contributors to CNS remyelination. We will also highlight the conditions known to limit endogenous repair, such as aging, chronic inflammation, and the production of extracellular matrix proteins, and the role of astrocytes and microglia in these processes. Finally, we will present the discrepancies between observations in humans and in rodents, discussing the relationship of findings in experimental models to myelin repair in humans. These considerations are particularly important from a therapeutic standpoint.</p>

<p>The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and FOXOs transcription factors play a pivotal role in cellular clearance and minimizing the accumulation of Aβ in neurodegeneration (ND). In African Americans (AAs) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the role of components of UPS and FOXOs; and whether they are amenable to exercise effects is unknown. We hypothesized that exercise can enhance cellular clearance systems during aging and ND by increasing expressions of FBXO32 and FOXO1. To test this hypothesis, we used TaqMan gene expression analysis in peripheral blood (PB) to investigate the component of UPS and FOXOs; and provide mechanistic insight at baseline, during exercise, and in both genders. At baseline, levels of FBXO32 were higher in women than in men. In our attempt to discern gender-specific exercise-related changes, we observed that levels of FBXO32 increased in men but not in women. Similarly, levels of FOXO1 increased in men only. These data suggest that a graded dose of FBXO32 and FOXO1 may be beneficial when PB cells carrying FBXO32 and FOXO1 summon into the brain in response to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) perturbation (docking station PB cells). Our observation is consistent with emerging studies that exercise allows the trafficking of blood factors. Given the significance of FBXO32 and FOXO1 to ND and associated muscle integrity, our findings may explain, at least in part, the benefits of exercise on memory, associated gait, and balance perturbation acknowledged to herald the emergence of MCI.</p>

<p>Frailty is a dynamic clinical condition characterized by the reduction of interconnections among different psychobiological domains, which leads to a homeostatic vulnerability. The association between physical frailty and cognitive dysfunctions is a possible predictor of poor prognosis in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. However, this construct has not been fully analyzed by a multidimensional neuropsychogeriatric assessment matched with multimodal neuroimaging methods in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). We have investigated cognitive dysfunctions and frailty status, assessed by both a neuropsychological evaluation and the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), in a sample of 18 bvFTD patients and compared to matched healthy controls. Gray matter (GM) volume (as assessed by voxel-based morphometry) and metabolism (on <sup>18</sup>fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) were first separately compared between groups, then voxelwise compared and correlated to each other within patients. Linear regression of the MPI was performed on those voxels presenting a significant correlation between altered GM volume and metabolism. The neuropsychological assessment reflected the diagnoses and the functional–anatomical alterations documented by neuroimaging analyses. In particular, the majority of patients presented significant executive dysfunction and mood changes in terms of apathy, depression, and anxiety. In the overall MPI score, the patients fell in the lower range (indicating an early frailty status). On imaging, they exhibited a bilateral decrease of GM density and hypometabolism involving the frontal pole, the anterior opercular region, and the anterior cingulate cortex. Greater atrophy than hypometabolism was observed in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, the triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and the ventral striatum, whereas the contrary was detected in the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area. MPI scores significantly correlated only with the co-occurrence of a decrease of GM density and hypometabolism in the right anterior insular cortex, but not with the separate pathological phenomena. Our results show a correlation between a specific pattern of co-occurring GM atrophy and hypometabolism with early frailty in bvFTD patients. These aspects, combined with executive dysfunction and mood changes, may lead to an increased risk of poor prognosis, highlighting a potentially critical and precocious role of the insula in the pathogenesis of frailty.</p>

<p>An easily scoring system to predict the risk of cognitive impairment after minor ischemic stroke has not been available. We aimed to develop and externally validate a nomogram for predicting the probability of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) among hospitalized population with minor stroke. Moreover, the association of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) with PSCI is also investigated. We prospectively conducted a developed cohort on collected data in stroke center from June 2017 to February 2018, as well as an external validation cohort between June 2018 and February 2019. The main outcome is cognitive impairment defined as &lt;22 Montreal Cognition Assessment (MoCA) score points 6 – 12 months following a minor stroke onset. Based on multivariate logistic models, the nomogram model was generated. Plasma TMAO levels were assessed at admission using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 228 participants completed the follow-up data for generating the nomogram. After multivariate logistic regression, seven variables remained independent predictors of PSCI to compose the nomogram included age, female, Fazekas score, educational level, number of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS), HbA1c, and cortical infarction. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve of model was 0.829, C index was good (0.810), and the AUC-ROC of the model applied in validation cohort was 0.812. Plasma TMAO levels were higher in patients with cognitive impairment than in them without cognitive dysfunction (median 4.56 vs. 3.22 μmol/L; p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion, this scoring system is the first nomogram developed and validated in a stroke center cohort for individualized prediction of cognitive impairment after minor stroke. Higher plasma TMAO level at admission suggests a potential marker of PSCI.</p>

Purpose<p>The objective of this study was to determine which factors influence brain iron concentrations in deep gray matter in elderly individuals and how these factors influence regional brain iron concentrations.</p>Methods<p>A total of 105 elderly individuals were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent detailed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations from October 2018 to August 2019. Among them, 44 individuals had undergone a previous MRI examination from July 2010 to August 2011. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was utilized as an indirect quantitative marker of brain iron, and the susceptibility values of deep gray matter structures were obtained. Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were used to investigate 11 possible determinants for cerebral iron deposition.</p>Results<p>Our results showed no sex- or hemisphere-related differences in susceptibility values in any of the regions studied. Aging was significantly correlated with increased insusceptibility values in almost all analyzed brain regions (except for the thalamus) when we compared the susceptibility values at the two time points. In a cross-sectional analysis, the relationship between gray matter nucleus susceptibility values and age was conducted using Pearson’s linear regression. Aging was significantly correlated with the susceptibility values of the globus pallidus (GP), putamen (Put), and caudate nucleus (CN), with the Put having the strongest correlations. In multiple linear regression models, associations with increased susceptibility values were found in the CN, Put, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus for individuals with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the patients with hypertension showed significantly reduced susceptibility values in the red nucleus and dentate nucleus. Our data suggested that smokers had increased susceptibility values in the thalamus. No significant associations were found for individuals with a history of hypercholesterolemia and Apolipoprotein E4 carrier status.</p>Conclusion<p>Our data revealed that aging, T2DM, and smoking could increase iron deposition in some deep gray matter structures. However, hypertension had the opposite effects in the red nuclei and dentate nuclei. Brain iron metabolism could be influenced by many factors in different modes. In future studies, we should strictly control for confounding factors.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/66836">Circuit organization of the excitatory sensorimotor loop through hand/forelimb S1 and M1</a></h4>

Sensory-guided limb control relies on communication across sensorimotor loops. For active touch with the hand, the longest loop is the transcortical continuation of ascending pathways, particularly the lemnisco-cortical and corticocortical pathways carrying tactile signals via the cuneate nucleus, ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamus, and primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices to reach corticospinal neurons and influence descending activity. We characterized excitatory connectivity along this pathway in the mouse. In the lemnisco-cortical leg, disynaptic cuneate→VPL→S1 connections excited mainly layer (L) 4 neurons. In the corticocortical leg, S1→M1 connections from L2/3 and L5A neurons mainly excited downstream L2/3 neurons, which excite corticospinal neurons. The findings provide a detailed new wiring diagram for the hand/forelimb-related transcortical circuit, delineating a basic but complex set of cell-type-specific feedforward excitatory connections that selectively and extensively engage diverse intratelencephalic projection neurons, thereby polysynaptically linking subcortical somatosensory input to cortical motor output to spinal cord.

<b>Background:</b> Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) is a genetic prion disease caused by the D178N mutation in the prion protein gene (<i>PRNP</i>) in coupling phase with methionine at <i>PRNP</i> 129. In 2017, we have shown that the olfactory mucosa (OM) collected from FFI patients contained traces of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> detectable by Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA).

Using fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry in rat brain slices in vitro, we showed an attenuation of electrically‐stimulated dopamine release by agonists at both GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptors. The attenuation by the baclofen was abolished in slices from animals pretreated with phencyclidine, modelling schizophrenia. 

Abstract
Dopamine signaling in nucleus accumbens (NAc) is modulated by γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting through GABA‐A and GABA‐B receptors: dysregulation of GABAergic control of dopamine function may be important in behavioral deficits in schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptor agonists on electrically stimulated dopamine release. Furthermore, we explored whether drug‐induced changes were disrupted by pretreatment with phencyclidine, which provides a well‐validated model of schizophrenia. Using brain slices from female rats, fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry was used to measure electrically stimulated dopamine release in NAc shell. Both muscimol and baclofen caused concentration‐dependent attenuation of evoked dopamine release: neither effect was changed by dihydro‐β‐erythroidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, or the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)‐type glutamate receptor antagonist, 6‐cyano‐7‐nitroquinoxaline‐2,3‐dione (CNQX), precluding indirect mechanisms using these transmitter systems in the GABAergic actions. In slices taken from rats pretreated with phencyclidine, the attenuation of evoked dopamine release by baclofen was abolished, but the attenuation by muscimol was unaffected. Since phencyclidine pretreatment was followed by drug‐free washout period of at least a week, the drug was not present during recording. Therefore, disruption of GABA‐B modulation of dopamine is due to long‐term functional changes resulting from the treatment, rather than transient changes due to the drug's presence at test. This enduring dysregulation of GABA‐B modulation of accumbal dopamine release provides a plausible mechanism through which GABA dysfunction influences accumbal dopamine leading to behavioral changes seen in schizophrenia and may provide a route for novel therapeutic strategies to treat the condition.

<p>by Sascha Frühholz, Joris Dietziker, Matthias Staib, Wiebke Trost</p>

Across many species, scream calls signal the affective significance of events to other agents. Scream calls were often thought to be of generic alarming and fearful nature, to signal potential threats, with instantaneous, involuntary, and accurate recognition by perceivers. However, scream calls are more diverse in their affective signaling nature than being limited to fearfully alarming a threat, and thus the broader sociobiological relevance of various scream types is unclear. Here we used 4 different psychoacoustic, perceptual decision-making, and neuroimaging experiments in humans to demonstrate the existence of at least 6 psychoacoustically distinctive types of scream calls of both alarming and non-alarming nature, rather than there being only screams caused by fear or aggression. Second, based on perceptual and processing sensitivity measures for decision-making during scream recognition, we found that alarm screams (with some exceptions) were overall discriminated the worst, were responded to the slowest, and were associated with a lower perceptual sensitivity for their recognition compared with non-alarm screams. Third, the neural processing of alarm compared with non-alarm screams during an implicit processing task elicited only minimal neural signal and connectivity in perceivers, contrary to the frequent assumption of a threat processing bias of the primate neural system. These findings show that scream calls are more diverse in their signaling and communicative nature in humans than previously assumed, and, in contrast to a commonly observed threat processing bias in perceptual discriminations and neural processes, we found that especially non-alarm screams, and positive screams in particular, seem to have higher efficiency in speeded discriminations and the implicit neural processing of various scream types in humans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yAAgcDOmmTs" width="1" />

Objective
Knowing explicitly where we are is an interpretation of our spatial representations. Reduplicative paramnesia is a disrupting syndrome in which patients present a firm belief of spatial mislocation. Here, we studied the largest sample of patients with delusional misidentifications of space (ie, reduplicative paramnesia) after stroke to shed light on their neurobiology.


Methods
In a prospective, cumulative, case‐control study, we screened 400 patients with acute right‐hemispheric stroke. We included 64 cases and 233 controls. First, lesions were delimited and normalized. Then, we computed structural and functional disconnection maps using methods of lesion‐track and network‐mapping. The maps were compared, controlling for confounders. Second, we built a multivariate logistic model, including clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data. Finally, we performed a nested cross‐validation of the model with a support‐vector machine analysis.


Results
The most frequent misidentification subtype was confabulatory mislocation (56%), followed by place reduplication (19%), and chimeric assimilation (13%). Our results indicate that structural disconnection is the strongest predictor of the syndrome and included 2 distinct streams, connecting right fronto‐thalamic and right occipitotemporal structures. In the multivariate model, the independent predictors of reduplicative paramnesia were the structural disconnection map, lesion sparing of right dorsal fronto‐parietal regions, age, and anosognosia. Good discrimination accuracy was demonstrated (area under the curve = 0.80 [0.75–0.85]).


Interpretation
Our results localize the anatomic circuits that may have a role in the abnormal spatial‐emotional binding and in the defective updating of spatial representations underlying reduplicative paramnesia. This novel data may contribute to better understand the pathophysiology of delusional syndromes after stroke. ANN NEUROL 2021

In the present study, the effects of electrical field stimulation (EFS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were determined in the compression model of ex vivo spinal cords by using a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC). The effects of the combination therapy are better than those of the individual treatments of PEG and EFS. The methods of establishing ex vivo spinal cord compression model in the DSGRC can be useful in the fundamental and the clinical applications of the spinal cord injury in future.

Abstract
The application of electric field stimulation (EFS) can reduce the cation influx after spinal cord injury. However, regenerated cation influx and reestablished injury potential are observed after EFS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is popular as an effective cell membrane fusion agent. This study aims to determine the effects of the combination therapy of EFS and PEG in the ex vivo spinal cord after compression. The ex vivo spinal cords of female rats with compression injury were incubated in a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC) and randomly divided into the following four groups: (1) compression group: compression only, (2) EFS group: EFS for 15 min, (3) PEG group: PEG treatment for 4 min, and (4) EFS + PEG group: EFS for 15 min and PEG treatment for 4 min. The hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed to measure the necrotic area of the spinal cords. The gap potential was detected, and the area under the curve of the gap potential was calculated. The intracellular cation concentration, membrane permeability, and compound action potential were measured and quantified. Results revealed no significant difference in the necrotic areas among different groups, and the compression model of the ex vivo spinal cord in the DSGRC had high consistency and stability. The combination therapy could attenuate cation inflow, promote cell membrane restoration, and promote the functional recovery of the spinal cord conduction after compression in ex vivo spinal cords.

Abstract
Although sex differences in learning behaviors are well documented, sexual dimorphism in the synaptic processes of encoding is only recently appreciated. Studies in male rodents have built upon the discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP), and acceptance of this activity‐dependent increase in synaptic strength as a mechanism of encoding, to identify synaptic receptors and signaling activities that coordinate the activity‐dependent remodeling of the subsynaptic actin cytoskeleton that is critical for enduring potentiation and memory. These molecular substrates together with other features of LTP, as characterized in males, have provided an explanation for a range of memory phenomena including multiple stages of consolidation, the efficacy of spaced training, and the location of engrams at the level of individual synapses. In the present report, we summarize these findings and describe more recent results from our laboratories showing that in females the same actin regulatory mechanisms are required for hippocampal LTP and memory but, in females only, the engagement of both modulatory receptors such as TrkB and synaptic signaling intermediaries including Src and ERK1/2 requires neuron‐derived estrogen and signaling through membrane‐associated estrogen receptor α (ERα). Moreover, in association with the additional ERα involvement, females exhibit a higher threshold for hippocampal LTP and spatial learning. We propose that the distinct LTP threshold in females contributes to as yet unappreciated sex differences in information processing and features of learning and memory.

<p>Olfactory perception is a complicated process involving multiple cortical and subcortical regions, of which the underlying brain dynamics are still not adequately mapped. Even in the definition of the olfactory primary cortex, there is a large degree of variation in parcellation templates used for investigating olfaction in neuroimaging studies. This complicates comparison between human olfactory neuroimaging studies. The present study aims to validate an olfactory parcellation template derived from both functional and anatomical data that applies structural connectivity (SC) to ensure robust connectivity to key secondary olfactory regions. Furthermore, exploratory analyses investigate if different olfactory parameters are associated with differences in the strength of connectivity of this structural olfactory fingerprint. By combining diffusion data with an anatomical atlas and advanced probabilistic tractography, we found that the olfactory parcellation had a robust SC network to key secondary olfactory regions. Furthermore, the study indicates that higher ratings of olfactory significance were associated with increased intra- and inter-hemispheric SC of the primary olfactory cortex. Taken together, these results suggest that the patterns of SC between the primary olfactory cortex and key secondary olfactory regions has potential to be used for investigating the nature of olfactory significance, hence strengthening the theory that individual differences in olfactory behaviour are encoded in the structural network fingerprint of the olfactory cortex.</p>

<p>The aging process and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are very heterogeneous and multifactorial, making it challenging to diagnose the disease based solely on genetic, behavioral tests, or clinical history. It is yet to be explained what ophthalmological tests relate specifically to aging and AD. To this end, we have selected the common degu (Octodon degus) as a model for aging which develops AD-like signs to conduct ophthalmological screening methods that could be clinical markers of aging and AD. We investigated ocular health using ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, intraocular pressure (IOP), and pupillary light reflex (PLR). The results showed significant presence of cataracts in adult degus and IOP was also found to increase significantly with advancing age. Age had a significant effect on the maximum pupil constriction but other pupil parameters changed in an age-independent manner (PIPR retention index, resting pupil size, constriction velocity, redilation plateau). We concluded that degus have underlying factors at play that regulate PLR and may be connected to sympathetic, parasympathetic, and melanopsin retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) deterioration. This study provides the basis for the use of ocular tests as screening methods for the aging process and monitoring of neurodegeneration in non-invasive ways.</p>

Introduction<p>The locus coeruleus noradrenergic (LC-NA) system is studied for its role in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and Major Depression Dissorder. Chemogenetics is a powerful technique for specific manipulation of the LC to investigate its functioning. Local injection of AAV2/7 viral vectors has limitations with regards to efficiency and specificity of the transduction, potentially due to low tropism of AAV2/7 for LC neurons. In this study we used a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2) vector with different volumes and viral particle numbers to achieve high and selective expression of hM3Dq, an excitatory Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), for chemogenetic modulation of LC neurons.</p>Methods<p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected in the LC with different absolute numbers of CAV2-PRSx8-hM3Dq-mCherry physical particles (0.1E9, 1E9, 5E9,10E9, or 20E9 pp) using different volumes (LowV = 3 nl × 300 nl, MediumV = 3 × 600 nl, HighV = 3 × 1200 nl). Two weeks post-injection, double-labeling immunohistochemistry for dopamine β hydroxylase (DBH) and mCherry was performed to determine hM3Dq expression and its specificity for LC neurons. The size of the transduced LC was compared to the contralateral LC to identify signs of toxicity.</p>Results<p>Administration of Medium volume (3 × 600 nl) and 1E9 particles resulted in high expression levels with 87.3 ± 9.8% of LC neurons expressing hM3Dq, but low specificity with 36.2 ± 17.3% of hM3Dq expression in non-LC neurons. The most diluted conditions (Low volume_0.1E pp and Medium Volume_0.1E pp) presented similar high transduction of LC neurons (70.9 ± 12.7 and 77.2 ± 9.8%) with lower aspecificity (5.5 ± 3.5 and 4.0 ± 1.9%, respectively). Signs of toxicity were observed in all undiluted conditions as evidenced by a decreased size of the transduced LC.</p>Conclusion<p>This study identified optimal conditions (Low and Medium Volume with 0.1E9 particles of CAV2-PRSx8-hM3Dq-mCherry) for safe and specific transduction of LC neurons with excitatory DREADDs to study the role of the LC-NA system in health and disease.</p>

Objectives<p>The severity of neurocognitive impairment increases with prematurity. However, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our aim was firstly to identify multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers that differ according to the degree of prematurity, and secondly to evaluate the impact of clinical complications on these markers.</p>Materials and Methods<p>We prospectively enrolled preterm infants who were divided into two groups according to their degree of prematurity: extremely preterm (&lt;28 weeks’ gestational age) and very preterm (28–32 weeks’ gestational age). They underwent a multiparametric brain MRI scan at term-equivalent age including morphological, diffusion tensor and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion sequences. We quantified overall and regional volumes, diffusion parameters, and cerebral blood flow (CBF). We then compared the parameters for the two groups. We also assessed the effects of clinical data and potential MRI morphological abnormalities on those parameters.</p>Results<p>Thirty-four preterm infants were included. Extremely preterm infants (n = 13) had significantly higher frontal relative volumes (p = 0.04), frontal GM relative volumes (p = 0.03), and regional CBF than very preterm infants, but they had lower brainstem and insular relative volumes (respectively p = 0.008 and 0.04). Preterm infants with WM lesions on MRI had significantly lower overall GM CBF (13.3 ± 2 ml/100 g/min versus 17.7 ± 2.5, &lt; ml/100 g/min p = 0.03).</p>Conclusion<p>Magnetic resonance imaging brain scans performed at term-equivalent age in preterm infants provide quantitative imaging parameters that differ with respect to the degree of prematurity, related to brain maturation.</p>

<p>Herein, we propose a real-time stable control gait switching method for the exoskeleton rehabilitation robot. Exoskeleton rehabilitation robots have been extensively developed during the past decade and are able to offer valuable motor ability to paraplegics. However, achieving stable states of the human-exoskeleton system while conserving wearer strength remains challenging. The constant switching of gaits during walking may affect the center of gravity, resulting in imbalance of human–exoskeleton system. In this study, it was determined that forming an equilateral triangle with two crutch-supporting points and a supporting leg has a positive impact on walking stability and ergonomic interaction. First, the gaits planning and stability analysis based on human kinematics model and zero moment point method for the lower limb exoskeleton are demonstrated. Second, a neural interface based on surface electromyography (sEMG), which realizes the intention recognition and muscle fatigue estimation, is constructed. Third, the stability of human–exoskeleton system and ergonomic effects are tested through different gaits with planned and unplanned gait switching strategy on the SIAT lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton. The intention recognition based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model can achieve an accuracy of nearly 99%. The experimental results verified the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed gait switching method for enhancing stability and ergonomic effects of lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.621716">Brain Density Clustering Analysis: A New Approach to Brain Functional Dynamics</a></h4>

Background<p>A number of studies in recent years have explored whole-brain dynamic connectivity using pairwise approaches. There has been less focus on trying to analyze brain dynamics in higher dimensions over time.</p>Methods<p>We introduce a new approach that analyzes time series trajectories to identify high traffic nodes in a high dimensional space. First, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are decomposed using spatial ICA to a set of maps and their associated time series. Next, density is calculated for each time point and high-density points are clustered to identify a small set of high traffic nodes. We validated our method using simulations and then implemented it on a real data set.</p>Results<p>We present a novel approach that captures dynamics within a high dimensional space and also does not use any windowing in contrast to many existing approaches. The approach enables one to characterize and study the time series in a potentially high dimensional space, rather than looking at each component pair separately. Our results show that schizophrenia patients have a lower dynamism compared to healthy controls. In addition, we find patients spend more time in nodes associated with the default mode network and less time in components strongly correlated with auditory and sensorimotor regions. Interestingly, we also found that subjects oscillate between state pairs that show opposite spatial maps, suggesting an oscillatory pattern.</p>Conclusion<p>Our proposed method provides a novel approach to analyze the data in its native high dimensional space and can possibly provide new information that is undetectable using other methods.</p>

<p>Neurotransmitter transporters limit spillover between synapses and maintain the extracellular neurotransmitter concentration at low yet physiologically meaningful levels. They also exert a key role in providing precursors for neurotransmitter biosynthesis. In many cases, neurons and astrocytes contain a large intracellular pool of transporters that can be redistributed and stabilized in the plasma membrane following activation of different signaling pathways. This means that the uptake capacity of the brain neuropil for different neurotransmitters can be dynamically regulated over the course of minutes, as an indirect consequence of changes in neuronal activity, blood flow, cell-to-cell interactions, etc. Here we discuss recent advances in the mechanisms that control the cell membrane trafficking and biophysical properties of transporters for the excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory neurotransmitters glutamate, GABA, and dopamine.</p>

<p>Objective: To examine whether prefrontal electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for screening dementia.</p><p>Methods: We estimated the global cognitive decline using the results of Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), measurements of brain activity from resting-state EEG, responses elicited by auditory stimulation [sensory event-related potential (ERP)], and selective attention tasks (selective-attention ERP) from 122 elderly participants (dementia, 35; control, 87). We investigated that the association between MMSE and each EEG/ERP variable by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and performing univariate linear regression analysis. Kernel density estimation was used to examine the distribution of each EEG/ERP variable in the dementia and non-dementia groups. Both Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses with the estimated odds ratios were conducted to assess the associations between the EEG/ERP variables and dementia prevalence. To develop the predictive models, five-fold cross-validation was applied to multiple classification algorithms.</p><p>Results: Most prefrontal EEG/ERP variables, previously known to be associated with cognitive decline, show correlations with the MMSE score (strongest correlation has |r| = 0.68). Although variables such as the frontal asymmetry of the resting-state EEG are not well correlated with the MMSE score, they indicate risk factors for dementia. The selective-attention ERP and resting-state EEG variables outperform the MMSE scores in dementia prediction (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.891, 0.824, and 0.803, respectively). In addition, combining EEG/ERP variables and MMSE scores improves the model predictive performance, whereas adding demographic risk factors do not improve the prediction accuracy.</p><p>Conclusion: Prefrontal EEG markers outperform MMSE scores in predicting dementia, and additional prediction accuracy is expected when combining them with MMSE scores.</p><p>Significance: Prefrontal EEG is effective for screening dementia when used independently or in combination with MMSE.</p>

<p>Purpose: Imaging of the choroid may detect the microvascular changes associated with early-onset dementia (EOD) and may represent an indicator for detection of the disease. We aimed to analyze the in vivo choriocapillaris (CC) flow density in EOD patients using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and evaluate the association with its clinical measures.</p><p>Methods: This cross-sectional study used the OCTA to image and analyze the choriocapillaris (CC) of 25 EOD patients and 20 healthy controls. Choriocapillaris flow density in the 3 mm area and 6 mm area was measured by an inbuilt algorithm in the OCT tool. Brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive assessment was done and recorded.</p><p>Results: Significantly reduced capillary flow density of the choriocapillaris was seen in EOD patients when compared to healthy controls in the 3.0 mm (P = 0.001) and 6.0 mm (P &lt; 0.001) area respectively. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in EOD patients positively correlated with choriocapillaris flow density in the 3 mm area (Rho = 0.466, P = 0.021). Disease duration of EOD patients also negatively correlated with choriocapillaris density in the 3 mm area (Rho = −0.497, P = 0.008).</p><p>Discussion: Our report suggests that choriocapillaris damage may be a potential indicator of early-onset dementia. Microvascular impairment may be involved in the early phase of dementia without aging playing a role in its impairment.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, ChiCTR2000041386.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most fatal subtype of stroke with high disability and high mortality rates, and there is no effective treatment. The predilection site of ICH is in the area of the basal ganglia and internal capsule (IC), where exist abundant white matter (WM) fiber tracts, such as the corticospinal tract (CST) in the IC. Proximal or distal white matter injury (WMI) caused by intracerebral parenchymal hemorrhage is closely associated with poor prognosis after ICH, especially motor and sensory dysfunction. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in WMI are quite complex and still far from clear. In recent years, the neuroprotection and repairment capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been widely investigated after ICH. MSCs exert many unique biological effects, including self-recovery by producing growth factors and cytokines, regenerative repair, immunomodulation, and neuroprotection against oxidative stress, providing a promising cellular therapeutic approach for the treatment of WMI. Taken together, our goal is to discuss the characteristics of WMI following ICH, including the mechanism and potential promising therapeutic targets of MSCs, aiming at providing new clues for future therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Currently there is a shortage of biomarkers for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in aging populations. Retinal vessels offer a unique and accessible “window” to study the microvasculature in vivo. However, the relationship between the retinal microvasculature and stroke is not entirely clear. To investigate the retinal microvascular characteristics in stroke, we recruited patients with stroke and age-matched control subjects from a tertiary hospital in China. The macular vessel density (VD) in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) metrics, and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) measured optic disc VD were recorded for analysis. A total of 189 patients with stroke and 195 control subjects were included. After adjusting for sex, visual acuity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, a history of smoking, levels of hemoglobulin (HbA1c), cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the macular VD of SCP and DCP in all sectors was decreased in patients with stroke. In the stroke group, the VD around the FAZ and the VD of the optic disk were lower. Logistic regression found the parafovea-superior-hemi VD of DCP &gt; 54.53% [odds ratio (OR): 0.169] as a protective factor of stroke. Using the integration of all OCTA parameters and traditional risk factors, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve of distinguishing patients with stroke was 0.962, with a sensitivity of 0.944 and a specificity of 0.871. Our study demonstrates that the retinal VD is decreased in patients with stroke independently of the traditional risk factors of stroke, which may shed light on the monitoring of stroke using the retinal microvascular parameters.</p>

<p>Background: There has been an increasing interest in studying electroencephalogram (EEG) as a biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease but the association between EEG signals and patients’ neuropsychiatric symptoms remains unclear. We studied EEG signals of patients with Alzheimer’s disease to explore the associations between patients’ neuropsychiatric symptoms and clusters of patients based on their EEG powers.</p><p>Methods: A total of 69 patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (the Clinical Dementia Rating = 1) were enrolled and their EEG signals from 19 channels/electrodes were recorded in three sessions for each patient. The EEG power was calculated by Fourier transform for the four frequency bands (beta: 13–40 Hz, alpha: 8–13 Hz, theta: 4–8 Hz, and delta: &lt;4 Hz). We performed K-means cluster analysis to classify the 69 patients into two distinct groups by the log-transformed EEG powers (4 frequency bands × 19 channels) for the three EEG sessions. In each session, both clusters were compared with each other to assess the differences in their behavioral/psychological symptoms in terms of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score.</p><p>Results: While EEG band powers were highly consistent across all three sessions before clustering, EEG band powers were different between the two clusters in each session, especially for the delta waves. The delta band powers differed significantly between the two clusters in most channels across the three sessions. Patients’ demographics and cognitive function were not different between both clusters. However, their behavioral/psychological symptoms were different between the two clusters classified based on EEG powers. A higher NPI score was associated with the clustering of higher EEG powers.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study suggests that EEG power correlates to behavioral and psychological symptoms among patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease. The clustering approach of EEG signals may provide a novel and cost-effective method to differentiate the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and/or predict the prognosis for Alzheimer’s patients.</p>

Binge ethanol activates astrocytes resulting in an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity (red) in the basolateral amygdala. When astrocytic receptor signaling was activated using GFAP‐Gq‐GPCR designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, it decreased ethanol consumption and ameliorated alcohol‐induced depression of glutamate in the amygdala.

Abstract
Binge drinking is a common occurrence in the United States, but a high concentration of alcohol in the blood has been shown to have reinforcing and reciprocal effects on the neuroimmune system in both dependent and non‐dependent scenarios. The first part of this study examined alcohol's effects on the astrocytic response in the central amygdala and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in a non‐dependent model. C57BL/6J mice were given access to either ethanol, water, or sucrose during a “drinking in the dark” paradigm, and astrocyte number and astrogliosis were measured using immunohistochemistry. Results indicate that non‐dependent consumption increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) density but not the number of GFAP+ cells, suggesting that non‐dependent ethanol is sufficient to elicit astrocyte activation. The second part of this study examined how astrocytes impacted behaviors and the neurochemistry related to alcohol using the chemogenetic tool, DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). Transgenic GFAP‐hM3Dq mice were administered clozapine N‐oxide both peripherally, affecting the entire central nervous system (CNS), or directly into the BLA. In both instances, GFAP‐Gq‐signaling activation significantly reduced ethanol consumption and correlating blood ethanol concentrations. However, GFAP‐Gq‐DREADD activation throughout the CNS had more broad effects resulting in decreased locomotor activity and sucrose consumption. More targeted GFAP‐Gq‐signaling activation in the BLA only impacted ethanol consumption. Finally, a glutamate assay revealed that after GFAP‐Gq‐signaling activation glutamate concentrations in the amygdala were partially normalized to control levels. Altogether, these studies support the theory that astrocytes represent a viable target for alcohol use disorder therapies.

Abstract
Behavioral inhibition is a temperamental disposition to react warily when confronted by unfamiliar people, objects, or events. Behaviorally inhibited children are at greater risk of developing anxiety disorders later in life. Previous studies reported that individuals with a history of childhood behavioral inhibition exhibit abnormal activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. However, few studies have investigated the structural differences that may underlie these functional abnormalities. In this exploratory study, we evaluated rhesus monkeys exhibiting a phenotype consistent with human behavioral inhibition. We performed quantitative neuroanatomical analyses that cannot be performed in humans including estimates of the volume and neuron number of distinct hippocampal regions and amygdala nuclei in behaviorally inhibited and control rhesus monkeys. Behaviorally inhibited monkeys had larger volumes of the rostral third of the hippocampal field CA3, smaller volumes of the rostral third of CA2, and smaller volumes of the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala. Furthermore, behaviorally inhibited monkeys had fewer neurons in the rostral third of CA2. These structural differences may contribute to the functional abnormalities in the hippocampus and amygdala of behaviorally inhibited individuals. These structural findings in monkeys are consistent with a reduced modulation of amygdala activity via prefrontal cortex projections to the accessory basal nucleus. Given the putative roles of the amygdala in affective processing, CA3 in associative learning and CA2 in social memory, increased amygdala and CA3 activity, and diminished CA2 structure and function, may be associated with increased social anxiety and the heritability of behavioral inhibition. The findings from this exploratory study compel follow‐up investigations with larger sample sizes and additional analyses to provide greater insight and more definitive answers regarding the neurobiological bases of behavioral inhibition.

<p>by Steffen Lange, Benjamin M. Friedrich</p>

Sperm of marine invertebrates have to find eggs cells in the ocean. Turbulent flows mix sperm and egg cells up to the millimeter scale; below this, active swimming and chemotaxis become important. Previous work addressed either turbulent mixing or chemotaxis in still water. Here, we present a general theory of sperm chemotaxis inside the smallest eddies of turbulent flow, where signaling molecules released by egg cells are spread into thin concentration filaments. Sperm cells ‘surf’ along these filaments towards the egg. External flows make filaments longer, but also thinner. These opposing effects set an optimal flow strength. The optimum predicted by our theory matches flow measurements in shallow coastal waters. Our theory quantitatively agrees with two previous fertilization experiments in Taylor-Couette chambers and provides a mechanistic understanding of these early experiments. ‘Surfing along concentration filaments’ could be a paradigm for navigation in complex environments in the presence of turbulent flow.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fSpDhUKA9NQ" width="1" />

<p>by Maria Kleshnina, Sabrina S. Streipert, Jerzy A. Filar, Krishnendu Chatterjee</p>

A game of rock-paper-scissors is an interesting example of an interaction where none of the pure strategies strictly dominates all others, leading to a cyclic pattern. In this work, we consider an unstable version of rock-paper-scissors dynamics and allow individuals to make behavioural mistakes during the strategy execution. We show that such an assumption can break a cyclic relationship leading to a stable equilibrium emerging with only one strategy surviving. We consider two cases: completely random mistakes when individuals have no bias towards any strategy and a general form of mistakes. Then, we determine conditions for a strategy to dominate all other strategies. However, given that individuals who adopt a dominating strategy are still prone to behavioural mistakes in the observed behaviour, we may still observe extinct strategies. That is, behavioural mistakes in strategy execution stabilise evolutionary dynamics leading to an evolutionary stable and, potentially, mixed co-existence equilibrium.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wMx6qU8nMMc" width="1" />

Chemical insecticides have been heavily employed as the most effective measure for control of agricultural and medical pests, but evolution of resistance by pests threatens the sustainability of this approach. Resistance-conferring mutations sometimes impose fitness costs, which may drive subsequent evolution of compensatory modifier mutations alleviating the costs of resistance. However, how modifier mutations evolve and function to overcome the fitness cost of resistance still remains unknown. Here we show that overexpression of P450s not only confers imidacloprid resistance in the brown planthopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>, the most voracious pest of rice, but also leads to elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through metabolism of imidacloprid and host plant compounds. The inevitable production of ROS incurs a fitness cost to the pest, which drives the increase or fixation of the compensatory modifier allele T65549 within the promoter region of <i>N</i>. <i>lugens peroxiredoxin</i> (<i>NlPrx</i>) in the pest populations. T65549 allele in turn upregulates the expression of <i>NlPrx</i> and thus increases resistant individuals’ ability to clear the cost-incurring ROS of any source. The frequent involvement of P450s in insecticide resistance and their capacity to produce ROS while metabolizing their substrates suggest that peroxiredoxin or other ROS-scavenging genes may be among the common modifier genes for alleviating the fitness cost of insecticide resistance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7kTY1Rr0DG4" width="1" />

Sarcomeres, the basic contractile units of striated muscle cells, contain arrays of thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments that slide past each other during contraction. The Ig-like domain-containing protein myotilin provides structural integrity to Z-discs—the boundaries between adjacent sarcomeres. Myotilin binds to Z-disc components, including F-actin and α-actinin-2, but the molecular mechanism of binding and implications of these interactions on Z-disc integrity are still elusive. To illuminate them, we used a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and biochemical and molecular biophysics approaches. We discovered that myotilin displays conformational ensembles in solution. We generated a structural model of the F-actin:myotilin complex that revealed how myotilin interacts with and stabilizes F-actin via its Ig-like domains and flanking regions. Mutant myotilin designed with impaired F-actin binding showed increased dynamics in cells. Structural analyses and competition assays uncovered that myotilin displaces tropomyosin from F-actin. Our findings suggest a novel role of myotilin as a co-organizer of Z-disc assembly and advance our mechanistic understanding of myotilin’s structural role in Z-discs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z5geBhqQbs4" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26074?af=R">Characterization of the Insular Role in Cardiac Function through Intracranial Electrical Stimulation of the Human Insula</a></h4>

Objective
The link between brain function and cardiovascular dynamics is an important issue yet to be elucidated completely. The insula is a neocortical brain area that is thought to have a cardiac chronotropic regulatory function, but its role in cardiac contractility is unknown. We aimed to analyze the variability in heart rate and cardiac contractility after functional activation of different insular regions through direct electrical stimulation (E‐stim) in humans.


Methods
This was an observational, prospective study, including patients admitted for stereo‐electroencephalographic recording because of refractory epilepsy, in whom the insular cortex was implanted. Patients with anatomical or electrophysiological insular abnormalities and those in whom E‐stim produced subjective symptoms were excluded. Variations in heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed during insular E‐stim and compared with control E‐stim of non‐eloquent brain regions and sham stimulations.


Results
Ten patients were included, 5 implanted in the right insula (52 E‐stim) and 5 in the left (37 E‐stim). Demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. E‐stim of both right and left insulas induced a significant decrease of the CO and HR, and an increase of the SV. E‐stim of control electrodes and sham stimulations were not associated with variations in cardiac function. Blood pressure and respiratory rate remained unaltered.


Interpretation
Our results suggest a direct chronotropic and inotropic cardiac depressor function of the right and left insulas. The evidence of an insular direct cardiac regulatory function might open a path in the prevention or treatment of heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2021

These are the identified wide‐field and medium‐field amacrine cells that made synapses onto a broad thorny ganglion cell (purple) in central macaque retina. The wide field amacrine cells included three wiry amacrine cells (green), a semilunar cell (aqua) and a stellate wavy cell (yellow). The medium‐field cells included a starburst amacrine cell (red) and a spiny amacrine cell (orange). These amacrine cell inputs are expected to mediate the responses of the broad thorny ganglion cells to stimuli outside their classical receptive fields.







Abstract
In primates, broad thorny retinal ganglion cells are highly sensitive to small, moving stimuli. They have tortuous, fine dendrites with many short, spine‐like branches that occupy three contiguous strata in the middle of the inner plexiform layer. The neural circuits that generate their responses to moving stimuli are not well‐understood, and that was the goal of this study. A connectome from central macaque retina was generated by serial block‐face scanning electron microscopy, a broad thorny cell was reconstructed, and its synaptic inputs were analyzed. It received fewer than 2% of its inputs from both ON and OFF types of bipolar cells; the vast majority of its inputs were from amacrine cells. The presynaptic amacrine cells were reconstructed, and seven types were identified based on their characteristic morphology. Two types of narrow‐field cells, knotty bistratified type 1 and wavy multistratified type 2, were identified. Two types of medium‐field amacrine cells, ON starburst and spiny, were also presynaptic to the broad thorny cell. Three types of wide‐field amacrine cells, wiry type 2, stellate wavy and semilunar type 2, also made synapses onto the broad thorny cell. Physiological experiments using a macaque retinal preparation in vitro confirmed that broad thorny cells received robust excitatory input from both the ON and the OFF pathways. Given the paucity of bipolar cell inputs, it is likely that amacrine cells provided much of the excitatory input, in addition to inhibitory input.

Long‐term stress is linked to depression in humans. We used a rat learned helplessness model of depression to study the effects on synaptic proteins important for plasticity. With quantitative immunogold EM we show an increase in NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B in the PSD of excitatory synapses in CA1 area of hippocampus.






Abstract
Major depressive disorder involves changes in synaptic structure and function, but the molecular underpinnings of these changes are still not established. In an initial pilot experiment, whole‐brain synaptosome screening with quantitative western blotting was performed to identify synaptic proteins that may show concentration changes in a congenital rat learned helplessness model of depression. We found that the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits GluN2A/GluN2B, activity‐regulated cytoskeleton‐associated protein (Arc) and syntaxin‐1 showed significant concentration differences between congenitally learned helpless (LH) and non‐learned helpless (NLH) rats. Having identified these three proteins, we then performed more elaborate quantitative immunogold electron microscopic analyses of the proteins in a specific synapse type in the dorsal hippocampus: the Schaffer collateral synapse in the CA1 region. We expanded the setup to include also un‐stressed wild‐type (WT) rats. The concentrations of the proteins in the LH and NLH groups were compared to WT animals. In this specific synapse, we found that the concentration of NMDARs was increased in postsynaptic spines in both LH and NLH rats. The concentration of Arc was significantly increased in postsynaptic densities in LH animals as well as in presynaptic cytoplasm of NLH rats. The concentration of syntaxin‐1 was significantly increased in both presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic spines in LH animals, while pre‐ and postsynaptic syntaxin‐1 concentrations were significantly decreased in NLH animals. These protein changes suggest pathways by which synaptic plasticity may be increased in dorsal hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses during depression, corresponding to decreased synaptic stability.

<p>Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) into proteinaceous deposits is a pathological hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Numerous lines of evidence indicate that the accumulation of toxic oligomeric and prefibrillar αSyn species may underpin the cellular toxicity and spread of pathology between cells. Therefore, aggregation of αSyn is considered a priority target for drug development, as aggregation inhibitors are expected to reduce αSyn toxicity and serve as therapeutic agents. Here, we used the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a platform for the identification of short peptides that inhibit αSyn aggregation and toxicity. A library consisting of approximately one million peptide variants was utilized in two high-throughput screening approaches for isolation of library representatives that reduce αSyn-associated toxicity and aggregation. Seven peptides were isolated that were able to suppress specifically αSyn toxicity and aggregation in living cells. Expression of the peptides in yeast reduced the accumulation of αSyn-induced reactive oxygen species and increased cell viability. Next, the peptides were chemically synthesized and probed for their ability to modulate αSyn aggregation in vitro. Two synthetic peptides, K84s and K102s, of 25 and 19 amino acids, respectively, significantly inhibited αSyn oligomerization and aggregation at sub-stoichiometric molar ratios. Importantly, K84s reduced αSyn aggregation in human cells. These peptides represent promising αSyn aggregation antagonists for the development of future therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Hypoxic-ischemia (HI) is a major cause of acquired visual impairment in children from developed countries. Previous studies have shown that systemic administration of 7,8-dihydroxyavone (DHF), a selective tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist, provides long-term neuroprotection against HI injury in an immature retina. However, the target genes and the mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of TrkB signaling are not known. In the present study, we induced an HI retinal injury through unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by 8% oxygen for 2 h in P7 rat pups. DHF was administered intraperitoneally 2 h before and 18 h after the HI injury. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was used to identify the target genes upregulated after the DHF treatment, which was then confirmed with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR and a western blot. Effects of the downstream mediator of DHF were assessed using an intravitreal injection of neutralizing antibody 4 h after DHF administration (24 h after HI). Meanwhile, the target protein was injected into the vitreous 24 h after HI to validate its protective effect when exogenously supplemented. We found that systemic DHF treatment after HI significantly increased the expression of the artemin (ARTN) gene and protein at P8 and P10, respectively. The neuroprotective effects of DHF were inhibited after the ARTN protein blockade, with an increase in neuroinflammation and astrogliosis. ARTN treatment showed long-term protection against HI injury at both the histopathological and functional levels. The neuroprotective effects of ARTN were related to a decrease in microglial activation at P17 and attenuation of astrogliosis at P29. ARTN enhances phosphorylation of RET, ERK, and JNK, but not AKT or p38 in the immature retina. Altogether, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of a TrkB agonist is partially exerted through a mechanism that involves ARTN because the protective effect is ameliorated by ARTN sequestration. ARTN treatment after HI injury protects the immature retina by attenuating late neuroinflammation and astrogliosis in the immature retina relating to the ARTN/RET/JNK/ERK signaling pathway. ARTN may be a strategy by which to provide long-term protection in the immature retina against HI injury.</p>

<p>The cerebellum harbors a circadian clock that can be shifted by scheduled mealtime and participates in behavioral anticipation of food access. Large-scale two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with mass spectrometry was used to identify day–night variations in the cerebellar proteome of mice fed either during daytime or nighttime. Experimental conditions led to modified expression of 89 cerebellar proteins contained in 63 protein spots. Five and 33 spots were changed respectively by time-of-day or feeding conditions. Strikingly, several proteins of the heat-shock protein family (i.e., Hsp90aa1, 90ab1, 90b1, and Hspa2, 4, 5, 8, 9) were down-regulated in the cerebellum of daytime food-restricted mice. This was also the case for brain fatty acid protein (Fabp7) and enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Ndufs1) or folate metabolism (Aldh1l1). In contrast, aldolase C (Aldoc or zebrin II) and pyruvate carboxylase (Pc), two enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and vesicle-fusing ATPase (Nsf) were up-regulated during daytime restricted feeding, possibly reflecting increased neuronal activity. Significant feeding × time-of-day interactions were found for changes in the intensity of 20 spots. Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(o) subunit alpha (Gnao1) was more expressed in the cerebellum before food access. Neuronal calcium-sensor proteins [i.e., parvalbumin (Pvalb) and visinin-like protein 1 (Vsnl1)] were inversely regulated in daytime food-restricted mice, compared to control mice fed at night. Furthermore, expression of three enzymes modulating the circadian clockwork, namely heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (Hnrnpk), serine/threonine-protein phosphatases 1 (Ppp1cc and Ppp1cb subunits) and 5 (Ppp5), was differentially altered by daytime restricted feeding. Besides cerebellar proteins affected only by feeding conditions or daily cues, specific changes in in protein abundance before food access may be related to behavioral anticipation of food access and/or feeding-induced shift of the cerebellar clockwork.</p>

<p>Altered function or presence of inhibitory neurons is documented in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the mechanism underlying this alternation is poorly understood. One major subtype of inhibitory neurons altered is the parvalbumin (PV)-containing neurons with reduced density and intensity in ASD patients and model mice. A subpopulation of PV<sup>+</sup> neurons expresses perineuronal nets (PNN). To better understand whether the relationship between PV and PNN is altered in ASD, we measured quantitatively the intensities of PV and PNN in single PV<sup>+</sup> neurons in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL-PFC) of a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD at different ages. We found a decreased PV intensity but increased PNN intensity in VPA mice. The relationship between PV and PNN intensities is altered in VPA mice, likely due to an “abnormal” subpopulation of neurons with an altered PV-PNN relationship. Furthermore, reducing PNN level using in vivo injection of chondroitinase ABC corrects the PV expression in adult VPA mice. We suggest that the interaction between PV and PNN is disrupted in PV<sup>+</sup> neurons in VPA mice which may contribute to the pathology in ASD.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aging population. Evidence implicates elevated soluble oligomeric Aβ as one of the primary triggers during the prodromic phase leading to AD, effected largely via hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. At low, physiological levels (pM-nM), however, oligomeric Aβ has been found to regulate synaptic plasticity as a neuromodulator. Through mutational analysis, we found a core hexapeptide sequence within the N-terminal domain of Aβ (N-Aβcore) accounting for its physiological activity, and subsequently found that the N-Aβcore peptide is neuroprotective. Here, we characterized the neuroprotective potential of the N-Aβcore against dysfunction of synaptic plasticity assessed in ex vivo hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 mice, specifically hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). The N-Aβcore was shown to reverse impairment in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 model mice, both for LTP and LTD. The reversal by the N-Aβcore correlated with alleviation of downregulation of hippocampal AMPA-type glutamate receptors in preparations from 5xFAD mice. The action of the N-Aβcore depended upon a critical di-histidine sequence and involved the phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase pathway via mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Together, the present findings indicate that the non-toxic N-Aβcore hexapeptide is not only neuroprotective at the cellular level but is able to reverse synaptic dysfunction in AD-like models, specifically alterations in synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>Neural interfacing devices using penetrating microelectrode arrays have emerged as an important tool in both neuroscience research and medical applications. These implantable microelectrode arrays enable communication between man-made devices and the nervous system by detecting and/or evoking neuronal activities. Recent years have seen rapid development of electrodes fabricated using flexible, ultrathin carbon-based microfibers. Compared to electrodes fabricated using rigid materials and larger cross-sections, these microfiber electrodes have been shown to reduce foreign body responses after implantation, with improved signal-to-noise ratio for neural recording and enhanced resolution for neural stimulation. Here, we review recent progress of carbon-based microfiber electrodes in terms of material composition and fabrication technology. The remaining challenges and future directions for development of these arrays will also be discussed. Overall, these microfiber electrodes are expected to improve the longevity and reliability of neural interfacing devices.</p>

<p>In neurodegenerative diseases, neurodegeneration has been related to several mitochondrial dynamics imbalances such as excessive fragmentation of mitochondria, impaired mitophagy, and blocked mitochondria mitochondrial transport in axons. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, and essential for energy conversion, neuron survival, and cell death. As mitochondrial dynamics have a significant influence on homeostasis, in this review, we mainly discuss the role of mitochondrial dynamics in several neurodegenerative diseases. There is evidence that several mitochondrial dynamics-associated proteins, as well as related pathways, have roles in the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases with an impact on mitochondrial functions and metabolism. However, specific pathological mechanisms need to be better understood in order to propose new therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dynamics that have shown promise in recent studies.</p>

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are widely utilized for the semantic segmentation of dense nerve tissues from light and electron microscopy (EM) image data; the goal of this technique is to achieve efficient and accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of the vasculature and neural networks in the brain. The success of these tasks heavily depends on the amount, and especially the quality, of the human-annotated labels fed into DCNNs. However, it is often difficult to acquire the gold standard of human-annotated labels for dense nerve tissues; human annotations inevitably contain discrepancies or even errors, which substantially impact the performance of DCNNs. Thus, a novel boosting framework consisting of a DCNN for multilabel semantic segmentation with a customized Dice-logarithmic loss function, a fusion module combining the annotated labels and the corresponding predictions from the DCNN, and a boosting algorithm to sequentially update the sample weights during network training iterations was proposed to systematically improve the quality of the annotated labels; this framework eventually resulted in improved segmentation task performance. The microoptical sectioning tomography (MOST) dataset was then employed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The result indicated that the framework, even trained with a dataset including some poor-quality human-annotated labels, achieved state-of-the-art performance in the segmentation of somata and vessels in the mouse brain. Thus, the proposed technique of artificial intelligence could advance neuroscience research.</p>

Purpose<p>This study aims to investigate the agreement of three software packages in measuring baseline ischemic core volume (ICV) and penumbra volume (PV), and determine their predictive values for unfavorable clinical outcome in patients with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).</p>Methods<p>Patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) were recruited. Baseline CTP measurements including ICV and PV were calculated by three software packages of IntelliSpace Portal (ISP), Rapid Processing of Perfusion and Diffusion (RAPID), and fast-processing of ischemic stroke (F-STROKE). All patients received EVT, and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days after EVT was assessed to determine the clinical outcomes (favorable: mRS = 0–2; unfavorable: mRS = 3–6). The agreement of CTP measurements among three software packages was determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The associations between CTP measurements and unfavorable clinical outcome were analyzed using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curves were conducted to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of CTP measurements in predicting unfavorable clinical outcome.</p>Results<p>Of 223 recruited patients (68.2 ± 11.3 years old; 145 males), 17.0% had unfavorable clinical outcome after EVT. Excellent agreement between F-STROKE and RAPID was found in measuring ICV (ICC 0.965; 95% CI 0.956–0.973) and PV (ICC 0.966; 95% CI 0.956–0.973). ICVs measured by three software packages were significantly associated with unfavorable clinical outcome before (odds ratios 1.012–1.018, all P &lt; 0.01) and after (odds ratios 1.003–1.014, all P &lt; 0.05) adjusted for confounding factors (age, gender, TOAST classification, and NIHSS on admission). In predicting unfavorable clinical outcome, ICV measured by F-STROKE showed similar performance to that measured by RAPID (AUC 0.701 vs. 0.717) but higher performance than that measured by ISP (AUC 0.629).</p>Conclusions<p>The software of F-STROKE has excellent agreement with the widely used analysis tool of RAPID in measuring ICV and PV. The ischemic core volume measured by both F-STROKE and RAPID is a stronger predictor for unfavorable clinical outcome after EVT compared to ISP.</p>

Purpose<p>To evaluate the prevalence and treatment patterns of speech and language disorders in Germany.</p>Methods<p>A retrospective analysis of data collected from 32% of the German population, insured by the statutory German health insurance (AOK, Local Health Care Funds). We used The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, German Modification (ICD-10 GM) codes for stuttering (F98.5), cluttering (F98.6), and developmental disorders of speech and language (F80) to identify prevalent and newly diagnosed cases each year. Prescription and speech therapy reimbursement data were used to evaluate treatment patterns.</p>Results<p>In 2017, 27,977 patients of all ages were diagnosed with stuttering (21,045 males, 75% and 6,932 females, 25%). Stuttering prevalence peaks at age 5 years (boys, 0.89% and girls, 0.40%). Cluttering was diagnosed in 1,800 patients of all ages (1,287 males, 71.5% and 513 females, 28.5%). Developmental disorders of speech and language were identified in 555,774 AOK-insurants (61.2% males and 38.8% females). Treatment data indicate a substantial proportion newly diagnosed stuttering individuals receive treatment (up to 45% of 6-year-old patients), with slightly fewer than 20 sessions per year, on average. We confirmed a previous study showing increased rates of atopic disorders and neurological and psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with stuttering, cluttering, and developmental disorders of speech and language.</p>Conclusion<p>This is the first nationwide study using health insurance data to analyze the prevalence and newly diagnosed cases of a speech and language disorder. Prevalence and gender ratio data were consistent with the international literature. The crude prevalence of developmental disorders of speech and language increased from 2015 to 2018, whereas the crude prevalence for stuttering remained stable. For cluttering, the numbers were too low to draw reliable conclusions. Proportional treatment allocation for stuttering peaked at 6 years of age, which is the school entrance year, and is later than the prevalence peak of stuttering.</p>

<p>Purpose: The cognitive effects of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on the brain remain poorly understood. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a very useful tool for detecting spontaneous brain activity in the resting state. Quasi-stable electrical distributions, known as microstates, carry useful information about the dynamics of large-scale brain networks. In this study, microstate analysis was used to study changes in brain activity after 24 h of total sleep deprivation.</p><p>Participants and Methods: Twenty-seven healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent EEG scans before and after 24 h of TSD. Microstate analysis was applied, and six microstate classes (A–F) were identified. Topographies and temporal parameters of the microstates were compared between the rested wakefulness (RW) and TSD conditions.</p><p>Results: Microstate class A (a right-anterior to left-posterior orientation of the mapped field) showed lower global explained variance (GEV), frequency of occurrence, and time coverage in TSD than RW, whereas microstate class D (a fronto-central extreme location of the mapped field) displayed higher GEV, frequency of occurrence, and time coverage in TSD compared to RW. Moreover, subjective sleepiness was significantly negatively correlated with the microstate parameters of class A and positively correlated with the microstate parameters of class D. Transition analysis revealed that class B exhibited a higher probability of transition than did classes D and F in TSD compared to RW.</p><p>Conclusion: The observation suggests alterations of the dynamic brain-state properties of TSD in healthy young male subjects, which may serve as system-level neural underpinnings for cognitive declines in sleep-deprived subjects.</p>

<p>Experimental studies support the notion of spike-based neuronal information processing in the brain, with neural circuits exhibiting a wide range of temporally-based coding strategies to rapidly and efficiently represent sensory stimuli. Accordingly, it would be desirable to apply spike-based computation to tackling real-world challenges, and in particular transferring such theory to neuromorphic systems for low-power embedded applications. Motivated by this, we propose a new supervised learning method that can train multilayer spiking neural networks to solve classification problems based on a rapid, first-to-spike decoding strategy. The proposed learning rule supports multiple spikes fired by stochastic hidden neurons, and yet is stable by relying on first-spike responses generated by a deterministic output layer. In addition to this, we also explore several distinct, spike-based encoding strategies in order to form compact representations of presented input data. We demonstrate the classification performance of the learning rule as applied to several benchmark datasets, including MNIST. The learning rule is capable of generalizing from the data, and is successful even when used with constrained network architectures containing few input and hidden layer neurons. Furthermore, we highlight a novel encoding strategy, termed “scanline encoding,” that can transform image data into compact spatiotemporal patterns for subsequent network processing. Designing constrained, but optimized, network structures and performing input dimensionality reduction has strong implications for neuromorphic applications.</p>

<p>Oligodendrocytes exert a profound influence on neural circuits by accelerating action potential conduction, altering excitability, and providing metabolic support. As oligodendrogenesis continues in the adult brain and is essential for myelin repair, uncovering the factors that control their dynamics is necessary to understand the consequences of adaptive myelination and develop new strategies to enhance remyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, few methods exist for analysis of oligodendrocyte dynamics, and even fewer are suitable for in vivo investigation. Here, we describe the development of a fully automated cell tracking pipeline using convolutional neural networks (Oligo-Track) that provides rapid volumetric segmentation and tracking of thousands of cells over weeks in vivo. This system reliably replicated human analysis, outperformed traditional analytic approaches, and extracted injury and repair dynamics at multiple cortical depths, establishing that oligodendrogenesis after cuprizone-mediated demyelination is suppressed in deeper cortical layers. Volumetric data provided by this analysis revealed that oligodendrocyte soma size progressively decreases after their generation, and declines further prior to death, providing a means to predict cell age and eventual cell death from individual time points. This new CNN-based analysis pipeline offers a rapid, robust method to quantitatively analyze oligodendrocyte dynamics in vivo, which will aid in understanding how changes in these myelinating cells influence circuit function and recovery from injury and disease.</p>

<p>Amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases such as prion, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases have distinct etiologies and clinical manifestations, but they share common pathological events. These diseases are caused by abnormally folded proteins (pathogenic prions PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in prion diseases, β-amyloids/Aβ and Tau in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease) that display β-sheet-enriched structures, propagate and accumulate in the nervous central system, and trigger neuronal death. In prion diseases, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-induced corruption of the physiological functions exerted by normal cellular prion proteins (PrP<sup>C</sup>) present at the cell surface of neurons is at the root of neuronal death. For a decade, PrP<sup>C</sup> emerges as a common cell surface receptor for other amyloids such as Aβ and α-synuclein, which relays, at least in part, their toxicity. In lipid-rafts of the plasma membrane, PrP<sup>C</sup> exerts a signaling function and controls a set of effectors involved in neuronal homeostasis, among which are the RhoA-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCKs). Here we review (i) how PrP<sup>C</sup> controls ROCKs, (ii) how PrP<sup>C</sup>-ROCK coupling contributes to neuronal homeostasis, and (iii) how the deregulation of the PrP<sup>C</sup>-ROCK connection in amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases triggers a loss of neuronal polarity, affects neurotransmitter-associated functions, contributes to the endoplasmic reticulum stress cascade, renders diseased neurons highly sensitive to neuroinflammation, and amplifies the production of neurotoxic amyloids.</p>

TDP-43 cytosolic inclusions are a common neuropathologic hallmark in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related diseases, and it is now established that TDP-43 misfolding and aggregation play a key role in their etiopathology. TDP-43 neurotoxic mechanisms are not yet clarified, but the identification of proteins able to modulate TDP-43-mediated damage may be promising therapeutic targets for TDP-43 proteinopathies. Here we show by the use of refined yeast models that the nucleolar protein nucleolin (NCL) acts as a potent suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity, restoring cell viability. We provide evidence that NCL co-expression is able to alleviate TDP-43-induced damage also in human cells, further supporting its beneficial effects in a more consistent pathophysiological context. Presented data suggest that NCL could promote TDP-43 nuclear retention, reducing the formation of toxic cytosolic TDP-43 inclusions.</p>

<p>The role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have become a research hotspot, appropriate animal model to study gut-brain axis in PD is yet to be confirmed. Our study employed a classical PD mice model achieved by chronic MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) injection to study concurrent changes of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the colon of mice. Our results showed such a PD model exhibited apparent locomotor deficits but not gastrointestinal dysfunction. Tyrosine hydroxylase expressions and dopamine content reduced greatly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum, but increased in the colon of PD mice. Mechanism investigation indicated autophagy activity and apoptosis were stimulated in the SNpc, but inhibited in the colon of PD mice. Interplay of gut microbiota (GM) and autophagy in response to chronic MPTP injection led to GM dysbiosis and defective autophagy in mice colon. Meanwhile, fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate and propionate in particular, declined greatly in PD mice, which could be attributed to the decreased bacteria abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, but increased abundance of phylum Firmicutes. GM dysbiosis derived fecal SCFAs might be one of the mediators of downregulated autophagy in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, colonic dopaminergic neurons changed in the opposition direction with those in the midbrain via GM dysbiosis-mediated autophagy inhibition followed by suppressed apoptosis in response to chronic MPTP injection. Such a chronic PD mice model might not be an ideal model to study role of gut-brain axis in PD progression.</p>

<p>Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impairs the ability to carry out daily activities, reduces independence and quality of life and increases caregiver burden. Our understanding of functional decline has traditionally relied on reports by family and caregivers, which are subjective and vulnerable to recall bias. The Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable sensor technologies promise to provide objective, affordable, and reliable means for monitoring and understanding function. However, human factors for its acceptance are relatively unexplored.</p><p>Objective: The Public Involvement (PI) activity presented in this paper aims to capture the preferences, priorities and concerns of people with AD and their caregivers for using monitoring wearables. Their feedback will drive device selection for clinical research, starting with the study of the RADAR-AD project.</p><p>Method: The PI activity involved the Patient Advisory Board (PAB) of the RADAR-AD project, comprised of people with dementia across Europe and their caregivers (11 and 10, respectively). A set of four devices that optimally represent various combinations of aspects and features from the variety of currently available wearables (e.g., weight, size, comfort, battery life, screen types, water-resistance, and metrics) was presented and experienced hands-on. Afterwards, sets of cards were used to rate and rank devices and features and freely discuss preferences.</p><p>Results: Overall, the PAB was willing to accept and incorporate devices into their daily lives. For the presented devices, the aspects most important to them included comfort, convenience and affordability. For devices in general, the features they prioritized were appearance/style, battery life and water resistance, followed by price, having an emergency button and a screen with metrics. The metrics valuable to them included activity levels and heart rate, followed by respiration rate, sleep quality and distance. Some concerns were the potential complexity, forgetting to charge the device, the potential stigma and data privacy.</p><p>Conclusions: The PI activity explored the preferences, priorities and concerns of the PAB, a group of people with dementia and caregivers across Europe, regarding devices for monitoring function and decline, after a hands-on experience and explanation. They highlighted some expected aspects, metrics and features (e.g., comfort and convenience), but also some less expected (e.g., screen with metrics).</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.640188">Older Adults Show Reduced Spatial Precision but Preserved Strategy-Use During Spatial Navigation Involving Body-Based Cues</a></h4>

<p>Older adults typically perform worse on spatial navigation tasks, although whether this is due to degradation of memory or an impairment in using specific strategies has yet to be determined. An issue with some past studies is that older adults are tested on desktop-based virtual reality: a technology many report lacking familiarity with. Even when controlling for familiarity, these paradigms reduce the information-rich, three-dimensional experience of navigating to a simple two-dimensional task that utilizes a mouse and keyboard (or joystick) as means for ambulation. Here, we utilize a wireless head-mounted display and free ambulation to create a fully immersive virtual Morris water maze in which we compare the navigation of older and younger adults. Older and younger adults learned the locations of hidden targets from same and different start points. Across different conditions tested, older adults remembered target locations less precisely compared to younger adults. Importantly, however, they performed comparably from the same viewpoint as a switched viewpoint, suggesting that they could generalize their memory for the location of a hidden target given a new point of view. When we implicitly moved one of the distal cues to determine whether older adults used an allocentric (multiple landmarks) or beaconing (single landmark) strategy to remember the hidden target, both older and younger adults showed comparable degrees of reliance on allocentric and beacon cues. These findings support the hypothesis that while older adults have less precise spatial memories, they maintain the ability to utilize various strategies when navigating.</p>

<p>Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and whether synthetic MRI can benefit diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</p><p>Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients and eighteen age-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent MR examination. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores were obtained from all patients. The whole brain volumetric characteristics, T1, T2, and proton density (PD) values of different cortical and subcortical regions were obtained. The volumetric characteristics and brain regional relaxation values between AD patients and NCs were compared using independent-samples t-test. The correlations between these quantitative parameters and MMSE score were assessed by the Pearson correlation in AD patients.</p><p>Results: Although the larger volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lower brain parenchymal volume (BPV), and the ratio of brain parenchymal volume to intracranial volume (BPV/ICV) were found in AD patients compared with NCs, there were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05). T1 values of right insula cortex and T2 values of left hippocampus and right insula cortex were significantly higher in AD patients than in NCs, but T1 values of left caudate showed a reverse trend (p &lt; 0.05). As the MMSE score decreased in AD patients, the BPV and BPV/ICV decreased, while the volume of CSF and T1 values of bilateral insula cortex and bilateral hippocampus as well as T2 values of bilateral hippocampus increased (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Synthetic MRI not only provides more information to differentiate AD patients from normal controls, but also reflects the disease severity of AD.</p>

<p>Objective: Olfactory impairment (OI) refers to decreased (hyposmia) or absent (anosmia) ability to smell. We sought to estimate the prevalence and correlates of OI among rural-dwelling Chinese older adults.</p><p>Methods: This population-based cross-sectional analysis included 4,514 participants (age ≥65 years; 56.7% women) from the Multidomain Interventions to Delay Dementia and Disability in Rural China (MIND-China). The 16-item Sniffin' Sticks identification test (SSIT) was used to assess olfactory function. Olfactory impairment was defined as the SSIT score ≤10, hyposmia as SSIT score of 8–10, and anosmia as SSIT score &lt;8. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with OI.</p><p>Results: The overall prevalence was 67.7% for OI, 35.3% for hyposmia, and 32.5% for anosmia. The prevalence increased with age for OI and anosmia, but not for hyposmia. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of OI was 2.10 (95% CI 1.69–2.61) for illiteracy and 1.41 (1.18–1.70) for elementary school (vs. middle school or above), 1.30 (1.01–1.67) for current smoking (vs. never smoking), 0.86 (0.74–0.99) for overweight and 0.73 (0.61–0.87) for obesity (vs. normal weight), 4.21 (2.23–7.94) for dementia, 1.68 (1.23–2.30) for head injury, and 1.44 (1.14–1.83) for sinonasal disease. Illiteracy in combination with either male sex or diabetes was significantly associated with an over two-fold increased OR of OI (p for interactions &lt;0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Olfactory impairment is highly prevalent that affects over two-thirds of rural-dwelling older adults in China. OI is correlated with illiteracy, current smoking, dementia, head injury, and sinonasal disease, but negatively associated with overweight or obesity. Olfactory impairment as a potential clinical marker of neurodegenerative disorders among older adults deserves further investigation.</p>

There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of COVID‐19. However, inconsistent study designs, inadequate controls, poorly‐validated tests, and differing settings, interventions, and cultural norms weaken study quality, comparability, and thus the understanding of the spectrum, burden and pathophysiology of these complications. Therefore, a global COVID‐19 Neuro Research Coalition, together with the WHO, has reviewed reports of COVID‐19 neurological complications and harmonised clinical measures for future research. This will facilitate well‐designed studies using precise, consistent case definitions of SARS‐CoV2 infection and neurological complications, with standardised forms for pooled data analyses that non‐specialists can use, including in low‐income settings.

Abstract
Pattern separation, the ability to differentiate new information from previously experienced similar information, is highly sensitive to hippocampal structure and function and declines with age. Functional MRI studies have demonstrated hippocampal hyperactivation in older adults compared to young, with greater task‐related activation associated with worse pattern separation performance. The current study was designed to determine whether pattern separation was sensitive to differences in task‐free hippocampal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 130 functionally intact older adults. Given prior evidence that apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4) status moderates the relationship between CBF and episodic memory, we predicted a stronger negative relationship between hippocampal CBF and pattern separation in APOE e4 carriers. An interaction between APOE group and right hippocampal CBF was present, such that greater right hippocampal CBF was related to better lure discrimination in noncarriers, whereas the effect reversed directionality in e4 carriers. These findings suggest that neurovascular changes in the medial temporal lobe may underlie memory deficits in cognitively normal older adults who are APOE e4 carriers.

Abstract
Research has reported that repeatedly retrieving a novel or imagined event representation reduces activity within brain regions critical for constructing mental scenarios, namely the anterior hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The primary aim of this investigation was to test if this pattern reported for imagined events would be found when repeatedly recollecting autobiographical memories. Twenty‐four participants retrieved 12 pre‐selected autobiographical memories four times while undergoing an fMRI scan. We used a region of interest approach to investigate how the anterior and posterior hippocampus as well as cortical regions critical for memory retrieval—the vmPFC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—are affected by repeated retrievals. This analysis revealed an effect in the bilateral anterior hippocampi and vmPFC, but not the posterior hippocampus nor the PCC, with activity decreasing in these regions as a function of repeated retrievals. A multivariate analytic approach (Partial Least Squares) was used to assess whole‐brain patterns of neural activity associated with repeated retrievals. This analysis revealed one pattern of neural activity associated with the initial retrieval of a memory (e.g., inferior frontal and temporal lobe regions) and a separate pattern of activity associated with later retrievals that was distributed primarily across the lateral parietal cortices. These findings suggest that the anterior hippocampus and the vmPFC support the episodic construction of an autobiographical memory the first time it is retrieved and that alternate nonconstructive processes support its subsequent retrieval shortly thereafter.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26068?af=R">How Can an Na+ Channel Inhibitor Ameliorate Seizures in Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome?</a></h4>

Objective
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) according to simplistic categorical grouping.


Methods
The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors was quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors.


Results
With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed with hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD‐associated seizures in pentylenetetrazol or AY‐9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures, including LGS.


Interpretation
Na+ channel inhibitors shall have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWDs, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASDs according to in‐depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable. ANN NEUROL 2021

The interplay between nutrient-induced signaling and metabolism plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis and its malfunction has been implicated in many different human diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders. Therefore, unraveling the role of nutrients as signaling molecules and metabolites together with their interconnectivity may provide a deeper understanding of how these conditions occur. Both signaling and metabolism have been extensively studied using various systems biology approaches. However, they are mainly studied individually and in addition, current models lack both the complexity of the dynamics and the effects of the crosstalk in the signaling system. To gain a better understanding of the interconnectivity between nutrient signaling and metabolism in yeast cells, we developed a hybrid model, combining a Boolean module, describing the main pathways of glucose and nitrogen signaling, and an enzyme-constrained model accounting for the central carbon metabolism of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, using a regulatory network as a link. The resulting hybrid model was able to capture a diverse utalization of isoenzymes and to our knowledge outperforms constraint-based models in the prediction of individual enzymes for both respiratory and mixed metabolism. The model showed that during fermentation, enzyme utilization has a major contribution in governing protein allocation, while in low glucose conditions robustness and control are prioritized. In addition, the model was capable of reproducing the regulatory effects that are associated with the Crabtree effect and glucose repression, as well as regulatory effects associated with lifespan increase during caloric restriction. Overall, we show that our hybrid model provides a comprehensive framework for the study of the non-trivial effects of the interplay between signaling and metabolism, suggesting connections between the Snf1 signaling pathways and processes that have been related to chronological lifespan of yeast cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_Dbq8MMfdOM" width="1" />

<p>by Piyush Nanda, Amit Ghosh</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to the whole world. In this regard, it is absolutely imperative to understand the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of host human cells by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations would aid in design of better therapeutics to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies. GS-DFA can be applied to existing repertoire of high-throughput proteomic or transcriptomic data in diseased condition to understand metabolic deregulation at the level of flux.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GHLqZEvY94w" width="1" />

Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile. Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates which we used here for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds is largely missing. In this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labelled most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as marker for displaced amacrine cells which allowed us to reliably distinguish ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also of birds. The markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26080?af=R">Detection of brain somatic mutations in CSF from refractory epilepsy patients</a></h4>

Brain mosaic mutations are a major cause of refractory focal epilepsies with cortical malformations such as focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy, or ganglioglioma. Here, we collected 1‐6 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during epilepsy surgery to search for somatic variants in cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) using targeted droplet digital PCR. In 3/12 epileptic patients with known somatic mutations previously identified in brain tissue, we here provide evidence that brain mosaicism can be detected in the CSF‐derived cfDNA. These findings suggest future opportunities for detecting the mutant allele driving epilepsy in CSF.

<p>The cerebellum and its functional multiplicity and heterogeneity have been objects of curiosity and interest since ancient times, giving rise to the urge to reveal its complexity. Since the first hypothesis of cerebellar mere role in motor tuning and coordination, much more has been continuously discovered about the cerebellum’s circuitry and functioning throughout centuries, leading to the currently accepted knowledge of its prominent involvement in cognitive, social, and behavioral areas. Particularly in childhood, the cerebellum may subserve several age-dependent functions, which might be compromised in several Central Nervous System pathologies. Overall, cerebellar damage may produce numerous signs and symptoms and determine a wide variety of neuropsychiatric impairments already during the evolutive age. Therefore, an early assessment in children would be desirable to address a prompt diagnosis and a proper intervention since the first months of life. Here we provide an overview of the cerebellum, retracing its morphology, histogenesis, and physiological functions, and finally outlining its involvement in typical and atypical development and the age-dependent patterns of cerebellar dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Early adversity (EA) impairs myelin development in a manner that persists later in life across diverse mammalian species including humans, non-human primates, and rodents. These observations, coupled with the highly conserved nature of myelin development suggest that animal models can provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which EA impairs myelin development later in life and the impact of these changes on network connectivity, cognition, and behavior. However, this area of translational research has received relatively little attention and no comprehensive review is currently available to address these issues. This is particularly important given some recent mechanistic studies in rodents and the availability of new agents to increase myelination. The goals of this review are to highlight the need for additional pre-clinical work in this area and to provide specific examples that demonstrate the potential of this work to generate novel therapeutic interventions that are highly needed.</p>

<p>Purpose: This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with physical training on the excitability of the motor cortex, physical performance, and motor learning.</p><p>Methods: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases for relevant research published from inception to August 2020. Eligible studies included those that used a randomized controlled design and reported the effects of tDCS combined with physical training to improve motor-evoked potential (MEP), dynamic posture stability index (DPSI), reaction time, and error rate on participants without nervous system diseases. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.</p><p>Results: Twenty-four of an initial yield of 768 studies met the eligibility criteria. The risk of bias was considered low. Results showed that anodal tDCS combined with physical training can significantly increase MEP amplitude, decrease DPSI, increase muscle strength, and decrease reaction time and error rate in motor learning tasks. Moreover, the gain effect is significantly greater than sham tDCS combined with physical training.</p><p>Conclusion: tDCS combined with physical training can effectively improve the excitability of the motor cortex, physical performance, and motor learning. The reported results encourage further research to understand further the synergistic effects of tDCS combined with physical training.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646013">Bidirectional Mapping of Brain MRI and PET With 3D Reversible GAN for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>Combining multi-modality data for brain disease diagnosis such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) commonly leads to improved performance than those using a single modality. However, it is still challenging to train a multi-modality model since it is difficult in clinical practice to obtain complete data that includes all modality data. Generally speaking, it is difficult to obtain both magnetic resonance images (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images of a single patient. PET is expensive and requires the injection of radioactive substances into the patient’s body, while MR images are cheaper, safer, and more widely used in practice. Discarding samples without PET data is a common method in previous studies, but the reduction in the number of samples will result in a decrease in model performance. To take advantage of multi-modal complementary information, we first adopt the Reversible Generative Adversarial Network (RevGAN) model to reconstruct the missing data. After that, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model with multi-modality input was proposed to perform AD diagnosis. We have evaluated our method on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and compared the performance of the proposed method with those using state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the structural and functional information of brain tissue can be mapped well and that the image synthesized by our method is close to the real image. In addition, the use of synthetic data is beneficial for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

<p>Although spinal cord injury (SCI) is the main cause of disability worldwide, there is still no definite and effective treatment method for this condition. Our previous clinical trials confirmed that the increased excitability of the motor cortex was related to the functional prognosis of patients with SCI. However, it remains unclear which cell types in the motor cortex lead to the later functional recovery. Herein, we applied optogenetic technology to selectively activate glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex and explore whether activation of glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex can promote functional recovery after SCI in rats and the preliminary neural mechanisms involved. Our results showed that the activation of glutamate neurons in the motor cortex could significantly improve the motor function scores in rats, effectively shorten the incubation period of motor evoked potentials and increase motor potentials’ amplitude. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin staining and nerve fiber staining at the injured site showed that accurate activation of the primary motor cortex could effectively promote tissue recovery and neurofilament growth (GAP-43, NF) at the injured site of the spinal cord, while the content of some growth-related proteins (BDNF, NGF) at the injured site increased. These results suggested that selective activation of glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex can promote functional recovery after SCI and may be of great significance for understanding the neural cell mechanism underlying functional recovery induced by motor cortex stimulation.</p>

<p>Many studies have observed modulation of the amplitude of the neural index mismatch negativity (MMN) related to which member of a phoneme contrast [phoneme A, phoneme B] serves as the frequent (standard) and which serves as the infrequent (deviant) stimulus (i.e., AAAB vs. BBBA) in an oddball paradigm. Explanations for this amplitude modulation range from acoustic to linguistic factors. We tested whether exchanging the role of the mid vowel /ε/ vs. high vowel /ɪ/ of English modulated MMN amplitude and whether the pattern of modulation was compatible with an underspecification account, in which the underspecified height values are [−high] and [−low]. MMN was larger for /ε/ as the deviant, but only when compared across conditions to itself as the standard. For the within-condition comparison, MMN was larger to /ɪ/ deviant minus /ε/ standard than to the reverse. A condition order effect was also observed. MMN amplitude was smaller to the deviant stimulus if it had previously served as the standard. In addition, the amplitudes of late discriminative negativity (LDN) showed similar asymmetry. LDN was larger for deviant /ε/ than deviant /ɪ/ when compared to themselves as the standard. These findings were compatible with an underspecification account, but also with other accounts, such as the Natural Referent Vowel model and a prototype model; we also suggest that non-linguistic factors need to be carefully considered as additional sources of speech processing asymmetries.</p>

<p>A variety of studies show that parental absence early in life leads to deleterious effects on the developing CNS. This is thought to be largely because evolutionary-dependent stimuli are necessary for the appropriate postnatal development of the young brain, an effect sometimes termed the “experience-expectant brain,” with parents providing the necessary input for normative synaptic connections to develop and appropriate neuronal survival to occur. Principal among CNS systems affected by parental input are the monoamine systems. In the present study, N = 434 rhesus monkeys (233 males, 201 females) were reared in one of two conditions: as mother-reared controls (MR; n = 269) or without adults with 24-h access to same-aged peers (PR; n = 165). When subjects were six-months-old, they underwent a separation paradigm involving 4, sequential, four-day social separations from their mothers or peers, with each separation followed by three-day reunions with their mothers or their peers. Prior to the separation paradigm, baseline cisternal CSF samples were obtained, as well as at the end of each the four social separations, and after final separation, during a recovery period. CSF was assayed for concentrations of monoamine metabolites and a blood sample was genotyped for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype. Replicating earlier landmark findings, PR subjects with the s allele exhibited lower baseline concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), when compared to PR subjects homozygous for the L allele. MR subjects were undifferentiated by genotype. PR subjects exhibited lower CSF 5-HIAA concentrations during baseline, but higher CSF 5-HIAA during social separations, when compared to MR subjects. There were rearing effects for the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) and for the norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), with PR subjects showing higher HVA and lower MHPG when compared to MR subjects. These findings indicate that there are long-term deficits in the response of monoamines following early maternal absence. The results of this study confirm and extend earlier findings that early parental absence has deleterious consequences for the development of the monoamine systems, and that these consequences are modulated by the 5-HTT genotype.</p>

<p>From birth to 15 months infants and caregivers form a fundamentally intersubjective, dyadic unit within which the infant’s ability to recognize gender/sex in the world develops. Between about 18 and 36 months the infant accumulates an increasingly clear and subjective sense of self as female or male. We know little about how the precursors to gender/sex identity form during the intersubjective period, nor how they transform into an independent sense of self by 3 years of age. In this Theory and Hypothesis article I offer a general framework for thinking about this problem. I propose that through repetition and patterning, the dyadic interactions in which infants and caregivers engage imbue the infant with an embodied, i.e., sensori-motor understanding of gender/sex. During this developmental period (which I label Phase 1) gender/sex is primarily an intersubjective project. From 15 to 18 months (which I label Phase 2) there are few reports of newly appearing gender/sex behavioral differences, and I hypothesize that this absence reflects a period of developmental instability during which there is a transition from gender/sex as primarily inter-subjective to gender/sex as primarily subjective. Beginning at 18 months (i.e., the start of Phase 3), a toddler’s subjective sense of self as having a gender/sex emerges, and it solidifies by 3 years of age. I propose a dynamic systems perspective to track how infants first assimilate gender/sex information during the intersubjective period (birth to 15 months); then explore what changes might occur during a hypothesized phase transition (15 to 18 months), and finally, review the emergence and initial stabilization of individual subjectivity-the period from 18 to 36 months. The critical questions explored focus on how to model and translate data from very different experimental disciplines, especially neuroscience, physiology, developmental psychology and cognitive development. I close by proposing the formation of a research consortium on gender/sex development during the first 3 years after birth.</p>

Background<p>Functional changes after spinal cord injury (SCI) are related to changes in cortical plasticity. These changes can be measured with electroencephalography (EEG) and has potential to be used as a clinical biomarker.</p>Method<p>In this longitudinal study participants underwent a total of 30 sessions of robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) over a course of 6 weeks. The duration of each session was 30 min. Resting state EEG was recorded before and after 30-session rehabilitation therapy. To measure gait, we used the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury Scale, 10-Meter- Walking Test, Timed-Up-and-Go, and 6-Min-Walking Test. Balance was measured using Berg Balance Scale.</p>Results<p>Fifteen participants with incomplete SCI who had AIS C or D injuries based on American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale classification were included in this study. Mean age was 35.7 years (range 17–51) and the mean time since injury was 17.08 (range 4–37) months. All participants showed clinical improvement with the rehabilitation program. EEG data revealed that high beta EEG activity in the central area had a negative correlation with gait (p = 0.049; β coefficient: −0.351; and adj-R<sup>2</sup>: 0.23) and balance (p = 0.043; β coefficient: −0.158; and adj-R<sup>2</sup>:0.24) measured at baseline, in a way that greater high beta EEG power was related to worse clinical function at baseline. Moreover, improvement in gait and balance had negative correlations with the change in alpha/theta ratio in the parietal area (Gait: p = 0.049; β coefficient: −0.351; adj-R<sup>2</sup>: 0.23; Balance: p = 0.043; β coefficient: −0.158; and adj-R<sup>2</sup>: 0.24).</p>Conclusion<p>In SCI, functional impairment and subsequent improvement following rehabilitation therapy with RAGT correlated with the change in cortical activity measured by EEG. Our results suggest that EEG alpha/theta ratio may be a potential surrogate marker of functional improvement during rehabilitation. Future studies are necessary to improve and validate these findings as a neurophysiological biomarker for SCI rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening condition that can also lead to permanent paralysis. However, the mechanisms that underlying neurobehavioral deficits after SAH have not been fully elucidated. As theta burst stimulation (TBS) can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the motor cortex, we tested its potential as a functional evaluation tool after experimentally induced SAH. Motor cortical inter-neuronal excitability was evaluated in anesthetized rats after 200 Hz-quadripulse TBS (QTS5), 200 Hz-quadripulse stimulation (QPS5), and 400 Hz-octapulse stimulation (OPS2.5). Furthermore, correlation between motor cortical LTP and N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor activation was evaluated using MK-801, a NMDA-receptor antagonist. We evaluated inhibition-facilitation configurations [interstimulus interval: 3 ms; short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and 11 ms; intracortical facilitation (ICF)] with paired electrical stimulation protocols and the effect of TBS paradigm on continuous recording of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) for quantitative parameters. SAH and MK-801 completely blocked ICF, while SICI was preserved. QTS5, QPS5, and OPS2.5 facilitated continuous MEPs, persisting for 180 min. Both SAH and MK-801 completely blocked MEP facilitations after QPS5 and OPS2.5, while MEP facilitations after QTS5 were preserved. Significant correlations were found among neurological scores and 3 ms-SICI rates, 11 ms-ICF rates, and MEP facilitation rates after 200 Hz-QTS5, 7 days after SAH (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6236; r = −0.79, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6053; r = −0.77 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9071; r = 0.95, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Although these findings need to be verified in humans, our study demonstrates that the neurophysiological parameters 3 ms-SICI, 11 ms-ICF, and 200 Hz-QTS5-MEPs may be useful surrogate quantitative biomarkers for assessing inter-neuronal function after SAH.</p>

<p>A key function of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is to control the speed of forward symmetrical locomotor movements. However, the ability of freely moving mammals to integrate environmental cues to brake and turn during MLR stimulation is poorly documented. Here, we investigated whether freely behaving mice could brake or turn, based on environmental cues during MLR stimulation. We photostimulated the cuneiform nucleus (part of the MLR) in mice expressing channelrhodopsin in Vglut2-positive neurons in a Cre-dependent manner (Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP) using optogenetics. We detected locomotor movements using deep learning. We used patch-clamp recordings to validate the functional expression of channelrhodopsin and neuroanatomy to visualize the stimulation sites. In the linear corridor, gait diagram and limb kinematics were similar during spontaneous and optogenetic-evoked locomotion. In the open-field arena, optogenetic stimulation of the MLR evoked locomotion, and increasing laser power increased locomotor speed. Mice could brake and make sharp turns (~90°) when approaching a corner during MLR stimulation in the open-field arena. The speed during the turn was scaled with the speed before the turn, and with the turn angle. Patch-clamp recordings in Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP mice show that blue light evoked short-latency spiking in MLR neurons. Our results strengthen the idea that different brainstem neurons convey braking/turning and MLR speed commands in mammals. Our study also shows that Vglut2-positive neurons of the cuneiform nucleus are a relevant target to increase locomotor activity without impeding the ability to brake and turn when approaching obstacles, thus ensuring smooth and adaptable navigation. Our observations may have clinical relevance since cuneiform nucleus stimulation is increasingly considered to improve locomotion function in pathological states such as Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, or stroke.</p>

<p>The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is a newly discovered ion channel that is highly conserved among species. It is known that Hv1 is not only expressed in peripheral immune cells but also one of the major ion channels expressed in tissue-resident microglia of the central nervous systems (CNS). One key role for Hv1 is its interaction with NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytosolic pH. Emerging data suggest that excessive ROS production increases and requires proton currents through Hv1 in the injured CNS, and manipulations that ablate Hv1 expression or induce loss of function may provide neuroprotection in CNS injury models including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. Recent data demonstrating microglial Hv1-mediated signaling in the pathophysiology of the CNS injury further supports the idea that Hv1 channel may function as a key mechanism in posttraumatic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize the main findings of Hv1, including its expression pattern, cellular mechanism, role in aging, and animal models of CNS injury and disease pathology. We also discuss the potential of Hv1 as a therapeutic target for CNS injury.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662578">Neurotropic Viruses, Astrocytes, and COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>At the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in China, causing a new coronavirus disease, termed COVID-19 by the WHO on February 11, 2020. At the time of this paper (January 31, 2021), more than 100 million cases have been recorded, which have claimed over 2 million lives worldwide. The most important clinical presentation of COVID-19 is severe pneumonia; however, many patients present various neurological symptoms, ranging from loss of olfaction, nausea, dizziness, and headache to encephalopathy and stroke, with a high prevalence of inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) syndromes. SARS-CoV-2 may also target the respiratory center in the brainstem and cause silent hypoxemia. However, the neurotropic mechanism(s) by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the CNS remain(s) unclear. In this paper, we first address the involvement of astrocytes in COVID-19 and then elucidate the present knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 as a neurotropic virus as well as several other neurotropic flaviviruses (with a particular emphasis on the West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Zika virus) to highlight the neurotropic mechanisms that target astroglial cells in the CNS. These key homeostasis-providing cells in the CNS exhibit many functions that act as a favorable milieu for virus replication and possibly a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The role of astrocytes in COVID-19 pathology, related to aging and neurodegenerative disorders, and environmental factors, is discussed. Understanding these mechanisms is key to better understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and for developing new strategies to mitigate the neurotropic manifestations of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The dopamine transporter (DAT) clears neurotransmitters from the extracellular space and serves as an important regulator of signal amplitude and duration at sites of dopamine release. Several different intracellular signaling pathways have been observed to modulate DAT activity through the regulation of the trafficking of the carriers to and from the cell surface. Acute activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters facilitates clathrin-dependent internalization of the DAT in a variety of model systems; however, the physiological stimuli and cell-surface receptor systems that activate PKC and regulate the DAT in dopamine neurons remain elusive. We report here that stimulation of M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>5</sub> muscarinic receptors in midbrain cultures decreases the ability of dopamine neurons to transport dopamine through DAT. Application of the cholinomimetic drug carbachol leads to a decrease in DAT activity in primary cultures while the M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>5</sub>-specific antagonist, pirenzepine, blocks these effects. The M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, DAU 5884, does not affect, but a positive modulator of M<sub>5</sub>, VU 0238429, enhances the loss of DAT function in response to carbachol and acetylcholine. These data implicate M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>5</sub> receptors on dopamine neurons in the modulation of DAT function. Bisindolylmaleimide, a PKC inhibitor, blocks the effects of carbachol stimulation on dopamine uptake, supporting a role for PKC in muscarinic receptor-mediated DAT internalization. Furthermore, as shown previously for PKC-induced internalization, downregulation of the DAT is dependent on both clathrin and dynamin. A G<sub>q</sub>-specific inhibitor peptide also blocks the effects of carbachol on DAT in primary cultures, confirming G<sub>q</sub> as the G-protein that couples M<sub>1</sub>/M<sub>5</sub> receptors to PKC activation in these cells. In acute midbrain slices, biotinylation of cell-surface proteins revealed the loss of dopamine transport mediated by muscarinic receptor stimulation was, indeed, due to loss of membrane expression of the DAT in endogenous tissue. These data indicate that stimulation of cholinergic pathways can lead to modulation of dopamine through internalization of the DAT.</p>

<p>The acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) converts sphingomyelin into ceramide. Recent work has advanced the ASM/ceramide system as a major player in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Indeed, ASM activity is enhanced in MDD patients and antidepressant drugs like fluoxetine act as functional inhibitors of ASM. Here, we employed the specific ASM inhibitor ARC39 to explore the acute effects of the enzyme on hippocampal synaptic transmission and cell excitability in adult mouse brain slice preparations. In both field potential and whole-cell recordings, ARC39 (1–3 μM) enhanced excitatory synaptic input onto ventral hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. The specificity of drug action was demonstrated by its lacking effect in slices from ASM knockout mice. In control condition, ARC39 strongly reduced firing in most CA1 pyramidal cells, together with membrane hyperpolarization. Such pronounced inhibitory action of ARC39 on soma excitability was largely reversed when GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors were blocked. The idea that ARC39 recruits GABAergic inhibition to dampen cell excitability was further reinforced by the drug’s ability to enhance the inhibitory synaptic drive onto pyramidal cells. In pyramidal cells that were pharmacologically isolated from synaptic input, the overall effect of ARC39 on cell firing was inhibitory, but some neurons displayed a biphasic response with a transient increase in firing, suggesting that ARC39 might alter intrinsic firing properties in a cell-specific fashion. Because ARC39 is charged at physiological pH and exerted all its effects within minutes of application, we propose that the neurophysiological actions reported here are due to the inhibition of secretory rather than lysosomal ASM. In summary, the ASM inhibitor ARC39 reveals a tonic control of the enzyme over ventral hippocampal excitability, which involves the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells as well as their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.</p>

<p>Children born prematurely suffer from learning disabilities and exhibit reading, speech, and cognitive difficulties, which are associated with an auditory processing disorder. However, it is unknown whether gestational age at delivery and the unnatural auditory environment in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) collectively affect proper auditory development and neuronal circuitry in premature newborns. We morphologically characterized fetal development of the medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO), an area important for binaural hearing and sound localization, in the auditory brainstem of baboon neonates at different gestational ages. Axonal and synaptic structures and the tonotopic differentiation of ion channels in the MSO underwent profound refinements after hearing onset in the uterus. These developmental refinements of the MSO were significantly altered in preterm baboon neonates in the NICU. Thus, the maternal environment in uterus is critical for auditory nervous system development during the last trimester of pregnancy and critically affects the anatomic and functional formation of synapses and neural circuitry in the preterm newborn brain.</p>

<p>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe complication of preterm birth associated with cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and commonly, accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Histologically, IVH leads to subependymal gliosis, fibrosis, and disruption of the ependymal wall. Importantly, expression of aquaporin channels 1 and 4 (AQP1 and AQP4) regulating respectively, secretion and absorption of cerebrospinal fluids is altered with IVH and are associated with development of post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Human cord blood derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs), which we previously demonstrated to reduce the magnitude of hydrocephalus, as having anti-inflammatory, and beneficial behavioral effects, were injected into the cerebral ventricles of rabbit pups 18 h after glycerol-induced IVH. USSC treated IVH pups showed a reduction in ventricular size when compared to control pups at 7 and 14 days (both, P &lt; 0.05). Histologically, USSC treatment reduced cellular infiltration and ependymal wall disruption. In the region of the choroid plexus, immuno-reactivity for AQP1 and ependymal wall AQP4 expression were suppressed after IVH but were restored following USSC administration. Effects were confirmed by analysis of mRNA from dissected choroid plexus and ependymal tissue. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) isoforms, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) mRNA, as well as protein levels, were significantly increased following IVH and restored towards normal with USSC treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA was reduced in IVH, but significantly recovered after USSC injection (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, USSCs exerted anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing both TGF-β specific isoforms, CTGF and MMP-9, recovered IL-10, restored aquaporins expression towards baseline, and reduced hydrocephalus. These results support the possibility of the use of USSCs to reduce IVH consequences in prematurity.</p>

<p>Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the central nervous system that maintain physiological homeostasis in the brain and contribute to the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the lack of appropriate human cellular models, it is difficult to study the basic pathophysiological processes linking microglia to brain diseases. In this study, we adopted a microglia-like cellular model derived from peripheral blood monocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-34 (IL-34). We characterized and validated this in vitro cellular model by morphology, immunocytochemistry, gene expression profiles, and functional study. Our results indicated that the iMG cells developed typical microglial ramified morphology, expressed microglial specific surface markers (P2RY12 and TMEM119), and possessed phagocytic activity. Principal component analyses and multidimensional scaling analyses of RNA-seq data showed that iMG cells were distinct from monocytes and induced macrophages (iMacs) but clustered closer to human microglia and hiPSC-induced microglia. Heatmap analyses also found that iMG cells, but not monocytes, were closely clustered with human primary microglia. Further pathway and relative expression analysis indicated that unique genes from iMG cells were involved in the regulation of the complement system, especially in the synapse and ion transport. Overall, our data demonstrated that the iMG model mimicked many features of the brain resident microglia, highlighting its utility in the study of microglial function in many brain diseases, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>

<p>Hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) due to mutations in genes along the PI3K-mTOR pathway and the GATOR1 complex causes a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders (termed mTORopathies) associated with malformation of cortical development and intractable epilepsy. Despite these gene variants’ converging impact on mTORC1 activity, emerging findings suggest that these variants contribute to epilepsy through both mTORC1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Here, we review the literature on in utero electroporation-based animal models of mTORopathies, which recapitulate the brain mosaic pattern of mTORC1 hyperactivity, and compare the effects of distinct PI3K-mTOR pathway and GATOR1 complex gene variants on cortical development and epilepsy. We report the outcomes on cortical pyramidal neuronal placement, morphology, and electrophysiological phenotypes, and discuss some of the converging and diverging mechanisms responsible for these alterations and their contribution to epileptogenesis. We also discuss potential therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, beyond mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin or everolimus, that could offer personalized medicine based on the gene variant.</p>

<p>Dementia and cognitive impairment are considered to be one of the biggest social and medical problems. While there is a definite relationship between vitamin B and cognitive decline, this has yet to be fully assessed with regard to sex differences. Thus, the present study investigated the relationship of vitamin B1 or vitamin B12 with dementia in accordance with the sex in 188 patients who visited the Memory Clinic at Showa University Hospital in Japan from March 2016 to March 2019. Cognitive function was tested by the Japanese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R). Blood tests were performed to measure the vitamin levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for dementia and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Compared to the highest vitamin group (third tertile), the lowest vitamin group (first tertile) exhibited a significantly increased OR for dementia defined by MMSE for vitamin B1 (OR:3.73, 95% CI:1.52–9.16) and vitamin B12 (2.97, 1.22–7.28) among women. In contrast, vitamin levels were not significantly associated with dementia determined by MMSE in men. These findings were similar even when dementia was defined by HDS-R. The present study suggests that vitamin B1 plays a role in preventing development of dementia in women. Future longitudinal studies will need to be undertaken in order to examine whether decreasing vitamin levels occur before or after cognitive impairment, and whether maintaining a higher vitamin level can prevent a worsening of cognitive function and the development of dementia.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are typically characterized by progressive neuronal loss and neurological dysfunctions in the nervous system, affecting both memory and motor functions. Neuregulins (NRGs) belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like family of extracellular ligands and they play an important role in the development, maintenance, and repair of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) through the ErbB signaling pathway. They also regulate multiple intercellular signal transduction and participate in a wide range of biological processes, such as differentiation, migration, and myelination. In this review article, we summarized research on the changes and roles of NRGs in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in AD. We elaborated on the structural features of each NRG subtype and roles of NRG/ErbB signaling networks in neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed the therapeutic potential of NRGs in the symptom remission of neurodegenerative diseases, which may offer hope for advancing related treatment.</p>

<p>Aging is marked by an accumulation of damaged and modified brain proteins, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for cellular protein degradation. Recent work has established a critical role for the UPS in memory and synaptic plasticity, but the role of the UPS in age-related cognitive decline remains poorly understood. We trained young, middle-aged, and aged male and female rats using trace fear conditioning (TFC) to investigate the effects of age and sex on memory. We then measured markers of UPS-related protein degradation (phosphorylation of the Rpt6 proteasome regulatory subunit and K48-linked polyubiquitination) using western blots. We found that aged males, but not aged females, showed behavioral deficits at memory retrieval. Aged males also displayed reduced phosphorylation of the Rpt6 proteasome subunit and accumulation of K48 in the basolateral amygdala, while aged females displayed a similar pattern in the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that markers of UPS function are differentially affected by age and sex in a brain region-dependent manner. Together these results provide an important step toward understanding the UPS and circuit-level differences in aging males and females.</p>

<p>Aging is accompanied by unisensory decline. To compensate for this, two complementary strategies are potentially relied upon increasingly: first, older adults integrate more information from different sensory organs. Second, according to the predictive coding (PC) model, we form “templates” (internal models or “priors”) of the environment through our experiences. It is through increased life experience that older adults may rely more on these templates compared to younger adults. Multisensory integration and predictive coding would be effective strategies for the perception of near-threshold stimuli, which may however come at the cost of integrating irrelevant information. Both strategies can be studied in multisensory illusions because these require the integration of different sensory information, as well as an internal model of the world that can take precedence over sensory input. Here, we elicited a classic multisensory illusion, the sound-induced flash illusion, in younger (mean: 27 years, N = 25) and older (mean: 67 years, N = 28) adult participants while recording the magnetoencephalogram. Older adults perceived more illusions than younger adults. Older adults had increased pre-stimulus beta-band activity compared to younger adults as predicted by microcircuit theories of predictive coding, which suggest priors and predictions are linked to beta-band activity. Transfer entropy analysis and dynamic causal modeling of pre-stimulus magnetoencephalography data revealed a stronger illusion-related modulation of cross-modal connectivity from auditory to visual cortices in older compared to younger adults. We interpret this as the neural correlate of increased reliance on a cross-modal predictive template in older adults leading to the illusory percept.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.617611">A Pilot Study on the Cutoff Value of Related Brain Metabolite in Chinese Elderly Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment Using MRS</a></h4>

<p>Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to distinguish patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from patients with normal controls (NCs) by measuring the levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), total creatinine (tCr), and choline (Cho) in their hippocampus (HIP) and their posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to predict the cutoff value on the ratios of metabolites. We further aimed to provide a reference for the diagnosis of MCI in elderly patients in China.</p><p>Methods: About 69 patients who underwent a clinical diagnosis of the MCI group and 67 patients with NCs, the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, and MRS of the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG were considered. The ratio of NAA/tCr and Cho/tCr in the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG was calculated. The relationship between the ratios of metabolites and the scores of MMSE and MoCA was analyzed, and the possible brain metabolite cutoff point for the diagnosis of MCI was evaluated.</p><p>Results: Compared with the NC group, the scores of MMSE and MoCA in the MCI group decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05); the ratio of NAA/tCr in the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG and the ratio of Cho/tCr at the right HIP in the MCI group decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the ratio of Cho/tCr in the left HIP and bilateral PCG between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). The correlation coefficient between MMSE/MoCA and the ratio of NAA/tCr was 0.49–0.56 in the bilateral HIP (p &lt; 0.01). The best cutoff value of NAA/creatine (Cr) in the left HIP and the right HIP was 1.195 and 1.19. Sensitivity, specificity, and the Youden index (YDI) in the left HIP and the right HIP were (0.725, 0.803, 0.528) and (0.754, 0.803, 0.557), respectively.</p><p>Conclusion: The level of metabolites in the HIP and the PCG of patients with MCI and of those with normal subjects has a certain correlation with the score of their MMSE and MoCA. When the value of NAA/tCr in the left HIP and right HIP is &lt;1.19, it suggests that MCI may have occurred. According to this cutoff point, elderly patients with MCI in China could be screened.</p>
