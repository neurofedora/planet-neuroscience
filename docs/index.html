              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Large-scale analysis and computer modeling reveal hidden regularities behind variability of cell division patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana embryogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Noise plays a major role in cellular processes and in the development of tissues and organs. Several studies have examined the origin, the integration or the accommodation of noise in gene expression, cell growth and elaboration of organ shape. By contrast, much less is known about variability in cell division plane positioning, its origin and links with cell geometry, and its impact on tissue organization. Taking advantage of the first-stereotyped-then-variable division patterns in the embryo of the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we combined 3D imaging and quantitative cell shape and cell lineage analysis together with mathematical and computer modeling to perform a large-scale, systematic analysis of variability in division plane orientation. Our results reveal that, paradoxically, variability in cell division patterns of <i>Arabidopsis</i> embryos is accompanied by a progressive reduction of heterogeneity in cell shape topology. The paradox is solved by showing that variability operates within a reduced repertoire of possible division plane orientations that is related to cell geometry. We show that in several domains of the embryo, a recently proposed geometrical division rule recapitulates observed variable patterns, suggesting that variable patterns emerge from deterministic principles operating in a variable geometrical context. Our work highlights the importance of emerging patterns in the plant embryo under iterated division principles, but also reveal domains where deviations between rule predictions and experimental observations point to additional regulatory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Latent functional diversity may accelerate microbial community responses to temperature fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                How complex microbial communities respond to climatic fluctuations remains an open question. Due to their relatively short generation times and high functional diversity, microbial populations harbor great potential to respond as a community through a combination of strain-level phenotypic plasticity, adaptation, and species sorting. However, the relative importance of these mechanisms remains unclear. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the degree to which bacterial communities can respond to changes in environmental temperature through a combination of phenotypic plasticity and species sorting alone. We grew replicate soil communities from a single location at six temperatures between 4°C and 50°C. We found that phylogenetically and functionally distinct communities emerge at each of these temperatures, with <i>K</i>-strategist taxa favored under cooler conditions and <i>r</i>-strategist taxa under warmer conditions. We show that this dynamic emergence of distinct communities across a wide range of temperatures (in essence, community-level adaptation) is driven by the resuscitation of latent functional diversity: the parent community harbors multiple strains pre-adapted to different temperatures that are able to ‘switch on’ at their preferred temperature without immigration or adaptation. Our findings suggest that microbial community function in nature is likely to respond rapidly to climatic temperature fluctuations through shifts in species composition by resuscitation of latent functional diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tree species and genetic diversity increase productivity via functional diversity and trophic feedbacks</a></h4>

              
                Addressing global biodiversity loss requires an expanded focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity. While most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity, our mechanistic understanding of how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity remains limited. Here, we use a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity, and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. We found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested. Given the complexity of interactions between species and genetic diversity, tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on productivity, we suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A motor neuron disease-associated mutation produces non-glycosylated Seipin that induces ER stress and apoptosis by inactivating SERCA2b</a></h4>

              
                A causal relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the development of neurodegenerative diseases remains controversial. Here, we focused on Seipinopathy, a dominant motor neuron disease, based on the finding that its causal gene product, Seipin, is a protein that spans the ER membrane twice. Gain-of-function mutations of Seipin produce non-glycosylated Seipin (ngSeipin), which was previously shown to induce ER stress and apoptosis at both cell and mouse levels albeit with no clarified mechanism. We found that aggregation-prone ngSeipin dominantly inactivated SERCA2b, the major calcium pump in the ER, and decreased the calcium concentration in the ER, leading to ER stress and apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma-derived cells (HCT116). This inactivation required oligomerization of ngSeipin and direct interaction of the C-terminus of ngSeipin with SERCA2b, and was observed in Seipin-deficient neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells expressing ngSeipin at an endogenous protein level. Our results thus provide a new direction to the controversy noted above.

	<p>Research on visual encoding models for functional magnetic resonance imaging derived from deep neural networks, especially CNN (e.g., VGG16), has been developed. However, CNNs typically use smaller kernel sizes (e.g., 3 &amp;amp;times; 3) for feature extraction in visual encoding models. Although the receptive field size of CNN can be enlarged by increasing the network depth or subsampling, it is limited by the small size of the convolution kernel, leading to an insufficient receptive field size. In biological research, the size of the neuronal population receptive field of high-level visual encoding regions is usually three to four times that of low-level visual encoding regions. Thus, CNNs with a larger receptive field size align with the biological findings. The RepLKNet model directly expands the convolution kernel size to obtain a larger-scale receptive field. Therefore, this paper proposes a mixed model to replace CNN for feature extraction in visual encoding models. The proposed model mixes RepLKNet and VGG so that the mixed model has a receptive field of different sizes to extract more feature information from the image. The experimental results indicate that the mixed model achieves better encoding performance in multiple regions of the visual cortex than the traditional convolutional model. Also, a larger-scale receptive field should be considered in building visual encoding models so that the convolution network can play a more significant role in visual representations.</p>

	<p>Transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) is a rare cause of acute amnestic syndromes (AAS), often misdiagnosed as transient global amnesia (TGA). We proposed a scoring system&amp;amp;mdash;the EPIlepsy AMNEsia (EPIAMNE) score&amp;amp;mdash;using quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis to obtain a tool for differentiating TEA from TGA. We retrospectively reviewed clinical information and standard EEGs (stEEG) of 19 patients with TEA and 21 with TGA. We computed and compared Power Spectral Density, demonstrating an increased relative theta power in TGA. We subsequently incorporated qEEG features in EPIAMNE score, together with clinical and stEEG features. ROC curve models and pairwise ROC curve comparison were used to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy for TEA detection of EPIAMNE score, presence of symptoms atypical for TGA (pSymAT) and identification of anomalies (interictal epileptiform or temporal focal spiky transients) at stEEG (PosEEG). Area Under the Curve (AUC) of EPIAMNE score revealed to be higher than PosEEG and pSymAT (AUCEPIAMNE = 0.95, AUCpSymAT = 0.85, AUCPosEEG = 0.67) and this superiority proved to be statistically significant (p-valueEPIAMNE-PosEEG and p-valueEPIAMNE-pSymAT &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, EPIAMNE score classified TEA with higher accuracy than PosEEG and pSymAT. This approach could become a promising tool for the differential diagnosis of AAS, especially for early TEA detection.</p>

	<p>Multiple studies support the relationship between ADHD and overweight/obesity in youth. Different mechanisms may be involved, such as temperamental and psychopathological factors. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that specific temperamental and psychopathological dimensions could mediate the relationship between ADHD and obesity. The sample included 100 children and adolescents (78 males and 22 females; age range 6 to 18 years; mean age 9.90 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.5 years). The assessment procedure included Conners&amp;amp;rsquo; Parent Rating Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Long (CPRS-R:L) as the inclusion criterion for ADHD diagnosis, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a dimensional measure for psychopathology, and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory, which describes four temperamental dimensions: novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence (RD), and persistence (P). While in the whole ADHD sample, the highest scores were found in NS and the lowest in P, ADHD with overweight/obesity, compared to ADHD with normal weight, showed higher HA and RD, lower NS, and higher CBCL Internalizing scores. These findings suggest that ADHD youth with overweight/obesity present specific temperamental and psychopathological features compared to those without overweight/obesity. If confirmed in larger samples, using a control group without ADHD, these temperamental and psychological features may be helpful for an earlier recognition of ADHD patients at higher risk for obesity, and may represent possible targets for temperament-based preventive interventions and tailored treatment programs. These features should be included in the routine assessment of children and adolescents with ADHD and/or are overweight/obese.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine among health care practitioners in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health crisis worldwide. In less than 12 months since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, several different COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and deployed mostly in developed countries since January 2021. However, hesitancy to accept the newly developed vaccines is a well-known public health challenge that needs to be addressed. The aim of this study was to measure willingness and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among health care practitioners' (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia.   Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online self-reported survey was conducted among HCPs in Saudi Arabia between April 4th to April 25th 2021 using snowball sampling. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify the possible factors affecting HCPs’ willingness and hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccines.   Results: Out of 776 participants who started the survey, 505 (65%) completed it and were included in the results. Among all HCPs, 47 (9.3%) either said “no” to receive the vaccine [20 (4%)] or were hesitant to receive it [27 (5.3%)]. Of the total number of the HCPs, 376 (74.5%) already received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 48 (9.50%) were registered to receive it. The main reason of agreement to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was “wanting to protect self and others from getting the infection” (24%).   Conclusion: Our findings have shown that hesitancy toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines among HCPs in Saudi Arabia is limited and therefore may not be a serious issue. The outcomes of this study may help to understand factors that lead to vaccine hesitancy in Saudi Arabia and help public health authorities to design targeted health education interventions aiming to increase uptake of these vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains in a tertiary care center [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Urinary tract infection(UTI) is one of the commonly prevalent bacterial infection in humans.The uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) expresses a range of virulence factors that contribute to their pathogenicity. The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated UTI is increasing.This study monitors the distribution of virulence factors among UPEC strains to note the antibiogram, outcome and type of associated UTI. Methods:A prospective cross-sectional time-bound study of six months was done on clinically significant urinary isolates of Escherichia coli. Detection of haemolysin production and serum resistance was done by phenotypic methods. Genotypic characterization of the virulence genes (papC, iutA, hlyA, cnf1) was done by multiplex PCR. Demographic data, clinical history, antibiogram and type of UTI was collected from clinical case records. Results:75 E.coli isolates from patients with suspected UTIs were included. Females had a higher preponderance of UTI (66.7%). 93% of patients were adults and the remaining 7% were from paediatrics.  24 (32%) isolates showed haemolysis by plate haemolysis and all isolates were serum-resistant. Out of 75 isolates, 65 were positive for at least one of four targeted genes, while remaining ten isolates were negative for all four genes.Multidrug resistance was found in 40 (53.3%) isolates. 97.4% of the UTI cases had a favourable clinical outcome at discharge. Mortality due to urosepsis was 2.6%. Conclusion:Association of hemolysin production with resistance to imipenem and norfloxacin in UPEC strains was significant.Presence of hlyA gene is positively associated with ceftazidime resistance. Nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and cefaperazone sulbactam are possible candidates for empirical therapy of UTIs. Drugs like aminoglycosides, carbapenems and fosfomycin may be used as reserve drugs in the treatment of MDR-UTI.However, inappropriate usage can increase antibiotic resistance. Hence proper selection of antibiotics in hospitals taking into account the local antibiogram is needed to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PhenoApp: A mobile tool for plant phenotyping to record field and greenhouse observations [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                With the ongoing cost decrease of genotyping and sequencing technologies, accurate and fast phenotyping remains the bottleneck in the utilizing of plant genetic resources for breeding and breeding research. Although cost-efficient high-throughput phenotyping platforms are emerging for specific traits and/or species, manual phenotyping is still widely used and is a time- and money-consuming step. Approaches that improve data recording, processing or handling are pivotal steps towards the efficient use of genetic resources and are demanded by the research community. Therefore, we developed PhenoApp, an open-source Android app for tablets and smartphones to facilitate the digital recording of phenotypical data in the field and in greenhouses. It is a versatile tool that offers the possibility to fully customize the descriptors/scales for any possible scenario, also in accordance with international information standards such as MIAPPE (Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Furthermore, PhenoApp enables the use of pre-integrated ready-to-use BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt für Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie) scales for apple, cereals, grapevine, maize, potato, rapeseed and rice. Additional BBCH scales can easily be added. The simple and adaptable structure of input and output files enables an easy data handling by either spreadsheet software or even the integration in the workflow of laboratory information management systems (LIMS). PhenoApp is therefore a decisive contribution to increase efficiency of digital data acquisition in genebank management but also contributes to breeding and breeding research by accelerating the labour intensive and time-consuming acquisition of phenotyping data.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">De Novo Brain-Computer Interfacing Deforms Manifold of Populational Neural Activity Patterns in Human Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human brains are capable of modulating innate activities to adapt to novel environments and tasks; for sensorimotor neural system this means acquisition of a rich repertoire of activity patterns that improve behavioral performance. To directly map the process of acquiring the neural repertoire during tasks onto performance improvement, we analyzed net neural populational activity during the learning of its voluntary modulation by brain-computer interface (BCI) operation in female and male humans. The recorded whole-head high-density scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) were subjected to dimensionality reduction algorithm to capture changes in cortical activity patterns represented by the synchronization of neuronal oscillations during adaptation. Although the preserved variance of targeted features in the reduced dimensions was 20%, we found systematic interactions between the activity patterns and BCI classifiers that detected motor attempt; the neural manifold derived in the embedded space was stretched along with motor-related features of EEG by model-based fixed classifiers but not with adaptive classifiers that were constantly recalibrated to user activity. Moreover, the manifold was deformed to be orthogonal to the boundary by <I>de novo</I> classifiers with a fixed decision boundary based on biologically unnatural features. Collectively, the flexibility of human cortical signaling patterns (i.e., neural plasticity) is only induced by operation of a BCI whose classifier required fixed activities, and the adaptation could be induced even the requirement is not consistent with biologically natural responses. These principles of neural adaptation at a macroscopic level may underlie the ability of humans to learn wide-ranging behavioral repertoires and adapt to novel environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Angular Tuning Properties of Low Threshold Mechanoreceptors in Isolated Rat Whisker Hair Follicles</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Angular tuning is preferential sensory response to a directional stimulus and is observed in the whisker tactile system. In whisker hair follicles, there are at least three types of low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs): rapidly adapting (RA), slowly adapting type 1 (SA1), and slowly adapting type 2 (SA2). These LTMRs display angular tuning but their properties remain incompletely studied. Here, we used isolated rat whisker hair follicles and pressure-clamped single-fiber recordings to study angular tuning of these LTMRs. Angular tuning was determined with impulses elicited by ramp-and-hold deflection of whisker hair in 24 directions each at 15&deg; for a total of 360&deg;. We show that RA display impulses during ramp-up, both ramp-up and ramp-down, or ramp-down dynamic phases. Both SA1 and SA2 respond to angular stimuli with slowly adapting impulses in most angles. However, SA1 and SA2 show rapidly adapting responses in other angles. All the three types of LTMRs display strong angular tuning, and there is no significant difference in angular tuning index among them. Population wise, the majority of SA1 are tuned in the caudal direction, a large part of SA2 is tuned in the rostral direction, and RAs are tuned in multiple directions. In the angles showing strong tuning, the three LTMRs respond to increased stimulation amplitudes with increased impulse numbers in a hyperbola relationship, and the responsiveness based on impulse numbers is SA2 &gt; SA1 &gt; RA. Our findings provide new information on angular tuning properties of LTMRs in whisker hair follicles and help to understand directional encoding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Model for the Propagation of Seizure Activity in Normal Brain Tissue</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Epilepsies are characterized by paroxysmal electrophysiological events and seizures, which can propagate across the brain. One of the main unsolved questions in epilepsy is how epileptic activity can invade normal tissue and thus propagate across the brain. To investigate this question, we consider three computational models at the neural network scale to study the underlying dynamics of seizure propagation, understand which specific features play a role, and relate them to clinical or experimental observations. We consider both the internal connectivity structure between neurons and the input properties in our characterization. We show that a paroxysmal input is sometimes controlled by the network while in other instances, it can lead the network activity to itself produce paroxysmal activity, and thus will further propagate to efferent networks. We further show how the details of the network architecture are essential to determine this switch to a seizure-like regime. We investigated the nature of the instability involved and in particular found a central role for the inhibitory connectivity. We propose a probabilistic approach to the propagative/non-propagative scenarios, which may serve as a guide to control the seizure by using appropriate stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In vitro apical microleakage evaluation for different endodontic sealers by spectrophotometric analysis: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It has been established that several filling techniques can affect apical leakage, which is responsible for 59% of endodontic failures. The primary goal of endodontic therapy is to create a tight seal that aids in repairing the periapical tissues, prevents apical periodontitis, and shields against root canal infection. The study aims to compare the apical sealing ability of epoxy resin based sealer  (AH plus), which is an epoxy-resin-based root canal sealer, GuttaFlow 2, which is a silicone-based root canal sealer, GuttaFlow bioseal is a bioactive glass-based root canal sealer, TotalFill HiFlow bioceramic (BC) sealer is a silicate-based root canal sealer (bioceramic sealer) using a single cone technique by spectrophotometric analysis.  Methods: This study chose 64 maxillary first molars with a straight palatal root. Following palatal roots sectioning to 11 mm from the root apex, the canals were instrumented up to size X4 using Protaper Next. They were separated into  four experimental groups (n = 15) per each group based on the kind of sealer utilized, Group I: AH plus, Group II: GuttaFlow 2, Group III: GuttaFlow bioseal, Group IV: TotalFill BC HiFlow, and two control groups (n =2 for each).  After completing obturation, the dye extraction technique was used to evaluate apical leakage. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical density of the solution after all the dyes were liberated from the interfacial regions. Result: A statistically non-significant difference between the investigated root canal sealers in apical microleakage P > 0.05 was noted. The highest mean values were observed in group IV (0.08046), group I(0.07731), and group II(0.06209), while the lowest mean value in group III (0.05719) Conclusions: All types of sealers used in this investigation showed various amounts of microleakage. None of the sealants could completely close the apical foramen to provide a fluid-tight seal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anticancer and antiretroviral activities of methanolic extract from Theobroma cacao L pod husk: focusing on the ethyl acetate partition [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many researchers have paid attention to Theobroma cocoa pod husk for its bioactive phytoconstituents which have several medicinal benefits. Herein, we aim to evaluate the methanolic extract from T. cocoa pod husk and its partitions for their anticancer and antiretroviral activities. Methods: The T. cocoa pod husk was macerated using methanol, and then sequentially partitioned with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. MCF-7 and HeLa cells were used to assess the anticancer activities, while the simian retrovirus-2 (SRV-2)-infected A549 cells were used for antiretroviral study. The ethyl acetate partition (TCEA) was then fractionated and screened for in-vitro antioxidant and cytotoxicity. The most active fraction was sub-fractionated and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Results: The results suggested that TCEA had moderate and weak activities against MCF-7 (IC50=53.91 μg/mL) and HeLa cells (IC50=120.71 μg/mL), respectively. TCEA 125 μg/mL had higher anti-SRV-2 activity in comparison with lamivudine 25 μg/mL after 1—7 days of incubation. The GC-MS analysis of the polyphenol-predominated sub-fraction from the most active fraction revealed the presence of lupeol, syringaresinol, catechol, and squalene. Conclusions: TCEA derived from the methanolic extract of T. cacao pod husk had moderate activity against MCF-7 cells and weak activity against HeLa cells. Antiretroviral study suggests that TCEA 125 μg/mL had higher inhibitory activity against SRV-2 replication as compared to lamivudine 25 μg/mL.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dynamic geographical accessibility assessments to improve health equity: protocol for a test case in Cali, Colombia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This protocol proposes an approach to assessing the place of residence as a spatial determinant of health in cities where traffic congestion might impact health services accessibility. The study provides dynamic travel times presenting data in ways that help shape decisions and spur action by diverse stakeholders and sectors.    Equity assessments in geographical accessibility to health services typically rely on static metrics, such as distance or average travel times. This new approach uses dynamic spatial accessibility measures providing travel times from the place of residence to the health service with the shortest journey time. It will show the interplay between traffic congestion, accessibility, and health equity and should be used to inform urban and health services monitoring and planning.   Available digitised data enable efficient and accurate accessibility measurements for urban areas using publicly available sources and provide disaggregated sociodemographic information and an equity perspective.   Test cases are done for urgent and frequent care (i.e., repeated ambulatory care). Situational analyses will be done with cross-sectional urban assessments; estimated potential improvements will be made for one or two new services, and findings will inform recommendations and future studies.   This study will use visualisations and descriptive statistics to allow non-specialized stakeholders to understand the effects of accessibility on populations and health equity. This includes “time-to-destination” metrics or the proportion of the people that can reach a service by car within a given travel time threshold from the place of residence.   The study is part of the AMORE Collaborative Project, in which a diverse group of stakeholders seeks to address equity for accessibility to essential health services, including health service users and providers, authorities, and community members, including academia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Demographical domains and clinico-radiological characteristics of study cohorts with spontaneous simultaneous multiple intracerebral hemorrhages in a tertiary neurosurgical center in Nepal: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 ap</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous simultaneous multiple intra-cerebral hemorrhages (SMICHs) and its occurrences in different territories of arterial disposition has been viewed as uncommon clinical occurrences, since the pathophysiological and predisposing factors as mechanisms aren’t vividly defined. This research primarily aims for demographic stratification and dichotomization pertaining to risk factors, etiological classifications, anatomical distributions and outcome analysis by focusing on management strategies and pertinent stroke care. Methods: 40 patients presenting to the College of Medical Sciences, Chitwan, Nepal in the last two years were included in the study. The patients with two or more spontaneous SMICHs with affected arterial territories with similar tomographic density based profiling were chosen as samples. Regression analysis was chosen to test three hypotheses. Results: Among our study cohorts, cortical and cortical territory (60%) was the major anatomical patterns of involvement. A conservative approach was undertaken in nine patients (22.5%), whereas surgical intervention was needed in five others (12.5%). A total of 14(35%) patients leaving against medical advice and a further seven (17.5%) patients were referred for adjuvant oncologic care. Mortality was observed among five (12.5%) patients. Hypertension was seen as a significant variable in its pathogenesis. Male patients were more affected. Age groups comprising 36-45years and 56-65 years were involved in 32.5% and 30% of cases respectively. Conclusion: This study proves the need for a national stroke data bank pertaining to spontaneous SMICHs. This will help foster effective patient education during preoperative counseling; as well as formatting a management algorithm combating them.

                Background: Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections, but the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) has rendered it ineffective in the vast majority of cases. Combination therapy has grown in popularity over the last decade; this study aims to analyze A.baumannii growth kinetics after exposure to meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam compared with meropenem and amikacin antibiotic combinations in clinically relevant concentrations.  Methods: This experimental laboratory study was conducted on the A. baumannii ATCC 19606 isolate and three clinical isolates that were intermediate or resistant to tested antibiotics. Meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam, as well as meropenem and amikacin, were tested at four different concentrations against isolates. Turbidity measurements were taken at predetermined time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours following exposure; bacterial concentration was enumerated using the agar plate method, with the results plotted in a time-kill curve.   Results: A bactericidal effect was achieved in isolates that were intermediate to ampicillin-sulbactam and resistant to meropenem after the administration of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam combination with a concentration of 4 µg/ml and 16/8 µg/ml, respectively. The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam demonstrated bacteriostatic activity against isolates that were resistant to both antibiotics. Isolates treated with resistant antibiotics showed an increased growth rate compared to the growth control.  Conclusion: The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam could be a promising combination therapy in treating CRAB infections. The mechanism and degree of antibiotic resistance in the isolates affect the efficacy of antibiotic combinations; further research is needed to corroborate the findings of this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of an mHealth application on remote monitoring and self-management of persons with hypertension in a coastal taluk of Udupi district: A study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a major cause of death and disability globally. There is increasing evidence that demonstrates clinically relevant benefits from self-monitoring and self-management of blood pressure. Evidence suggests a reduction of systolic BP by 3.2 mm/hg through self-monitoring. The use of mHealth applications in health care monitoring and self-management can help in the timely delivery of health information. Around 33% of Indians use mHealth applications in their daily life. However, well-designed, user complied mHealth applications are essential to reach the masses and to be effective. A previously conducted study in India demonstrated that applications are not customized according to users' needs and expectations and lacked usability assessment by patients. Therefore, we aimed to develop and test a novel mHealth application on remote monitoring and self-management in hypertension. Methods: The study will be carried out in three phases. The first phase will be an in-depth interview to identify the required parameters to develop a customized mHealth android-based application to monitor hypertension. The second phase is to develop the customized application through the Agile development design using the android studio platform. In the third phase, a community-based cluster randomized trial will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention on the remote monitoring and self-management of people with hypertension. A sample of 236 people from 12 villages will be randomized and the mHealth application will be delivered to the intervention group and the standard regimen will be continued in the control group. Results: In the proposed study if the intervention is found to be helpful, then hypertension patients in the community can be encouraged to install the mHealth application. This application, if found effective can improve the health status, knowledge, and self-care approach among hypertensive patients. Registration: CTR India (CTRI/2022/03/041544).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Efficient inference and identifiability analysis for differential equation models with random parameters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander P. Browning, Christopher Drovandi, Ian W. Turner, Adrianne L. Jenner, Matthew J. Simpson</p>

Heterogeneity is a dominant factor in the behaviour of many biological processes. Despite this, it is common for mathematical and statistical analyses to ignore biological heterogeneity as a source of variability in experimental data. Therefore, methods for exploring the identifiability of models that explicitly incorporate heterogeneity through variability in model parameters are relatively underdeveloped. We develop a new likelihood-based framework, based on moment matching, for inference and identifiability analysis of differential equation models that capture biological heterogeneity through parameters that vary according to probability distributions. As our novel method is based on an approximate likelihood function, it is highly flexible; we demonstrate identifiability analysis using both a frequentist approach based on profile likelihood, and a Bayesian approach based on Markov-chain Monte Carlo. Through three case studies, we demonstrate our method by providing a didactic guide to inference and identifiability analysis of hyperparameters that relate to the statistical moments of model parameters from independent observed data. Our approach has a computational cost comparable to analysis of models that neglect heterogeneity, a significant improvement over many existing alternatives. We demonstrate how analysis of random parameter models can aid better understanding of the sources of heterogeneity from biological data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of path information in visual perception of joint stiffness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by A. Michael West Jr., Meghan E. Huber, Neville Hogan</p>

Humans have an astonishing ability to extract hidden information from the movement of others. In previous work, subjects observed the motion of a simulated stick-figure, two-link planar arm and estimated its stiffness. Fundamentally, stiffness is the relation between force and displacement. Given that subjects were unable to physically interact with the simulated arm, they were forced to make their estimates solely based on observed kinematic information. Remarkably, subjects were able to correctly correlate their stiffness estimates with changes in the simulated stiffness, despite the lack of force information. We hypothesized that subjects were only able to do this because the controller used to produce the simulated arm’s movement, composed of oscillatory motions driving mechanical impedances, resembled the controller humans use to produce their own movement. However, it is still unknown what motion features subjects used to estimate stiffness. Human motion exhibits systematic velocity-curvature patterns, and it has previously been shown that these patterns play an important role in perceiving and interpreting motion. Thus, we hypothesized that manipulating the velocity profile should affect subjects’ ability to estimate stiffness. To test this, we changed the velocity profile of the simulated two-link planar arm while keeping the simulated joint paths the same. Even with manipulated velocity signals, subjects were still able to estimate changes in simulated joint stiffness. However, when subjects were shown the same simulated path with different velocity profiles, they perceived motions that followed a veridical velocity profile to be less stiff than that of a non-veridical profile. These results suggest that path information (displacement) predominates over temporal information (velocity) when humans use visual observation to estimate stiffness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inference of B cell clonal families using heavy/light chain pairing information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Duncan K. Ralph, Frederick A. Matsen IV</p>

Next generation sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires has become a ubiquitous tool for understanding the antibody-mediated immune response: it is now common to have large volumes of sequence data coding for both the heavy and light chain subunits of the BCR. However, until the recent development of high throughput methods of preserving heavy/light chain pairing information, these samples contained no explicit information on which heavy chain sequence pairs with which light chain sequence. One of the first steps in analyzing such BCR repertoire samples is grouping sequences into clonally related families, where each stems from a single rearrangement event. Many methods of accomplishing this have been developed, however, none so far has taken full advantage of the newly-available pairing information. This information can dramatically improve clustering performance, especially for the light chain. The light chain has traditionally been challenging for clonal family inference because of its low diversity and consequent abundance of non-clonal families with indistinguishable naive rearrangements. Here we present a method of incorporating this pairing information into the clustering process in order to arrive at a more accurate partition of the data into clonally related families. We also demonstrate two methods of fixing imperfect pairing information, which may allow for simplified sample preparation and increased sequencing depth. Finally, we describe several other improvements to the <i>partis</i> software package.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The geometry of representational drift in natural and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kyle Aitken, Marina Garrett, Shawn Olsen, Stefan Mihalas</p>

Neurons in sensory areas encode/represent stimuli. Surprisingly, recent studies have suggested that, even during persistent performance, these representations are not stable and change over the course of days and weeks. We examine stimulus representations from fluorescence recordings across hundreds of neurons in the visual cortex using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and we corroborate previous studies finding that such representations change as experimental trials are repeated across days. This phenomenon has been termed “representational drift”. In this study we geometrically characterize the properties of representational drift in the primary visual cortex of mice in two open datasets from the Allen Institute and propose a potential mechanism behind such drift. We observe representational drift both for passively presented stimuli, as well as for stimuli which are behaviorally relevant. Across experiments, the drift differs from in-session variance and most often occurs along directions that have the most in-class variance, leading to a significant turnover in the neurons used for a given representation. Interestingly, despite this significant change due to drift, linear classifiers trained to distinguish neuronal representations show little to no degradation in performance across days. The features we observe in the neural data are similar to properties of artificial neural networks where representations are updated by continual learning in the presence of dropout, i.e. a random masking of nodes/weights, but not other types of noise. Therefore, we conclude that a potential reason for the representational drift in biological networks is driven by an underlying dropout-like noise while continuously learning and that such a mechanism may be computational advantageous for the brain in the same way it is for artificial neural networks, e.g. preventing overfitting.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Experimental validation of computerised models of clustering of platelet glycoprotein receptors that signal via tandem SH2 domain proteins</a></h4>

The clustering of platelet glycoprotein receptors with cytosolic YxxL and YxxM motifs, including GPVI, CLEC-2 and PEAR1, triggers activation via phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residues and recruitment of the tandem SH2 (Src homology 2) domain effector proteins, Syk and PI 3-kinase. We have modelled the clustering of these receptors with monovalent, divalent and tetravalent soluble ligands and with transmembrane ligands based on the law of mass action using ordinary differential equations and agent-based modelling. The models were experimentally evaluated in platelets and transfected cell lines using monovalent and multivalent ligands, including novel nanobody-based divalent and tetravalent ligands, by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Ligand valency, receptor number, receptor dimerisation, receptor phosphorylation and a cytosolic tandem SH2 domain protein act in synergy to drive receptor clustering. Threshold concentrations of a CLEC-2-blocking antibody and Syk inhibitor act in synergy to block platelet aggregation. This offers a strategy for countering the effect of avidity of multivalent ligands and in limiting off-target effects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational modeling approach for predicting multicell spheroid patterns based on signaling-induced differential adhesion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nikita Sivakumar, Helen V. Warner, Shayn M. Peirce, Matthew J. Lazzara</p>

Physiological and pathological processes including embryogenesis and tumorigenesis rely on the ability of individual cells to work collectively to form multicell patterns. In these heterogeneous multicell systems, cell-cell signaling induces differential adhesion between cells that leads to tissue-level patterning. However, the sensitivity of pattern formation to changes in the strengths of signaling or cell adhesion processes is not well understood. Prior work has explored these issues using synthetically engineered heterogeneous multicell spheroid systems, in which cell subpopulations engage in bidirectional intercellular signaling to regulate the expression of different cadherins. While engineered cell systems provide excellent experimental tools to observe pattern formation in cell populations, computational models of these systems may be leveraged to explore more systematically how specific combinations of signaling and adhesion parameters can drive the emergence of unique patterns. We developed and validated two- and three-dimensional agent-based models (ABMs) of spheroid patterning for previously described cells engineered with a bidirectional signaling circuit that regulates N- and P-cadherin expression. Systematic exploration of model predictions, some of which were experimentally validated, revealed how cell seeding parameters, the order of signaling events, probabilities of induced cadherin expression, and homotypic adhesion strengths affect pattern formation. Unsupervised clustering was also used to map combinations of signaling and adhesion parameters to these unique spheroid patterns predicted by the ABM. Finally, we demonstrated how the model may be deployed to design new synthetic cell signaling circuits based on a desired final multicell pattern.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Attentional enhancement predicts individual differences in visual working memory under go/no-go search conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Tay, John J. McDonald</p>

Attention-control processes transfer relevant information to visual working memory (WM) and prevent irrelevant information from consuming WM resources. Although event-related potentials (ERPs) have revealed attention-control processes associated with enhancement of relevant stimuli (targets) and suppression of irrelevant stimuli (distractors), only the suppressive processes have been found to predict WM capacity. We hypothesised a link between target-enhancement processes and WM capacity would be revealed in a task that requires more control than the conventional visual search paradigms used to study target selection. Here, participants searched for a pop-out target on Go trials and withheld responses on an equal number of randomly intermixed No-Go trials, depending on the colour of the stimulus array. Magnitudes of ERP indices associated with target enhancement (the singleton detection positivity (SDP) and N2pc) were positively correlated with individual differences in WM capacity. These relationships vanished when participants searched for the pop-out target on every trial, regardless of stimulus-array colour. Inhibitory processes associated with suppressing distractors (P<sub>D</sub>) and withholding responses (no-go P3) on No-Go trials did not predict WM capacity. These findings indicate that target-enhancement mechanisms control access to WM in search tasks that require dynamic control and disconfirm the view that the gateway to WM is entirely inhibitory by nature.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Mycobacterium tuberculosis PE15/PPE20 complex transports calcium across the outer membrane</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vishant Boradia, Andrew Frando, Christoph Grundner</p>

The mechanisms by which nutrients traverse the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) outer membrane remain mostly unknown and, in the absence of classical porins, likely involve specialized transport systems. Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are an important nutrient and serve as a second messenger in eukaryotes, but whether bacteria have similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling systems is not well understood. To understand the basis for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport and signaling in <i>Mtb</i>, we determined <i>Mtb’s</i> transcriptional response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Overall, only few genes changed expression, suggesting a limited role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a transcriptional regulator. However, 2 of the most strongly down-regulated genes were the <i>pe15</i> and <i>ppe20</i> genes that code for members of a large family of proteins that localize to the outer membrane and comprise many intrinsically disordered proteins. PE15 and PPE20 formed a complex and PPE20 directly bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-associated phenotypes such as increased ATP consumption and biofilm formation were reversed in a <i>pe15/ppe20</i> knockout (KO) strain, suggesting a direct role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. To test whether the PE15/PPE20 complex has a role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport across the outer membrane, we created a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter strain. A <i>pe15/ppe20</i> KO in the FRET background showed a specific and selective loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that was dependent on the presence of an intact outer cell wall. These data show that PE15/PPE20 form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein complex that selectively imports Ca<sup>2+</sup>, show a distinct transport function for an intrinsically disordered protein, and support the emerging idea of a general family-wide role of PE/PPE proteins as idiosyncratic transporters across the outer membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Posteromedial thalamic nucleus activity significantly contributes to perceptual discrimination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jia Qi, Changquan Ye, Shovan Naskar, Ana R. Inácio, Soohyun Lee</p>

Higher-order sensory thalamic nuclei are densely connected with multiple cortical and subcortical areas, yet the role of these nuclei remains elusive. The posteromedial (POm) thalamic nucleus, the higher-order thalamic nucleus in the rodent somatosensory system, is an anatomical hub broadly connected with multiple sensory and motor brain areas yet weakly responds to passive sensory stimulation and whisker movements. To understand the role of POm in sensory perception, we developed a self-initiated, two-alternative forced-choice task in freely moving mice during active sensing. Using optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation, we show that POm thalamic nucleus plays a significant role in sensory perception and the projection from the primary somatosensory cortex to POm is critical for the contribution of POm in sensory perception during active sensing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Whole-genome scanning reveals environmental selection mechanisms that shape diversity in populations of the epipelagic diatom Chaetoceros</a></h4>

Diatoms form a diverse and abundant group of photosynthetic protists that are essential players in marine ecosystems. However, the microevolutionary structure of their populations remains poorly understood, particularly in polar regions. Exploring how closely related diatoms adapt to different environments is essential given their short generation times, which may allow rapid adaptations, and their prevalence in marine regions dramatically impacted by climate change, such as the Arctic and Southern Oceans. Here, we address genetic diversity patterns in <i>Chaetoceros</i>, the most abundant diatom genus and one of the most diverse, using 11 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) reconstructed from <i>Tara</i> Oceans metagenomes. Genome-resolved metagenomics on these MAGs confirmed a prevalent distribution of <i>Chaetoceros</i> in the Arctic Ocean with lower dispersal in the Pacific and Southern Oceans as well as in the Mediterranean Sea. Single-nucleotide variants identified within the different MAG populations allowed us to draw a landscape of <i>Chaetoceros</i> genetic diversity and revealed an elevated genetic structure in some Arctic Ocean populations. Gene flow patterns of closely related <i>Chaetoceros</i> populations seemed to correlate with distinct abiotic factors rather than with geographic distance. We found clear positive selection of genes involved in nutrient availability responses, in particular for iron (e.g., ISIP2a, flavodoxin), silicate, and phosphate (e.g., polyamine synthase), that were further supported by analysis of <i>Chaetoceros</i> transcriptomes. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of environmental selection in shaping diatom diversity patterns and provide new insights into their metapopulation genomics through the integration of metagenomic and environmental data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A single N6-methyladenosine site regulates lncRNA HOTAIR function in breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Allison M. Porman, Justin T. Roberts, Emily D. Duncan, Madeline L. Chrupcala, Ariel A. Levine, Michelle A. Kennedy, Michelle M. Williams, Jennifer K. Richer, Aaron M. Johnson</p>

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA regulates normal and cancer biology, but knowledge of its function on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) remains limited. Here, we reveal that m6A regulates the breast cancer-associated human lncRNA HOTAIR. Mapping m6A in breast cancer cell lines, we identify multiple m6A sites on HOTAIR, with 1 single consistently methylated site (A783) that is critical for HOTAIR-driven proliferation and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Methylated A783 interacts with the m6A “reader” YTHDC1, promoting chromatin association of HOTAIR, proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells, and gene repression. A783U mutant HOTAIR induces a unique antitumor gene expression profile and displays loss-of-function and antimorph behaviors by impairing and, in some cases, causing opposite gene expression changes induced by wild-type (WT) HOTAIR. Our work demonstrates how modification of 1 base in an lncRNA can elicit a distinct gene regulation mechanism and drive cancer-associated phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The dynamics and determinants of specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in three adult cohorts in the Ecuadorian Andes: a study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: There are limited longitudinal data on the systemic and mucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 from Latin America, a region severely affected by COVID-19, and where vaccine strategies have been implemented during the evolving pandemic. Objective: To evaluate determinants of seroprevalence and changes in levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies longitudinally in adults with different levels of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (defined a priori as low, medium, and high based on presumed occupational risk), in two Andean cities in Ecuador. Methods: Longitudinal cohort study of 1,000 adults aged 18 years and older with questionnaire data and sample collection done at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months during the period 2020-2023. Observations collected included WHO-ISARIC questionnaire and peripheral blood and saliva samples for measurement of IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively.  Planned analyses are tailored to the longitudinal nature of the outcomes defined by participants’ antibody levels and aim at estimating their average trends with time since infection in each of the occupational groups, adjusted for demographics and calendar-time levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population. The latter reflect the impact of the national control measures such as vaccinations and movement restrictions. Importance: Understanding the duration and the dynamics of waning immunity to SARS-CoV-2, in the context of exposures to emerging virus variants and immunization, will inform the implementation of targeted public health strategies in the Latin American region. Ethics and Dissemination: This study will observe the bioethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent will be obtained. Samples from participants will be stored for up to three years after which they will be destroyed. The study protocol was approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health Ethics Committee for COVID-19 Research. Antibody results will be provided to participants and participating institutions and to the national health authorities.

<p>The moderate to strong associations between gene and protein expression for CB1 receptor in the human brain were observed and we produced the density atlas map of CB1 receptor for the first time in the human brain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We aimed to integrate genomic mapping from brain mRNA atlas with the protein expression from positron emission tomography (PET) scans of type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor and to compare the predictive power of CB1 receptor with those of other neuroreceptor/transporters using a meta-analysis. Volume of distribution (<i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub>) from F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans, CNR1 gene (Cannabinoid receptor 1) expression, and H3-CP55940 binding were calculated and correlation analysis was performed. Between <i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub> of F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA expression, moderate strength of correlation was observed (<i>rho</i> = .5067, <i>p</i> = .0337). Strong positive correlation was also found between CNR1 mRNA expression and H3-CP55940 binding (<i>r</i> = .6336, <i>p</i> = .0364), validating the finding between F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA. The correlation between <i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub> of F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and H3-CP55940 binding was marginally significant (<i>r</i> = .5025, <i>p</i> = .0563). From the meta-analysis, the correlation coefficient between mRNA expression and protein expressions ranged from −.10 to .99, with a pooled effect of .76. In conclusion, we observed the moderate to strong associations between gene and protein expression for CB1 receptor in the human brain, which was validated by autoradiography. We combined the autoradiographic finding with PET of CB1 receptor, producing the density atlas map of CB1 receptor. From the meta-analysis, the moderate to strong correlation was observed between mRNA expression and protein expressions across multiple genes. Further study is needed to investigate the relationship between multiple genes and in vivo proteins to improve and accelerate drug development.</p>

                Dysregulation of the imprinted <i>H19/IGF2</i> locus can lead to Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) in humans. However, the mechanism of how abnormal <i>H19/IGF2</i> expression contributes to various SRS phenotypes remains unclear, largely due to incomplete understanding of the developmental functions of these two genes. We previously generated a mouse model with humanized <i>H19/IGF2</i> imprinting control region (<i>hIC1</i>) on the paternal allele that exhibited <i>H19/Igf2</i> dysregulation together with SRS-like growth restriction and perinatal lethality. Here, we dissect the role of <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i> in cardiac and placental development utilizing multiple mouse models with varying levels of <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i>. We report severe cardiac defects such as ventricular septal defects and thinned myocardium, placental anomalies including thrombosis and vascular malformations, together with growth restriction in mouse embryos that correlated with the extent of <i>H19/Igf2</i> dysregulation. Transcriptomic analysis using cardiac endothelial cells of these mouse models shows that <i>H19/Igf2</i> dysregulation disrupts pathways related to extracellular matrix and proliferation of endothelial cells. Our work links the heart and placenta through regulation by <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i>, demonstrating that accurate dosage of both <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2</i> is critical for normal embryonic development, especially related to the cardiac-placental axis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glutamine synthetase mRNA releases sRNA from its 3´UTRto regulate carbon/nitrogen metabolic balance in Enterobacteriaceae</a></h4>

              
                Glutamine synthetase (GS) is the key enzyme of nitrogen assimilation induced under nitrogen limiting conditions. The carbon skeleton of glutamate and glutamine, 2-oxoglutarate, is supplied from the TCA cycle, but how this metabolic flow is controlled in response to nitrogen availability remains unknown. We show that the expression of the E1o component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, SucA, is repressed under nitrogen limitation in <i>Salmonella</i> <i>enterica</i> and <i>E coli</i>. The repression is exerted at the post-transcriptional level by an Hfq-dependent sRNA GlnZ generated from the 3´UTR of the GS-encoding <i>glnA</i> mRNA. Enterobacterial GlnZ variants contain a conserved seed sequence and primarily regulate <i>sucA</i> through base-pairing far upstream of the translation initiation region. During growth on glutamine as the nitrogen source, the <i>glnA</i> 3´UTR deletion mutants expressed SucA at higher levels than the <i>S. enterica</i> and<i> E. coli</i> wild-type strains, respectively. In <i>E. coli</i>, the transcriptional regulator Nac also participates in the repression of <i>sucA</i>. Lastly, this study clarifies that the release of GlnZ from the <i>glnA</i> mRNA by RNase E is essential for the post-transcriptional regulation of <i>sucA</i>. Thus the mRNA coordinates the two independent functions to balance the supply and demand of the fundamental metabolites.

                Attentional modulation of sensory processing is a key feature of cognition, yet its neural circuit basis is poorly understood. A candidate mechanism is the disinhibition of pyramidal cells through vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SOM) positive interneurons. However, the interaction of attentional modulation and VIP-SOM disinhibition has never been directly tested. We used all-optical methods to bi-directionally manipulate VIP interneuron activity as mice performed an attention switching task. We measured the activity of VIP, SOM and parvalbumin (PV) positive interneurons and pyramidal neurons identified in the same tissue and found that although activity in all cell classes was modulated by both attention and VIP manipulation, their effects were orthogonal. Attention and VIP-SOM disinhibition relied on distinct patterns of changes in activity and reorganisation of interactions between inhibitory and excitatory cells. These results reveal the remarkable ability of cortical circuits to multiplex strong yet non-interacting modulations in the same neural population.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new theoretical framework jointly explains behavioral and neural variability across subjects performing flexible decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The ability to flexibly select and accumulate relevant information to form decisions, while ignoring irrelevant information, is a fundamental component of higher cognition. Yet its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that, under assumptions supported by both monkey and rat data, the space of possible network mechanisms to implement this ability is spanned by the combination of three different components, each with specific behavioral and anatomical implications. We further show that existing electrophysiological and modeling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these components, suggesting that different individuals could use different component combinations. To study variations across subjects, we developed a rat task requiring context-dependent evidence accumulation, and trained many subjects on it. Our task delivers sensory evidence through pulses that have random but precisely known timing, providing high statistical power to characterize each individual's neural and behavioral responses. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioral analysis revealed remarkable heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. The theory further predicts a specific link between behavioral and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. Our results provide a new experimentally-supported theoretical framework to analyze biological and artificial systems performing flexible decision-making tasks, and open the door to the study of individual variability in neural computations underlying higher cognition.

                Perinatal high fat diet (pHFD) exposure is known to affect the development of vagal neurocircuits that control gastrointestinal (GI) motility and reduce stress resiliency in offspring. Descending oxytocin (OXT; prototypical, anti-stress peptide) and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF; prototypical, stress peptide) inputs from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) modulate the GI stress response. However, how these descending inputs, and their associated changes to GI motility and stress responses, are altered following pHFD exposure are unknown. The present study used in vivo recordings of gastric tone and motility, in vivo assays of gastric emptying rates, in vitro electrophysiological recordings from brainstem slice preparations, and retrograde neuronal tracing experiments to investigate the hypothesis that pHFD alters descending PVN-DMV inputs, dysregulating DMV neuronal responses and subsequent gastric motility. Basal gastric emptying rates were found to be significantly delayed in pHFD rats, which also demonstrating an inability to mount an appropriate response to acute stress with a further delay in gastric emptying. Neuronal tracing experiments suggested that pHFD reduced PVNOXT neurons that project to the DMV but increased PVNCRF projections. Whole cell patch clamp recordings of DMV neurons demonstrated that, following pHFD, PVNCRF projections are tonically active, altering GABAergic inputs to DMV neurons. Lastly, blocking DMV CRF receptors in pHFD rats restored the appropriate gastric response to brainstem oxytocin application. Taken together, these results indicate that pHFD exposure leads to an upregulating of CRF inputs to the DMV, resulting in tonic CRF activation on the system and altering gastric motility. These results suggest that pHFD exposure leads gastric dysmotility, leading to a maladaptive gastric stress response and reduced stress resiliency.

                Neurobiological models of learning emphasize the importance of prediction errors (surprises) for memory formation. These effects have focused on memory for information surrounding a momentary surprising event; however, it is less clear whether surprise that unfolds across multiple events and timescales impacts memory. We asked basketball fans about their most positive and negative autobiographical memories of individual plays, games, and seasons, allowing surprise measurements spanning seconds, hours, and months. We used advanced analytics on National Basketball Association play-by-play data and betting odds spanning 17 seasons, >22K games, >5.6M plays to compute and align the estimated surprise values of each memory. We found that surprising events biased positive memories on the scale of seconds and months and negative memories across all three timescales. Critically, game and season memories could not be explained by surprise at shorter timescales, suggesting that long-term, multi-event surprise influences memory. These results expand the role of surprise in models of learning and reinforce its relevance in real-world domains.

                The brain estimates hand position using visual and proprioceptive cues, which are combined to give an integrated multisensory estimate. Spatial mismatches between cues elicit recalibration, a compensatory process where each unimodal estimate is shifted closer to the other. It is unclear how well visuo-proprioceptive recalibration is retained after mismatch exposure. Here we asked whether direct vision and/or active movement of the hand can undo visuo-proprioceptive recalibration, and whether recalibration is still evident 24 hours later. 75 participants performed two blocks of visual, proprioceptive, and combination trials, with no feedback or direct vision of the hand. In Block 1, a 70 mm visuo-proprioceptive mismatch was gradually imposed, and recalibration assessed. Block 2 tested retention. Between blocks, Groups 1-4 rested or made active movements with their directly visible or unseen hand for several minutes. Group 5 had a 24-hour gap between blocks. All five groups recalibrated both vision and proprioception in Block 1, and Groups 1-4 retained most of this recalibration in Block 2. Interestingly, Group 5 showed an offline increase in proprioceptive recalibration, but retained little visual recalibration. Our results suggested that visuo-proprioceptive recalibration is robustly retained in the short-term. In the longer term, contextual factors may affect retention.

                Translating genome-wide association loci to therapies requires knowledge of the causal genes, their directionality of effect and the cell-types in which they act. To infer these relationships in the human brain, we implemented Mendelian randomisation using single cell-type expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as genetic anchors. Expression QTLs were mapped across 8 major cell-types in brain tissue exclusively ascertained from donors with no history of brain disease. We report evidence for a causal association between the change in expression of 118 genes and one or more of 16 brain phenotypes, revealing candidate targets for risk mitigation and opportunities for shared preventative therapeutic strategies. We highlight key causal genes for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease and for each, we report its cellular context and the therapeutic directionality required for risk mitigation. Our use of control samples establishes a new resource for the causal interpretation of GWAS risk alleles for human brain phenotypes.

                Past cognitive neuroscience studies using naturalistic stimuli have considered narratives holistically and focused on cognitive processes. In this study, we incorporated the narrative structure the dramatic arc as an object of investigation, to examine how engagement levels fluctuate across a narrative-aligned dramatic arc. We explored the possibility of predicting self-reported engagement ratings from neural activity and investigated the idiosyncratic effects of each phase of the dramatic arc on brain responses as well as the relationship between engagement and brain responses. We presented a movie excerpt following the six-phase narrative arc structure to female and male participants while collecting EEG signals. We then asked this group of participants to recall the excerpt, another group to segment the video based on the dramatic arc model, and a third to rate their engagement levels while watching the movie. The results showed that the self-reported engagement ratings followed the pattern of the narrative dramatic arc. Moreover, whilst EEG amplitude could not predict group-averaged engagement ratings, other features comprising dynamic inter-subject correlation, dynamic functional connectivity patterns and graph features were able to achieve this. Furthermore, neural activity in the last two phases of the dramatic arc significantly predicted engagement patterns. This study is the first to explore the cognitive processes behind the dramatic arc and its phases. By demonstrating how neural activity predicts self-reported engagement, which itself aligns with the narrative structure, this study provides insights on the interrelationships between narrative structure, neural responses, and viewer engagement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effect of depth on crowding investigated with a multi-depth plane display</a></h4>

              
                Crowding occurs when highly visible objects are rendered unrecognizable in the presence of nearby features. Several studies have demonstrated that crowding can be reduced by depth differences between target and flanking features, which challenges the assumption of real-world significance because real objects typically occur at differing depths. However, most previous studies tested only small differences in depth and/or used standard stereo displays in which disparity, accommodation, and defocus blur are inconsistent with the real world. For this study we developed a multi-depth plane display consisting of three screens at different distances from the observer to test how crowding is affected by large, real differences in target-flanker depth. Overall, perceptual error decreased with increasing target-flanker spacing, but increased when the target or flankers were displayed at a different depth from fixation and one another. Our findings demonstrate that depth can increase crowding when depth differences are large. Analysis of the perceived appearance of the stimuli suggest that outside Panum's Fusional Area, crowding is increased by suppression to maintain single vision rather than by an increase in clutter because of diplopia. These findings suggest that crowding may be a more significant problem in real scenes than is estimated with 2D displays.

                BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation is a major contributor to poor brain pathology across many disease conditions. Specifically, the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF in the hippocampus activates its receptor TNFR1, reducing AMPA receptor trafficking to impair LTP and associated behavioral outcomes. Studies using animal models of GWI have shown both a chronic upregulation of TNF and impaired neurological function. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether selectively inhibiting only the soluble form of TNF (solTNF) that preferentially activates TNFR1 can reverse neuroinflammation to improve neuroplasticity and neurological function. METHODS: GWI was induced in rats by treating with DFP (or vehicle) for 5 consecutive days. Six months later, the rats were treated with XPro1595 (or vehicle) for 2 weeks to selectively inhibit solTNF, after which they were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests (cognition, anxiety-related, depressive-like behavior, and neuropathic pain). MRI brain scans were performed, and the animals were euthanized for brain pathological analysis. RESULTS: The hippocampus of the GWI rats had significantly increased neuroinflammatory levels, resulting in edema and reduced AMPA receptor trafficking to the post-synaptic membrane that collectively promoted impairments in memory, anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and neuropathic pain. However, treating the rats with XPro1595 in the chronic environment attenuated the neuroinflammatory response, that reduced edema and impaired AMPA receptor trafficking, allowing for improvements in all areas of neurological function. CONCLUSION: Overall findings suggest that selectively inhibiting solTNF using XPro1595 reduces neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and overall function when administered in the chronic setting of a rat model of GWI. This data supports the use of XPro1595 in Veterans with GWI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generative network modeling reveals quantitative definitions of bilateral symmetry exhibited by a whole insect brain connectome</a></h4>

              
                Comparing connectomes can help explain how neural connectivity is related to genetics, disease, development, learning, and behavior. However, making statistical inferences about the significance and nature of differences between two networks is an open problem, and such analysis has not been extensively applied to nanoscale connectomes. Here, we investigate this problem via a case study on the bilateral symmetry of a larval Drosophila brain connectome. We translate notions of "bilateral symmetry" to generative models of the network structure of the left and right hemispheres, allowing us to test and refine our understanding of symmetry. We find significant differences in connection probabilities both across the entire left and right networks and between specific cell types. By rescaling connection probabilities or removing certain edges based on weight, we also present adjusted definitions of bilateral symmetry exhibited by this connectome. This work shows how statistical inferences from networks can inform the study of connectomes, facilitating future comparisons of neural structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic weights that correlate with presynaptic selectivity increase decoding performance</a></h4>

              
                The activity of neurons in the visual cortex is often characterized by tuning curves, which are thought to be shaped by Hebbian plasticity during development and sensory experience. This leads to the prediction that neural circuits should be organized such that neurons with similar functional preference are connected with stronger weights. In support of this idea, previous experimental and theoretical work have provided evidence for a model of the visual cortex characterized by such functional subnetworks. A recent experimental study, however, have found that the postsynaptic preferred stimulus was defined by the total number of spines activated by a given stimulus and independent of their individual strength. While this result might seem to contradict previous literature, there are many factors that define how a given synaptic input influences postsynaptic selectivity. Here, we designed a computational model in which postsynaptic functional preference is defined by the number of inputs activated by a given stimulus. Using a plasticity rule where synaptic weights tend to correlate with presynaptic selectivity, and is independent of functional-similarity between pre- and postsynaptic activity, we find that this model can be used to decode presented stimuli in a manner that is comparable to maximum likelihood inference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Profound impact of hippocampal output on the interpretation of tactile input patterns in SI neurons</a></h4>

              
                Due to continuous state variations in neocortical circuits, individual SI neurons in vivo display a variety of intracellular response types to repeated presentations of the exact same tactile input pattern. The specific intracellular response obtained depends on a time-evolving combination of the specific input with the current neocortical state. To manipulate the internal cortical state, we here used brief electrical stimulation of the output region of the hippocampus, which preceded the delivery of specific tactile afferent input patterns to digit 2 of the anesthetized rat. We find that hippocampal output had a diversified and remarkably strong impact on the specific set of intracellular response types each SI neuron displays to each given tactile input pattern. The findings show that hippocampal output can profoundly impact the state-dependent interpretation of tactile inputs in SI neurons and hence influence their perception, potentially with affective and semantic components.

                To explore the neural underpinnings of (dis)honest decision making under quasi-ecological conditions, we used an fMRI adapted version of a card game in which deceptive or truthful decisions are made to an opponent, with or without the risk of getting caught by them. Dishonest decisions were associated to increased activity in a cortico-subcortical circuit including the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, and right caudate. Crucially, deceptive immoral decisions under reputation risk enhanced activity of - and functional connectivity between - the bilateral ACC and left AI, suggesting the need for heightened emotional processing and cognitive control when making immoral decisions under reputation risk. Tellingly, more manipulative individuals required less involvement of the ACC during risky self-gain lies but more involvement during other-gain truths, pointing to the need of cognitive control only when going against one's own moral code.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Balance between direct and indirect pathways of the nucleus accumbens controls social behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deficient social interactions are a hallmark of major neuropsychiatric disorders, and cumulating evidence point to altered social reward and motivation as key underlying mechanisms in these pathologies. In the present study, we aimed at assessing the role of the two striatal projecting neuronal (SPN) populations bearing either D1R or D2R dopamine receptors (D1R- and D2R-SPNs), in modulating social behavior and other behaviors often altered in neuropsychiatric disorders. Methods: We selectively ablated D1R- and D2R-SPNs using an inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)-mediated cell targeting strategy and assessed social behavior as well as repetitive/perseverative behavior, motor function and anxiety levels. We tested the effects of optogenetic stimulation of D2R-SPNs in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) and pharmacological compounds repressing D2R-SPN. Results: Targeted deletion of D1R-SPNs in the NAc blunted social behavior in mice, facilitated skill motor learning and increased anxiety levels. These behaviors were normalized by pharmacological inhibition of D2R-SPN, which also repressed transcription in the efferent nucleus, the ventral pallidum (VP). In contrast, ablation of D1R-SPNs in the dorsal striatum had no impact on social behavior, impaired motor skill learning, and decreased anxiety levels. Deletion of D2R-SPNs in the NAc also produced motor stereotypies but facilitated social behavior and impaired skill motor learning. We mimicked excessive D2R-SPN activity by optically stimulating D2R-SPNs in the NAc and evidenced a severe deficit in social interaction that was prevented by D2R-SPN pharmacological inhibition. Conclusions: Repressing D2R-SPN activity may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to relieve social deficit in neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocyte MCT1 expression does not contribute to the axonal degenerative phenotype observed with ubiquitous MCT1 depletion.</a></h4>

              
                We recently reported that loss of oligodendrocyte metabolic support through the lactate and pyruvate transporter Monocarboxylate Transporter 1 (MCT1) is well tolerated into adulthood. Only with advanced aging did we observe axonal degeneration and hypomyelination due to loss of MCT1 from oligodendroglia lineage cells. MCT1 is also expressed by other glial subtypes, such as astrocytes and endothelial cells where it has been suggested to be essential for learning and memory tasks. However, the importance of MCT1 in these cell types for long-term axonal metabolic support is still unknown. We therefore addressed whether conditional loss of MCT1 from either of these cell types would lead to widespread axonal degeneration with aging. Using a conditional null approach, similar to what was used for oligodendrocyte MCT1 depletion, we observed that conditional knockout of MCT1 from either astrocytes or endothelial cells did not cause neuronal injury. On the other hand, inducible ubiquitous depletion of MCT1 causes late-onset axonal degeneration, comparable with what was observed in our previous study using the oligodendrocyte lineage MCT1 null mice. In summary, we conclude that unlike oligodendrocyte MCT1, astrocyte MCT1 is not an essential driver of astrocyte mediated axonal energy homeostasis with aging.

                Brains contain networks of interconnected neurons, so knowing the network architecture is essential for understanding brain function. We therefore mapped the synaptic-resolution connectome of an insect brain (Drosophila larva) with rich behavior, including learning, value-computation, and action-selection, comprising 3,013 neurons and 544,000 synapses. We characterized neuron-types, hubs, feedforward and feedback pathways, and cross-hemisphere and brain-nerve cord interactions. We found pervasive multisensory and interhemispheric integration, highly recurrent architecture, abundant feedback from descending neurons, and multiple novel circuit motifs. The brain's most recurrent circuits comprised the input and output neurons of the learning center. Some structural features, including multilayer shortcuts and nested recurrent loops, resembled powerful machine learning architectures. The identified brain architecture provides a basis for future experimental and theoretical studies of neural circuits.

                The properties of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons that innervate the distal colon are poorly defined, hindering our understanding of their roles in normal physiology and gastrointestinal disease. Here, we report genetically defined subsets of colon innervating DRG neurons with diverse morphologic and physiologic properties. Four colon innervating DRG neuron populations are mechanosensitive and exhibit distinct force thresholds to colon distension. The highest threshold population, selectively labeled using Bmpr1b genetic tools, is necessary and sufficient for behavioral responses to high colon distension, which is partly mediated by the mechanosensory ion channel Piezo2. This HTMR population mediates behavioral over-reactivity to colon distension caused by inflammation in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, like cutaneous mechanoreceptor populations, colon innervating DRG afferents exhibit distinct anatomical and physiological properties and tile force threshold space, and genetically defined colon innervating HTMRs mediate pathophysiological responses to colon distension revealing a target population for therapeutic intervention.

                A 21-nucleotide duplication in one allele of SNCA was identified in a previously described disease with abundant -synuclein inclusions that we now call juvenile-onset synucleinopathy (JOS). Both wild-type -synuclein and its insertion mutant containing seven additional residues (MAAAEKT) after residue 22 were present in sarkosyl-insoluble material that was extracted from frontal cortex of the individual with JOS and examined by electron cryo-microscopy. The structures of JOS filaments, comprising either a single protofilament, or a pair of protofilaments, revealed a new -synuclein fold that differs from the folds of Lewy body diseases and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The JOS fold consists of a compact core, the sequence of which (residues 36-100 of wild-type -synuclein) is unaffected by the mutation, and two disconnected density islands (A and B) of mixed sequences. There is a non-proteinaceous cofactor bound between the core and island A. The JOS fold resembles the common substructure of MSA type I and type II dimeric filaments, with its core segment approximating the C-terminal body of MSA protofilaments B and its islands mimicking the N-terminal arm of MSA protofilaments A. The partial similarity of JOS and MSA folds extends to the locations of their cofactor-binding sites. Our findings provide insight into a likely mechanism of JOS fibrillation in which mutant -synuclein of 147 amino acids forms a nucleus with the JOS fold, around which wild-type and mutant proteins assemble during elongation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction error signals in anterior cingulate cortex drive task-switching</a></h4>

              
                Task-switching is a fundamental cognitive ability which requires animals to update their knowledge of current rules, allowing flexible behaviour in a changing environment. This is often achieved through evaluating discrepancies between observed and expected events. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has a key role in processing such discrepancies, or prediction errors. However, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying task-switching are largely unknown. Here we show that activity in the ACC induced by the absence of expected stimuli is necessary for rapid task-switching. Mice trained to perform a block-wise set-shifting task typically required a single experience of an expectation violation, or prediction error to accurately switch between responding to the same stimuli using distinct rules. Neurons in the ACC explicitly represented these prediction errors, and their activity was predictive of successful one-shot behavioural transitions. Prediction error signals were projection target-specific, constrained in their spatio-temporal spread across cortex, and heavily disrupted by VIP interneuron perturbation. Optogenetic silencing and single-trial un-silencing revealed that the requirement of the ACC in task-switching was restricted to the epochs when neural prediction error signals were observed. These results reveal a dedicated circuitry promoting the transition between distinct cognitive states

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Violation of the ultrastructural size principle in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex underlies working memory impairment in the aged common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)</a></h4>

              
                Working memory relies critically on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Morphology and function of the dlPFC, and corresponding working memory performance, are affected early in the aging process. However, these effects are heterogeneous, with nearly half of aged individuals spared of working memory deficits. Translationally relevant model systems are critical for investigating the neurobiological drivers of this variability and identifying why some people experience age-related working memory impairment while others do not. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is advantageous as a model in which to investigate the biological underpinnings of aging because, as a nonhuman primate, marmosets have a clearly defined dlPFC facilitating investigations of prefrontal-dependent cognitive functions, including working memory, and their short (~10 year) lifespan facilitates longitudinal studies of aging. Here, we conduct the first investigation of synaptic ultrastructure in the dlPFC of the marmoset and investigate whether there are changes to synaptic ultrastructure that are unique to aging with and without working memory impairment. To do this, we characterized working memory capacity in a cohort of marmosets that collectively covered their short lifespan, and found age-related working memory impairment. We also found a remarkable degree of heterogeneity in performance, similar to that found in humans. Utilizing three dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy, we visualized structural correlates of synaptic efficacy including boutons, mitochondria, and synapses in layer III of the dlPFC of three marmosets: one young adult (YA), one aged cognitively unimpaired (AU), and one aged cognitively impaired (AI). We find that aged marmosets have fewer synapses in dlPFC than young, and this is due to selective vulnerability of small synapses. Next, we tested the hypothesis that violation of the ultrastructural size principle underlies age-related working memory impairment. The ultrastructural size principle states that synaptic efficacy relies on coordinated scaling of synaptic components (e.g., synapses, mitochondria) with presynaptic boutons. While synapses and mitochondria scaled proportionally and were strongly correlated with presynaptic boutons in the YA and AU marmosets, the ultrastructural characteristics of the AI marmoset were alarmingly different. We found that age-related working memory impairment was associated with disproportionately large synapses compared to presynaptic boutons, specifically in those with mitochondria. Remarkably, presynaptic mitochondria and these boutons were completely decorrelated. We posit that this decorrelation results in mismatched energy supply and demand, leading to impaired synaptic transmission. This is the first report of age-related synapse loss in the marmoset, and the first demonstration that violation of the ultrastructural size principle underlies age-related working memory impairment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholecystokinin exerts a major control on corticostriatal synapse and motor behavior</a></h4>

              
                Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neuropeptide detected and produced at high concentrations in the brain. To date it was mainly used as a neuronal marker of neuronal subtypes and its role as a neuromodulator was poorly known. However, few studies showed that it could be an essential neuromodulator in various brain structures, playing a role on synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. In order to better understand the processes by which CCK impacts plasticity, we focus our attention on the striatum, a nucleus involved in procedural learning and motor behavior, with a rich expression of CCK receptor type 2 (CCK2R). By using in-vivo and ex-vivo electrophysiological approaches, we show that CCK is involved in the corticostriatal synaptic transmission and has a key role in its plasticity. Using in-vivo optopatch-clamp of identified MSNs, we observe a decrease of corticostriatal synaptic transmission after an injection of CCK2R antagonist, leading to a reduction of evoked excitatory post synaptic potential rec-orded on both MSNs populations (direct and indirect pathways). In addition, we evaluate the impact of CCK2R antagonist on corticostriatal synaptic plasticity using Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) protocols on MSNs of acute rat brain slices. Results demonstrate that the CCK2R antagonist is able to reverse the corticostriatal synaptic plasticity (i.e. LTP protocol leads to LTD). Finally, we evaluate the effect of CCK2R antagonist on the motor behavior of juvenile rats challenged with different locomotor tests and show a sex-dependent impairment of motor behavior. Overall, our results demonstrate that CCK and its receptor CCK2R are es-sential for inputs processing encoding in the corticostriatal network with consequences on motor activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PIEZO2 in somatosensory neurons controls gastrointestinal transit</a></h4>

              
                The gastrointestinal tract is in a state of constant motion. These movements are tightly regulated by the presence of food and help digestion by mechanically breaking down and propelling gut content. Mechanical sensing in the gut is thought to be essential for regulating motility; however, the identity of the neuronal populations, the molecules involved, and the functional consequences of this sensation are unknown. Here, we show that humans lacking PIEZO2 exhibit impaired bowel sensation and motility. Piezo2 in mouse dorsal root but not nodose ganglia is required to sense gut content, and this activity slows down food transit rates in the stomach, small intestine, and colon. Indeed, Piezo2 is directly required to detect colon distension in vivo. Our study unveils the mechanosensory mechanisms that regulate the transit of luminal contents throughout the gut, which is a critical process to ensure proper digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste removal.

	<p>Early rehabilitation with the right intensity contributes to the physical recovery of stroke survivors. In clinical practice, physicians determine whether the training intensity is suitable for rehabilitation based on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; narratives, training scores, and evaluation scales, which puts tremendous pressure on medical resources. In this study, a lightweight facial expression recognition algorithm is proposed to diagnose stroke patients&amp;amp;rsquo; training motivations automatically. First, the properties of convolution are introduced into the Vision Transformer&amp;amp;rsquo;s structure, allowing the model to extract both local and global features of facial expressions. Second, the pyramid-shaped feature output mode in Convolutional Neural Networks is also introduced to reduce the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s parameters and calculation costs significantly. Moreover, a classifier that can better classify facial expressions of stroke patients is designed to improve performance further. We verified the proposed algorithm on the Real-world Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), the Face Expression Recognition Plus Dataset (FER+), and a private dataset for stroke patients. Experiments show that the backbone network of the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than Pyramid Vision Transformer (PvT) and Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) with fewer parameters and Floating-point Operations Per Second (FLOPs). In addition, the algorithm reaches an 89.44% accuracy on the RAF-DB dataset, which is higher than other recent studies. In particular, it obtains an accuracy of 99.81% on the private dataset, with only 4.10M parameters.</p>

	<p>Virtual reality (VR), a rapidly evolving technology that simulates three-dimensional virtual environments for users, has been proven to activate brain functions. However, the continuous alteration pattern of the functional small-world network in response to comprehensive three-dimensional stimulation rather than realistic two-dimensional media stimuli requires further exploration. Here, we aimed to validate the effect of VR on the pathways and network parameters of a small-world organization and interpret its mechanism of action. Fourteen healthy volunteers were selected to complete missions in an immersive VR game. The changes in the functional network in six different frequency categories were analyzed using graph theory with electroencephalography data measured during the pre-, VR, and post-VR stages. The mutual information matrix revealed that interactions between the frontal and posterior areas and those within the frontal and occipital lobes were strengthened. Subsequently, the betweenness centrality (BC) analysis indicated more robust and extensive pathways among hubs. Furthermore, a specific lateralized channel (O1 or O2) increment in the BC was observed. Moreover, the network parameters improved simultaneously in local segregation, global segregation, and global integration. The overall topological improvements of small-world organizations were in high-frequency bands and exhibited some degree of sustainability.</p>

	<p>Introduction: microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs playing a myriad of important roles in regulating gene expression. Of note, recent work demonstrated a critical role of miRNAs in the genesis and progression of brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). Accordingly, here we examine miRNA signatures related to bAVMs and associated gene expression. In so doing we expound on the potential prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic significance of miRNAs in the clinical management of bAVMs. Methods: A PRISMA-based literature review was performed using PubMed/Medline database with the following search terms: &amp;amp;ldquo;brain arteriovenous malformations&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;cerebral arteriovenous malformations&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;microRNA&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;miRNA&amp;amp;rdquo;. All preclinical and clinical studies written in English, regardless of date, were selected. For our bioinformatic analyses, miRWalk and miRTarBase machine learning algorithms were employed; the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was quired for associated pathways/functions. Results: four studies were ultimately included in the final analyses. Sequencing data consistently revealed the decreased expression of miR-18a in bAVM-endothelial cells, resulting in increased levels of vascular endodermal growth factor (VEGF), Id-1, matrix metalloproteinase, and growth signals. Our analyses also suggest that the downregulation of miR-137 and miR-195* within vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may foster the activation of inflammation, aberrant angiogenesis, and phenotypic switching. In the peripheral blood, the overexpression of miR-7-5p, miR-629-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-200b-3p, and let-7b-5p may contribute to endothelial proliferation and nidus development. The machine learning algorithms employed confirmed associations between miRNA-related target networks, vascular rearrangement, and bAVM progression. Conclusion: miRNAs expression appears to be critical in managing bAVMs&amp;amp;rsquo; post-transcriptional signals. Targets of microRNAs regulate canonical vascular proliferation and reshaping. Although additional scientific evidence is needed, the identification of bAVM miRNA signatures may facilitate the development of novel prognostic/diagnostic tools and molecular therapies for bAVMs.</p>

	<p>The current study investigated the mental lexicon features of the Hakka-Mandarin dialect bilingual from two perspectives: the structural features of lexicons and the relations between lexicons. Experiment one used a semantic fluency task and complex-network analysis to observe the structural features of lexicons. Experiment two used a cross-language long-term repetition priming paradigm to explore the relations between lexicons, with three sub-experiments focusing on conceptual representation, lexical representation, and their relations, respectively. The results from experiment one showed that the dialect bilingual lexicons were small-world in nature, and the D2 (Mandarin) lexicon was better organized than the D1 (Hakka) lexicon. Experiment two found that D1 and D2 might have partially shared conceptual representations, separate lexical form representations, and partially shared lemma representations. Based on the findings, we tentatively proposed a two-layer activation model to simulate the lexicon features of dialect bilingual speakers.</p>

	<p>Background: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment modality for ablation of low-grade glioma (LGG) and radiation necrosis (RN). Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and survival outcomes of patients with radiographically presumed recurrent or newly diagnosed LGG and RN treated with LITT. Methods: The neuro-oncological database of a quaternary center was reviewed for all patients who underwent LITT for management of LGG between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2020. Clinical data including demographics, lesion characteristics, and clinical and radiographic outcomes were collected. Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier analyses comprised overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Nine patients (7 men, 2 women; mean [SD] age 50 [16] years) were included. Patients underwent LITT at a mean (SD) of 11.6 (8.5) years after diagnosis. Two (22%) patients had new lesions on radiographic imaging without prior treatment. In the other 7 patients, all (78%) had surgical resection, 6 (67%) had intensity-modulated radiation therapy and chemotherapy, respectively, and 4 (44%) had stereotactic radiosurgery. Two (22%) patients had lesions that were wild-type IDH1 status. Volumetric assessment of preoperative T1-weighted contrast-enhancing and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences yielded mean (SD) lesion volumes of 4.1 (6.5) cm3 and 26.7 (27.9) cm3, respectively. Three (33%) patients had evidence of radiographic progression after LITT. The pooled median (IQR) PFS for the cohort was 52 (56) months, median (IQR) OS after diagnosis was 183 (72) months, and median (IQR) OS after LITT was 52 (60) months. At the time of the study, 2 (22%) patients were deceased. Conclusions: LITT is a safe and effective treatment option for management of LGG and RN, however, there may be increased risk of permanent complications with treatment of deep-seated subcortical lesions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation/suppression balances in rat Superior Colliculus encode the visual continuity illusion</a></h4>

              
                The continuity illusion occurs when visual stimuli are presented at a sufficiently high frequency, thereby triggering a shift from the static to the dynamic vision mode. This facilitates perception of continuous and moving objects, which is key for interactions with the surrounding environment. However, how the continuity illusion is encoded along the entire visual pathway remains poorly understood, with disparate Flicker Fusion Frequency (FFF) measured at the retinal, cortical, and behavioural levels. Here, we combine a behavioural paradigm, functional-MRI (fMRI), and electrophysiological validation for studying the mechanisms underlying the encoding of the continuity illusion effect in the rat. Our behavioural measurements reported a Flicker Fusion Frequency (FFF) of 18{+/-}2 Hz. Remarkably, whole-pathway fMRI revealed marked zero-crossings from positive to negative fMRI signal regimes at the FF in the superior colliculus (SC) - an important visual saliency detector - but not in higher cortical or thalamic visual areas. Our electrophysiological recordings in SC explained the sources of these observations as arising from strong neuronal suppression when the continuity illusion is achieved. Combined, our data suggests that activation and suppression balances in SC play a critical role in encoding the continuity illusion effect.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optical measurement of glutamate release robustly reports short-term plasticity at a fast central synapse</a></h4>

              
                Recently developed fluorescent neurotransmitter indicators have enabled direct measurements of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Precise optical measurements of neurotransmitter release may be used to make inferences about presynaptic function independent of electrophysiological measurement techniques. Here, we express iGluSnFR, a genetically encoded glutamate reporter in mouse spiral ganglion neurons to compare electrophysiological and optical readouts of presynaptic function and short-term synaptic plasticity at the endbulb of Held synapse. We conclude that iGluSnFR robustly and approximately linearly reports glutamate release from the endbulb of Held during synaptic transmission and allows assessment of short-term plasticity during high-frequency train stimuli. Furthermore, we show that iGluSnFR expression slightly alters the time course of spontaneous postsynaptic currents, but is unlikely to impact measurements of evoked synchronous release of many synaptic vesicles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Timescales of adaptation to context in horizontal sound localization</a></h4>

              
                Psychophysical experiments explored how the repeated presentation of a context, consisting of an adaptor and a target, induces plasticity in the localization of an identical target presented alone on interleaved trials. The plasticity, and its time course, was examined both in a classroom and in an anechoic chamber. Adaptors and targets were 2-ms noise clicks and listeners were tasked with localizing the targets while ignoring the adaptors (when present). The context had either a fixed temporal structure, consisting of a single-click adaptor and a target, or its structure varied from trial to trial, either containing a single-click or an 8-click adaptor. The adaptor was presented either from a frontal or a lateral location, fixed within a run. The presence of context caused responses to the isolated targets to be displaced up to 14 degrees away from the adaptor location. This effect was stronger and slower if the context was variable, growing over the 5-minute duration of the runs. Additionally, the fixed-context buildup had a slower onset in the classroom. Overall, the results illustrate that sound localization is subject to slow adaptive processes that depend on the spatial and temporal structure of the context and on the level of reverberation in the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parametric information about eye movements is sent to the ears</a></h4>

              
                Eye movements alter the relationship between the visual and auditory spatial scenes. Signals related to eye movements affect neural pathways from the ear through auditory cortex and beyond, but how these signals contribute to computing the locations of sounds with respect to the visual scene is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the information contained in eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs), pressure changes recorded in the ear canal that occur in conjunction with simultaneous eye movements. We show that EMREOs contain parametric information about horizontal and vertical eye displacement as well as initial/final eye position with respect to the head. The parametric information in the horizontal and vertical directions combines linearly, allowing accurate prediction of the EMREOs associated with oblique eye movements from their respective horizontal and vertical components. Target location can also be inferred from the EMREO signals recorded during eye movements to those targets. We hypothesize that the thus-far unknown mechanism underlying EMREOs could impose a two-dimensional eye-movement related transfer function on any incoming sound, permitting subsequent processing stages to compute the positions of sounds in relation to the visual scene.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivating Positive Personality Traits During Sleep Impacts Self-Evaluative Memories</a></h4>

              
                People tend to view themselves through rose-tinted glasses, as evidenced by preferential recall of positive personality traits. We asked whether reactivating positive personality traits during sleep could enhance peoples positive self-evaluative memories. After a baseline self-referential encoding task in which participants endorsed positive and negative traits as self-descriptive, participants were trained to give timely responses to positive traits in a cue-approach training (CAT) task. Once participants had entered slow-wave sleep during a subsequent nap, half of the trained positive traits were unobtrusively re-played to them to promote consolidation (targeted memory reactivation, TMR). Participants completed free-recall tasks about self-descriptive traits to measure their self-evaluative memories. Our findings revealed that TMR prioritized the recall of positive traits that were strongly memorized before sleep, while impairing the recall of intermediate traits. The results suggest pre-TMR self-evaluative memory strength modulated the TMR benefits. Sleep EEG analyses revealed that compared with weak/intermediate/control traits, re-playing strongly memorized traits during sleep elicited greater sigma power changes, which likely reflect preferential memory reactivation. Our results demonstrate the potential implication of wakeful cue-approach training and sleep-based memory reactivation in strengthening positive self-evaluative memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory Brainstem Mechanisms Likely Compensate for Self-imposed Peripheral Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                It is well known that the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) in the brainstem, part of the efferent network, inhibits the cochlear active gain mechanism. The upstream neural influence of this peripheral inhibition is less understood. When the MOCR is activated, responses generated in the cochlea and cortex undergo putative attenuation, yet the amplitude of responses generated in the brainstem are perplexingly unaffected despite decreased input from the periphery. Based on known neural circuitry, we hypothesized that the inhibition of peripheral input is compensated for by equivalent positive feedback in the brainstem over time. We predicted that the inhibition can be captured at the brainstem with stimuli shorter (1.5 s) than previously employed long durations (4 min) where this inhibition is diminished due to compensation. Results from 18 normal hearing human listeners support our hypothesis in that when the MOCR is activated, there is a robust reduction of responses generated at the periphery, brainstem, and cortex for short stimuli and that brainstem inhibition diminishes for longer stimuli. Our methodology and findings have implications for auditory disorders such as tinnitus, evaluation of efferent function, and provides a novel non-invasive window into potential gain compensation mechanisms in the brainstem.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two differentiated brain systems micro-structurally associated with obesity</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between obesity and brain structure is incompletely understood. Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ~33,000 UK Biobank participants we test the hypothesis that obesity (waist-to-hip ratio, WHR) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal-temporal- striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal-occipital-striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics, we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (rg = 0.026, P = 0.36) and ICVF (rg = 0.112, P < 9x10-4). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Independence and interaction between the control of moving and holding still in post-stroke arm paresis</a></h4>

              
                Moving and holding still have been posited to be under separate control regimes for both eye and arm movements. The paretic arm after stroke is notable for abnormalities both at rest and during movement, thus it provides an opportunity to address the relationships between control of reaching, stopping and stabilizing. Here, we asked whether independence of these behaviors is preserved in arm paresis. To address this question, we quantified resting postural abnormalities in stroke patients by measuring their biases in force production as they held their hand still in various locations in a planar workspace, and then assessed the influence of these resting force biases on active reaching in the same workspace. We found that patients had marked resting postural force biases at each location. However, these biases did not manifest during any phase of planar reaching movements in the setting of weight support: not during initial acceleration, not to mid-trajectory perturbations, and not during deceleration to a stop. Resting force biases only appeared to switch on after a movement had fully stopped. These findings in stroke suggest that moving and holding still are functionally separable modes of control. At the same time, we found that patients resting postural force biases mirrored characteristics of abnormal synergies active during movement: they markedly decreased when arm support was provided; they were higher in more distal positions which require breaking out of flexion; and they scaled with the Fugl-Meyer score for the upper extremity (a measure of intrusion of abnormal synergies during active movement). These three shared features suggest a common mechanism for resting postural biases and abnormal synergies, which appears to be a contradiction given the functional separation of moving and holding still observed in the same patients. To resolve this apparent paradox, we propose a model that predicts a breakdown in the functional separation between reaching and holding still when patients move in the absence of weight support. Thus, the model posits that synergies are the behavioral manifestation of a spillover of posture into movement. Mapping these functional systems onto anatomical and physiological details of lesioned substrate after stroke may provide implementation-level insight into how normal arm motor control is assembled.

                To understand human behaviour, it is crucial to reveal the mechanisms by which we learn and decide about effort costs and benefits in an uncertain world. Whereas the mechanisms for reward learning are well-understood, the mechanisms for effort cost learning, and especially mental effort, remain elusive. Initially, we hypothesized that cost learning follows temporal-difference learning such that brains update expected costs when informed about upcoming effort levels. However, fMRI data revealed neural correlates of a cost-prediction error of mental effort during task execution and not in response to an effort cue about upcoming effort demands. These results imply that expected costs are updated during actual effort exertion, implying that the adaptive learning of mental effort cost does not follow traditional temporal-difference learning. This study contributes to the understanding of the neural mechanism underlying unwillingness to work, suggesting that humans learn mental effort costs only when they experience effort exertion.

                Lactylation is a newly found lactate-derived post-translational modification, which is firstly reported on histone protein lysine residues to regulate gene expression. Here, we provided evidence that higher serum lactate level was possibly associated with better prognosis in ischemic stroke patients. Meanwhile, inhibition of endogenous lactate increased the infarct volume and decreased protein pan-lactylation in the affected brain tissue in cerebral ischemia mice. We further demonstrated that downregulating lactylation level of Hdac6 (Histone Deacetylase 6) in neurons exacerbated ischemic neuronal injury. The underlying mechanisms involved Hdac6 lactylation disturbing calcium homeostasis through binding BiP (Binding immunoglobulin protein), an endoplasmic reticulum-related protein. Collectively, our findings identified a new effect of lactate for neuroprotection through Hdac6 lactylation during cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury which introduced a potential therapeutic approach against ischemic stroke.

<p>Despite the putative advantages of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent, the long-term neuroprotective effect on the offspring is still unraveled. Here, we studied the long-term impact of antenatal MgSO<sub>4</sub> at the late gestational periods on the offspring behavior in a mouse MIA model. MgSO<sub>4</sub> treatment for preventing brain injuries can adversely affect offspring cognition behavior later in life, depending on the sex and age of the offspring.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anti-inflammatory agent in pregnant women have been investigated in the last few years. Infections can cause an inflammatory reaction involving the placenta membranes and amniotic cavity. They may have short-term effects on the mother and her fetuses, like preterm birth, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay. Despite the alleged advantages of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the long-term molecular and behavioral function of MgSO<sub>4</sub> has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the long-term effect of antenatal MgSO<sub>4</sub>, during late gestation, on offspring's behavior focusing on cognitive function, motor activity, and social cognition in adolescence and adulthood, and explored its influence on brain gene expression (e.g., ErbB signaling, pro-inflammatory, and dopaminergic markers) in adulthood. A significant abnormal exploratory behavior of offspring of MgSO<sub>4</sub>-treated dams was found compared to the control group in both adolescence and adulthood. Furthermore, we found that adult females exposed to MgSO<sub>4</sub> under inflammation displayed working and recognition memory impairment. A reduction in IL-6 expression was detected in the prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus specimens derived from LPS–Mg-treated group. In contrast, an imbalanced expression of dopamine 1 and 2 receptors was detected only in prefrontal cortex specimens. Besides, we found that MgSO<sub>4</sub> ameliorated the overexpression of the Nrg1 and Erbb4 receptors induced by LPS in the hippocampus. Thus, MgSO<sub>4</sub> treatment for preventing brain injuries can adversely affect offspring cognition behavior later in life, depending on the sex and age of the offspring.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Batten disease consists of a family of primarily autosomal recessive, progressive neuropediatric disorders, also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). These pathologies are characterized by seizures and visual, cognitive and motor decline, and premature death. The pathophysiology of this rare disease is still unclear despite the years of trials and financial aids. This paper has reviewed advantages and limits of in vivo and in vitro models of Batten disease from murine and larger animal models to primitive unicellular models, until the most recently developed patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. For each model advantages, limits and applications were analyzed. The first prototypes investigated were murine models that due to their limits were replaced by larger animals. In vitro models gradually replaced animal models for practical, cost, and ethical reasons. Using induced pluripotent stem cells to study neurodegeneration is a new way of studying the disease, since they can be distinguished into differentiating elements like neurons, which are susceptible to neurodegeneration. In vivo and in vitro models have contributed to clarifying to some extent the pathophysiology of the disease. The collection and sharing of suitable human bio samples likely through biobanks can contribute to a better understanding, prevention, and to identify possible treatment strategies of Batten disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparative safety of antiseizure medication monotherapy for major malformations</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To study the comparative safety of antiseizure medication (ASM) monotherapy in pregnancy with respect to risk of major congenital malformations (MCM), overall and MCM subtypes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a population-based cohort study using national health register data from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (1996-2020). We compared pregnancies with first trimester exposure to lamotrigine monotherapy to ASM unexposed, carbamazepine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate to lamotrigine monotherapy, and stratified monotherapy groups by dose. The outcome was non-genetic MCM and specific subtypes. We estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with log-binomial regression and propensity score weights.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was a higher crude risk of any MCM in pregnancies exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy (n=8339) compared to ASM unexposed (n=4,866,362), but not after confounder adjustment (aRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.08). Compared to lamotrigine, there was an increased risk of malformations associated with valproate (n=2031, aRR 2.05, 1.70-2.46) and topiramate (n=509, aRR 1.81, 1.26-2.60) which increased in a dose-dependent manner. We found no differences in malformation risk for carbamazepine (n=2674, aRR 0.91, 0.72-1.15), oxcarbazepine (n=1313, RR 1.09, 0.83-1.44), or levetiracetam (n=1040, aRR 0.78, 0.53-1.13). Valproate was associated with several malformation subtypes including nervous system, cardiac, oral clefts, clubfoot, and hypospadias whereas lamotrigine and carbamazepine were not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Topiramate is associated with an increased risk of MCM similar to that associated with valproate, but lower doses may mitigate the risks for both drugs. Conversely, we found no increased risks for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam, which is reassuring.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Simplified Model of Motor Control</a></h4>

              
                In general, control of movement is considered to be either cortical, spinal, or purely biomechanical and is studied separately at these levels. To achieve this separation when studying a particular level, variations that may be introduced by the other levels are generally either ignored or restricted. This restriction misrepresents the way movements occur in realistic scenarios and limits the ability to model movements in a biologically inspired manner. In this work, we propose a heuristic model for motor control that conceptually and mathematically accounts for the entire motor process, from target to endpoint. It simulates human arm motion and is able to represent functionally different motion properties by flexibly choosing more or less complex motion paths without built-in optimization or joint constraints. With a novel implementation of hierarchical control, this model successfully overcomes the problem of degrees of freedom in robotics. It can serve as a template for neurocomputational work that currently uses control architectures that do not mirror the human motor control process. The model itself also suggests a maximum threshold for delays in position feedback for effective movement, and that the primary role of position feedback in movement is to overcome the effects of environmental perturbations at the joint level. These findings can inform future efforts to develop biologically inspired motor control techniques for prosthetic devices.

                The development and survival of dopaminergic neurons are influenced by the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway. Anosmin-1 (A1) is an extracellular matrix protein that acts as a major regulator of this signaling pathway, controlling FGF diffusion, and receptor interaction and shuttling. Furthermore, overexpression of A1 in vivo gives rise to higher number of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb. Here, using A1 overexpressing mice (A1-mice), we studied the effects of A1 on different populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the central (CNS) and the peripheral nervous systems (PNS). A1 overexpression increases the number of dopaminergic SNpc neurons and alters the striosome/matrix organization of the striatum. Interestingly, these numerical and morphological changes in the nigrostriatal pathway of A1-mice do not confer an altered susceptibility to experimental MPTP-parkinsonism with respect to wild type controls. Moreover, the study of the effects of A1 overexpression was extended to different dopaminergic tissues associated with the PNS, detecting a significant reduction in the number of dopaminergic chemosensitive carotid body glomus cells in A1-mice. Overall, these analyses confirm A1 as a principal regulator of the FGF pathway in the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons in different nuclei of the mammalian nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A back-translational study of descending interactions with central mechanisms of hyperalgesia induced by high frequency stimulation in rat and human</a></h4>

              
                In humans and animals, high frequency electrocutaneous stimulation (HFS) may produce an early long-term potentiation-like sensitisation. Peripheral and central modulatory processes are proposed to play a role. To explore the impact of descending inhibitory pathway activation on the development of HFS-induced hyperalgesia, we concurrently applied HFS with i) a conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm during psychophysical testing in humans, or ii) a diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) paradigm during in vivo electrophysiological recording of spinal neurones in anaesthetised animals in parallel studies that utilised identical stimuli. HFS induced enhanced perceptual responses to pin-prick stimuli in cutaneous areas secondary to the area of stimulation in humans and heightened the excitability of spinal neurones in rats (which exhibited stimulus intensity dependent coded responses to pin-prick stimulation in a manner that tracked with human psychophysics), where we also observed indicators of increased central neuronal hyperexcitability. In humans, a HFS(+CPM) paradigm did not alter primary or secondary hyperalgesia, and the area and pain intensity of secondary hyperalgesia did not correlate with temporal summation of pain or CPM magnitude, while in rats application of a DNIC paradigm concurrent to HFS did not impact the development of neuronal hyperexcitability. Concordance between human and rat data supports their translational validity. Our finding that excitatory signalling exceeds inhibitory controls suggests that dampening facilitatory mechanisms may be a preferable strategy for certain chronic pain states. If facilitatory mechanisms dominate, our data could explain why enhancing activity in descending inhibitory controls is not sufficient to induce pain relief in vulnerable patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kinetic models for PET displacement studies</a></h4>

              
                The traditional design of PET target engagement studies is based on a baseline scan and one or more scans after drug administration. We here evaluate an alternative design in which the drug is administered during an on-going scan (i.e., a displacement study). This approach results both in lower radiation exposure and lower costs. Existing kinetic models assume steady state. This condition is not present during a drug displacement and consequently, our aim here was to develop kinetic models for analysing PET displacement data. We modified existing compartment models to accommodate a time-variant increase in occupancy following the pharmacological in-scan intervention. Since this implies the use of differential equations that cannot be solved analytically, we developed instead one approximate and one numerical solution. Through simulations, we show that if the occupancy is relatively high, it can be estimated without bias and with good accuracy. The models were applied to PET data from six pigs where [11C]UCB-J was displaced by intravenous brivaracetam. The dose-occupancy relationship estimated from these scans showed good agreement with occupancies calculated with Lassen plot applied to baseline-block scans of two pigs. In summary, the proposed models provide a framework to determine target occupancy from a single displacement scan.

                In the past years, machine-learning-based approaches to track animal poses with high spatial and temporal resolution have become available, but toolkits to extract, integrate, and analyze coordinate datasets in a user-friendly manner have lagged behind. Here, we introduce Fear-Mouse Tracker (FMT), a simple and open-source MATLAB-based pipeline to extract and quantitatively analyze DeepLabCut-derived coordinates of mice presented with threatening stimuli that commonly trigger innate defensive responses. This framework allows for unbiased quantitative estimations of stretch-attend posture (SAP) observed during risk assessment behaviors, as well as for measurements of the timing and extent of freezing and escape responses that follow the presentation of threatening stimuli such as a predator odor, or sweeping and looming stimuli resembling predator approaches. FMT is specially designed for users not very experienced in using programming languages, thus making it more accessible to a broader audience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-differences in prostaglandin signaling: a semi-systematic review and characterization of PTGDS expression in human sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing evidence of sex differences in underlying mechanisms causing pain in preclinical models, and in clinical populations. There are also important disconnects between clinical pain populations and the way preclinical pain studies are conducted. For instance, osteoarthritis pain more frequently affects women but most preclinical studies have been conducted using males in animal models. The most widely used painkillers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), act on the prostaglandin pathway by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the preclinical and clinical literature on the role of prostaglandins and COX in inflammation and pain. We aimed to specifically identify studies that used both sexes and investigate whether any sex-differences in the action of prostaglandins and COX inhibition had been reported, either in clinical or preclinical studies. We conducted a PubMed search and identified 369 preclinical studies and 100 clinical studies that matched our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our analysis shows that only 17% of preclinical studies on prostaglandins used both sexes and, out of those, only 19% analyzed or reported data in a sex-aware fashion. In contrast, 79% of the clinical studies analyzed used both sexes. However, only 6% of those reported data in a sex-aware fashion. Interestingly, 14 out of 15 preclinical studies and 4 out of 5 clinical studies that analyzed data in a sex-aware fashion have identified sex-differences. This builds on the increasing evidence of sex-differences in prostaglandin signaling and the importance of sex-awareness in data analysis. The preclinical literature identifies a sex difference in prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) expression where it is higher in female than in male rodents in the nervous system. We experimentally validated that PTGDS expression is higher in female human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons recovered from organ donors. Our semi-systematic literature review reveals a need for continued inclusivity of both male and female animals in prostaglandins studies and sex-aware analysis in data analysis in preclinical and clinical studies. Our finding of sex-differences in neuronal PTGDS expression in humans exemplifies the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how the prostaglandin system functions in the DRG in rodents and humans.

                During memory retrieval, people tend to reenact the same eye movements performed when memorized items were first displayed and to gaze at similar locations. This was hypothesized to reflect the role of eye movements as retrieval cues. However, it is unknown what is it about eye movements that makes them effective retrieval cues. Here, we examine, for the first time, the individual and combined contributions of the visual and the motor components of eye movements to memory retrieval. Results (N=70) revealed a non-additive benefit of both components of eye movements to memory performance. Additionally, we found that individuals who gained from one component, were more likely to gain from the other as well. Together, these findings unravel the central role of eye movements in episodic memory; they show how the visual and motor components are integrated into a single effective memory retrieval cue and how this integration varies among individuals.

                The contraction bias has been extensively studied in psychophysics, but only recently has its origin begun to be investigated with neural activity recordings. Leveraging the fact that it is currently possible to train recurrent networks of spiking neurons to perform cognitive tasks, we investigated the causes of the contraction bias and how behavior relates to population firing activity in networks trained to discriminate temporal intervals. A novel normative model containing potential sources of the bias guided us in investigating how it emerged in the networks. Various geometric features of state-space trajectories encoded compressed representations of the durations of the first interval, which were modulated by sensory history. Furthermore, these compressions conveyed a Bayesian estimate of the durations, thus relating activity and behavior. We conjecture that this occurs in areas of the brain where information about the current and preceding stimuli converges, and that it holds generally in delayed comparison tasks.

                The Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) is a key region of the brain's reading network and its activation has been shown to be strongly associated with reading skills. Here, for the first time, we investigated whether voluntary regulation of VWFA activity is feasible using real-time fMRI neurofeedback. 40 adults with typical reading skills were instructed to either upregulate (UP group) or downregulate (DOWN group) their own VWFA activity during six neurofeedback training runs. The VWFA target region was individually defined based on a functional localizer task. Before and after training, also regulation runs without feedback ('no-feedback runs') were performed. When comparing the two groups, we found stronger activity across the whole reading network, including the VWFA, for the UP than the DOWN group. Crucially, we observed a significant interaction of group and time (pre, post) for the no-feedback runs: The two groups did not differ in their VWFA activity before neurofeedback training, but the UP group showed significantly stronger activity than the DOWN group after neurofeedback training. Our results indicate that self-regulation of the VWFA activity is feasible and that, once learned, successful self-regulation can even be performed in the absence of feedback. These results are a crucial step toward to development of a potential clinical intervention to improve reading skills in individuals with reading impairments.

                Neuroscience is pushing toward studying the brain during naturalistic behaviors with open-ended tasks. Grid cells are a classic example, where free behavior was key to observing their characteristic spatial representations in two-dimensional environments. In contrast, it has been difficult to identify grid cells and study their computations in more restrictive experiments, such as head-fixed wheel running. Here, we challenge this view by showing that shifting the focus from single neurons to the population level changes the minimal experimental complexity required to study grid cell representations. Specifically, we combine the manifold approximation in UMAP with persistent homology to study the topology of the population activity. With these methods, we show that the population activity of grid cells covers a similar two-dimensional toroidal state space during wheel running as in open field foraging, with and without a virtual reality setup. Trajectories on the torus correspond to single trial runs in virtual reality and changes in experimental conditions are reflected in the internal representation, while the toroidal representation undergoes occasional shifts in its alignment to the environment. These findings show that our method can uncover latent topologies that go beyond the complexity of the task, allowing us to investigate internal dynamics in simple experimental settings in which the analysis of grid cells has so far remained elusive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural alpha oscillations and pupil size differentially index cognitive demand under competing audio-visual task conditions</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive demand is thought to modulate two often used, but rarely combined, measures: pupil size and neural alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillatory power. However, it is unclear whether these two measures capture cognitive demand in a similar way, and whether a measured cognitive demand response in pupil size or brain activity is dependent on sensory modality by which the demand is induced. Here we recorded pupil size and neural alpha power (using electroencephalography), while human participants of both sexes concurrently performed a visual multiple object-tracking task and an auditory gap-detection task. Difficulties of the two tasks were manipulated independent of each other. Participants' performance decreased in accuracy and speed with increasing cognitive demand. Pupil size increased with increasing demand for both the auditory and the visual task. Alpha power emerging from two cortical sources showed counteracting neural dynamics: Alpha power in visual cortex decreased with increasing demand in the visual task, whereas alpha power in parietal cortex increased with increasing demand in the auditory task. Furthermore, demand-related changes in pupil size and alpha power were uncorrelated, suggesting that they index different aspects of cognitive demand. Overall, the current study demonstrates that the dynamics of the neurophysiological indices of cognitive demand and associated effort are multi-faceted and potentially modality-dependent under complex audio-visual task conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dendritic modulation enables multitask representation learning in hierarchical sensory processing pathways</a></h4>

              
                While sensory representations in the brain depend on context, it remains unclear how such modulations are implemented at the biophysical level, and how processing layers further in the hierarchy can extract useful features for each possible contextual state. Here, we first demonstrate that thin dendritic branches are well suited to implementing contextual modulation of feedforward processing. Such neuron-specific modulations exploit prior knowledge, encoded in stable feedforward weights, to achieve transfer learning across contexts. In a network of biophysically realistic neuron models with context-independent feedforward weights, we show that modulatory inputs to thin dendrites can solve linearly non-separable learning problems with a Hebbian, error-modulated learning rule. Finally, we demonstrate that local prediction of whether representations originate either from different inputs, or from different contextual modulations of the same input, results in representation learning of hierarchical feedforward weights across processing layers that accommodate a multitude of contexts.

	<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is consistently associated with a host of social problems, such as victimization and difficulties in maintaining close friendships. These problems are not limited to offline relations but also manifest in the online social world, as previous research shows that ADHD is associated with problematic use of social media. Given the ubiquitous nature of social media, the goal of the current review is to understand why adolescents with ADHD demonstrate more problematic social media use than their typically developing peers. To this end, we provide a narrative review on the evidence for the link between ADHD and social media use, and consequently present an integrative framework, which encompasses neurobiological mechanisms (i.e., imbalance theory of brain development and dual pathway model of ADHD) and social mechanisms, including influences from peers and parents. We conclude that empirical work shows most consistent evidence for the link between problematic social media use and ADHD (symptoms), while intensity of social media use is also associated with several other behaviors and outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize how existing interventions for ADHD may work on the identified mechanisms and provide at-hand clinical recommendations for therapists working with adolescents with ADHD who exhibit problematic social media use.</p>

	<p>The benefits of sport activity on cognition and especially on executive function development are well-known, and in recent years, several kinds of cognitive-motor training (CMT) have been proven effective in adults and older people. Less is known about possible CMT benefits in children. This study aims to confirm the positive influence played by CMTs on specific executive functions (planning abilities and visual search) in young soccer players. Twenty-four 10-year-old athletes were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental (Exp) and control (Con) groups of 12 players. Both groups were trained for 10 weeks, twice a week (90 min per training), following standard soccer training (technical-tactical exercises). The Exp group, during the first training session of the week, in the last 22 min, performed the experimental treatment, which consisted of a psychokinetic CMT. Both groups were examined before and after the ten-week training using the Tower of London and WISC-IV cancellation tests. Results revealed that the Exp group, following treatment, reported significantly better scores than the Con group in all the cognitive measures. We concluded that the proposed CMT is more effective than motor training alone at improving planning abilities and visual search abilities, even in children.</p>

	<p>A range of professional figures are needed to preserve the quality of life of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study aimed to explore the beginning of the care process as negotiated by people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals. We designed the study according to the constructivist Grounded Theory method, collecting data through open-ended, semi-structured interviews, employing theoretical sampling and constant comparison, and performing conceptual coding as data analysis. By naming the core category &amp;amp;ldquo;off-beat interfacing&amp;amp;rdquo;, we were able to show how the demands of the professionals concerned did not correspond to the ability of people with ALS and their proxies to process information, deal with requests, and be at ease in making decisions at the beginning of the shared care pathway. Three categories were generated: (i) navigating different paths, (ii) offering and experiencing a standard, non-personalized pathway, and (iii) anticipating decisions. The network of services must be organized according to guidelines, but must also contemplate a patient-family-centered approach that permits more personalized assistance.</p>

	<p>Compared to other primates, humans are late bloomers, with exceptionally long childhood and adolescence. The extensive developmental period of humans is thought to facilitate the learning processes required for the growth and maturation of the complex human brain. During the first two and a half decades of life, the human brain is a construction site, and learning processes direct its shaping through experience-dependent neuroplasticity. Formal and informal learning, which generates long-term and accessible knowledge, is mediated by neuroplasticity to create adaptive structural and functional changes in brain networks. Since experience-dependent neuroplasticity is at full force during school years, it holds a tremendous educational opportunity. In order to fulfill this developmental and learning potential, educational practices should be human-brain-friendly and &amp;amp;ldquo;ride&amp;amp;rdquo; the neuroplasticity wave. Neuroscience can inform educators about the natural learning mechanisms of the brain to support student learning. This review takes a neuroscientific lens to explore central concepts in education (e.g., mindset, motivation, meaning-making, and attention) and suggests two methods of using neuroscience as an educational tool: teaching students about their brain (content level) and considering the neuro-mechanisms of learning in educational design (design level).</p>

                Background Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a serious threat to the public health system in India. Although the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) is providing a wide range of interventions from early diagnosis to complete treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality from TB, adverse drug reactions (ADR) remain a challenge in treatment adherence and completion. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in selected districts of Gujarat state. A total of 593 reported TB patients were recruited with an adjusted unified distribution based on the type of cases, site of diseases, and service facility through a simple random sampling method. A semi-structured questionnaire tool was used to collect socio-demographic, clinical, and ADR-related data from the TB patients. Data was analyzed for the frequency, percentage, chi-squared, and adjusted odds ratio to find the association between the variables. Results The majority of the study participants were male (87.2%), aged 15 to 60 (57.8%), daily laborers (22.4%), and married (64.2%). Over 75% of individuals had pulmonary TB, with 87% having experienced their first episode, 83% being new cases, and 44.7% having a history of addiction. ADR with mild symptoms was reported by more than a quarter (29%) of TB patients during the intensive phase (77%). The association between ADR experience and drug susceptibility was significant (p<0.005) and drug-resistant TB patients experience two times more ADRs than drug-sensitive TB patients (OR 2.04). Binomial logistic regression was carried out to describe the association between various variables and occurrence of ADRs. Conclusion The study highlighted a need to enhance health care providers’ capacity and program structure for managing ADRs among TB patients. In order to completely eliminate TB across the country, it also emphasized the attention for a holistic and all-encompassing strategy for managing TB patients at the field level.

                Background: The Russia-Ukraine war brought immediate and delayed socio-economic consequences. In general, the repercussions caused fear all over the world. This study aims to validate an instrument for measuring fear perception caused by the consequences of a large-scale war in Latin American citizens. Methodology: An instrumental study in which 1705 residents of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and other countries were surveyed through a virtual format. A literature search, expert judgment, preliminary (then exploratory and confirmatory) analysis, as well as reliability assessment were carried out. Results: The skewness and kurtosis values of the 13 questions did not exceed the range ± 1.5 and showed significant correlations (>0.30). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (0.962) and Bartlett's test (19558.5; df=78; p=0.001) had good indicators. The parallel analysis suggested a single factor, which explained 75.59% of the total variance. The confirmatory factor analysis generated an instrument with six items (χ2=47.33, df=9, p=0.001; RMR=0.010; GFI=0.990; CFI=1.00; TLI=0.990; and RMSEA=0.050), with an overall Cronbach's Alpha=0.949 (95% CI=0.94–0.95). Conclusion: A six-item instrument that measures the perception of fear caused by the consequences of a large-scale war was validated in half a dozen Latin American countries. This short and valid instrument can be administered to a broad population in Latin America.

                Background: Thailand is one of the Asian countries where high pesticides use is common for agriculture. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the spatial association between types of land-use areas and diseases occurred by pesticide poisoning in Thailand. Methods: This study was conducted by using the data set of average prevalence of diseases occurred by pesticide pollution and the land-use areas between 2018-2020. A Moran’s I and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were used to identify the spatial autocorrelation between each type of land use areas and diseases developed due to pesticide poisoning in Thailand. Results: This present study observed that the average prevalence of disease occurred from pesticide pollution between 2018-2020 was 13.17 (95% CI: 10.83 - 15.50) per 100,000 in Thailand. The results identified the spatial global autocorrelation of each type of land used and occurrence of diseases due to pesticide pollution, including rice field areas, field crops, fruit trees and perennials, vegetables and flowers, and other agriculture with Moran’s I 0.270, 0.144, 0.606, 0.135, and 0.324 respectively. A spatial association between various factors and average prevalence of pesticide pollutions with significant LISA analysis were; rice field areas with eight high-high clusters and nine low-low clusters, field crops areas with three high-high clusters and 11 low-low clusters,  fruit trees and perennials areas with eight high-high clusters and 12 low-low clusters, and six high-high clusters and four low-low clusters vegetable and flower areas. Similarly, nine high-high clusters and nine low-low clusters of other agricultural areas had been observed with prevalence of diseases acquired by pesticide pollution. Conclusions: There was significant spatial association between land-use areas and diseases acquired by pesticide pollution in Thailand. It should be controlled by new policy recommendations for pesticides use for agriculture.,  especially, in provinces with more land-use areas for each type of plant.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Zen meditation-integrated CBT normalized the impaired brain function of a chronic low back pain patient—from the findings of brain blood flow SPECT imaging [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mindfulness meditation for chronic pain is popular globally, but evidence of its efficacy is limited. Moreover, there are no established methods on the objective evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions for chronic pain. In this study, a chronic low back pain patient was treated with traditional Japanese Buddhism meditation-integrated cognitive behavioral therapy and the pre- and post-intervention brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were compared. Case: A 45-year-old man was experiencing continuous back pain after a vehicular accident and experienced insufficient improvement after drug treatment. The patient underwent a 3-month outpatient mindfulness meditation-integrated cognitive behavioral therapy program executed by a multidisciplinary team: physician visits (once a week for 30 min), multidisciplinary medical and meditation education (Zen breath counting meditation and mantra), physiotherapy interventions (twice weekly), occupational therapy interventions (twice weekly), psychiatric occupational therapy interventions (twice weekly), and nutritional interventions (twice weekly). After treatment, the patient reported a decrease in subjective pain overall, based on whether or not a pain attack occurred. Brain SPECT imaging revealed an improvement in excess blood flow from the right temporoparietal junction to the inferior parietal lobe. Conclusions: These findings indicate that Zen meditation is an effective intervention method for chronic pain and SPECT is a useful tool for measuring its effectiveness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Frontier model of the environmental inefficiency effects on livestock bioeconomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This work was focused on measuring environmental inefficiency in Mexican dairy farms, considering climate change variables related to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and planetary geomagnetic activity. Methods: The applied methodology measures the eco-efficiency of Mexican dairy farms using the empirical application of a stochastic frontier model of the bioeconomy. The productive sector of the bioeconomy studied was the eco-intensification of the livestock production system (dairies). The environmental inefficiency effect was assumed to be a distribution-independent truncation of a normal distribution with constant variance, while the mean was a linear environmental function of the observable variable. Results: The results showed that the coefficients of the frontier model were highly significant, highlighting the investment in livestock (50%). The inefficiency model had an impact on climate variation with greenhouse gas emissions CH4 (1.96%). The results of the environmental technical efficiency in geometric average were 81.28%. The producers that reached the border with a technical efficiency equal to 1 are the references for the rest, marking the relative technical efficiency. Conclusions: It was concluded that the coefficients in the model were very significant, showing the level of investment in livestock (50%). The low-performance model estimates the impact of climate change on GHG emissions CH4 (1.96%) explaining the trend of increasing GHG emissions, keeping in view that the management of food and cattle during the study period were affected by summer feeding, which allowed considering the activity of GHG emissions. According to the results, the geometric mean environmental performance of engineering is 81.28%.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Green taxes as ecosystem conservation: an analysis of the industrial sector's view in Peru [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Environmental problems are becoming more recurrent nowadays, which is why many countries have acted on the matter, through different forms, laws and taxes that can contribute and reduce the polluting impact of companies at the time of manufacturing their products. One of the reforms has been environmental taxes, which are not only aimed at raising money, but also at taking corrective action on the behavior of companies that damage both the environment and the health of the population. The research is intended to finding out the opinion and interest of managers of different companies in the industrial sector on environmental taxes, also known as green taxes, and whether they consider it necessary to add green taxes to the current tax system. Method: For data collection of the research, 120 managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industrial sector were questioned about whether green taxes could have an influence on ecosystem conservation and several other questions. Results: 63.3% of the managers surveyed agree that the application of an environmental tax is necessary. Conclusion: It is concluded that managers are in favor of green taxes and  approve that  such taxes should be given as part of ecosystem conservation and environmental protection for all businesses, and that they promote businesses that do not generate any side effects or transformations to the environmental balance, thus improving the quality of life of residents.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dorsal striatum coding for the timely execution of action sequences</a></h4>

              
                The automatic initiation of actions can be highly functional. But occasionally these actions cannot be withheld and are released at inappropriate times, impulsively. Striatal activity has been shown to participate in the timing of action sequence initiation and it has been linked to impulsivity. Using a self-initiated task, we trained adult male rats to withhold a rewarded action sequence until a waiting time interval has elapsed. By analyzing neuronal activity we show that the striatal response preceding the initiation of the learned sequence is strongly modulated by the time subjects wait before eliciting the sequence. Interestingly, the modulation is steeper in adolescent rats, which show a strong prevalence of impulsive responses compared to adults. We hypothesize this anticipatory striatal activity reflects the animals’ subjective reward expectation, based on the elapsed waiting time, while the steeper waiting modulation in adolescence reflects age-related differences in temporal discounting, internal urgency states, or explore–exploit balance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell-intrinsic ceramides determine T cell function during melanoma progression</a></h4>

              
                Acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) and acid ceramidase (Ac) are parts of the sphingolipid metabolism. Asm hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide, which is further metabolized to sphingosine by Ac. Ceramide generates ceramide-enriched platforms that are involved in receptor clustering within cellular membranes. However, the impact of cell-intrinsic ceramide on T cell function is not well characterized. By using T cell-specific Asm- or Ac-deficient mice, with reduced or elevated ceramide levels in T cells, we identified ceramide to play a crucial role in T cell function in vitro and in vivo. T cell-specific ablation of Asm in <i>Smpd1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd4<sup>cre/+</sup></i> (Asm/CD4cre) mice resulted in enhanced tumor progression associated with impaired T cell responses, whereas <i>Asah1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd4<sup>cre/+</sup></i> (Ac/CD4cre) mice showed reduced tumor growth rates and elevated T cell activation compared to the respective controls upon tumor transplantation. Further in vitro analysis revealed that decreased ceramide content supports CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell differentiation and interferes with cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In contrast, elevated ceramide concentration in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from Ac/CD4cre mice was associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity. Strikingly, ceramide co-localized with the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD3 in the membrane of stimulated T cells and phosphorylation of TCR signaling molecules was elevated in Ac-deficient T cells. Hence, our results indicate that modulation of ceramide levels, by interfering with the Asm or Ac activity has an effect on T cell differentiation and function and might therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases such as tumorigenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metrics of high cofluctuation and entropy to describe control of cardiac function in the stellate ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Stellate ganglia within the intrathoracic cardiac control system receive and integrate central, peripheral, and cardiopulmonary information to produce postganglionic cardiac sympathetic inputs. Pathological anatomical and structural remodeling occurs within the neurons of the stellate ganglion (SG) in the setting of heart failure. A large proportion of SG neurons function as interneurons whose networking capabilities are largely unknown. Current therapies are limited to targeting sympathetic activity at the cardiac level or surgical interventions such as stellectomy, to treat heart failure. Future therapies that target the stellate ganglion will require understanding of their networking capabilities to modify any pathological remodeling. We observe SG networking by examining cofluctuation and specificity of SG networked activity to cardiac cycle phases. We investigate network processing of cardiopulmonary transduction by SG neuronal populations in porcine with chronic pacing-induced heart failure and control subjects during extended in-vivo extracellular microelectrode recordings. We find that information processing and cardiac control in chronic heart failure by the SG, relative to controls, exhibits: i) more frequent, short-lived, high magnitude cofluctuations, ii) greater variation in neural specificity to cardiac cycles, and iii) neural network activity and cardiac control linkage that depends on disease state and cofluctuation magnitude.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Processing of the same narrative stimuli elicits common functional connectivity dynamics between individuals</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that the richness of conscious experience can be directly linked to the richness of brain state repertories. Brain states change depending on our environment and activities we engage in by taking both external and internally derived information into account. It has been shown that high-level sensory stimulation changes local brain activity and induces neural synchrony across participants. However, the dynamic interplay of cognitive processes that underlie moment-to-moment information processing remains poorly understood. Using naturalistic movies as an ecological laboratory model of the real world, here we assess how the processing of complex naturalistic stimuli alters the dynamics of brain networks' interactions, and how these in turn support information processing. Participants underwent fMRI recordings during movie watching, scrambled movie watching, and rest. Measuring phase-synchrony between different brain networks, we computed whole-brain connectivity patterns. We showed that specific connectivity patterns were associated with each experimental condition. We hypothesized that functional connectivity dynamics would be similar across participants during the plot-driven movie. We found a higher synchronization of brain patterns across participants during movie watching compared to resting state and scrambled movie conditions. Moreover, synchronization increased during the most engaging parts of the movie. The synchronization dynamics across participants were associated with suspensefulness; more suspenseful scenes induced higher synchronization. These results suggested that processing of the same high-level information elicits common neural dynamics among individuals and that whole-brain functional connectivity tracks variations in the processed information and the subjective experience.

                Huntingtons disease (HD) results from a CAG repeat expansion in the gene for Huntington (HTT) resulting in expansion of the polyglutamine (Q) tract in the mutant protein (mHTT). Synaptic changes are early manifestations of neuronal dysfunction in HD. However, the mechanism(s) by which mHTT impacts synapse formation and function is not well defined. Herein we explored HD pathogenesis in the BACHD and the deltaN17-BACHD mouse models of HD by examining cortical synapse formation and function in primary cultures maintained for up to 35 days (DIV35). We identified synapses by immunostaining with antibodies against pre-synaptic (Synapsin 1) and a post-synaptic (PSD95) marker. Consistent with earlier studies, cortical neurons from both WT and the HD models began to form synapses at DIV14; at this age there were no genotypic differences in synapse numbers. However, from DIV21 through DIV35 BACHD neurons showed progressively smaller numbers of synapses relative to WT neurons. Remarkably, BACHD synaptic deficits were completely rescued by treating cultures with BDNF. Building on earlier studies using reagents inspired by the chaperonin TRiC, we found that addition of the recombinant apical domain of CCT1 partially rescued synapse number. Unexpectedly, unlike BACHD cultures, synapses in deltaN17-BACHD cultures showed a progressive increase in number as compared to WT neurons, thus distinguishing synaptic changes in these HD models. Using multielectrode arrays, we discovered age-related functional deficits in BACHD cortical cultures with significant differences present by DIV28. As for synapse number, BDNF treatment prevented most synaptic deficits, including mean firing rate, spikes per burst, inter-burst interval, and synchrony. The apical domain of CCT1 showed similar, albeit less potent effects. These data are evidence that deficits in HD synapse number and function can be replicated in vitro and that treatment with either BDNF or a TRiC-inspired reagent can prevent them. Our findings support the use of cellular models to further explicate HD pathogenesis and its treatments.

                Hydrocephalus is a prevalent condition among newborns leading to substantial neurocognitive and motor impairment. Novel therapies are needed to supplant invasive surgeries but identifying targetable cells and pathways remains a hurdle to devising alternative pharmacological options. Multiciliated ependymal cells (MECs) promote cerebrospinal fluid flow within brain ventricles and their dysfunction is associated with various forms of hydrocephalus. Here we show that an acute exposure to TNF- strongly impairs the conversion of ependymal cell radial glial progenitors (ecRGPs) into MECs. Inhibition of MEC differentiation was correlated with elevated expression levels of notch pathway effectors normally downregulated prior to the transition of ecRGPs into MECs. TNF- inhibited Multicilin gene upregulation along with downstream genes critical for centriole amplification and multicilia formation resulting in cells with greatly diminished basal bodies and multicilia. Treatment with notch inhibitor, DBZ, either in parallel with TNF- or sequentially days later rescued MEC differentiation and expression of genes required for multicilia formation. These results provide a rationale for how TNF- can impair MEC development, and they offer a targetable pathway to the treatment of some forms of hydrocephalus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anti-NMDAR encephalitis antibodies cause long-lasting degradation of the hippocampal neural representation of memory</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome together with a reduction of NMDAR. Although in most patients the life-threatening symptoms of the acute stage resolve with immunotherapy, memory and executive functions remain altered for several months or years. A mechanistic explanation for these long-lasting cognitive effects is still lacking and previous animal models have not explored this effect. Here, we combined repeat calcium imaging of the same population of hundreds of hippocampal CA1 neurons for three months along with two behavioral tasks to assess retrograde and anterograde memory loss using a reported mouse model of cerebroventricular transfer of patients' CSF antibodies. We measured how memory-related neuronal activity is affected by the presence of NMDAR antibodies during the induction of the model and its long-lasting recovery. In addition, we developed a computational model that provides a mechanistic explanation for the long-term antibody-mediated impairment of memory. The findings show that the presence of antibodies leads to an increase of CA1 neuronal firing rate, resulting in a reduction of the amount of information encoded by these cells. Furthermore, the antibodies cause a degradation of the hippocampal neuronal response stability over time, providing a neural correlate of memory dysfunction. All these neuronal alterations span the 3 months of recordings, and in some cases beyond the last recording point. The computational model shows that a reduction of NMDAR is sufficient to cause the changes observed in neuronal activity, including the different involvement of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to CA1 neurons. Altogether, we show that the antibody-mediated reduction of NMDAR leads to long-term changes in hippocampal neuronal activity which extend far beyond the antibody clearance, providing a mechanism that can account for the cognitive deficits observed in the protracted recovery of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional diversity in synaptic gene sets is sufficient to discriminate cortical neuronal identity</a></h4>

              
                Synapse diversity has been described from different perspectives, ranging from the specific neurotransmitters released, to their diverse biophysical properties and proteome profiles. However, synapse diversity at the transcriptional level has not been systematically identified across all synapse populations in the brain. To quantify postsynaptic and identify specific synaptic features of neuronal cell types we combined the SynGO (Synaptic Gene Ontology) database with single-cell RNA sequencing data of the mouse neocortex. We show that cell types can be discriminated by synaptic genes alone with the same power as all genes. The cell type discriminatory power is not equally distributed across synaptic genes as we could identify functional categories and synaptic compartments with greater cell type specific expression. Synaptic genes, and specific SynGO categories, belonged to three different types of gene modules: gradient expression over all cell types, gradient expression in selected cell types and cell class- or type-specific profiles. This data provides a deeper understanding of synapse diversity in the neocortex and identifies potential markers to selectively identify synapses from specific neuronal populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brief temporal perturbations in somatosensory reafference disrupt perceptual and neural attenuation and increase supplementary motor-cerebellar connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic delays in sensory feedback can be detrimental for motor control. As a compensation strategy, the brain predicts the sensory consequences of movement via a forward model on the basis of a copy of the motor command. Using these predictions, the brain attenuates the somatosensory reafference to facilitate the processing of exafferent information. Theoretically, this predictive attenuation gets disrupted by (even minimal) temporal errors between the predicted and the actual reafference, but direct evidence for such disruption is lacking since previous neuroimaging studies contrasted conditions of nondelayed reafferent input with exafferent one. Here, we combined psychophysics with functional magnetic resonance imaging to test whether subtle perturbations in the timing of somatosensory reafference disrupt its predictive processing. Twenty-eight participants generated touches on their left index finger by tapping a sensor with their right index finger. The touches on the left index finger were delivered at the time of the two fingers contact or with a 100 ms delay. We found that such brief temporal perturbations disrupted the attenuation of the somatosensory reafference both at the perceptual and neural level, leading to greater somatosensory and cerebellar responses and weaker somatosensory connectivity with the cerebellum proportionally to perceptual changes. Moreover, we observed increased connectivity of the supplementary motor area with the cerebellum during the perturbations. We interpret these effects as the failure of the forward model to predictively attenuate the delayed somatosensory reafference and the return of the prediction error to the motor centers, respectively.

	<p>Rationale: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of several sites, such as the thalamus, has been shown to reduce seizure frequency and interictal epileptiform activity in patients with refractory epilepsy. Recent findings have demonstrated that the insula is part of the &amp;amp;lsquo;rich club&amp;amp;rsquo; of highly connected brain regions. This pilot study investigated short-term effects of high-frequency (HF) insular DBS on interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) rate in patients with refractory epilepsy. Methods: Six patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing an intracranial electroencephalographic study received two sets of 10 min continuous 150 Hz HF-DBS of the insula. For each patient, epileptiform activity was analyzed for a total of 80 min, starting 20 min prior to stimulation set 1 (S1), and ending 20 min after stimulation set 2 (S2). All IEDs were identified and classified according to their anatomic localization by a board-certified epileptologist. The IED rate during the 20 min preceding S1 served as a baseline for comparison with IED rate during S1, S2 and post-stimulation periods. Results: HF-DBS of the anterior insula (aINS) was performed in a patient with an aINS epileptic focus (patient 1). HF-DBS of the posterior insula (pINS) was performed in two patients with a pINS epileptic focus (patients 2 and 4), in one patient with an aINS focus (patient 3), and in two non-insular patients (patients 5 and 6). The total IED (irrespective of their location) rate significantly decreased (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in two patients (patients 1 and 2) during the stimulation period, whereas it significantly increased (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in one patient (patient 6); there was no change in the other three patients. Looking at subsets of spike localization, HF-DBS of the aINS significantly reduced aINS and orbitofrontal IEDs in patient 1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), while HF-DBS of the pINS had an effect on pINS IEDs (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in both patients with a pINS focus; there was no significant effect of HF-DBS of the insula on IEDs in temporal or other frontal regions. Conclusion: Short-term HF-DBS of the insula had heterogeneous effects on the IED rate. Further work is required to examine factors underlying these heterogeneous effects, such as stimulation frequency, location of IEDs and subregions of the insula stimulated.</p>

	<p>Hyperacusis (decreased sound tolerance) is a prevalent complaint. Yet, to date, no research has qualitatively evaluated the types of problems experienced by adults with hyperacusis. Our service evaluation aims to determine the hyperacusis-related problem domains reported by patients and the degree to which these domains were reported together. Retrospective analysis was conducted on an anonymised clinical dataset from 306 patients who attended a UK tinnitus and hyperacusis treatment centre between 1994 and 2017. Conventional content analysis was used to categorise responses to the question &amp;amp;lsquo;Why is hyperacusis a problem?&amp;amp;rsquo; into domains which were then subjected to a cluster analysis. Twenty-five problem domains were identified, of which 12 were further classified into three overarching categories. &amp;amp;lsquo;Fear&amp;amp;rsquo;, &amp;amp;lsquo;Reduced quality of life&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;Physical reaction to sound&amp;amp;rsquo; were most frequently reported problems. Cluster analysis revealed that &amp;amp;lsquo;Sleep difficulties&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;Despondency&amp;amp;rsquo;, were commonly reported together. Adults with hyperacusis face many challenges in their everyday lives. The nature of these problems indicates the need to develop complex interventions and assessments to aid management of hyperacusis. Current hyperacusis questionnaires may be useful in identifying some problem domains, but further assessment thorough patient interviews is required to fully explore all potential problems and make informed decisions about treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: Nowadays, controversy exists regarding the stage of cognitive decline and/or dementia where voting capacity is diminished. Aim: To evaluate whether general cognitive status in advancing age predicts voting capacity in its specific aspects. Methods: The study sample comprised 391 people: 88 cognitively healthy older adults (CH), 150 people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and 153 people with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease dementia (ADD). The assessment included CAT-V for the voting capacity and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for general cognitive ability. ANOVAs and ROC curves were the tools of statistical analysis towards (a) indicating under which MMSE rate participants are incapable of voting and (b) whether the CAT-V total score can discriminate people with dementia (PwADD) from people without dementia (PwtD). Results: Out of the six CAT-V questions, one question was associated with a low MMSE cutoff score (19.50), having excellent sensitivity (92.5%) and specificity (77.20%), whilst the other five questions presented a higher MMSE cutoff score, with a good sensitivity (78.4% to 87.6%) and specificity (75.3% to 81.7%), indicating that voting difficulties are associated with cognitive status. Secondarily, the total CAT-V score discriminates PwADD from PwtD of 51&amp;amp;ndash;65 years (sensitivity 93.2%/specificity 100%&amp;amp;mdash;excellent), PwADD from PwtD of 66&amp;amp;ndash;75 years (sensitivity 73.3%/specificity 97.1%&amp;amp;mdash;good), PwADD from PwtD of 76&amp;amp;ndash;85 years (sensitivity 92.2%/specificity 64.7%&amp;amp;mdash;good), whilst for 86&amp;amp;ndash;95 years, a cutoff of 9.5 resulted in perfect sensitivity and specificity (100%). Conclusion: According to MMSE, PwADD have no full voting competence, whilst PwtD seem to have intact voting capacity. The calculated cut-off scores indicate that only people who score more than 28 points on the MMSE have voting capacity.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are highly specialized neural cells with several functions essential for vision. Progressive deterioration of RPE cells in elderly individuals can result in visual impairment and, ultimately, blinding disease. While human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE cell (hESC-RPE) growth conditions are generally harsher than those of cell lines, the subretinal transplantation of hESC-RPE is being clinically explored as a strategy to recover the damaged retina and improve vision. The cell-adhesion ability of the support is required for RPE transplantation, where pre-polarized cells can maintain specific functions on the scaffold. This work examined four typical biodegradable hydrogels as supports for hESC-RPE growth. Methods: Four biodegradable hydrogels were examined: gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA), alginate, and fibrin hydrogels. ARPE-19 and hESC-RPE cells were seeded onto the hydrogels separately, and the ability of these supports to facilitate adherence, proliferation, and homogeneous distribution of differentiated hESC-RPE cells was investigated. Furthermore, the hydrogel&amp;amp;rsquo;s subretinal bio-compatibility was assessed in vivo. Results: We showed that ARPE-19 and hESC-RPE cells adhered and proliferated only on the fibrin support. The monolayer formed when cells reached confluency, demonstrating the polygonal semblance, and revealing actin filaments that moved along the cytoplasm. The expression of tight junction proteins at cell interfaces on the 14th day of seeding demonstrated the barrier function of epithelial cells on polymeric surfaces and the interaction between cells. Moreover, the expression of proteins crucial for retinal functions and matrix production was positively affected by fibrin, with an increment of PEDF. Our in vivo investigation with fibrin hydrogels revealed high short-term subretinal biocompatibility. Conclusions: The research of stem cell-based cell therapy for retinal degenerative diseases is more complicated than that of cell lines. Our results showed that fibrin is a suitable scaffold for hESC-RPE transplantation, which could be a new grafting material for tissue engineering RPE cells.</p>

	<p>Purpose: This study aimed to detect differences in post-exercise brain activity between the left and right paddlers due to exercise by analyzing the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum before and after exercise. Methods: Twenty-one right paddlers and twenty-two left paddlers completed a 1 km all-out test on a dragon boat ergometer, and their heart rate and exercise time were recorded. EEG signals were collected from superficial brain layers before and after exercise; then, the EEG power spectrum was extracted and compared in different frequency bands. In addition, the degree of lateralization in each brain region was assessed by the asymmetry index. Results: There was no significant difference in the power spectrum values and asymmetry indices between the left and right paddlers before rowing (p &amp;amp;#707; 0.05). However, after rowing, the left-paddlers group had significantly higher spectral power values in &amp;amp;theta; and &amp;amp;alpha; bands than the right-paddlers group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and brain lateralization in both groups of athletes occurred mainly in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the frontal and central regions. Conclusion: The 1 km of rowing induced more brain activation in the left paddlers, and both left and right paddlers showed functional aggregation of hemispheric lateralization.</p>

	<p>The training of mental health professionals is an important component of suicide-prevention programs. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in different Italian regions to evaluate knowledge of, and attitudes toward, suicide as well as the experience of a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s suicide or a suicide attempt in early career psychiatrists (ECPs) and trainees (N = 338). The Suicide Knowledge and Skills Questionnaire and the Impact of a Patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s Suicide on Professional and Personal Lives scale were administered. Furthermore, symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, and arousal were examined through the Impact of Event Scale in ECPs and trainees who had experienced the suicide of a patient or a suicide attempt. Participants with training were more confident in the clinical management of suicide-risk patients. The group with experience of a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s suicide reported more suicide skills except for support and supervision. Finally, the participants who reported a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s suicide presented a more conservative patient selection, difficulties in relationships, loss of self-esteem, dreams linked to suicide, intrusive thoughts of suicide, guilt, and anger. Our results show that knowledge of, and attitudes toward, suicide are essential in the management of suicide-risk patients.</p>

	<p>Adults commonly struggle with perceiving and recognizing the sounds and words of a second language (L2), especially when the L2 sounds do not have a counterpart in the learner&amp;amp;rsquo;s first language (L1). We examined how L1 Mandarin L2 English speakers learned pseudo English words within a cross-situational word learning (CSWL) task previously presented to monolingual English and bilingual Mandarin-English speakers. CSWL is ambiguous because participants are not provided with direct mappings of words and object referents. Rather, learners discern word-object correspondences through tracking multiple co-occurrences across learning trials. The monolinguals and bilinguals tested in previous studies showed lower performance for pseudo words that formed vowel minimal pairs (e.g., /dit/-/d&amp;amp;#618;t/) than pseudo word which formed consonant minimal pairs (e.g., /b&amp;amp;#596;n/-/p&amp;amp;#596;n/) or non-minimal pairs which differed in all segments (e.g., /b&amp;amp;#596;n/-/dit/). In contrast, L1 Mandarin L2 English listeners struggled to learn all word pairs. We explain this seemingly contradicting finding by considering the multiplicity of acoustic cues in the stimuli presented to all participant groups. Stimuli were produced in infant-directed-speech (IDS) in order to compare performance by children and adults and because previous research had shown that IDS enhances L1 and L2 acquisition. We propose that the suprasegmental pitch variation in the vowels typical of IDS stimuli might be perceived as lexical tone distinctions for tonal language speakers who cannot fully inhibit their L1 activation, resulting in high lexical competition and diminished learning during an ambiguous word learning task. Our results are in line with the Second Language Linguistic Perception (L2LP) model which proposes that fine-grained acoustic information from multiple sources and the ability to switch between language modes affects non-native phonetic and lexical development.</p>

	<p>Previous intermodulation (IM) studies have employed two (or more) temporal modulations of a stimulus, with different local elements of the stimulus being modulated by different frequencies. Brain activities of IM obtained mainly from electroencephalograms (EEG) have been analyzed in the frequency domain. As a powerful tool, IM, which can provide a direct and objective physiological measure of neural interaction, has emerged as a promising method to decipher neural interactions in visual perception, and reveal the underlying different perceptual processing levels. In this review, we summarize the recent applications of IM in visual perception, detail the protocols and types of IM, and extend its utility and potential applications to the multisensory domain. We propose that using IM could prevail in partially revealing the potential hierarchical processing of multisensory information and contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying brain dynamics.</p>

                TBK1 is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been linked to a number of diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Reproducible research on TBK1 has been hampered by the lack of well characterized antibodies. In this study, we characterized 11 commercial antibodies for TBK1 for use in immunoblot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using an isogeneic knock-out cell line as a control. We identify antibodies that appear specific for all three applications but invite the readers to interpret the present findings based on their own scientific expertise and use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among pharmacy students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the wake of COVID-19 prevention, a growing attention has been devoted to administering vaccines among various sub-group populations including community health care providers. As a community health worker pharmacists and pharmacy students played a crucial role in patient-centered services for managing COVID-19. Examining pharmacy students’ vaccine acceptance intent has great potential in understanding how pharmacists’ perception impacts community people. This study investigated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pharmacy students in Bangladesh and identified the potential factors associated with their vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was deployed online using Google forms in English and conveniently sent to 1190 pharmacy students at different universities between 15th October 2021 and 15th December 2021. The convenience sampling consisted of 1034 student pharmacists (response rate 86.9%) who participated in this study. Binary logistic regressions and Chi-squared test were used for rationalizing the study objectives. Results: The pooled COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was 908 (87.8%; 95% CI 85.8─87.8) among student pharmacists while 29.6% (95% CI 25.4─33.9) admitted the willingness to pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine. Out of 12 vital predictive factors, “safety,” “efficacy,” and “trust” had the strongest significant and positive association with vaccine acceptance (p=0.000). The logistic analysis also revealed that “communication” and “information sufficiency” had a significant positive association with vaccine acceptance (p=0.035 and 0.038, respectively) among student pharmacists. Although the odds of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be 1.1; an insignificant association between gender and vaccine acceptance was observed in the Chi-squared test. Conclusions: The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine apprehension will reduce if vaccine-related information becomes more publicly available. Ensuring easy access to scientific information with evidence-based and tailored communication would enhance vaccine acceptance among pharmacy students. Implementation of multidisciplinary educational intervention would support the health care students to achieve adequate knowledge on vaccination consequences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Safety, quality, and nutritional aspect of smoked barracuda fish [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Barracuda fish has a superior nutritional content, so it can be utilized as raw material for smoked fish products. The smoking method most commonly applied in Indonesia is traditional smoking. The traditional smoking process implemented commercially in Indonesia still uses simple equipment and sanitation is typically not monitored. Traditional smoking used at high temperatures can cause contamination of the products, such as with chemicals and microbes. Liquid smoke can be used to overcome these disadvantages. The study aimed to evaluate the nutritional, chemical, and microbial content of fresh and smoked barracuda processed using different smoking methods, namely traditional and liquid smoke. Methods: Barracuda fish were smoked using different smoking methods, traditional and liquid smoke. The traditional method used a simple smoking furnace, while the liquid smoke method was carried out by immersing the fish in a 5% liquid smoke solution. Then, the smoked barracuda were analyzed with various methods, such as proximate, heavy metals, histamine, benzo[a]pyrene, and total microbes (TPC). Data was analyzed using ANOVA at significance level (p < 0.05) followed by Duncan’s test models using SPSS v.16. Results: Smoked fish treated with liquid smoke had a lower value of Arsenic heavy metal (As), at 0.73 mg/kg compared to the traditional method at 1.93 mg/kg; no histamine and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds were detected, namely benzo[a]pyrene; and liquid smoked fish can inhibit the growth of bacteria which can be seen from total bacteria value of 4.6 x 10 colonies/g Conclusions: Smoked fish processed using a liquid smoke was safer for consumption by the consumer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: An unusual case of small bowel volvulus due to appendicitis associated with pneumatosis intestinalis: Review of the literature [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Pneumatosis cystoid intestinalis is a rare disease reported in the literature affecting 0.03% of the population. It has a variety of causes and its manifestation may change widely. It usually presents as a marginal finding resulting from various gastrointestinal pathologies. In the acute complicated form of pneumatosis intestinalis, management is challenging for physicians and surgeons. We present a case of a 60-year-old patient who was admitted to our surgical department with a symptomatology suggestive of small bowel occlusion. Computed tomography demonstrated ileal volvulus associated with parietal signs suffering and pneumoperitoneum. An emergent exploratory laparoscopy followed by conversion was performed demonstrating segmental ileal pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to a small bowel volvulus due to an inflammatory appendix wrapping around the distal ileum. Further, detorsion, retrograde draining, and appendectomy were performed because there were no signs of necrosis and the appendix was pathological. The postoperative course was uneventful. This case is exceedingly rare in the literature, because it was featured by the ileal volvulus due to appendicitis.This case report emphasizes the importance of surgical procedures in the management of symptomatic pneumatosis intestinalis associated to an acute abdomen.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Towards achieving lightweight intrusion detection systems in Internet of Things, the role of incremental machine learning: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                While the benefits of IoT cannot be overstated, its computational constraints make it challenging to deploy security methodologies that have been deployed in traditional computing systems. The benefits and computational constraints have made IoT systems attractive to cyber-attacks. One way to mitigate these attacks is to detect them. In this study, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been conducted to analyze the role of incremental machine learning in achieving lightweight intrusion detection for IoT systems. The study analyzed existing incremental machine learning approaches used in designing intrusion detection systems for IoT ecosystems, emphasizing the incremental methods used in detecting intrusions, the datasets used to evaluate these methods, and how the method achieves lightweight status. The SLR outlined the contributions of each study, focusing on their strengths and gaps, the datasets used, and the incremental machine learning model used. This study revealed that incremental learning approaches in detecting intrusion in IoT systems are in their infant stage. Over 12 years, from 2010 to 2022, a total of twenty-one (21) studies were carried out in IDSs using incremental machine learning, with eight (8) studies carried out in IoT systems. In addition to reviewing the literature, we offer suggestions for improving existing solutions and achieving lightweight IDS for IoT systems. We also discussed some problems with making lightweight IDS for IoT systems and areas where more research could be done in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Integration of the CA2 region in the hippocampal network during epileptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The CA2 pyramidal cells are mostly resistant to cell death in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) with hippocampal sclerosis, but they are aberrantly integrated into the epileptic hippocampal network via mossy fiber sprouting. Furthermore, they show increased excitability in vitro in hippocampal slices obtained from human MTLE specimens or animal epilepsy models. Although these changes promote CA2 to contribute to epileptic activity (EA) in vivo, the role of CA2 in the epileptic network within and beyond the sclerotic hippocampus is still unclear. We used the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model for MTLE, which recapitulates most features of the human disease including pharmacoresistant epileptic seizures and hippocampal sclerosis, with preservation of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA2 pyramidal cells. In vivo recordings with electrodes in CA2 and the DG showed that EA occurs at high coincidence between the ipsilateral DG and CA2 and current source density analysis of silicon probe recordings in dorsal ipsilateral CA2 revealed CA2 as a local source of EA. Cell-specific viral tracing in Amigo2-icreERT2 mice confirmed the preservation of the axonal projection from ipsilateral CA2 pyramidal cells to contralateral CA2 under epileptic conditions and indeed, EA propagated from ipsi- to contralateral CA2 with increasing likelihood with time after KA injection, but always at lower intensity than within the ipsilateral hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that CA2 presents with local theta oscillations and like the DG, shows a pathological reduction of theta frequency already from 2 days after KA onward. The early changes in activity might be facilitated by the loss of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (<i>Gad67</i>) mRNA-expressing interneurons directly after the initial <i>status epilepticus</i> in ipsi- but not contralateral CA2. Together, our data highlight CA2 as an active player in the epileptic network and with its contralateral connections as one possible router of aberrant activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Staining ability of herbal tea preparations on a nano-filled composite restorative material – an in-vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Discoloration of tooth-colored restorations due to various factors is one of the principal causes behind the failure of aesthetics. There has been an surge in the consumption of herbal beverages in recent times and the dietary factors play a potential role in the discoloration tooth-coloured restorations. This study was done to juxtapose the staining ability of green tea (GT), moringa tea (MT), and hibiscus tea (HT) on a nano-filled composite restorative material. Methods: The study was conducted in-vitro on composite samples prepared using moulds. 112 discs were prepared from FiltekTM Z350XT composite using a brass mould lined with mylar strips. Samples were divided into GT, MT, HT, and artificial saliva (AS) groups and immersed in freshly prepared beverages for 15 minutes each day for 45 days. Digital reflectance spectrophotometer was utilized to record color at baseline, 30, and 45 days. Repeated-measures ANOVA with a post-hoc Bonferroni test was used to compare groups within each group. ANOVA with a post-hoc Games Howell test was used to compare mean differences in ΔE among the groups. Results: Maximum discoloration was observed in the GT, followed by HT and MT, with the least being in the AS group at the end of 30 and 45 days (P<0.001 and P<0.001) respectively. Conclusions: The universal nano-filled composite material showed clinically detectable discoloration when exposed to Green Tea, Hibiscus Tea, and Moringa Tea which increased with time. Herbal beverages have the potential to cause discoloration of the composite resin which is often the choice of material for anterior aesthetic restorations.

                Background: The expanding Acacia decurrens woodlots in Northwestern Ethiopia is recognized for carbon storage via root biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) enhancement but its planting densities have varied considerably. This study evaluated the effect of planting density on the root biomass, SOC stock, and vertical distributions in the stands. Methods: Five planting densities (0.5 m x 0.5 m, 0.75 m x 0.75 m, 1 m x 1 m, 1.25 m x 1.25 m, and 1.5 m x 1.5 m) were replicated four times with randomized complete block design. Soil core (6.67 cm diameter) and pit (900 cm2 area) methods were used to collect fine and coarse root samples within 0–50 cm soil depth (having five soil layers in 10 cm intervals), respectively. Fine root biomass samples were classified as live and dead (necromass) and further as tree and herbaceous root. All root biomass samples were washed, oven-dried, weighed, and standardized into gram per meter square (g m-2) for root biomass comparisons for each planting density and soil depth, then summed up for 0–50 cm depth as a total root biomass. The vertical distributions of fine and coarse root biomass at each depth were expressed as a percentage (in decimal) of the total root biomass (0–50 cm). Conclusions: Planting density had significant effects on root biomass, SOC stock, and root distributions (P < 0.05) but inconsistent for the percentage of SOC stock at all soil layers except at 40-50 cm. Planting A. decurrens with high density is recommended to increase root biomass, SOC, and percentage of roots in deep soil layers. Further study is suggested for the effects of stand age on root biomass dynamics and SOC stock with large scale.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare and often severe disease characterized by central nervous system-restricted inflammatory vasculitis on histopathology. Diagnosis requires brain biopsy for confirmation and is suggested prior to starting immunotherapy when feasible. However, emerging evidence suggests that other neuroinflammatory conditions may have a clinical and radiographic phenotype that mimics small vessel primary angiitis, at times with overlapping pathologic features as well. Such diagnoses, including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease and central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, can be non-invasively diagnosed with serum antibody or genetic testing that would prompt different monitoring and treatment paradigms. To determine the ultimate diagnosis of patients who were suspected prior to biopsy to have small vessel primary angiitis, we reviewed the clinical, radiographic, and pathological features of a cohort of patients at a single center undergoing brain biopsy for non-oncologic indications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical data were retrospectively extracted from the medical record. Pathology and neuroimaging review was conducted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 21 patients over a 19-year time-period, of whom 14 (66.7%) were ultimately diagnosed with entities other than small vessel primary angiitis that would have obviated the need for brain biopsy. Diagnoses included anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease (n = 9), central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n = 3), anti-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor encephalitis (n = 1), and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (n = 1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights the importance of pursuing now readily available non-invasive testing for mimicking diagnoses before performing a brain biopsy for suspected small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Effect of Mobile Stroke Unit Dispatch in all Patients with Acute Stroke or TIA</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the effect of additional mobile stroke unit (MSU) dispatch on functional outcomes among the full spectrum of stroke patients, regardless of subtype or potential contraindications to reperfusion therapies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data from the nonrandomized Berlin-based B_PROUD study (02/2017 to 05/2019), in which MSUs were dispatched based solely on availability, and the linked B-SPATIAL stroke registry. All patients with final stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) diagnoses were eligible. The intervention under study was the additional dispatch of an MSU, an emergency physician-staffed ambulance equipped to provide prehospital imaging and thrombolytic treatment, compared to conventional ambulance alone. The primary outcome was the 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and the co-primary outcome was a 3-tiered disability scale. We identified confounders using directed acyclic graphs and obtained adjusted effect estimates using inverse probability of treatment weighting.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MSUs were dispatched to 1,125 patients (mean age: 74 years, 46.5% female), while for 1,141 patients only conventional ambulances were dispatched (75 years, 49.9% female). After confounding adjustment, MSU dispatch was associated with more favorable 3-month mRS scores (common odds ratio [cOR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71–0.94). No statistically significant association was found with the co-primary outcome (cOR = 0.86; 9% CI: 0.72–1.01) or 7-day mortality (OR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.59–1.48).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>When considering the entire population of stroke/TIA patients, MSU dispatch improved 3-month functional outcomes without evidence of compromised safety. Our results are relevant for decision-makers since stroke subtype and treatment eligibility are unknown at time of dispatch. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>
