              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Prolonged Unconsciousness is Common in COVID‐19 and Associated with Hypoxemia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to estimate the time to recovery of command-following and associations between hypoxemia with time to recovery of command-following.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study during the initial surge of the United Statesʼ pandemic (March–July 2020) we estimate the time from intubation to recovery of command-following, using Kaplan Meier cumulative-incidence curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients were included if they were admitted to 1 of 3 hospitals because of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), required endotracheal intubation for at least 7 days, and experienced impairment of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score &lt;6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five hundred seventy-one patients of the 795 patients recovered command-following. The median time to recovery of command-following was 30 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27–32 days). Median time to recovery of command-following increased by 16 days for patients with at least one episode of an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) value ≤55 mmHg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and 25% recovered ≥10 days after cessation of mechanical ventilation. The time to recovery of command-following  was associated with hypoxemia (PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤55 mmHg hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46–0.68; PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤70 HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.91), and each additional day of hypoxemia decreased the likelihood of recovery, accounting for confounders including sedation. These findings were confirmed among patients without any imagining evidence of structural brain injury (n = 199), and in a non-overlapping second surge cohort (N = 427, October 2020 to April 2021).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Survivors of severe COVID-19 commonly recover consciousness weeks after cessation of mechanical ventilation. Long recovery periods are associated with more severe hypoxemia. This relationship is not explained by sedation or brain injury identified on clinical imaging and should inform decisions about life-sustaining therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Oxidative stress induces inflammation which in turn exacerbates oxidative stress (OS) and the expression of acute phase proteins (APPs). Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) therapy was assessed for suppression of OS and APP responses in longitudinal serum samples from subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The first round of Treg therapy suppressed levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). During a six-month washout period, ox-LDL levels increased. A second round of therapy again suppressed ox-LDL levels and then rose following the cessation of treatment. Serum levels of APPs, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and C-reactive protein, were stabilized during Treg administrations, but rose during the washout period and again after therapy was discontinued. Treg therapy potentially suppresses peripheral OS and the accompanying circulating pro-inflammatory induced APPs, both of which may serve as peripheral candidates for monitoring efficacies of immunomodulating therapies.</p>

	<p>Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder affecting one billion people worldwide, mainly females. It is characterized by attacks of moderate to severe headache pain, with associated symptoms. Receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP1) is part of the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) receptor, a pharmacological target for migraine. Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, play a role in clinical presentation of various diseases. DNA methylation occurs mostly in the gene promoter and can control gene expression. We investigated the methylation state of the RAMP1 promoter in 104 female blood DNA samples: 54 migraineurs and 50 controls. We treated DNA with sodium bisulfite and performed PCR, Sanger Sequencing, and Epigenetic Sequencing Methylation (ESME) software analysis. We identified 51 CpG dinucleotides, and 5 showed methylation variability. Migraineurs had a higher number of individuals with all five CpG methylated when compared to controls (26% vs. 16%), although non-significant (p = 0.216). We also found that CpG &amp;amp;minus;284 bp, related to the transcription start site (TSS), showed higher methylation levels in cases (p = 0.011). This CpG may potentially play a role in migraine, affecting RAMP1 transcription or receptor malfunctioning and/or altered CGRP binding. We hope to confirm this finding in a larger cohort and establish an epigenetic biomarker to predict female migraine risk.</p>

	<p>An important problem in many fields dealing with noisy time series, such as psychophysiological single trial data during learning or monitoring treatment effects over time, is detecting a change in the model underlying a time series. Here, we present a new method for detecting a single changepoint in a linear time series regression model, termed residuals permutation-based method (RESPERM). The optimal changepoint in RESPERM maximizes Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size with the parameters estimated by the permutation of residuals in a linear model. RESPERM was compared with the SEGMENTED method, a well-established and recommended method for detecting changepoints, using extensive simulated data sets, varying the amount and distribution characteristics of noise and the location of the change point. In time series with medium to large amounts of noise, the variance of the detected changepoint was consistently smaller for RESPERM than SEGMENTED. Finally, both methods were applied to a sample dataset of single trial amplitudes of the N250 ERP component during face learning. In conclusion, RESPERM appears to be well suited for changepoint detection especially in noisy data, making it the method of choice in neuroscience, medicine and many other fields.</p>

	<p>Previous studies on the neural cognitive mechanisms of aspectual processing in second language (L2) learners have focused on Indo-European languages with rich inflectional morphology. These languages have aspects which are equipped with inflected verb forms combined with auxiliary or modal verbs. Meanwhile, little attention has been paid to Mandarin Chinese, which has limited morphological inflection, and its aspect is equipped with aspectual particles (e.g., le, zhe, guo). The present study explores the neurocognitive mechanism of Mandarin Chinese aspect processing among two groups of late Mandarin Chinese proficient learners with Thai (with Mandarin Chinese-like aspect markers) and Indonesian (lack of Mandarin Chinese-like aspect markers) as their first language (L1). We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) time locked to the aspect marker le in two different conditions (the aspect violation sentences and the correct sentences). A triphasic ELAN-LAN-P600 effect was produced by the Mandarin Chinese native speakers. However, there was no ELAN and LAN in Indonesian native speakers and Thai native speakers, except a 300&amp;amp;ndash;500 ms negativity widely distributed in the right hemisphere and P600-like effect. This suggests that both groups of Mandarin Chinese learners cannot reach the same level as Mandarin Chinese native speakers to process Mandarin Chinese aspect information, probably due to the complex feature of Mandarin Chinese aspect maker, the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; L2 proficiency and age of L2 acquisition.</p>

<p>Treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 does not enhance sensory and motor regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in female mice (Top). Direct neuronal BET inhibition reduces neurite outgrowth in DRG explants (Middle). However, BET-inhibited macrophages secrete pro-regenerative factors, probably anti-inflammatory cytokines that enhance STAT 6 phosphorylation and neuritogenesis ex vivo (Bottom).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve regeneration is limited after injury, especially in humans, due to the large distance the axons have to grow in the limbs. This process is highly dependent on the expression of neuroinflammatory factors produced by macrophages and glial cells. Given the importance of the epigenetic BET proteins on inflammation, we aimed to ascertain if BET inhibition may have an effect on axonal outgrowth. For this purpose, we treated female mice with JQ1 or vehicle after sciatic nerve crush injury and analyzed target reinnervation. We also used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) culture explants to analyze the effects of direct BET inhibition or treatment with conditioned medium from BET-inhibited macrophages. We observed that although JQ1 produced an enhancement of IL-4, IL-13, and GAP43 expression, it did not have an effect on sensory or motor reinnervation after crush injury in vivo. In contrast, JQ1 reduced neurite growth when interacting directly with DRG neurons ex vivo, whereas conditioned medium from JQ1-treated macrophages promoted neurite outgrowth. Therefore, BET-inhibited macrophages secrete pro-regenerative factors that induce neurite outgrowth, and that may counteract the direct inhibition of BET proteins in neurons in vivo. Finally, we observed an activation of the STAT6 pathway in DRG explants treated with conditioned medium from JQ1-treated macrophages. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that BET protein inhibition in macrophages provides a mechanism to enhance axonal outgrowth. However, specific targeting of BET proteins to macrophages will be needed to efficiently enhance functional recovery after nerve injury.</p>

Based on a significant association between the gray matter volume loss and lower olfactory-specific quality of life, we assume that these morphometric network changes may be closely related to emotional dysfunctions in anosmia.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of olfaction, or anosmia, frequently accompanies emotional dysfunctions, partly due to the overlapping brain regions between the olfactory and emotional processing centers. Here, we investigated whether anosmia was associated with gray matter volume alterations at a network level, and whether these alterations were related to the olfactory-specific quality of life (QOL) and depressive symptoms. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 22 individuals with postinfectious or idiopathic anosmia (the anosmia group) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls (the control group). Using independent component analysis on the gray matter volumes, we identified 10 morphometric networks. The gray matter volumes of these networks were compared between the two groups. Olfactory-specific QOL and depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires and clinician-administered interviews, respectively. The anosmia group showed lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala and the precuneus networks, relative to the control group. Lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala network were also linearly associated with lower olfactory-specific QOL and higher depressive symptom scores. These findings suggest a close relationship between anosmia and gray matter volume alterations in the emotional brain networks, albeit without determined causal relations.</p>

<p>Regulation of ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. And organelles play a role in different cellular interactions with ferroptosis. Targeting organelle metabolic pathways and redox responses may be an effective strategy for disease treatment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimerʼs disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease, is a striking global health problem. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation products and the accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species. Strict regulation of iron metabolism is essential to ensure neuronal homeostasis. Excess and deficiency of iron are both associated with neurodegeneration. Studies have shown that oxidative stress caused by cerebral iron metabolism disorders in the body is involved in the process of AD, ferroptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, and regulating ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of AD. Various organelles are closely related to ferroptosis: mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosome are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis from the aspects of iron metabolism and redox imbalance. In this review, the relationship between AD and the dysfunction of organelles (including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, and Golgi apparatus) and the role of organelles in ferroptosis of AD were reviewed to provide insights for understanding the relationship between organelles and ferroptosis in AD and the treatment of AD.</p>

     alt="The role of sex in the association between cannabis use and working memory-related brain activity"/>
<p>Compared to controls, cannabis users show a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing working memory (WM) load and a relatively smaller reduction in WM related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. No sex differences emerged generally or in cannabis users in WM and WM load related activity or performance.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although cannabis use patterns differ between men and women, studies on sex differences on the effects of cannabis on the brain and cognitive control are largely lacking. Working memory (WM) is a component of cognitive control believed to be involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. In this study, we evaluated the association between cannabis use and WM (load) related brain activity in a large sample, enabling us to assess sex effects in this association. The brain activity of 104 frequent cannabis users (63% men) and 85 controls (53% men) was recorded during an N-back WM task. Behavioral results showed a significant interaction between WM load and group for both accuracy and reaction time, with cannabis users showing a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing WM load. Cannabis users compared to controls showed a relatively smaller reduction in WM (load) related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. This WM (load) related activity was not associated with performance nor cannabis use and related problems. An exploratory analysis showed higher WM-related activity in the superior frontal gyrus in men compared to women. While cannabis users showed higher WM (load) related activity in central nodes of the default mode network, this was not directly attributable to group specific worsening of performance under higher cognitive load. Further research is necessary to assess whether observed group differences increase with higher cognitive load, how group differences relate to measures of cannabis use, and how sex affects these group differences.</p>

<p>Astrocyte calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes increases with Aß pathology and age. Increased calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes does not affect astrocyte network activity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are critical for healthy brain function. In Alzheimer’s disease, astrocytes become reactive, which affects their signaling properties. Here, we measured spontaneous calcium transients <i>ex vivo</i> in hippocampal astrocytes in brain slices containing the dentate gyrus of 6- (6M) and 9-month-old (9M) APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. We investigated the frequency and duration of calcium transients in relation to aging, amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, and the proximity of the astrocyte to Aβ plaques. The 6M APP/PS1 astrocytes showed no change in spontaneous calcium-transient properties compared to wild-type (WT) astrocytes. 9M APP/PS1 astrocytes, however, showed more hyperactivity compared to WT, characterized by increased spontaneous calcium transients that were longer in duration. Our data also revealed an effect of aging, as 9M astrocytes overall showed an increase in calcium activity compared to 6M astrocytes. Subsequent calcium-wave analysis showed an increase in sequential calcium transients (i.e., calcium waves) in 9M astrocytes, suggesting increased network activity <i>ex vivo</i>. Further analysis using null models revealed that this network effect is caused by chance, due to the increased number of spontaneous transients. Our findings show that alterations in calcium signaling in individual hippocampal astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice are subject to both aging and Aβ pathology but these do not lead to a change in astrocyte network activity. These alterations in calcium dynamics of astrocytes may help to understand changes in neuronal physiology leading to cognitive decline and ultimately dementia.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Concomitant exploration of structural, functional, and neurochemical brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline is crucial in promoting healthy aging. Here, we present the DopamiNe, Age, connectoMe, and Cognition (DyNAMiC) project, a multimodal, prospective 5-year longitudinal study spanning the adult human lifespan. DyNAMiC examines age-related changes in the brain’s structural and functional connectome in relation to changes in dopamine D1 receptor availability (D1DR), and their associations to cognitive decline. Critically, due to the complete lack of longitudinal D1DR data, the true trajectory of one of the most age-sensitive dopamine systems remains unknown. The first DyNAMiC wave included 180 healthy participants (20–80 years). Brain imaging included magnetic resonance imaging assessing brain structure (white matter, gray matter, iron), perfusion, and function (during rest and task), and positron emission tomography (PET) with the [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 radioligand. A subsample (<i>n</i> = 20, &gt;65 years) was additionally scanned with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride PET measuring D2DR. Age-related variation was evident for multiple modalities, such as D1DR; D2DR, and performance across the domains of episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed. Initial analyses demonstrated an inverted u-shaped association between D1DR and resting-state functional connectivity across cortical network nodes, such that regions with intermediate D1DR levels showed the highest levels of nodal strength. Evident within each age group, this is the first observation of such an association across the adult lifespan, suggesting that emergent functional architecture depends on underlying D1DR systems. Taken together, DyNAMiC is the largest D1DR study worldwide, and will enable a comprehensive examination of brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline.</p>

<p>Interleukin-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) through the activation of microglia. It is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is thought to be associated with inflammation in many neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke and poststroke depression, but the role of IL-18 in inflammatory injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unclear. In this study, we established the ICH model in male mice and found that IL-18 expression including protein and mRNA levels was significantly increased in brain tissues after ICH. Meanwhile, exogenous IL-18 exacerbated cerebral hematoma and neurological deficits following ICH. In the IL-18 knockout group, the size of hematoma and neurological functions after ICH was decreased compared with the wild-type group, suggesting the critical role of IL-18 on the modulation of brain injury after ICH. Importantly, exogenous IL-18 increased microglial activation in brain tissues after ICH. Furthermore, IL-18 knockout resulted in the reduction of activated microglia after ICH. These results indicated that IL-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after ICH through the activation of microglia. Thus, IL-18 is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>

<p>Activating subpopulations of <i>parafascicular</i> (Pf) neurons selected on the basis of their projections to different basal ganglia components shows that the activity of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr) can be shaped by convergent information processed through direct thalamonigral (1), trans-subthalamic (2), and trans-striatal direct (3) and indirect (4) subcircuits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence implicates the <i>parafascicular nucleus</i> of the thalamus (Pf) in basal ganglia (BG)-related functions and pathologies. Despite Pf connectivity with all BG components, most attention is focused on the thalamostriatal system and an integrated view of thalamic information processing in this network is still lacking. Here, we addressed this question by recording the responses elicited by Pf activation in single neurons of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr), the main BG output structure in rodents, in anesthetized mice. We performed optogenetic activation of Pf neurons innervating the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the SNr using virally mediated transcellular delivery of Cre from injection in either target in Rosa26-LoxP-stop-ChR2-EYFP mice to drive channelrhodopsin expression. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the striatum evoked an inhibition often followed by an excitation, likely resulting from the activation of the trans-striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the SNr or the STN triggered one or two early excitations, suggesting partial functional overlap of trans-subthalamic and direct thalamonigral projections. Excitations were followed in about half of the cases by an inhibition that might reflect recruitment of intranigral inhibitory loops. Finally, global Pf stimulation, electrical or optogenetic, elicited similar complex responses comprising up to four components: one or two short-latency excitations, an inhibition, and a late excitation. These data provide evidence for functional connections between the Pf and different BG components and for convergence of the information processed through these pathways in single SNr neurons, stressing their importance in regulating BG outflow.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">What does gender has to do with math? Complex questions require complex answers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Whether mathematics is a gendered domain or not is a long-lasting issue bringing along major social and educational implications. The females' underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has been considered one of the key signs of the math gender gap, although the current view largely attributes the origin of this phenomenon to sociocultural factors. Indeed, recent approaches to math gender differences reached the universal conclusion that nature and nurture exert reciprocal effects on each other, establishing the need for approaching the study of the math gender issue only once its intrinsic complexity has been accepted. Building upon a flourishing literature, this review provides an updated synthesis of the evidence for math gender equality at the start, and for math gender inequality on the go, challenging the role of biological factors. In particular, by combining recent findings from different research areas, the paper discusses the persistence of the “math male myth” and the associated “female are not good at math myth,” drawing attention to the complex interplay of social and cultural forces that support such stereotypes. The suggestion is made that longevity of these myths results from the additive effects of two independent cognitive biases associated with gender stereotypes and with math stereotypes, respectively. Scholars' responsibility in amplifying these myths by pursuing some catching lines of research is also discussed.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), including diffuse axonal injury, are influenced by the direction, magnitude, and duration of head acceleration during the injury exposure. Ovine models have been used to study injury mechanics and pathological outcomes of TBI. To accurately describe the kinematics of the head during an injury exposure, and better facilitate comparison with human head kinematics, anatomical coordinate systems (ACS) with an origin at the head or brain center of mass (CoM), and axes that align with the ovine Frankfort plane equivalent, are required. The aim of this study was to determine the mass properties of the sheep head and brain, and define an ACS<sub>virtual</sub> for the head and brain, using anatomical landmarks on the skull with the aforementioned origins and orientation. Three-dimensional models of 10 merino sheep heads were constructed from computed tomography images, and the coordinates of the head and brain CoMs, relative to a previously reported sheep head coordinate system (ACS<sub>physical</sub>), were determined using the Hounsfield unit–mass density relationship. The ACS<sub>physical</sub> origin was 34.8 ± 3.1 mm posterosuperior of the head CoM and 43.7 ± 1.7 anteroinferior of the brain CoM. Prominent internal anatomical landmarks were then used to define a new ACS (ACS<sub>virtual</sub>) with axes aligned with the Frankfort plane equivalent and an origin 10.4 ± 3.2 mm from the head CoM. The CoM and ACS<sub>virtual</sub> defined in this study will increase the potential for comparison of head kinematics between ovine models and humans, in the context of TBI.</p>

<p>5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain produces antidepressive effect in both “normal” C57Bl/6J and “depressive” ASC/Icg mice. This effect is accompanied by increased 5-HT metabolism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heterodimerization between 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors seems to play an important role in the mechanism of depression and antidepressant drug action. It was suggested that the shift of the ratio between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>7</sub> hetero- and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers in presynaptic neurons toward 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers is one of the reasons of depression. Consequently, the artificial elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor number in presynaptic terminals might restore physiological homo-/heterodimer ratio resulting in antidepressive effect. Here we showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain raphe nuclei area produced antidepressive effect in male mice of both C57Bl/6J and genetically predisposed to depressive-like behavior ASC (antidepressant sensitive cataleptics) strains. These changes were accompanied by the elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor mRNA level in the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and its reduction in the hippocampus of ASC mice. The presence of engineered 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the midbrain of both mouse strains was further demonstrated. Importantly that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression resulted in the reduction of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor level in the membrane protein fraction from the midbrain samples of C57Bl/6J, but not ASC, mice. 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression caused an increase of 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the midbrain and the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and in all investigated brain structures of ASC mice. Thus, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area affects brain 5-HT system and causes antidepressive effect both in C57Bl/6J and in “depressive” ASC male mice. Obtained results indicate the involvement of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the mechanisms underlying depressive behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The role of the lateral septum in neuropsychiatric disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral septum (LS) is a structure in the midline of the brain that is interconnected with areas associated with stress and feeding. This review highlights the role of the LS in anxiety, depression, and eating disorders and their comorbidity. There is a prevailing view that the LS is anxiolytic. This review finds that the LS is both anxiolytic and anxiogenic. Furthermore, the LS can promote and inhibit feeding. Given these shared roles, the LS represents a common site for the comorbidity of neuropsychiatric disorders, and therefore a potential pharmacological target. This is crucial since currently available treatments are not always effective. Corticotrophin-releasing factor 2 antagonists are potential drugs for the treatment of anxiety and anorexia and require further research. Furthermore, other drugs currently in trials for binge eating, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists, may in fact promote food intake. It is hoped that the advancements in chemo- and optogenetic techniques will allow future studies to profile the specific neural connections of the LS and their function. This information could facilitate our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and therefore pharmacological targets, of these psychiatric conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prenatal Opioid Exposure Impairs Endocannabinoid and Glutamate Transmission in the Dorsal Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The opioid crisis has contributed to a growing population of children exposed to opioids during fetal development; however, many of the long-term effects of opioid exposure on development are unknown. We previously demonstrated that opioids have deleterious effects on endocannabinoid plasticity at glutamate synapses in the dorsal striatum of adolescent rodents, but it is unclear whether prenatal opioid exposure produces similar neuroadaptations. Using a mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME), we performed proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and patch-clamp electrophysiology in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) to examine synaptic functioning in adolescent PME offspring. PME impacted the proteome and phosphoproteome in a region- and sex-dependent manner. Many proteins and phosphorylated proteins associated with glutamate transmission were differentially abundant in PME offspring, which was associated with reduced glutamate release in the DLS and altered the rise time of excitatory events in the DMS. Similarly, the intrinsic excitability properties of DMS neurons were significantly affected by PME. Last, pathway analyses revealed an enrichment in retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in the DLS, but not in the DMS, of males. Electrophysiology studies confirmed that endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic depression was impaired in the DLS, but not DMS, of PME-males. These results indicate that PME induces persistent neuroadaptations in the dorsal striatum and could contribute to the aberrant behavioral development described in offspring with prenatal opioid exposure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Oral and Injected Tamoxifen Alter Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Female and Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inducible Cre recombinase facilitates temporal control of genetic recombination in numerous transgenic model systems, a feature which has made it a popular tool for adult neurogenesis studies. One of the most common forms of inducible Cre, CreER<sup>T2</sup>, requires activation by the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen (TAM) to initiate recombination of LoxP-flanked sequences. To date, most studies deliver TAM via intraperitoneal injection. But the introduction of TAM-infused commercial chows has recently expanded the possible modes of TAM delivery. Despite the widespread use of TAM-inducible genetic models in adult neurogenesis research, the comparative efficiency and off-target effects of TAM administration protocols is surprisingly infrequently studied. Here, we compare a standard, 5 d TAM injection regimen with voluntary consumption of TAM-infused chow. First, we used adult NestinCreER<sup>T2</sup>;Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-EYFP reporter mice to show that two weeks of TAM chow and 5 d of injections led to LoxP recombination in a similar phenotypic population of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the adult dentate gyrus. However, TAM chow resulted in substantially less overall recombination than injections. TAM administration also altered adult neurogenesis, but in different ways depending on administration route: TAM injection disrupted neural progenitor cell proliferation three weeks after TAM, whereas TAM chow increased neuronal differentiation of cells generated during the diet period. These findings provide guidance for selection of TAM administration route and appropriate controls in adult neurogenesis studies using TAM-inducible Cre mice. They also highlight the need for better understanding of off-target effects of TAM in other neurologic processes and organ systems.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prolonged Feedback Duration Does Not Affect Implicit Recalibration in a Visuomotor Rotation Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visuomotor rotations are frequently used to study cognitive processes underlying motor adaptation. Explicit aiming strategies and implicit recalibration are two of these processes. A large body of literature indicates that both processes are in fact dissociable and mainly independent components that can be measured using different manipulations in visuomotor rotation tasks. Visual feedback is a crucial element in these tasks, and it therefore plays an important role when assessing explicit re-aiming and implicit recalibration. For instance, researchers have found timing of visual feedback to affect the contribution of implicit recalibration to learning: if feedback is shown only at the end of the movement (instead of continuously), implicit recalibration decreases. Similarly, participants show lower levels of implicit recalibration if visual feedback is presented with a delay (instead of immediately). We thus hypothesized that the duration of feedback availability might also play a role. The goal of this study was thus to investigate the effect of longer versus shorter feedback durations on implicit recalibration in human participants. To this end, we compared three feedback durations in a between-subject design: 200, 600, and 1200 ms. Using a large sample size, we found differences between groups to be quite small, to the point where most differences indicated statistical equivalence between group means. We therefore hypothesize that feedback duration, when only endpoint feedback is presented, has a negligible effect on implicit recalibration. We propose that future research investigate the effect of feedback duration on other parameters of adaptation, so as proprioceptive recalibration and explicit re-aiming.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Semi-Automated Workflow for Brain Slice Histology Alignment, Registration, and Cell Quantification (SHARCQ)</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tools for refined cell-specific targeting have significantly contributed to understanding the characteristics and dynamics of distinct cellular populations by brain region. While advanced cell-labeling methods have accelerated the field of neuroscience, specifically in brain mapping, there remains a need to quantify and analyze the data. Here, by modifying a toolkit that localizes electrodes to brain regions (SHARP-Track; Slice Histology Alignment, Registration, and Probe-Track analysis), we introduce a post-imaging analysis tool to map histological images to established mouse brain atlases called SHARCQ (Slice Histology Alignment, Registration, and Cell Quantification). The program requires MATLAB, histological images, and either a manual or automatic cell count of the unprocessed images. SHARCQ simplifies the post-imaging analysis pipeline with a step-by-step GUI. We demonstrate that SHARCQ can be applied for a variety of mouse brain images, regardless of histology technique. In addition, SHARCQ rectifies discrepancies in mouse brain region borders between atlases by allowing the user to select between the Allen Brain Atlas or the digitized and modified Franklin&ndash;Paxinos Atlas for quantifying cell counts by region. SHARCQ produces quantitative and qualitative data, including counts of brain-wide region populations and a 3D model of registered cells within the atlas space. In summary, SHARCQ was designed as a neuroscience post-imaging analysis tool for cell-to-brain registration and quantification with a simple, accessible interface. All code is open-source and available for download (<A HREF="https://github.com/wildrootlab/SHARCQ">https://github.com/wildrootlab/SHARCQ</A>).</p>

                <p>The first evidence of local translation in the CNS appeared nearly 40 years ago, when electron microscopic studies showed polyribosomes localized to the base of dendritic spines. Since then, local translation has been established as an important regulatory mechanism for gene expression in polarized or functionally compartmentalized cells. While much attention has been placed on characterizing the local transcriptome and regulatory "grammar" directing mRNA localization in neurons and glia, less is understood about how these cells subsequently de-repress mRNA translation in their peripheral processes to produce a rapid translational response to stimuli. MicroRNA-mediated translation regulation offers a possible solution to this question. Not only do miRNAs provide the specificity needed for targeted gene regulation, but association and dynamic interactions between Argonaute (AGO) with sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins may provide a molecular switch to allow for de-repression of target mRNAs. Here, we review the expression and activity of different AGO proteins in miRNA-induced silencing complexes in neurons and glia and discuss known pathways of miRNA-mediated regulation, including activity-dependent pre-miRNA maturation in dendrites. We further detail work on AGO and RNA-binding protein interactions that allow for the reversal of miRNA-mediated translational silencing, and we propose a model for how intercellular communication may play a role in the regulation of local translation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KCNQ Channels Enable Reliable Presynaptic Spiking and Synaptic Transmission at High Frequency</a></h4>

              
                <p>The presynaptic action potential (AP) is required to drive calcium influx into nerve terminals, resulting in neurotransmitter release. Accordingly, the AP waveform is crucial in determining the timing and strength of synaptic transmission. The calyx of Held nerve terminals of rats of either sex showed minimum changes in AP waveform during high-frequency AP firing. We found that the stability of the calyceal AP waveform requires KCNQ (K<SUB>V</SUB>7) K<sup>+</sup> channel activation during high-frequency spiking activity. High-frequency presynaptic spikes gradually led to accumulation of KCNQ channels in open states which kept interspike membrane potential sufficiently negative to maintain Na<sup>+</sup> channel availability. Blocking KCNQ channels during stimulus trains led to inactivation of presynaptic Na<sup>+</sup>, and to a lesser extent K<SUB>V</SUB>1 channels, thereby reducing the AP amplitude and broadening AP duration. Moreover, blocking KCNQ channels disrupted the stable calcium influx and glutamate release required for reliable synaptic transmission at high frequency. Thus, while KCNQ channels are generally thought to prevent hyperactivity of neurons, we find that in axon terminals these channels function to facilitate reliable high-frequency synaptic signaling needed for sensory information processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The presynaptic spike results in calcium influx required for neurotransmitter release. For this reason, the spike waveform is crucial in determining the timing and strength of synaptic transmission. Auditory information is encoded by spikes phase locked to sound frequency at high rates. The calyx of Held nerve terminals in the auditory brainstem show minimum changes in spike waveform during high-frequency spike firing. We found that activation of KCNQ K<sup>+</sup> channel builds up during high-frequency firing and its activation helps to maintain a stable spike waveform and reliable synaptic transmission. While KCNQ channels are generally thought to prevent hyperexcitability of neurons, we find that in axon terminals these channels function to facilitate high-frequency synaptic signaling during auditory information processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Opioid-Induced Pronociceptive Signaling in the Gastrointestinal Tract Is Mediated by Delta-Opioid Receptor Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opioid tolerance (OT) leads to dose escalation and serious side effects, including opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). We sought to better understand the mechanisms underlying this event in the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic <I>in vivo</I> administration of morphine by intraperitoneal injection in male C57BL/6 mice evoked tolerance and evidence of OIH in an assay of colonic afferent nerve mechanosensitivity; this was inhibited by the -opioid receptor (DOPr) antagonist naltrindole when intraperitoneally injected in previous morphine administration. Patch-clamp studies of DRG neurons following overnight incubation with high concentrations of morphine, the &micro;-opioid receptors (MOPr) agonist [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>, N-Me-Phe<sup>4</sup>, Gly<sup>5</sup>-ol]-Enkephalin (DAMGO) or the DOPr agonist [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>, D-Leu<sup>5</sup>]-Enkephalin evoked hyperexcitability. The pronociceptive actions of these opioids were blocked by the DOPr antagonist SDM25N but not the MOPr antagonist D-Pen-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH<SUB>2</SUB>. The hyperexcitability induced by DAMGO was reversed after a 1 h washout, but reapplication of low concentrations of DAMGO or [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>, D-Leu<sup>5</sup>]-Enkephalin restored the hyperexcitability, an effect mediated by protein kinase C. DOPr-dependent DRG neuron hyperexcitability was blocked by the endocytosis inhibitor Pitstop 2, and the weakly internalizing DOPr agonist ARM390 did not cause hyperexcitability. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies in HEK cells showed no evidence of switching of G-protein signaling from G<SUB>i</SUB> to a G<SUB>s</SUB> pathway in response to either high concentrations or overnight incubation of opioids. Thus, chronic high-dose opioid exposure leads to opioid tolerance and features of OIH in the colon. This action is mediated by DOPr signaling and is dependent on receptor endocytosis and downstream protein kinase C signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioids are effective in the treatment of abdominal pain, but escalating doses can lead to opioid tolerance and potentially opioid-induced hyperalgesia. We found that -opioid receptor (DOPr) plays a central role in the development of opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia in colonic afferent nociceptors following prolonged exposure to high concentrations of MOPr or DOPr agonists. Furthermore, the role of DOPr was dependent on OPr internalization and activation of a protein kinase C signaling pathway. Thus, targeting DOPr or key components of the downstream signaling pathway could mitigate adverse side effects by opioids.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Non-Nuclear NF-{kappa}B Modulates Alcohol Sensitivity But Not Immunity</a></h4>

              
                <p>NF-B proteins are well known as transcription factors important in immune system activation. In this highly conserved role, they contribute to changes in behavior in response to infection and in response to a variety of other insults and experiences. In some mammalian neurons, NF-Bs can be found at the synapse and translocate to the nucleus to alter gene expression when activated by synaptic activity. Here, we demonstrate that, in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, NF-B action is important both inside and outside the nucleus and that the <I>Dif</I> gene has segregated nuclear and non-nuclear NF-B action into different protein isoforms. The DifA isoform is a canonical nuclear-acting NF-B protein that enters the nucleus and is important for combating infection. The DifB variant, but not the DifA variant, is found in the central nervous system (mushroom bodies and antennal lobes). DifB does not enter the nucleus and co-localizes with a synaptic protein. In males and females, a DifB mutant alters alcohol behavioral sensitivity without an obvious effect on combating infection, whereas a DifA mutant does not affect alcohol sensitivity but compromises the immune response. These data are evidence that the non-nuclear DifB variant contributes to alcohol behavioral sensitivity by a nongenomic mechanism that diverges from the NF-B transcriptional effects used in the peripheral immune system. Enrichment of DifB in brain regions rich in synapses and biochemical enrichment of DifB in the synaptoneurosome fraction indicates that the protein may act locally at the synapse.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> NF-Bs are transcription factors used by innate immune signaling pathways to protect against infection. Alcohol abuse also activates these pathways, which contributes to the addictive process and the health consequences associated with alcohol abuse. In the mammalian nervous system, NF-Bs localize to synapses, but it is axiomatic that they effect change by acting in the nucleus. However, for the Drosophila <I>Dif</I> gene, immune and neural function segregate into different protein isoforms. Whereas the nuclear isoform (DifA) activates immune genes in response to infection, the CNS isoform acts nongenomically to modulate alcohol sensitivity. Immunohistochemical and biochemical assays localize DifB to synapse-rich regions. Direct synaptic action would provide a novel and rapid way for NF-B signaling to modulate behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Formation of the Mouse Internal Capsule and Cerebral Peduncle: A Pioneering Role for Striatonigral Axons as Revealed in Isl1 Conditional Mutants</a></h4>

              
                <p>The projection neurons of the striatum, the principal nucleus of the basal ganglia, belong to one of the following two major pathways: the striatopallidal (indirect) pathway or the striatonigral (direct) pathway. Striatonigral axons project long distances and encounter ascending tracts (thalamocortical) while coursing alongside descending tracts (corticofugal) as they extend through the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle. These observations suggest that striatal circuitry may help to guide their trajectories. To investigate the developmental contributions of striatonigral axons to internal capsule formation, we have made use of <I>Sox8-EGFP</I> (striatal direct pathway) and <I>Fezf2-TdTomato</I> (corticofugal pathway) BAC transgenic reporter mice in combination with immunohistochemical markers to trace these axonal pathways throughout development. We show that striatonigral axons pioneer the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle and are temporally and spatially well positioned to provide guidance for corticofugal and thalamocortical axons. Using <I>Isl1</I> conditional knock-out (cKO) mice, which exhibit disrupted striatonigral axon outgrowth, we observe both corticofugal and thalamocortical axon defects with either ventral forebrain- or telencephalon-specific <I>Isl1</I> inactivation, despite Isl1 not being expressed in either cortical or thalamic projection neurons. Striatonigral axon defects can thus disrupt internal capsule formation. Our genome-wide transcriptomic analysis in <I>Isl1</I> cKOs reveals changes in gene expression relevant to cell adhesion, growth cone dynamics, and extracellular matrix composition, suggesting potential mechanisms by which the striatonigral pathway exerts this guidance role. Together, our data support a novel pioneering role for the striatal direct pathway in the correct assembly of the ascending and descending axon tracts within the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The basal ganglia are a group of subcortical nuclei with established roles in the coordination of voluntary motor programs, aspects of cognition, and the selection of appropriate social behaviors. Hence, disruptions in basal ganglia connectivity have been implicated in the motor, cognitive, and social dysfunction characterizing common neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder, and tic disorder. Here, we identified a novel role for the striatonigral (direct) pathway in pioneering the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle, and in guiding axons extending to and from the cortex. Our findings suggest that the abnormal development of basal ganglia circuits can drive secondary internal capsule defects and thereby may contribute to the pathology of these disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Computational Model of Direction Selectivity in Macaque V1 Cortex Based on Dynamic Differences between On and Off Pathways</a></h4>

              
                <p>This paper is about neural mechanisms of direction selectivity (DS) in macaque primary visual cortex, V1. We present data (on male macaque) showing strong DS in a majority of simple cells in V1 layer 4C&alpha;, the cortical layer that receives direct afferent input from the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Magnocellular LGN cells are not direction-selective. To understand the mechanisms of DS, we built a large-scale, recurrent model of spiking neurons called DSV1. Like its predecessors, DSV1 reproduces many visual response properties of V1 cells including orientation selectivity. Two important new features of DSV1 are (1) DS is initiated by small, consistent dynamic differences in the visual responses of OFF and ON Magnocellular LGN cells, and (2) DS in the responses of most model simple cells is increased over those of their feedforward inputs; this increase is achieved through dynamic interaction of feedforward and intracortical synaptic currents without the use of intracortical direction-specific connections. The DSV1 model emulates experimental data in the following ways: (1) most 4C&alpha; Simple cells were highly direction-selective but 4C&alpha; Complex cells were not; (2) the preferred directions of the model's direction-selective Simple cells were invariant with spatial and temporal frequency (TF); (3) the distribution of the preferred/opposite ratio across the model's population of cells was very close to that found in experiments. The strong quantitative agreement between DS in data and in model simulations suggests that the neural mechanisms of DS in DSV1 may be similar to those in the real visual cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motion perception is a vital part of our visual experience of the world. In monkeys, whose vision resembles that of humans, the neural computation of the direction of a moving target starts in the primary visual cortex, V1, in layer 4C&alpha; that receives input from the eye through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). How direction selectivity (DS) is generated in layer 4C&alpha; is an outstanding unsolved problem in theoretical neuroscience. In this paper, we offer a solution based on plausible biological mechanisms. We present a new large-scale circuit model in which DS originates from slightly different LGN ON/OFF response time-courses and is enhanced in cortex without the need for direction-specific intracortical connections. The model's DS is in quantitative agreement with experiments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Descending Axonal Projections from the Inferior Colliculus Target Nearly All Excitatory and Inhibitory Cell Types of the Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) integrates auditory nerve input with nonauditory sensory signals and is proposed to function in sound source localization and suppression of self-generated sounds. The DCN also integrates activity from descending auditory pathways, including a particularly large feedback projection from the inferior colliculus (IC), the main ascending target of the DCN. Understanding how these descending feedback signals are integrated into the DCN circuit and what role they play in hearing requires knowing the targeted DCN cell types and their postsynaptic responses. In order to explore these questions, neurons in the DCN that received descending synaptic input from the IC were labeled with a trans-synaptic viral approach in male and female mice, which allowed them to be targeted for whole-cell recording in acute brain slices. We tested their synaptic responses to optogenetic activation of the descending IC projection. Every cell type in the granule cell domain received monosynaptic, glutamatergic input from the IC, indicating that this region, considered an integrator of nonauditory sensory inputs, processes auditory input as well and may have complex and underappreciated roles in hearing. Additionally, we found that DCN cell types outside the granule cell regions also receive descending IC signals, including the principal projection neurons, as well as the neurons that inhibit them, leading to a circuit that may sharpen tuning through feedback excitation and lateral inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory processing starts in the cochlea and ascends through the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) to the inferior colliculus (IC) and beyond. Here, we investigated the feedback projection from IC to DCN, whose synaptic targets and roles in auditory processing are unclear. We found that all cell types in the granule cell regions, which process multisensory feedback, also process this descending auditory feedback. Surprisingly, all except one cell type in the entire DCN receive IC input. The IC-DCN projection may therefore modulate the multisensory pathway as well as sharpen tuning and gate auditory signals that are sent to downstream areas. This excitatory feedback loop from DCN to IC and back to DCN could underlie hyperexcitability in DCN, widely considered an etiology of tinnitus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dendritic Domain-Specific Sampling of Long-Range Axons Shapes Feedforward and Feedback Connectivity of L5 Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Feedforward and feedback pathways interact in specific dendritic domains to enable cognitive functions such as predictive processing and learning. Based on axonal projections, hierarchically lower areas are thought to form synapses primarily on dendrites in middle cortical layers, whereas higher-order areas are thought to target dendrites in layer 1 and in deep layers. However, the extent to which functional synapses form in regions of axodendritic overlap has not been extensively studied. Here, we use viral tracing in the secondary visual cortex of male mice to map brain-wide inputs to thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive map of input locations through subcellular optogenetic circuit mapping. We show that input pathways target distinct dendritic domains with far greater specificity than appears from their axonal branching, often deviating substantially from the canonical patterns. Common assumptions regarding the dendrite-level interaction of feedforward and feedback inputs may thus need revisiting.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Perception and learning depend on the ability of the brain to shape neuronal representations across all processing stages. Long-range connections across different hierarchical levels enable diverse sources of contextual information, such as predictions or motivational state, to modify feedforward signals. Assumptions regarding the organization of this hierarchical connectivity have not been extensively verified. Here, we assess the synaptic connectivity of brain-wide projections onto pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex of mice. Using trans-synaptic viral tracing and subcellular optogenetic circuit mapping, we show that functional synapses do not follow the consistent connectivity rule predicted by their axonal branching patterns. These findings highlight the diversity of computational strategies operating throughout cortical networks and may aid in building better artificial networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatic Depolarization Enhances Hippocampal CA1 Dendritic Spike Propagation and Distal Input-Driven Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptic inputs that target distal regions of neuronal dendrites can often generate local dendritic spikes that can amplify synaptic depolarization, induce synaptic plasticity, and enhance neuronal output. However, distal dendritic spikes are subject to significant attenuation by dendritic cable properties, and often produce only a weak subthreshold depolarization of the soma. Nonetheless, such spikes have been implicated in memory storage, sensory perception and place field formation. How can such a weak somatic response produce such powerful behavioral effects? Here, we use dual dendritic and somatic recordings in acute hippocampal slices of male mice to reveal that dendritic spike propagation, but not spike initiation, is strongly enhanced when the somatic resting potential is depolarized, likely as a result of increased inactivation of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. Somatic depolarization also facilitates the induction of a form of dendritic spike driven heterosynaptic plasticity that enhances memory specificity. Thus, the effect of somatic membrane depolarization to enhance dendritic spike propagation and long-term synaptic plasticity is likely to play an important role in hippocampal-dependent spatial representations as well as learning and memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons receive synaptic input along their dendrites but produce action potential (AP) output at their soma. Signals arriving at the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs) have little impact on the soma unless they combine to initiate a dendritic spike, which needs to propagate to the soma to trigger an AP. This study shows that small subthreshold depolarization of the soma powerfully enhances the propagation of dendritic spikes, through inactivation of dendritic A-type potassium channels. Enhanced dendritic spike propagation also markedly facilitates the induction of a form of plasticity driven by the distal synaptic inputs. Thus, small changes in somatic membrane potential, similar to those observed <I>in vivo</I>, act as a powerful gate of neuronal information transfer.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupted Choline Clearance and Sustained Acetylcholine Release In Vivo by a Common Choline Transporter Coding Variant Associated with Poor Attentional Control in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Transport of choline via the neuronal high-affinity choline transporter (CHT; <I>SLC5A7</I>) is essential for cholinergic terminals to synthesize and release acetylcholine (ACh). In humans, we previously demonstrated an association between a common CHT coding substitution (rs1013940; Ile89Val) and reduced attentional control as well as attenuated frontal cortex activation. Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to generate mice expressing the I89V substitution and assessed, <I>in vivo</I>, CHT-mediated choline transport, and ACh release. Relative to wild-type (WT) mice, CHT-mediated clearance of choline in male and female mice expressing one or two Val89 alleles was reduced by over 80% in cortex and over 50% in striatum. Choline clearance in CHT Val89 mice was further reduced by neuronal inactivation. Deficits in ACh release, 5 and 10 min after repeated depolarization at a low, behaviorally relevant frequency, support an attenuated reloading capacity of cholinergic neurons in mutant mice. The density of CHTs in total synaptosomal lysates and neuronal plasma-membrane-enriched fractions was not impacted by the Val89 variant, indicating a selective impact on CHT function. When challenged with a visual disruptor to reveal attentional control mechanisms, Val89 mice failed to adopt a more conservative response bias. Structural modeling revealed that Val89 may attenuate choline transport by altering conformational changes of CHT that support normal transport rates. Our findings support the view that diminished sustained cholinergic signaling capacity underlies perturbed attentional performance in individuals expressing CHT Val89. The CHT Val89 mouse serves as a valuable model to study heritable risk for cognitive disorders arising from cholinergic dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetylcholine (ACh) signaling depends on the functional capacity of the neuronal choline transporter (CHT). Previous research demonstrated that humans expressing the common CHT coding variant Val89 exhibit attentional vulnerabilities and attenuated fronto-cortical activation during attention. Here, we find that mice engineered to express the Val89 variant exhibit reduced CHT-mediated choline clearance and a diminished capacity to sustain ACh release. Additionally, Val89 mice lack cognitive flexibility in response to an attentional challenge. These findings provide a mechanistic and cognitive framework for interpreting the attentional phenotype associated with the human Val89 variant and establish a model that permits a more invasive interrogation of CNS effects as well as the development of therapeutic strategies for those, including Val89 carriers, with presynaptic cholinergic perturbations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altruism under Stress: Cortisol Negatively Predicts Charitable Giving and Neural Value Representations Depending on Mentalizing Capacity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Altruism, defined as costly other-regarding behavior, varies considerably across people and contexts. One prominent context in which people frequently must decide on how to socially act is under stress. How does stress affect altruistic decision-making and through which neurocognitive mechanisms? To address these questions, we assessed neural activity associated with charitable giving under stress. Human participants (males and females) completed a charitable donation task before and after they underwent either a psychosocial stressor or a control manipulation, while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. As the ability to infer other people's mental states (i.e., mentalizing) predicts prosocial giving and may be susceptible to stress, we examined whether stress effects on altruism depend on participants' general capacity to mentalize, as assessed in an independent task. Although our stress manipulation per se had no influence on charitable giving, increases in the stress hormone cortisol were associated with reductions in donations in participants with high mentalizing capacity, but not in low mentalizers. Multivariate neural response patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were less predictive of postmanipulation donations in high mentalizers with increased cortisol, indicating decreased value coding, and this effect mediated the (moderated) association between cortisol increases and reduced donations. Our findings provide novel insights into the modulation of altruistic decision-making by suggesting an impact of the stress hormone cortisol on mentalizing-related neurocognitive processes, which in turn results in decreased altruism. The DLPFC appears to play a key role in mediating this cortisol-related shift in altruism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Altruism is a fundamental building block of our society. Emerging evidence indicates a major role of acute stress and stress-related neuromodulators in social behavior and decision-making. How and through which mechanisms stress may impact altruism remains elusive. We observed that the stress hormone cortisol was linked to diminished altruistic behavior. This effect was mediated by reduced value representations in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and critically depended on the individual capacity to infer mental states of others. Our findings provide novel insights into the modulation of human altruism linked to stress-hormone dynamics and into the involved sociocognitive and neural mechanisms, with important implications for future developments of more targeted interventions for stress-related decrements in social behavior and social cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Age-Related Enhancements in Positive Emotionality across The Life Span: Structural Equation Modeling of Brain and Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is associated with a bias in attention and memories toward positive and away from negative emotional content. In addition, emotion regulation appears to improve with age, despite concomitant widespread cognitive decline coupled with gray matter volume loss in cortical and subcortical regions thought to subserve emotion regulation. Here, we address this emotion-aging paradox using the behavioral data of an emotion regulation task from a population-derived, male and female, human sample (CamCAN) and use structural equation modeling together with multivariate analysis of structural MRI images of the same sample to investigate brain&ndash;behavior relationships. In a series of measurement models, we show the relationship between age and emotionality is best explained by a four-factor model, compared with single and hierarchical factor models. These four latent factors are interpreted as Basal Negative Affect, Positive Reactivity, Negative Reactivity and Positive Regulation (upregulating positive emotion to negative content). Increasing age uniquely contributes to increased Basal Negative Affect, Positive Reactivity, and Positive Regulation, but not Negative Reactivity. Furthermore, we show gray matter volumes, namely in the bilateral frontal operculum, medial frontal gyrus, bilateral hippocampal complex, bilateral middle temporal gyri, and bilateral angular gyrus, are distinctly related to these four latent factors. Finally, we show that a subset of these brain&ndash;behavior relationships remain significant when accounting for age and demographic data. Our results support the notion of an age-related increase in positivity and are interpreted in the context of the socioemotional selectivity theory of improved emotion regulation in older age.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging is associated with a paradoxical increase in well-being and improved emotion regulation despite widespread cognitive decline and gray matter volume loss in neural regions that underlie emotion regulation. Using a population-derived sample, we test the theories behind this emotion/aging paradox with an emotion regulation task and structural MRI data. We report robust age-related increases in positivity across the life span and show structural neural integrity influences this relationship with increasing age. Several brain&ndash;behavior relationships remained unaffected by age and may represent empirically derived neural markers to explore the paradox of increased well-being in old age. The results support the predictions of socioemotional selectivity theory of improved emotion regulation in older age and challenge the amygdala-focused neural predictions of the aging brain model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Corticothalamic Circuit Trades off Speed for Safety during Decision-Making under Motivational Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decisions to act while pursuing goals in the presence of danger must be made quickly but safely. Premature decisions risk injury or death, whereas postponing decisions risk goal loss. Here we show how mice resolve these competing demands. Using microstructural behavioral analyses, we identified the spatiotemporal dynamics of approach&ndash;avoidance decisions under motivational conflict in male mice. Then we used cognitive modeling to show that these dynamics reflect the speeded decision-making mechanisms used by humans and nonhuman primates, with mice trading off decision speed for safety of choice when danger loomed. Using calcium imaging in paraventricular thalamus and optogenetic inhibition of the prelimbic cortex to paraventricular thalamus pathway, we show that this speed-safety trade off occurs because increases in paraventricular thalamus activity increase decision caution, thereby increasing approach&ndash;avoid decision times in the presence of danger. Our findings demonstrate that a discrete brain circuit involving the paraventricular thalamus and its prefrontal input adjusts decision caution during motivational conflict, trading off decision speed for decision safety when danger is close. We identify the corticothalamic pathway as central to cognitive control during decision-making under conflict.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Foraging animals balance the need to seek food and energy against the conflicting needs to avoid injury and predation. This competition is fundamental to survival but rarely has a stable, correct solution. Here we show that approach&ndash;avoid decisions under motivational conflict involve strategic adjustments in decision caution controlled via a top-down corticothalamic pathway from the prelimbic cortex to the paraventricular thalamus. We identify a novel corticothalamic mechanism for cognitive control that is applicable across a range of motivated behaviors and mark paraventricular thalamus and its prefrontal cortical input as targets to remediate the deficits in decision caution characteristic of unsafe and impulsive choices.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prefrontal Cortical Connectivity Mediates Locus Coeruleus Noradrenergic Regulation of Inhibitory Control in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Response inhibition is a core executive function enabling adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Human and animal models indicate that inhibitory control and control networks are modulated by noradrenaline, arising from the locus coeruleus. The integrity (i.e., cellular density) of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system can be estimated from magnetization transfer (MT)-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in view of neuromelanin present in noradrenergic neurons of older adults. Noradrenergic psychopharmacological studies indicate noradrenergic modulation of prefrontal and frontostriatal stopping-circuits in association with behavioral change. Here, we test the noradrenergic hypothesis of inhibitory control, in healthy adults. We predicted that locus coeruleus integrity is associated with age-adjusted variance in response inhibition, mediated by changes in connectivity between frontal inhibitory control regions. In a preregistered analysis, we used MT MRI images from <I>N</I> = 63 healthy humans aged above 50 years (of either sex) who performed a Stop-Signal Task (SST), with atlas-based measurement of locus coeruleus contrast. We confirm that better response inhibition is correlated with locus coeruleus integrity and stronger connectivity between presupplementary motor area (preSMA) and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), but not volumes of the prefrontal cortical regions. We confirmed a significant role of prefrontal connectivity in mediating the effect of individual differences in the locus coeruleus on behavior, where this effect was moderated by age, over and above adjustment for the mean effects of age. Our results support the hypothesis that in normal populations, as in clinical settings, the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system regulates inhibitory control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that the integrity of the locus coeruleus, the principal source of cortical noradrenaline, is related to the efficiency of response inhibition in healthy older adults. This effect is in part mediated by its effect on functional connectivity in a prefrontal cortical stopping-network. The behavioral effect, and its mediation by connectivity, are moderated by age. This supports the psychopharmacological and genetic evidence for the noradrenergic regulation of behavioral control, in a population-based normative cohort. Noradrenergic treatment strategies may be effective to improve behavioral control in impulsive clinical populations, but age, and locus coeruleus integrity, are likely to be important stratification factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Improved Sleep, Memory, and Cellular Pathological Features of Tauopathy, Including the NLRP3 Inflammasome, after Chronic Administration of Trazodone in rTg4510 Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several cellular pathways contribute to neurodegenerative tauopathy-related disorders. Microglial activation, a major component of neuroinflammation, is an early pathologic hallmark that correlates with cognitive decline, while the unfolded protein response (UPR) contributes to synaptic pathology. Sleep disturbances are prevalent in tauopathies and may also contribute to disease progression. Few studies have investigated whether manipulations of sleep influence cellular pathologic and behavioral features of tauopathy. We investigated whether trazodone, a licensed antidepressant with hypnotic efficacy in dementia, can reduce disease-related cellular pathways and improve memory and sleep in male rTg4510 mice with a tauopathy-like phenotype. In a 9 week dosing regimen, trazodone decreased microglial NLRP3 inflammasome expression and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase levels, which correlated with the NLRP3 inflammasome, the UPR effector ATF4, and total tau levels. Trazodone reduced theta oscillations during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and enhanced REM sleep duration. Olfactory memory transiently improved, and memory performance correlated with REM sleep duration and theta oscillations. These findings on the effects of trazodone on the NLRP3 inflammasome, the unfolded protein response and behavioral hallmarks of dementia warrant further studies on the therapeutic value of sleep-modulating compounds for tauopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dementia and associated behavioral symptoms such as memory loss and sleep disturbance are debilitating. Identifying treatments that alleviate symptoms and concurrently target cellular pathways contributing to disease progression is paramount for the patients and their caregivers. Here we show that a chronic treatment with trazodone, an antidepressant with positive effects on sleep, has beneficial effects on several cellular pathways contributing to neuroinflammation and tau pathology, in tauopathy-like rTg4510 mice. Trazodone also improved rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the slowing of brain oscillations, and olfactory memory disturbances, which are all early symptoms observed in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, trazodone and compounds with REM sleep-promoting properties may represent a promising treatment approach to reduce the early symptoms of tauopathy and slow down disease progression.</p>

                <p>by Saksham Phul, Georg Kuenze, Carlos G. Vanoye, Charles R. Sanders, Alfred L. George Jr., Jens Meiler</p>

Recent advances in experimental and computational protein structure determination have provided access to high-quality structures for most human proteins and mutants thereof. However, linking changes in structure in protein mutants to functional impact remains an active area of method development. If successful, such methods can ultimately assist physicians in taking appropriate treatment decisions. This work presents three artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive models that classify four key functional parameters of KCNQ1 variants as normal or dysfunctional using PSSM-based evolutionary and/or biophysical descriptors. Recent advances in predicting protein structure and variant properties with artificial intelligence (AI) rely heavily on the availability of evolutionary features and thus fail to directly assess the biophysical underpinnings of a change in structure and/or function. The central goal of this work was to develop an ANN model based on structure and physiochemical properties of KCNQ1 potassium channels that performs comparably or better than algorithms using only on PSSM-based evolutionary features. These biophysical features highlight the structure-function relationships that govern protein stability, function, and regulation. The input sensitivity algorithm incorporates the roles of hydrophobicity, polarizability, and functional densities on key functional parameters of the KCNQ1 channel. Inclusion of the biophysical features outperforms exclusive use of PSSM-based evolutionary features in predicting activation voltage dependence and deactivation time. As AI is increasing applied to problems in biology, biophysical understanding will be critical with respect to ‘explainable AI’, i.e., understanding the relation of sequence, structure, and function of proteins. Our model is available at www.kcnq1predict.org.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">BioCRNpyler: Compiling chemical reaction networks from biomolecular parts in diverse contexts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William Poole, Ayush Pandey, Andrey Shur, Zoltan A. Tuza, Richard M. Murray</p>

Biochemical interactions in systems and synthetic biology are often modeled with chemical reaction networks (CRNs). CRNs provide a principled modeling environment capable of expressing a huge range of biochemical processes. In this paper, we present a software toolbox, written in Python, that compiles high-level design specifications represented using a modular library of biochemical parts, mechanisms, and contexts to CRN implementations. This compilation process offers four advantages. First, the building of the actual CRN representation is automatic and outputs Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models compatible with numerous simulators. Second, a library of modular biochemical components allows for different architectures and implementations of biochemical circuits to be represented succinctly with design choices propagated throughout the underlying CRN automatically. This prevents the often occurring mismatch between high-level designs and model dynamics. Third, high-level design specification can be embedded into diverse biomolecular environments, such as cell-free extracts and <i>in vivo</i> milieus. Finally, our software toolbox has a parameter database, which allows users to rapidly prototype large models using very few parameters which can be customized later. By using BioCRNpyler, users ranging from expert modelers to novice script-writers can easily build, manage, and explore sophisticated biochemical models using diverse biochemical implementations, environments, and modeling assumptions.

Accurate discovery of somatic mutations in a cell is a challenge that partially lays in immaturity of dedicated analytical approaches. Approaches comparing a cell’s genome to a control bulk sample miss common mutations, while approaches to find such mutations from bulk suffer from low sensitivity. We developed a tool, All<sup>2</sup>, which enables accurate filtering of mutations in a cell without the need for data from bulk(s). It is based on pair-wise comparisons of all cells to each other where every call for base pair substitution and indel is classified as either a germline variant, mosaic mutation, or false positive. As All<sup>2</sup> allows for considering dropped-out regions, it is applicable to whole genome and exome analysis of cloned and amplified cells. By applying the approach to a variety of available data, we showed that its application reduces false positives, enables sensitive discovery of high frequency mutations, and is indispensable for conducting high resolution cell lineage tracing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale affinity maturation simulations to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV</a></h4>

The design of vaccines against highly mutable pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, requires a detailed understanding of how the adaptive immune system responds to encountering multiple variant antigens (Ags). Here, we describe a multiscale model of B cell receptor (BCR) affinity maturation that employs actual BCR nucleotide sequences and treats BCR/Ag interactions in atomistic detail. We apply the model to simulate the maturation of a broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) against HIV. Starting from a germline precursor sequence of the VRC01 anti-HIV Ab, we simulate BCR evolution in response to different vaccination protocols and different Ags, which were previously designed by us. The simulation results provide qualitative guidelines for future vaccine design and reveal unique insights into bnAb evolution against the CD4 binding site of HIV. Our model makes possible direct comparisons of simulated BCR populations with results of deep sequencing data, which will be explored in future applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Application of modular response analysis to medium- to large-size biological systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Meriem Mekedem, Patrice Ravel, Jacques Colinge</p>

The development of high-throughput genomic technologies associated with recent genetic perturbation techniques such as short hairpin RNA (shRNA), gene trapping, or gene editing (CRISPR/Cas9) has made it possible to obtain large perturbation data sets. These data sets are invaluable sources of information regarding the function of genes, and they offer unique opportunities to reverse engineer gene regulatory networks in specific cell types. Modular response analysis (MRA) is a well-accepted mathematical modeling method that is precisely aimed at such network inference tasks, but its use has been limited to rather small biological systems so far. In this study, we show that MRA can be employed on large systems with almost 1,000 network components. In particular, we show that MRA performance surpasses general-purpose mutual information-based algorithms. Part of these competitive results was obtained by the application of a novel heuristic that pruned MRA-inferred interactions <i>a posteriori</i>. We also exploited a block structure in MRA linear algebra to parallelize large system resolutions.

     alt="Altered basal ganglia infraslow oscillation and resting functional connectivity in complex regional pain syndrome"/>
<p>This study is the first systematic evaluation of functional connectivity of basal ganglia motor and non-motor territories in CRPS. In CRPS, there is increased ISOs and resting functional connectivity in motor but not in non-motor basal ganglia territories (except caudate body functional connectivity) compared to controls.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful condition commonly accompanied by movement disturbances and often affects the upper limbs. The basal ganglia motor loop is central to movement, however, non-motor basal ganglia loops are involved in pain, sensory integration, visual processing, cognition, and emotion. Systematic evaluation of each basal ganglia functional loop and its relation to motor and non-motor disturbances in CRPS has not been investigated. We recruited 15 upper limb CRPS and 45 matched healthy control subjects. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, infraslow oscillations (ISO) and resting-state functional connectivity in motor and non-motor basal ganglia loops were investigated using putamen and caudate seeds. Compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased ISO power in the putamen contralateral to the CRPS affected limb, specifically, in contralateral putamen areas representing the supplementary motor area hand, motor hand, and motor tongue. Furthermore, compared to controls, CRPS subjects displayed increased resting connectivity between these putaminal areas as well as from the caudate body to cortical areas such as the primary motor cortex, supplementary and cingulate motor areas, parietal association areas, and the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate changes in basal ganglia loop function in CRPS subjects and may underpin motor disturbances of CRPS.</p>

                The blood–brain barrier (BBB) continues to represent one of the most significant challenges for successful drug-based treatments of neurological disease. Mechanical modulation of the BBB using focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles (MBs) has shown considerable promise in enhancing the delivery of therapeutics to the brain, but questions remain regarding possible long-term effects of such forced disruption. This review examines the evidence for inflammation associated with ultrasound-induced BBB disruption and potential strategies for managing such inflammatory effects to improve both the efficacy and safety of therapeutic ultrasound in neurological applications.

                The peripheral autonomic nervous system (PANS) functions to maintain homeostasis of the internal body environment. Dysregulation of the PANS alters the functions of the cardiovascular, genito-urinary, skin, and gastrointestinal systems. Dysautonomia can occur independently or in coincidence with other diseases, such as synucleinopathies. Despite similar manifestations across many conditions, research points to a variety of pathophysiological mechanisms involving development, malfunction, and neurodegeneration.

                By combining virtual reality and two-photon calcium imaging, Priestley et. al. find pervasive signatures of rapid neural plasticity mechanisms in the mouse hippocampus during new experiences. Their study highlights a strong regulation of neural feature tuning in CA1 by novelty, which could contribute to quickly encoding new memories.

                Chong et al. show that intranasally-delivered murine IFN-λ2 protects mice against historical, B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts without excessive inflammation. In the lung, IFN-λ is produced mainly by epithelial cells and acts on stromal cells to protect against of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neocortical pyramidal neurons with axons emerging from dendrites are frequent in non-primates, but rare in monkey and human</a></h4>

              
                The canonical view of neuronal function is that inputs are received by dendrites and somata, become integrated in the somatodendritic compartment and upon reaching a sufficient threshold, generate axonal output with axons emerging from the cell body. The latter is not necessarily the case. Instead, axons may originate from dendrites. The terms 'axon carrying dendrite' (AcD) and 'AcD neurons' have been coined to describe this feature. In rodent hippocampus, AcD cells are shown to be functionally 'privileged', since inputs here can circumvent somatic integration and lead to immediate action potential initiation in the axon. Here, we report on the diversity of axon origins in neocortical pyramidal cells of rodent, ungulate, carnivore, and primate. Detection methods were Thy-1-EGFP labeling in mouse, retrograde biocytin tracing in rat, cat, ferret, and macaque, SMI-32/βIV-spectrin immunofluorescence in pig, cat, and macaque, and Golgi staining in macaque and human. We found that in non-primate mammals, 10-21% of pyramidal cells of layers II-VI had an AcD. In marked contrast, in macaque and human, this proportion was lower, and was particularly low for supragranular neurons. A comparison of six cortical areas (sensory, association, limbic) in three macaques yielded percentages of AcD cells which varied by a factor of 2 between the areas and between the individuals. Unexpectedly, pyramidal cells in the white matter of postnatal cat and aged human cortex exhibit AcDs to much higher percentages. In addition, interneurons assessed in developing cat and adult human cortex had AcDs at type-specific proportions and for some types at much higher percentages than pyramidal cells. Our findings expand the current knowledge regarding the distribution and proportion of AcD cells in neocortex of non-primate taxa, which strikingly differ from primates where these cells are mainly found in deeper layers and white matter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Macrophage inflammation resolution requires CPEB4-directed offsetting of mRNA degradation</a></h4>

              
                Chronic inflammation is a major cause of disease. Inflammation resolution is in part directed by the differential stability of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. In particular, tristetraprolin (TTP)-directed mRNA deadenylation destabilizes AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNAs. However, this mechanism alone cannot explain the variety of mRNA expression kinetics that are required to uncouple degradation of pro-inflammatory mRNAs from the sustained expression of anti-inflammatory mRNAs. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein CPEB4 acts in an opposing manner to TTP in macrophages: it helps to stabilize anti-inflammatory transcripts harboring cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) and AREs in their 3′-UTRs, and it is required for the resolution of the LPS-triggered inflammatory response. Coordination of CPEB4 and TTP activities is sequentially regulated through MAPK signaling. Accordingly, CPEB4 depletion in macrophages impairs inflammation resolution in an LPS-induced sepsis model. We propose that the counterbalancing actions of CPEB4 and TTP, as well as the distribution of CPEs and AREs in their target mRNAs, define transcript-specific decay patterns required for inflammation resolution. Thus, these two opposing mechanisms provide a fine-tuning control of inflammatory transcript destabilization while maintaining the expression of the negative feedback loops required for efficient inflammation resolution; disruption of this balance can lead to disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Computed tomographic analysis of the dental system of three Jurassic ceratopsians and implications for the evolution of tooth replacement pattern and diet in early-diverging ceratopsians</a></h4>

              
                The dental system of ceratopsids is among the most specialized structure in Dinosauria by the presence of tooth batteries and high-angled wear surfaces. However, the origin of this unique dental system is poorly understood due to a lack of relative knowledge in early-diverging ceratopsians. Here we study the dental system of three earliest-diverging Chinese ceratopsians: <i>Yinlong</i> and <i>Hualianceratops</i> from the early Late Jurassic of Xinjiang and <i>Chaoyangsaurus</i> from the Late Jurassic of Liaoning Province. By micro-computed tomographic analyses, our study has revealed significant new information regarding the dental system, including no more than five replacement teeth in each jaw quadrant; at most one replacement tooth in each alveolus; nearly full resorption of the functional tooth root; and occlusion with low-angled, concave wear facets. <i>Yinlong</i> displays an increase in the number of maxillary alveoli and a decrease in the number of replacement teeth during ontogeny as well as the retention of functional tooth remnants in the largest individual. <i>Chaoyangsaurus</i> and <i>Hualianceratops</i> have slightly more replacement teeth than <i>Yinlong</i>. In general, early-diverging ceratopsians display a relatively slow tooth replacement rate and likely use gastroliths to triturate foodstuffs. The difference in dietary strategy might have influenced the tooth replacement pattern in later-diverging ceratopsians.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular determinants of complexin clamping and activation function</a></h4>

              
                Previously we reported that Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin synergistically clamp the SNARE assembly process to generate and maintain a pool of docked vesicles that fuse rapidly and synchronously upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Ramakrishnan et al., 2020). Here, using the same in vitro single-vesicle fusion assay, we determine the molecular details of the Complexin-mediated fusion clamp and its role in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation. We find that a delay in fusion kinetics, likely imparted by Synaptotagmin-1, is needed for Complexin to block fusion. Systematic truncation/mutational analyses reveal that continuous alpha-helical accessory-central domains of Complexin are essential for its inhibitory function and specific interaction of the accessory helix with the SNAREpins enhances this functionality. The C-terminal domain promotes clamping by locally elevating Complexin concentration through interactions with the membrane. Independent of their clamping functions, the accessory-central helical domains of Complexin also contribute to rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-synchronized vesicle release by increasing the probability of fusion from the clamped state.

                Sensory systems reliably process incoming stimuli in spite of changes in context. Most recent models accredit this context invariance to an extraction of increasingly complex sensory features in hierarchical feedforward networks. Here, we study how context-invariant representations can be established by feedback rather than feedforward processing. We show that feedforward neural networks modulated by feedback can dynamically generate invariant sensory representations. The required feedback can be implemented as a slow and spatially diffuse gain modulation. The invariance is not present on the level of individual neurons, but emerges only on the population level. Mechanistically, the feedback modulation dynamically reorients the manifold of neural activity and thereby maintains an invariant neural subspace in spite of contextual variations. Our results highlight the importance of population-level analyses for understanding the role of feedback in flexible sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chemoreceptor co-expression in Drosophila melanogaster olfactory neurons</a></h4>

              
                <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> olfactory neurons have long been thought to express only one chemosensory receptor gene family. There are two main olfactory receptor gene families in <i>Drosophila</i>, the odorant receptors (ORs) and the ionotropic receptors (IRs). The dozens of odorant-binding receptors in each family require at least one co-receptor gene in order to function: <i>Orco</i> for ORs, and <i>Ir25a</i>, <i>Ir8a</i>, and <i>Ir76b</i> for IRs. Using a new genetic knock-in strategy, we targeted the four co-receptors representing the main chemosensory families in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<i>Orco, Ir8a, Ir76b, Ir25a</i>). Co-receptor knock-in expression patterns were verified as accurate representations of endogenous expression. We find extensive overlap in expression among the different co-receptors. As defined by innervation into antennal lobe glomeruli, <i>Ir25a</i> is broadly expressed in 88% of all olfactory sensory neuron classes and is co-expressed in 82% of Orco+ neuron classes, including all neuron classes in the maxillary palp. <i>Orco</i>, <i>Ir8a</i>, and <i>Ir76b</i> expression patterns are also more expansive than previously assumed. Single sensillum recordings from Orco-expressing <i>Ir25a</i> mutant antennal and palpal neurons identify changes in olfactory responses. We also find co-expression of <i>Orco</i> and <i>Ir25a</i> in <i>Drosophila sechellia</i> and <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i> olfactory neurons. These results suggest that co-expression of chemosensory receptors is common in insect olfactory neurons. Together, our data present the first comprehensive map of chemosensory co-receptor expression and reveal their unexpected widespread co-expression in the fly olfactory system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A-type FHFs mediate resurgent currents through TTX-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels</a></h4>

              
                Resurgent currents (<i>I</i><sub>NaR</sub>) produced by voltage-gated sodium channels are required for many neurons to maintain high-frequency firing, and contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and disease pathophysiology. Here we show, for the first time, that <i>I</i><sub>NaR</sub> can be reconstituted in a heterologous system by co-expression of sodium channel α-subunits and A-type fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs). Specifically, A-type FHFs induces <i>I</i><sub>NaR</sub> from Nav1.8, Nav1.9 tetrodotoxin-resistant neuronal channels and, to a lesser extent, neuronal Nav1.7 and cardiac Nav1.5 channels. Moreover, we identified the N-terminus of FHF as the critical molecule responsible for A-type FHFs-mediated <i>I</i><sub>NaR</sub>. Among the FHFs, FHF4A is the most important isoform for mediating Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 <i>I</i><sub>NaR</sub>. In nociceptive sensory neurons, FHF4A knockdown significantly reduces <i>I</i><sub>NaR</sub> amplitude and the percentage of neurons that generate <i>I</i><sub>NaR</sub>, substantially suppressing excitability. Thus, our work reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying TTX-resistant <i>I</i><sub>NaR</sub> generation and provides important potential targets for pain treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modelling the consequences of the dikaryotic life cycle of mushroom-forming fungi on genomic conflict</a></h4>

              
                Generally, sexual organisms contain two haploid genomes, one from each parent, united in a single diploid nucleus of the zygote which links their fate during growth. A fascinating exception to this are Basidiomycete fungi, where the two haploid genomes remain separate in a dikaryon, retaining the option to fertilize subsequent monokaryons encountered. How the ensuing nuclear competition influences the balance of selection within and between individuals is largely unexplored. We test the consequences of the dikaryotic lifecycle for mating success and mycelium-level fitness components. We assume a trade-off between mating fitness at the level of the haploid nucleus and fitness of the fungal mycelium. We show that the maintenance of fertilization potential by dikaryons leads to a higher proportion of fertilized monokaryons, but that the ensuing intra-dikaryon selection for increased nuclear mating fitness leads to reduced mycelium fitness relative to a diploid life cycle. However, this fitness reduction is lower compared to a hypothetical life cycle where dikaryons can also exchange nuclei. Prohibition of fusion between dikaryons therefore reduces the level of nuclear parasitism. The number of loci influencing fitness is an important determinant of the degree to which average mycelium-level fitness is reduced. The results of this study crucially hinge upon a trade-off between nucleus and mycelium-level fitness. We discuss the evidence for this assumption and the implications of an alternative that there is a positive relationship between nucleus and mycelium-level fitness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of anterior temporal lobe reduces distortions in memory from category knowledge</a></h4>

              
                Memory retrieval does not provide a perfect recapitulation of past events, but instead an imperfect reconstruction of event-specific details and general knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether this reconstruction relies on mixtures of signals from different memory systems, including one supporting general knowledge. Here, we investigate whether the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) distorts new memories due to prior category knowledge. In this experiment (N=36), participants encoded and retrieved image-location associations. Most images' locations were clustered according to their category, but some were in random locations. With this protocol, we previously demonstrated that randomly located images were retrieved closer to their category cluster relative to their encoded locations, suggesting an influence of category knowledge. We combined this procedure with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to the left ATL before retrieval. We separately examined event-specific details (error) and category knowledge (bias) to identify distinct signals attributable to different memory systems. We found that TMS to ATL attenuated bias in location memory, but only for atypical category members. The magnitude of error was not impacted, suggesting that a memory's fidelity can be decoupled from its distortion by category knowledge. This raises the intriguing possibility that retrieval is jointly supported by separable memory systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor outcomes congruent with intentions may sharpen metacognitive representations</a></h4>

              
                We can monitor our intentional movements, in order to describe how we move our bodies. But it is unclear which information this metacognitive monitoring relies on. For example, when throwing a ball to hit a target, we might use the visual information about how the ball flew to metacognitively assess our performance. Alternatively, we might disregard the ball trajectory - given that it is not directly relevant to our goal - and metacognitively assess our performance based solely on whether we reached the goal of hitting the target. In two experiments we aimed to distinguish between these two alternatives and asked whether the distal outcome of a goal-directed action (hitting or missing a target) informs the metacognitive representations of our own movements. Participants performed a semi-virtual task where they moved their arm to throw a virtual ball at a target. After each throw, participants discriminated which of two ball trajectories displayed on the screen corresponded to the flight path of their throw and then rated their confidence in this decision. The task included two conditions that differed on whether the distal outcome of the two trajectories shown matched (congruent) or differed (incongruent). Participants were significantly more accurate in discriminating between the two trajectories, and responded faster in the incongruent condition and, accordingly, were significantly more confident on these trials. Crucially, we found significant differences in metacognitive performance (measured as meta-d'/d') between the two conditions only on successful trials, where the virtual ball had hit the target. These results indicate that participants successfully incorporated information about the outcome of the movement into both their discrimination and confidence responses. However, information about the outcome selectively sharpened the precision of confidence ratings only when the outcome of their throw matched their intention. We argue that these findings underline the separation between the different levels of information that may contribute to body monitoring, and we provide evidence that intentions might play a central role in metacognitive motor representations.

                Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a highly heterogeneous demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that needs for reliable biomarkers to foresee disease severity. Previous retrospective investigations in the MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), highlighted the important relationship between monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and the experimented severity of the clinical course. In this work, we show for the first time cells resembling M-MDSCs associated to MS lesions, whose abundance was related to milder MS clinical courses. Moreover, Ly-6Chi cells (which are indistinguishable from circulating M-MDSCs in mice) are useful biomarkers to predict a milder severity of the EAE disease course and a lesser tissue damage extent. Finally, the abundance of M-MDSCs in blood from untreated MS patients at their first relapse was inversely correlated with EDSS at baseline and relapse recovery one-year later. In summary, our data point to M-MDSC load as a promising biomarker of clinical course severity.

                The cholinergic interneurons (ChATs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have a critical role in the activity of this region, specifically in the context of major depressive disorder. To understand the circuitry regulating this behavior we sought to determine the areas that directly project to these cells/interneurons by utilizing the monosynaptic cell-specific tracing technique. Mapping showed monosynaptic projections that are exclusive to NAc ChATs. To determine if some of these projections are altered in a depression mouse model, we used mice that do not express the calcium binding protein p11 specifically in ChATs (ChAT-p11 cKO) and display a depressive-like phenotype. Our data demonstrated that while the overall projection areas remain similar between wild type and in ChAT-p11 cKO mice, the number of projections coming from the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) is significantly reduced in the ChAT-p11 cKO mice. Furthermore, using optogenetics and electrophysiology we showed that glutamatergic projections from vHIP to NAc ChATs are severely altered in mutant mice. These results show that specific alterations in the circuitry of the accumbal ChAT interneurons could play an important role in the regulation of depressive-like behavior, reward seeking behavior in addictions, or psychiatric symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vision-dependent and -independent molecular maturation of mouse retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                The development and connectivity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the retina's sole output neurons, are patterned by activity-independent transcriptional programs and activity-dependent remodeling. To inventory the molecular correlates of these influences, we applied high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to mouse RGCs at six embryonic and postnatal ages. We identified temporally regulated modules of genes that correlate with, and likely regulate, multiple phases of RGC development, ranging from differentiation and axon guidance to synaptic recognition and refinement. Some of these genes are expressed broadly while others, including key transcription factors and recognition molecules, are selectively expressed by one or a few of the 45 transcriptomically distinct types defined previously in adult mice. Next, we used these results as a foundation to analyze the transcriptomes of RGCs in mice lacking visual experience due to dark rearing from birth or to mutations that ablate either bipolar or photoreceptor cells. 98.5 percent of visually deprived (VD) RGCs could be unequivocally assigned to a single RGC type based on their transcriptional profiles, demonstrating that visual activity is dispensable for acquisition and maintenance of RGC type identity. However, visual deprivation significantly reduced the transcriptomic distinctions among RGC types, implying that activity is required for complete RGC maturation or maintenance. Consistent with this notion, transcriptomic alternations in VD RGCs significantly overlapped with gene modules found in developing RGCs. Our results provide a resource for mechanistic analyses of RGC differentiation and maturation, and for investigating the role of activity in these processes.

                Multiple large-scale networks populate human association cortex. Here we explored the functional properties of these networks by exploiting trial-to-trial variation in component processing demands. In two behavioral studies (N=136 and N=238), participants quantified strategies used to solve individual task trials that spanned remembering, imagining future scenarios, and various control trials. These trials were also all scanned in an independent sample of functional MRI participants (N=10), each with sufficient data to precisely define within-individual networks. Stable latent factors varied across trials and correlated with trial-level functional responses selectively across networks. One network linked to parahippocampal cortex, labeled Default Network A (DN-A), tracked scene construction, including for control trials that possessed minimal episodic memory demands. To the degree a trial encouraged participants to construct a mental scene with vivid imagery and awareness about spatial locations of objects or places, the response in DN-A increased. The juxtaposed Default Network B (DN-B) showed no such response but varied in relation to social processing demands. Another adjacent network, labeled Frontoparietal Network B (FPN-B), robustly correlated with trial difficulty. These results support that DN-A and DN-B are specialized networks differentially supporting information processing within spatial and social domains. Both networks are dissociable from a closely juxtaposed domain-general control network that tracks cognitive effort.

                In humans and non-human primates (NHPs), motion and stereopsis are processed within fine-scale cortical sites, including V2 thick stripes and their extensions into areas V3 and V3A that are believed to be under the influence of magnocellular stream. However, in both species, the functional organization (overlapping vs. interdigitated) of these sites remains unclear. Using high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI), we found evidence for two interdigitated channels within human extrastriate areas that contribute to processing motion and stereopsis. Across multiple experiments that included different stimuli (random dots, gratings, and natural scenes), the functional selectivity of these channels for motion vs. stereopsis remained consistent. Furthermore, an analysis of resting state functional connectivity revealed stronger functional connectivity within the two channels rather than between them. This finding provides a new perspective toward the mesoscale organization of the magnocellular stream within the human extrastriate visual cortex, beyond our previous understanding based on animal models.

                Cell-cell interactions in the central nervous system (CNS) are based on the release of molecules mediating signal exchange and providing structural and trophic support through vesicular exocytosis and the formation of extracellular vesicles (EVs). The specific mechanisms employed by each cell type in the brain are incompletely understood. Here, we explored the means of communication used by Muller cells, a type of glial cells in the retina, which forms part of the CNS. Using immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, and molecular analyses, we provide evidence for the release of distinct EVs from highly specialized domains of Muller cells in retinae from adult mice in vivo. We identify VAMP5 as a Muller cell-specific SNARE component that is part of EVs and responsive to ischemia, and we reveal differences between the secretomes of affinity-purified Muller cells and neurons in vitro. Our findings suggest EV-based communication as an important mediator of cellular interactions in the retina.

                Surviving in an uncertain environment requires not only the ability to select the best action, but also the flexibility to withhold inappropriate actions when the environmental conditions change. Although selecting and withholding actions have been extensively studied in both human and animals, there is still lack of consensus on the mechanism underlying these action regulation functions, and more importantly, how they inter-relate. A critical gap impeding progress is the lack of a computational theory that will integrate the mechanisms of action regulation into a unified framework. The current study aims to advance our understanding by developing a neurodynamical computational theory that models the mechanism of action regulation that involves suppressing responses, and predicts how disruption of this mechanism can lead to motor deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We tested the model predictions in neurotypical individuals and PD patients in three behavioral tasks that involve free action selection between two opposed directions, action selection in the presence of conflicting information and abandoning an ongoing action when a stop signal is presented. Our results and theory suggest an integrated mechanism of action regulation that affects both action initiation and inhibition. When this mechanism is disrupted, motor behavior is affected, leading to longer reaction times and higher error rates in action inhibition.

                Activation of chemokine IP10, also named as CXCL10, and its receptor CXCR3 in CNS is described in some neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous study has also demonstrated an increased brain IP10 levels in several scrapie infected rodent models. However, the detailed alteration of IP10/CXCR3 signaling in CNS during prion infection remains unsettled. Here, we found the increased IP10 signals in the brains of scrapie infected mice mainly localized in the neurons and the activated microglia using various methodologies. The levels of CXCR3 were markedly increased in brains of the scrapie infected mice and in the prion infected cell line SMB-S15. The increased CXCR3 mainly distributed in neurons. Obviously morphological colocalizations of PrP/PrPSc with IP10 and CXCR3 in the brains of scrapie infected mice were observed in the assays of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence. Additionally, IHC analysis with whole brain sections demonstrated that the increased IP10 and CXCR3 accumulated in the brain regions with more PrPSc deposits. Co-immunoprecipitation and biomolecular interaction assays identified the evidence for the molecular interactions of PrP with IP10 and CXCR3. Compared to the normal partner cell line SMB-PS, the more portion of IP10 accumulated insides of prion infected SMB-S15 cells. Removal of prion replication in SMB-S15 cells by resveratrol converted the pattern of the accumulation and secretion of cellular IP10. Our data here demonstrate an activation of IP10/CXCR3 signaling in the brain tissues of prion infection, highly coincidental with PrPSc deposit. Modulation of brain IP10/CXCR3 signaling is potential therapeutic target for reducing the progression of prion diseases.

                Prions cause infectious and fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals. Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a prion disease of cervids, spreads efficiently among wild and farmed animals. Potential transmission to humans of CWD is a growing concern due to its increasing prevalence. Here, we provide the strongest evidence to date supporting the zoonotic potential of CWD prions, and their probable materialization in humans using mice expressing human prion protein (PrP) as an infection model. Inoculation of these mice with deer CWD isolates resulted in atypical clinical manifestations, with prion seeding activity and efficient transmissible infectivity in the brain and, remarkably, in feces. Intriguingly, the protease-resistant PrP in the brain resembled that found in a familial human prion disease and was transmissible upon second passage. Our results are the first evidence that CWD can infect humans with a distinctive clinical presentation, signature, and tropism, and might be transmissible between humans while current diagnostic assays might fail to detect it. These findings have major implications for public health and CWD management.

                Neural activity in the cortex is highly variable in response to repeated stimuli. Population recordings across the cortex demonstrate that the variability of neuronal responses is shared among large groups of neurons and concentrates in a low dimensional space. However, the source of the population-wide shared variability is unknown. In this work, we analyzed the dynamical regimes of spatially distributed networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We found chaotic spatiotemporal dynamics in networks with similar excitatory and inhibitory projection widths, an anatomical feature of the cortex. The chaotic solutions contain broadband frequency power in rate variability and have distance-dependent and low-dimensional correlations, in agreement with experimental findings. In addition, rate chaos can be induced by globally correlated noisy inputs. These results suggest that spatiotemporal chaos in cortical networks can explain the shared variability observed in neuronal population responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prolonged dexamethasone exposure enhances zebrafish lateral-line regeneration but disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and hair cell function</a></h4>

              
                The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone is commonly used to treat inner ear disorders. Previous work in larval zebrafish has shown that dexamethasone treatment enhances hair cell regeneration, yet dexamethasone has also been shown to inhibit regeneration of peripheral nerves after lesion. We therefore used the zebrafish model to determine the impact of dexamethasone treatment on lateral-line hair cells and primary afferents. To explore dexamethasone in the context of regeneration, we used copper sulfate (CuSO4) to induce hair cell loss and retraction of nerve terminals, and then allowed animals to recover in dexamethasone for 48 hours. Consistent with previously work, we observed significantly more regenerated hair cells in dexamethasone-treated larvae. Importantly, we found that the afferent processes beneath neuromasts also regenerated in the presence of dexamethasone and formed an appropriate number of synapses, indicating that innervation of hair cells was not inhibited by dexamethasone. In addition to regeneration, we also explored the effects of prolonged dexamethasone exposure on lateral-line homeostasis and function. Following dexamethasone treatment, we observed more negatively charged mitochondrial membrane potentials ({Delta}{Psi}m) in neuromast hair cells and supporting cells. Hair cells exposed to dexamethasone were also more vulnerable to neomycin-induced cell death. In response to a fluid-jet delivered saturating stimulus, calcium influx through hair cell mechanotransduction channels was significantly reduced, yet presynaptic calcium influx was unchanged. Cumulatively, these observations indicate that dexamethasone enhances hair cell regeneration in lateral-line neuromasts, yet also disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis, making hair cells more vulnerable to ototoxic insults and possibly impacting hair cell function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglial inflammatory activation paradoxically improves glucose tolerance during diet-induced obesity</a></h4>

              
                Hypothalamic gliosis associated with high fat diet (HFD) feeding increases susceptibility to hyperphagia and weight gain, and is therefore presumed to promote obesity-associated consequences such as glucose intolerance as well. Nevertheless, the body weight-independent contribution of microglial activation to glucose regulation has not been determined. Here we show that reducing microglial NF-{kappa}B signaling via cell-specific IKK{beta} deletion exacerbates HFD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance despite reducing body weight and adiposity. This effect was associated with reduced activity of hypothalamic glucose sensing neurons. Conversely, a genetic approach to increase microglial inflammatory activity improved glucose tolerance independently of diet in lean rodents. To avoid confounding effects due to chronic alterations to microglial signaling pathways from dietary or genetic interventions, we developed an inducible model of microglial activation using DREADD-based chemogenetics. Gq-coupled GPCR activation rapidly increased microglial calcium levels, cytokine gene expression, and morphological hallmarks of inflammatory activation. In both lean and obese rodents, chemogenetic microglial activation caused a marked improvement in glucose tolerance along with increased activation of hypothalamic glucose sensing neurons, effects abrogated by central blockade of TNF signaling. Thus, while diet-induced microglial activation promotes weight gain, it may also serve an adaptive function--to prevent the deterioration of glucose tolerance associated with obesity, an important consideration for immune-modulating metabolic therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical facilitation of somatosensory inputs using gravity-related tactile information in patients with bilateral vestibular loss</a></h4>

              
                A few years after their bilateral vestibular loss, individuals usually show a motor repertoire that is almost back to normal. This recovery is thought to involve an up-regulation of the visual and proprioceptive information that compensates for the lack of vestibular information. Here, we investigated whether plantar tactile inputs, which provide body information relative to the ground and to the Earth-vertical, contribute to this compensation. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that somatosensory cortex response to electric stimulation of the plantar sole in standing adults will be greater in patients (n = 10) with bilateral vestibular loss than in an aged-matched healthy group (n = 10). Showing significant greater somatosensory evoked potentials (i.e., P1N1) in patients than in controls, the electroencephalographic recordings supported this hypothesis. Furthermore, we found evidence that increasing the differential pressure between both feet, by adding a 1 kg mass at each pending wrist, enhanced the internal representation of body orientation and motion relative to a gravitational reference frame. The large decreased in alpha/beta power in the right posterior parietal cortex (and not in the left) is in line with this assumption. Finally, our behavioral analyses showed smaller body sway oscillations for patients, likely originated from a tactile-based control strategy. Conversely, healthy subjects showed smaller head oscillations suggesting a vestibular-based control strategy, the head serving as a reference for balance control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Restriction of dietary fat, but not carbohydrate, alters brain reward circuitry in adults with obesity</a></h4>

              
                Weight loss diets often restrict either fat or carbohydrate, macronutrients that are sensed via distinct gut-brain pathways and differentially affect peripheral hormones and metabolism. To investigate whether reductions in dietary fat versus carbohydrate alter brain reward circuitry, we measured dopamine D2/3 receptor binding potential (D2BP) using PET and neural activity in response to visual food cues using fMRI in 17 inpatient adults with obesity during a eucaloric baseline diet and on the fifth day of isocaloric diets selectively reduced in either dietary fat or carbohydrate, in random order. Reduction of dietary fat, but not carbohydrate, decreased D2BP and decreased neural activity to food cues in brain reward regions. After the reduced fat diet, ad libitum intake shifted towards foods high in both fat and carbohydrates. These results suggest that dietary fat restriction increases tonic dopamine in brain reward regions thereby affecting food choice in ways that may hamper diet adherence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">C. elegans Sine oculis/SIX-type homeobox genes act as homeotic switches to define neuronal subtype identities</a></h4>

              
                The classification of neurons into distinct types reveals hierarchical taxonomic relationships that reflect the extent of similarity between neuronal cell types. At the base of such taxonomies are neuronal cells that are very similar to one another but differ in a small number of reproducible and select features. How are very similar members of a neuron class that share many features instructed to diversify into distinct subclasses? We show here that the six very similar members of the C. elegans IL2 sensory neuron class, which are all specified by a homeobox terminal selector, unc-86/BRN3A/B, differentiate into two subtly distinct subclasses, a dorsoventral subclass and a lateral subclass, by the toggle switch-like action of the SIX/Sine-oculis homeobox gene unc-39. unc-39 is expressed only in the lateral IL2 neurons and loss of unc-39 leads to a homeotic transformation of the lateral into the dorsoventral class; conversely, ectopic unc-39 expression converts the dorsoventral subclass into the lateral subclass. Hence, a terminal selector homeobox gene controls both class-, as well as subclass-specific features, while a subordinate homeobox gene determines the ability of the class-specific homeobox gene to activate subtype-specific target genes. We find a similar regulatory mechanism to operate in a distinct class of six motor neurons. Our findings underscore the importance of homeobox genes in neuronal identity control and invite speculations about homeotic identity transformations as potential drivers of evolutionary novelty during cell type evolution in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Language and the cerebellum: structural connectivity to the eloquent brain</a></h4>

              
                Much remains to be learned about the role(s) of the cerebellum in the neurobiology of language. Contemporary models have focused extensively on the left-hemisphere perisylvian cortex with the assumption that the cerebellum supports more peri-linguistic cognitive processes (e.g., verbal working memory). The goal of this study was to map the structural connectivity profile of domain-specific language regions of interest (ROIs) implicated in semantics, phonology, and syntax relative to connectivity for working memory. Functional imaging data and diffusion-weighted imaging data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) were analyzed. We found that (a) working memory, motor activity, and language comprehension activated partially overlapping but mostly unique regions of the cerebellum; (b) the linguistic portion of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit was more extensive than the linguistic portion of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar tract; (c) there was a frontal-lobe bias in the connectivity from the cerebellum to the cerebrum; (d) there was some degree of specificity; and (e) for some of the cerebellar tracts, individual differences in picture identification ability correlated with variation in fractional anisotropy. These findings yield insights into the structural connectivity of the cerebellum as it relates to language comprehension - an ability that is unique to humans.

	<p>The cerebellum has a homogeneous structure and performs different computational functions such as modulation/coordination of the communication between cerebral regions, and regulation/integration of sensory information. Albeit cerebellar activity is generally associated with motor functions, several recent studies link it to various cognitive functions, including spatial navigation. In addition, cerebellar activity plays a modulatory role in different cognitive domains and brain processes. Depending on the network involved, cerebellar damage results in specific functional alterations, even when no function loss might be detected. In the present review, we discuss evidence of brainstem degeneration and of a substantial reduction of neurons in nuclei connected to the inferior olivary nucleus in the early stages of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Based on the rich patterns of afferences from the inferior olive nucleus to the cerebellum, we argue that the subtle alterations in spatial navigation described in the early stages of dementia stem from alterations of the neuromodulatory functions of the cerebellum.</p>

	<p>Although pontine infarction is the most common subtype of posterior circulation stroke, there has been little research focusing on recurrent pontine infarction. Our study aimed to investigate the factors associated with site and mechanism of recurrent pontine infarction. Patients with acute isolated pontine infarction were enrolled and followed up for one year. Lesion topography was determined by diffusion-weighted imaging. Mechanisms were determined based on lesion topography and other vascular, cardiologic and laboratory results. A total of 562 patients with pontine infarction were included, with 67 patients experiencing recurrence during the follow-up period. Forty-one recurrences occurred at the same site as index pontine infarction (41/67, 61.2%). Results indicated that the mechanism of index pontine infarction was significantly associated with the recurrent sites (p = 0.041, OR 2.938, 95% CI 1.044&amp;amp;ndash;8.268), and also with the mechanisms of recurrence (p = 0.004, OR 6.056, 95% CI 1.774&amp;amp;ndash;20.679). Branch atheromatous disease-induced index pontine infarction was likely to recur at the same site and with the same mechanism. Moreover, if recurrence occurred at the same site, the mechanism was probably the same as that of the index stroke (p = 0.000). Our study may help physicians treat patients with pontine infarction by predicting the site and mechanism of recurrence.</p>

	<p>Due to its safety, portability, and cheapness, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) use largely increased in research and clinical settings. Despite tDCS&amp;amp;rsquo;s wide application, previous works pointed out inconsistent and low replicable results, sometimes leading to extreme conclusions about tDCS&amp;amp;rsquo;s ineffectiveness in modulating behavioral performance across cognitive domains. Traditionally, this variability has been linked to significant differences in the stimulation protocols across studies, including stimulation parameters, target regions, and electrodes montage. Here, we reviewed and discussed evidence of heterogeneity emerging at the intra-study level, namely inter-individual differences that may influence the response to tDCS within each study. This source of variability has been largely neglected by literature, being results mainly analyzed at the group level. Previous research, however, highlighted that only a half&amp;amp;mdash;or less&amp;amp;mdash;of studies&amp;amp;rsquo; participants could be classified as responders, being affected by tDCS in the expected direction. Stable and variable inter-individual differences, such as morphological and genetic features vs. hormonal/exogenous substance consumption, partially account for this heterogeneity. Moreover, variability comes from experiments&amp;amp;rsquo; contextual elements, such as participants&amp;amp;rsquo; engagement/baseline capacity and individual task difficulty. We concluded that increasing knowledge on inter-dividual differences rather than undermining tDCS effectiveness could enhance protocols&amp;amp;rsquo; efficiency and reproducibility.</p>

	<p>Hypnosis is a commonly used therapy option in dentistry and medicine for fear and pain reduction. Nevertheless, it is viewed very critically, as there is still insufficient evidence for a treatment effect. Specific phobia of dental treatment and dental anxiety are prevalent conditions that can cause an oral health impairment. This paper critically reviews 19 clinical trials aimed at reducing dental anxiety and fear avoidance in adults, published in peer-reviewed journals between 1979 and 2021. The search identified 257 papers; 223 were selected after removing duplicates. A total of 188 articles were excluded after title and abstract evaluation; 35 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Another 10 papers were discharged after full text evaluation, as these were case reports and questionnaires. Six papers were discharged due to the lack of a comparable scale to measure dental anxiety. The following treatment techniques were reviewed: various forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation training, benzodiazepine premedication, self-hypnosis by audio therapy, hypnotherapy, hypnosis, and nitrous oxide sedation. CBT delivered in a variety of formats, including one-session treatment, showed the most evidence for the efficacy of reducing anxiety. A wide heterogeneity of methods allowed only the inclusion of five studies to the performed meta-analysis, showing contrasting results for the application of hypnosis. The main reason for this issue is the great variety in methods used, making a distinct assessment of hypnotic interventions difficult. However, the results of the systematic review are promising in that hypnosis can also be regarded as powerful and successful method for anxiety reduction, while there are also studies with a small or even slightly negative effect. Therefore, further research is needed. Within the limitations of the current study, a more consistent use of methods to examine anxiety for hypnosis research is recommended.</p>

	<p>Background: The retina and brain share similar neuronal and microvascular features. We aimed to investigate the retinal thickness and microvasculature in patients with thalamic infarcts compared with control participants. Material and methods: Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) was used to image the macular thickness (retinal nerve fiber layer, RNFL; ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, GCIP), while OCT angiography was used to image the microvasculature (superficial vascular plexus, SVP; intermediate capillary plexus, ICP; deep capillary plexus, DCP). Inbuilt software was used to measure the macular thickness (&amp;amp;micro;m) and microvascular density (%). Lesion volumes were quantitively assessed based on structural magnetic resonance images. Results: A total of 35 patients with unilateral thalamic infarction and 31 age&amp;amp;ndash;sex-matched controls were enrolled. Compared with control participants, thalamic infarction patients showed a significantly thinner thickness of RNFL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and GCIP (p = 0.02), and a lower density of SVP (p = 0.001) and ICP (p = 0.022). In the group of patients, ipsilateral eyes showed significant reductions in SVP (p = 0.033), RNFL (p = 0.01) and GCIP (p = 0.043). When divided into three groups based on disease duration (&amp;amp;lt;1 month, 1&amp;amp;ndash;6 months, and &amp;amp;gt;6 months), no significant differences were found among these groups. After adjusting for confounders, SVP, ICP, DCP, RNFL, and GCIP were significantly correlated with lesion volume in patients. Conclusions: Thalamic infarction patients showed significant macular structure and microvasculature changes. Lesion size was significantly correlated with these alterations. These findings may be useful for further research into the clinical utility of retinal imaging in stroke patients, especially those with damage to the visual pathway.</p>

	<p>A spinal artery aneurysm originating from the branch of the extracranial vertebral artery is uncommon. Most of them were finally diagnosed due to the evidence of infratentorial or spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Herein, we report an extremely rare case of a ruptured spinal artery aneurysm which predominantly presented with supratentorial SAH. A 68-year-old woman was initially revealed cranial computed tomographic angiographically negative SAH with a Hunt-Hess grade of 3, while the digital subtraction angiography confirmed an isolated radiculomedullary aneurysm arising from the medial ascending branch of V2 segment at C2 level. The patient underwent surgery in a hybrid operating room. She was originally attempted with coil embolization, but successful clipping of the aneurysm was achieved through unilateral laminectomy at last. Regrettably, the current case suffered a poor clinical outcome due to the complications caused by progressive cerebral vasospasm. In summary, angiogram is of great value for this rare kind of aneurysmal definitive diagnosis. A hybrid operating room may be a feasible choice for the ruptured spinal artery aneurysm.</p>

                <p>We sought to determine whether racial and socio-economic disparities in the utilization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) have improved over time. We examined DBS utilization and analyzed factors associated with placement of DBS. The odds of DBS placement increased across the study period while White PD patients were 5 times more likely than Black patients to undergo DBS. Individuals, regardless of racial background, with two or more comorbidities were 14 times less likely to undergo DBS. Privately insured patients were 1.6 times more likely to undergo DBS. Despite increasing DBS utilization, significant disparities persist in access to DBS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Context-Specificity of Locomotor Learning Is Developed during Childhood</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Humans can perform complex movements with speed and agility in the face of constantly changing task demands. To accomplish this, motor plans are adapted to account for errors in our movements because of changes in our body (e.g., growth or injury) or in the environment (e.g., walking on sand vs ice). It has been suggested that adaptation that occurs in response to changes in the state of our body will generalize across different movement contexts and environments, whereas adaptation that occurs with alterations in the external environment will be context-specific. Here, we asked whether the ability to form generalizable versus context-specific motor memories develops during childhood. We performed a cross-sectional study of context-specific locomotor adaptation in 35 children (3&ndash;18 years old) and 7 adults (19&ndash;31 years old). Subjects first adapted their gait and learned a new walking pattern on a split-belt treadmill, which has two belts that move each leg at a different speed. Then, subjects walked overground to assess the generalization of the adapted walking pattern across different environments. Our results show that the generalization of treadmill after-effects to overground walking decreases as subjects&rsquo; age increases, indicating that age and experience are critical factors regulating the specificity of motor learning. Our results suggest that although basic locomotor patterns are established by two years of age, brain networks required for context-specific locomotor learning are still being developed throughout youth.</p>

New additions of vertebrate specimens to natural history collections are declining in the midst of widespread and accelerating environmental change. Reversing these trends in collecting efforts is essential for addressing future unforeseen ecological issues.

The growth of natural history collections is declining. We need to reverse this decline to effectively facilitate the discovery of new knowledge and inform future societies about their past.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Longitudinal deep sequencing informs vector selection and future deployment strategies for transmissible vaccines</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Megan E. Griffiths, Alice Broos, Laura M. Bergner, Diana K. Meza, Nicolas M. Suarez, Ana da Silva Filipe, Carlos Tello, Daniel J. Becker, Daniel G. Streicker</p>

Vaccination is a powerful tool in combating infectious diseases of humans and companion animals. In most wildlife, including reservoirs of emerging human diseases, achieving sufficient vaccine coverage to mitigate disease burdens remains logistically unattainable. Virally vectored “transmissible” vaccines that deliberately spread among hosts are a potentially transformative, but still theoretical, solution to the challenge of immunising inaccessible wildlife. Progress towards real-world application is frustrated by the absence of frameworks to guide vector selection and vaccine deployment prior to major in vitro and in vivo investments in vaccine engineering and testing. Here, we performed deep sequencing on field-collected samples of <i>Desmodus rotundus</i> betaherpesvirus (DrBHV), a candidate vector for a transmissible vaccine targeting vampire bat–transmitted rabies. We discovered 11 strains of DrBHV that varied in prevalence and geographic distribution across Peru. The phylogeographic structure of DrBHV strains was predictable from both host genetics and landscape topology, informing long-term DrBHV-vectored vaccine deployment strategies and identifying geographic areas for field trials where vaccine spread would be naturally contained. Multistrain infections were observed in 79% of infected bats. Resampling of marked individuals over 4 years showed within-host persistence kinetics characteristic of latency and reactivation, properties that might boost individual immunity and lead to sporadic vaccine transmission over the lifetime of the host. Further, strain acquisitions by already infected individuals implied that preexisting immunity and strain competition are unlikely to inhibit vaccine spread. Our results support the development of a transmissible vaccine targeting a major source of human and animal rabies in Latin America and show how genomics can enlighten vector selection and deployment strategies for transmissible vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Effect of imaging markers on reperfusion therapy in basilar artery occlusion</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of endovascular therapy (EVT) versus intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO), based on the information of advanced imaging.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data of stroke patients with radiologically confirmed BAO within 24 hours. BAO were categorized into “top-of-the-basilar” syndrome (TOBS) and other types. An initial infarct size of &lt;70 ml, and a ratio of ischemic tissue to infarct volume of ≥1.8 was defined as “target mismatch”. The primary outcome was a good outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–3 at 3 months. Propensity score adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity score methods were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 474 BAO patients, 93 (19.6%) were treated with IVT prior to EVT, 91 (19.2%) were treated with IVT alone, 95 (20.0%) were treated with EVT alone, and 195 (41.1%) were treated with antithrombotic therapy. In IPTW analyses, we found no benefit of EVT superior to IVT for good outcome in either TOBS patients (odds ratio = 1.08, 95% CI 0.88–1.31), nor in those with other types (odds ratio = 1.13, 95% CI 0.94–1.36). However, in patients with other types, if there existed a target mismatch, EVT was independently related to good outcome (odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI 1.17–1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The “target mismatch profile” seems to be a possible candidate selection standard of EVT for those with other type of BAO. Future studies should separate TOBS from other type of BAO, and try to use advanced imaging.</p>

                <p>Nodding syndrome (NS) is a poorly understood form of childhood-onset epilepsy that is characterized by the pathognomonic ictal phenomenon of repetitive vertical head drops. To evaluate the underlying ictal neurophysiology, ictal EEG features were evaluated in nine participants with confirmed NS from South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda and ictal presence of high frequency gamma oscillations on scalp EEG were assessed. Ictal EEG during the head nodding episode predominantly showed generalized slow waves or sharp-and-slow wave complexes followed by electrodecrement. Augmentation of gamma activity (30- 70 Hz) was seen during the head nodding episode in all the participants. We confirm that head nodding episodes in persons with NS from the three geographically distinct regions in sub-Saharan Africa share the common features of slow waves with electrodecrement and superimposed gamma activity.</p>

To validate this, Matsumura et al. arrest Cry oscillation and find that the circadian clock remains functional independent of cell-autonomous Cry and Per oscillation, probably because of cell-autonomous circadian rhythms in the half-life of Per2.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">ILC precursors differentiate into metabolically distinct ILC1-like cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection</a></h4>

              
                In this study, Corral et al. demonstrate that the inflammatory and metabolic environments shape the fate of lung ILC precursors expressing IL-18Rα. During Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, lung ILC precursors differentiate into IFN-γ, producing ILC1-like cells. ILC1-like cells display the protective capacity to control the mycobacterial infection.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Inflammation induces pro-NETotic neutrophils via TNFR2 signaling</a></h4>

              
                Neuenfeldt et al. show that neutrophil priming induces dichotomous expression of CCR5. TNFR2 signaling increases ELANE expression in CCR5+ neutrophils. CCR5 triggering or reverse signaling of membrane-bound TNF activates ELANE, leading to enhanced NETosis. Pro-NETotic CCR5+ neutrophils in the lamina propria of ulcerative colitis patients may affect the success of anti-TNF therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Treg tissue stability depends on lymphotoxin beta-receptor- and adenosine-receptor-driven lymphatic endothelial cell responses</a></h4>

              
                Saxena et al. show that, to prolong allograft survival, Treg transendothelial migration across LECs is required and involves Treg lymphotoxin (LT) ⍺β and LEC LTβR signaling. Disrupting LT signaling converts Tregs to non-suppressive Foxp3loCD25lo exTregs via LTβR-NF-κB-driven IL-6 secretion by LECs. Adenosine-A2AR signaling in LEC promotes Treg stability.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Human IL-10-producing B cells have diverse states that are induced from multiple B cell subsets</a></h4>

              
                Through multiplexed screening of activating conditions and time points, Glass et al. find that human IL-10+ B cells lack a unifying cellular phenotype and frequently co-express pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mass-cytometry analyses reveal the breadth of phenotypic and polyfunctional profiles of IL-10+ B cells and their associations with liver-allograft operational tolerance.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Oncogenic Vav1-Myo1f induces therapeutically targetable macrophage-rich tumor microenvironment in peripheral T cell lymphoma</a></h4>

              
                Cortes et al. show that expression of Vav1-Myo1f, a recurrent peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL)-associated VAV1 fusion, induces CD4+ T cell lymphoma with features analogous to high-risk GATA3+ human PTCL. Expression of Vav1-Myo1f induces recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages to the tumor microenvironment that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention in PTCL.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A single-cell atlas of diffuse large B cell lymphoma</a></h4>

              
                Using single-cell RNA sequencing, Ye et al. demonstrate that genetic diversity within tumors, potential interactions between malignant and tumor-infiltrating cells, and viral infections may all contribute to the marked disease heterogeneity in DLBCL.
