">Human Substantia Nigra Neurons Encode Reward Expectations</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) signals originating from substantia nigra (SN) neurons are centrally involved in the regulation of motor and reward processing. DA signals behaviorally relevant events where reward outcomes differ from expectations (reward prediction errors, RPEs). RPEs play a crucial role in learning optimal courses of action and in determining response vigor when an agent expects rewards. Nevertheless, how reward expectations, crucial for RPE calculations, are conveyed to and represented in the dopaminergic system is not fully understood, especially in the human brain where the activity of DA neurons is difficult to study. One possibility, suggested by evidence from animal models, is that DA neurons explicitly encode reward expectations. Alternatively, they may receive RPE information directly from upstream brain regions. To address whether SN neuron activity directly reflects reward expectation information, we directly examined the encoding of reward expectation signals in human putative DA neurons by performing single-unit recordings from the SN of patients undergoing neurosurgery. Patients played a two-armed bandit decision-making task in which they attempted to maximize reward. We show that neuronal firing rates (FR) of putative DA neurons during the reward expectation period explicitly encode reward expectations. First, activity in these neurons was modulated by previous trial outcomes, such that FR were greater after positive outcomes than after neutral or negative outcome trials. Second, this increase in FR was associated with shorter reaction times, consistent with an invigorating effect of DA neuron activity during expectation. These results suggest that human DA neurons explicitly encode reward expectations, providing a neurophysiological substrate for a signal critical for reward learning.

	<p>Exploring the spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for interpreting dementia and related cognitive decline. Spatiotemporal patterns of EEG can be described through microstate analysis, which provides a discrete approximation of the continuous electric field patterns generated by the brain cortex. Here, we propose a novel microstate spatiotemporal dynamic indicator, termed the microstate sequence non-randomness index (MSNRI). The essence of the method lies in initially generating a sequence of microstate transition patterns through state space compression of EEG data using microstate analysis. Following this, we assess the non-randomness of these microstate patterns using information-based similarity analysis. The results suggest that this MSNRI metric is a potential marker for distinguishing between health control (HC) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (HC vs. FTD: 6.958 vs. 5.756, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), as well as between HC and populations with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) (HC vs. AD: 6.958 vs. 5.462, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Healthy individuals exhibit more complex macroscopic structures and non-random spatiotemporal patterns of microstates, whereas dementia disorders lead to more random spatiotemporal patterns. Additionally, we extend the proposed method by integrating the Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) method to explore spatiotemporal dynamic patterns of microstates at specific frequency scales. Moreover, we assessed the effectiveness of this innovative method in predicting cognitive scores. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of CEEMD-enhanced microstate dynamic indicators significantly improved the prediction accuracy of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (R2 = 0.940). The CEEMD-enhanced MSNRI method not only aids in the exploration of large-scale neural changes in populations with dementia but also offers a robust tool for characterizing the dynamics of EEG microstate transitions and their impact on cognitive function.</p>

	<p>Background: The COVID-19 pandemic increased symptoms of stress and anxiety and induced changes in sleep quality, dream activity, and parasomnia episodes. It has been shown that stressful factors and/or bad sleep habits can affect parasomnia behaviors. However, investigations on how COVID-19 has affected sleep, dreams, and episode frequency in parasomnias are rare. The current study focuses on the impact of the pandemic on a specific parasomnia characterized by speech production (sleep talking, ST). Methods: We selected 27 participants with frequent ST episodes (STs) during the pandemic and compared them with 27 participants with frequent STs from a previous study conducted during a pre-pandemic period. All participants performed home monitoring through sleep logs and recorded their nocturnal STs for one week. Results: We observed a higher frequency of STs in the pandemic group. Moreover, STs were related to the emotional intensity of dreams, independent of the pandemic condition. The pandemic was associated with lower bizarreness of dreams in the pandemic group. There were no differences in sleep variables between the two groups. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest a stressful effect of COVID-19 on the frequency of STs. Both the pandemic and the frequency of STs affect qualitative characteristics of dreams in this population.</p>

                <p>Both the retina and brain exhibit neurovascular coupling, increased blood flow during increased neural activity. In the retina increased blood flow can be evoked by flickering light, but the magnitude of the metabolic change that underlies this is not known. Local changes in oxygen consumption (QO<SUB>2</SUB>) are difficult to measure in vivo when both supply and demand are changing. Here we isolated the C57BL/6J mouse retina and supplied it with oxygen from both sides of the tissue. Microelectrode recordings of PO<SUB>2</SUB> were made in darkness and during 20&nbsp;s of high scotopic flickering light at 1&nbsp;Hz. Flicker led to a PO<SUB>2</SUB> increase in the outer retina and a decrease in the inner retina, indicating that outer retinal QO<SUB>2</SUB> (QOR) decreased and inner retinal QO<SUB>2</SUB> (QIR) increased. A four-layer oxygen diffusion model was fitted to PO<SUB>2</SUB> values obtained in darkness and at the end of flicker to determine the values of QOR and QIR. QOR in flicker was 76 &plusmn; 14% (mean and SD, <I>n</I> = 10) of QOR in darkness. The increase in QIR was smaller, 6.4 &plusmn; 5.0%. These metabolic changes are likely smaller than the maximum changes, because with no regeneration of pigment in the isolated retina, we limited the illumination. Further modeling indicated that at high illumination, QIR could increase by up to 45%, which is comparable to the magnitude of flow changes. This suggests that the blood flow increase is at least roughly matched to the increased metabolic demands of activity in the retina.</p>

                Background The aim of this study was to observe and analyze vascular function in ‘prolonged sitting’, followed by a yoga asana routine and pranayama intervention. Participants in this study include those who work from desks in offices. The study required the participants to attend on three separate days at random, and they had to finish a computerized test on each day. On the first day, participants were required to complete a computer test while sitting still for four hours (with the exception of washroom breaks). The next day, they underwent a computerized test along with a pranayama intervention. Finally, on the last day, they underwent a computerized test along with a yoga asana intervention. At the start of the study and after two and four hours, we measured the diameter and velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Methods The study was a within-subjects prospective single-center trial conducted in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India, between September 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to do one of the following ‘activities’ over successive weeks: Week 1 – Prolonged sitting; Week 2 – Pranayama intervention; and Week 3 – Yoga asana intervention during prolonged sitting. The baseline and follow-up variables of pulse velocity, endothelial thickness, and shear rate were assessed for normality through a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Results Our sample included 11 participants with moderate physical activity, five with high physical activity and one with low physical activity. Yoga asana intervention comprised participants sitting continuously for four hours, with a yoga asana intervention being provided every hour, lasting for 10 minutes. Conclusions Yoga asana improves vascular functions in prolonged sitting conditions. This routine can promote the concept of interrupted sitting and ways to reduce it with efficient yoga asana practice without changing the work culture and provide better physical relief.

                Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), a serious clinical challenge caused by incomplete abortion in female, calls for efficient and minimally invasive therapies to treat symptoms and protect reproductive health. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has been discovered as a viable therapeutic strategy to treat DUB following an incomplete abortion. The existing information and clinical experience of UAE for this particular indication were thoroughly reviewed. A female’s quality of life may be negatively affected by incomplete abortion, which is defined as residual fetal tissue inside the uterine cavity. This frequently results in heavy and continuous uterine bleeding. Medical procedures and traditional management techniques such as dilatation and curettage (D&C) do not always produce the desired effects or might have inherent dangers. UAE, a less invasive technique first developed for treating uterine fibroids, has shown promise as a substitute solution for DUB caused by an incomplete abortion.

The heterogeneity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) poses a barrier to effective treatment. Stratifying highly heterogeneous HCC into molecular subtypes with similar features is crucial for personalized anti-tumor therapies. Although driver genes play pivotal roles in cancer progression, their potential in HCC subtyping has been largely overlooked. This study aims to utilize driver genes to construct HCC subtype models and unravel their molecular mechanisms. Utilizing a novel computational framework, we expanded the initially identified 96 driver genes to 1192 based on mutational aspects and an additional 233 considering driver dysregulation. These genes were subsequently employed as stratification markers for further analyses. A novel multi-omics subtype classification algorithm was developed, leveraging mutation and expression data of the identified stratification genes. This algorithm successfully categorized HCC into two distinct subtypes, CLASS A and CLASS B, demonstrating significant differences in survival outcomes. Integrating multi-omics and single-cell data unveiled substantial distinctions between these subtypes regarding transcriptomics, mutations, copy number variations, and epigenomics. Moreover, our prognostic model exhibited excellent predictive performance in training and external validation cohorts. Finally, a 10-gene classification model for these subtypes identified <i>TTK</i> as a promising therapeutic target with robust classification capabilities. This comprehensive study provides a novel perspective on HCC stratification, offering crucial insights for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis and the development of promising treatment strategies.

                <p>by Cristina Sáez, Israel Pagán</p>

All plant viruses were thought to encode in its genome a movement protein that acts as a “passport,” allowing active movement within the host. A new study in PLOS Biology characterizes the first plant virus that can colonize its host without encoding this protein.

                Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a prominent cause of illness and mortality worldwide, with a significant amount of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries performed each year. It is a complicated technique that results in several clinical and functional issues. While CABG is an effective treatment, it comes with clinical and functional challenges, including reduced lung volume, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure, and thoracic mobility after surgery. Incisional pain has been associated with a decline in postoperative lung function; however, this resolves a month following surgery. There is no documented association between respiratory muscle strength and lung function after heart surgery. The POWERbreathe Medic Plus is intended for patients who have extremely weak breathing muscles as a result of illness, hospitalization, or existing respiratory health disorders such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. To address these challenges, a study will investigate the efficacy of the POWERbreathe Medic Plus device in improving maximal inspiratory pressure, functional capacity, and quality of life in CABG patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-471/v1?src=rss">Towards a quality indicator for research data publications and research software publications – a vision from the Helmholtz Association [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Research data and software are widely accepted as an outcome of scientific work. However, in comparison to text-based publications, there is not yet an established process to assess and evaluate quality of research data and research software publications. This paper presents an attempt to fill this gap. Initiated by the Working Group Open Science of the Helmholtz Association, the Task Group Helmholtz Quality Indicators for Data and Software Publications currently develops a quality indicator for research data and research software publications to be used within the Association. This report summarizes the vision of the group of what all contributes to such an indicator. The proposed approach relies on generic well-established concepts for quality criteria, such as the FAIR Principles and the COBIT Maturity Model. It does – on purpose – not limit itself to technical implementation possibilities to avoid using an existing metric for a new purpose. The intention of this paper is to share the current state for further discussion with all stakeholders, particularly with other groups also working on similar metrics but also with entities that use the metrics.

                Margalit et al. develop a topographic artificial neural network that predicts both functional responses and spatial organization of multiple cortical areas of the primate visual system. In turn, the model minimizes between-area wiring length and produces more brain-like responses to visual stimuli than spatially unconstrained alternative models.

                Shrestha et al. demonstrate that JAK1 is a key signaling mediator of cytokines that promote mutant KRAS-induced pancreatic cancer initiation and progression. They provide experimental evidence that deficiency in JAK1 prevents tumor formation, and they identified C/EBPδ as a critical downstream effector of the pro-tumorigenic functions of JAK1/STAT signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90749">Txnip deletions and missense alleles prolong the survival of cones in a retinitis pigmentosa mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal disease in which there is a loss of cone-mediated daylight vision. As there are &gt;100 disease genes, our goal is to preserve cone vision in a disease gene-agnostic manner. Previously we showed that overexpressing TXNIP, an α-arrestin protein, prolonged cone vision in RP mouse models, using an AAV to express it only in cones. Here, we expressed different alleles of <i>Txnip</i> in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), a support layer for cones. Our goal was to learn more of TXNIP’s structure-function relationships for cone survival, as well as determine the optimal cell type expression pattern for cone survival. The C-terminal half of TXNIP was found to be sufficient to remove GLUT1 from the cell surface, and improved RP cone survival, when expressed in the RPE, but not in cones. Knock-down of HSP90AB1, a TXNIP-interactor which regulates metabolism, improved the survival of cones alone and was additive for cone survival when combined with TXNIP. From these and other results, it is likely that TXNIP interacts with several proteins in the RPE to indirectly support cone survival, with some of these interactions different from those that lead to cone survival when expressed only in cones.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89948">Coupling and uncoupling of midline morphogenesis and cell flow in amniote gastrulation</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale cell flow characterizes gastrulation in animal development. In amniote gastrulation, particularly in avian gastrula, a bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow, called ‘polonaise movements’, appears along the midline. Here, through experimental manipulations, we addressed relationships between the polonaise movements and morphogenesis of the primitive streak, the earliest midline structure in amniotes. Suppression of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway maintains the polonaise movements along a deformed primitive streak. Mitotic arrest leads to diminished extension and development of the primitive streak and maintains the early phase of the polonaise movements. Ectopically induced Vg1, an axis-inducing morphogen, generates the polonaise movements, aligned to the induced midline, but disturbs the stereotypical cell flow pattern at the authentic midline. Despite the altered cell flow, induction and extension of the primitive streak are preserved along both authentic and induced midlines. Finally, we show that ectopic axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, is capable of initiating the polonaise movements without concomitant PS extension under mitotic arrest conditions. These results are consistent with a model wherein primitive streak morphogenesis is required for the maintenance of the polonaise movements, but the polonaise movements are not necessarily responsible for primitive streak morphogenesis. Our data describe a previously undefined relationship between the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in gastrulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94653">Knockdown of PHOX2B in the retrotrapezoid nucleus reduces the central CO2 chemoreflex in rats</a></h4>

              
                PHOX2B is a transcription factor essential for the development of different classes of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. Heterozygous mutations in the PHOX2B coding region are responsible for the occurrence of Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare neurological disorder characterised by inadequate chemosensitivity and life-threatening sleep-related hypoventilation. Animal studies suggest that chemoreflex defects are caused in part by the improper development or function of PHOX2B expressing neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a central hub for CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitivity. Although the function of PHOX2B in rodents during development is well established, its role in the adult respiratory network remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether reduction in PHOX2B expression in chemosensitive neuromedin-B (NMB) expressing neurons in the RTN altered respiratory function. Four weeks following local RTN injection of a lentiviral vector expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting <i>Phox2b</i> mRNA, a reduction of PHOX2B expression was observed in <i>Nmb</i> neurons compared to both naive rats and rats injected with the non-target shRNA. PHOX2B knockdown did not affect breathing in room air or under hypoxia, but ventilation was significantly impaired during hypercapnia. PHOX2B knockdown did not alter <i>Nmb</i> expression but it was associated with reduced expression of both <i>Task2</i> and <i>Gpr4</i>, two CO<sub>2</sub>/pH sensors in the RTN. We conclude that PHOX2B in the adult brain has an important role in CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreception and reduced PHOX2B expression in CCHS beyond the developmental period may contribute to the impaired central chemoreflex function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92083">Dynamic modes of Notch transcription hubs conferring memory and stochastic activation revealed by live imaging the co-activator Mastermind</a></h4>

              
                Developmental programming involves the accurate conversion of signalling levels and dynamics to transcriptional outputs. The transcriptional relay in the Notch pathway relies on nuclear complexes containing the co-activator Mastermind (Mam). By tracking these complexes in real time, we reveal that they promote the formation of a dynamic transcription hub in Notch ON nuclei which concentrates key factors including the Mediator CDK module. The composition of the hub is labile and persists after Notch withdrawal conferring a memory that enables rapid reformation. Surprisingly, only a third of Notch ON hubs progress to a state with nascent transcription, which correlates with polymerase II and core Mediator recruitment. This probability is increased by a second signal. The discovery that target-gene transcription is probabilistic has far-reaching implications because it implies that stochastic differences in Notch pathway output can arise downstream of receptor activation.

                Neuropeptides are ancient signaling molecules in animals but only few peptide receptors are known outside bilaterians. Cnidarians possess a large number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) – the most common receptors of bilaterian neuropeptides – but most of these remain orphan with no known ligands. We searched for neuropeptides in the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i> and created a library of 64 peptides derived from 33 precursors. In a large-scale pharmacological screen with these peptides and 161 <i>N. vectensis</i> GPCRs, we identified 31 receptors specifically activated by 1 to 3 of 14 peptides. Mapping GPCR and neuropeptide expression to single-cell sequencing data revealed how cnidarian tissues are extensively connected by multilayer peptidergic networks. Phylogenetic analysis identified no direct orthology to bilaterian peptidergic systems and supports the independent expansion of neuropeptide signaling in cnidarians from a few ancestral peptide-receptor pairs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88212">Parallel processing of quickly and slowly mobilized reserve vesicles in hippocampal synapses</a></h4>

              
                Vesicles within presynaptic terminals are thought to be segregated into a variety of readily releasable and reserve pools. The nature of the pools and trafficking between them is not well understood, but pools that are slow to mobilize when synapses are active are often assumed to feed pools that are mobilized more quickly, in a series. However, electrophysiological studies of synaptic transmission have suggested instead a parallel organization where vesicles within slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools would separately feed independent reluctant- and fast-releasing subdivisions of the readily releasable pool. Here, we use FM-dyes to confirm the existence of multiple reserve pools at hippocampal synapses and a parallel organization that prevents intermixing between the pools, even when stimulation is intense enough to drive exocytosis at the maximum rate. The experiments additionally demonstrate extensive heterogeneity among synapses in the relative sizes of the slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools, which suggests equivalent heterogeneity in the numbers of reluctant and fast-releasing readily releasable vesicles that may be relevant for understanding information processing and storage.

                Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the Huntingtin protein (Htt). While symptoms, primarily characterized by progressive deterioration of the striatum and motor and cognitive functions, typically manifest in adulthood, recent studies have also highlighted developmental defects in HD. Indeed, alterations in cortical and striatal development have been observed in individuals carrying the mutation as early as in embryonic stages. However, despite the striatum being one of the most affected regions in HD, few studies have investigated potential developmental alterations in this structure, especially in the early weeks after birth. To address this question, we compared striatal development between wild-type (WT) mice and two murine models of HD, R6/1 and CAG140 mice crossed with reporter mice to identify D1- and D2-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1- and D2-MSNs). Using ex vivo electrophysiology and neuronal reconstruction, we observed that the maturation of electrical properties was selectively disrupted in D2-MSNs of the matrix compartment of HD mice during the first post-natal days. D2-MSNs arbor also an increased dendritic complexity. When studying the establishment of striatal afferents, we observed that cortico-striatal glutamatergic transmission was specifically reduced in D2-MSNs during the second postnatal week. All these alterations were transient before the circuit normalized on its own after the second postnatal week. These anatomical and electrophysiological data highlight the significant impact of the Htt mutation on numerous striatal development processes during the postnatal period. Interestingly, we observed that these alterations specifically affect MSNs in the indirect pathway. This preferential vulnerability aligns with the early death of these neurons in adulthood, suggesting that early treatment of these alterations could potentially modify the disease's progression.

">Sex-dependent effects of early life stress on network and behavioral states.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with numerous detriments in health, including increased vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses. Early life stress (ELS) in rodents has been shown to effectively model several of the behavioral and endocrine impacts of ACEs and has been utilized to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to disease. However, the precise neural mechanisms responsible for mediating the impact of ELS on vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses remain largely unknown. Methods: We use behavior, immunoassay, in vivo LFP recording, histology, and patch clamp to describe the effects of ELS on stress behaviors, endocrinology, network states, protein expression, and cellular physiology in male and female mice. Results: We demonstrate that a murine maternal separation (MS) ELS model causes sex-dependent alterations in behavioral and hormonal responses following an acute stressor. Local field potential (LFP) recordings in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and frontal cortex (FC) reveal similar sex-dependent alterations at baseline, in response to acute ethological stress, and during fear memory extinction, supporting a large body of literature demonstrating that these network states contribute to stress reactivity and vulnerability to psychiatric illnesses. Sex differences were accompanied by altered physiology of BLA principal neurons in males and BLA PV interneurons in females. Conclusions: Collectively, these results implicate novel, sex-dependent mechanisms through which ACEs may impact psychiatric health, involving altered cellular physiology and network states involved in emotional processing.

">"What" and "when" predictions jointly modulate speech processing</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior rests on forming predictions based on previous statistical regularities encountered in the environment. Such regularities pertain not only to the contents of the stimuli ("what") but also their timing ("when"), and both interactively modulate sensory processing. In speech streams, predictions can be formed at multiple hierarchical levels, both in terms of contents (e.g. single syllables vs. words) and timing (e.g., faster vs. slower time scales). Whether and how these hierarchies map onto each other in terms of integrating "what" and "when" predictions remains unknown. Under one hypothesis neural hierarchies may link "what" and "when" predictions within sensory processing areas: with lower cortical regions mediating interactions for smaller units e.g., syllables, and higher cortical areas mediating interactions for larger units e.g., words. Alternatively, interactions between "what" and "when" predictions might rest on a generic, sensory-independent mechanism, mediated by common attention-related (e.g., frontoparietal) networks. To address those questions, we manipulated "what" and "when" predictions at two levels - single syllables and disyllabic pseudowords - while recording neural activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy volunteers (N=22). We studied how syllable and/or word deviants are modulated by "when" predictability, both analyzing event-related fields and using source reconstruction and dynamic causal modeling to explain the observed effects in terms of the underlying effective connectivity. "When" predictions modulated "what" mismatch responses in a specific way with regards to speech hierarchy, such that mismatch responses to deviant words (vs. syllables) were amplified by temporal predictions at a slower (vs. faster) time scale. However, these modulations were source-localized to a shared network of cortical regions, including frontal and parietal sources. Effective connectivity analysis showed that, while mismatch responses to violations of "what" predictions modulated connectivity between regions, the integration of "what" and "when" predictions selectively modulated connectivity within regions, consistent with gain effects. These results suggest that the brain integrates "what" and "when" predictions that are congruent with respect to their hierarchical level, but this integration is mediated by a shared and distributed cortical network. This contrasts with recent studies indicating separable networks for different levels of hierarchical speech processing.

">Near infrared fluorescent nanosensors for high spatiotemporal oxytocin imaging</a></h4>

              
                Oxytocin is a neuropeptide thought to play a central role in regulating social and emotional behavior. Current techniques for neuropeptide imaging are generally limited in spatial and temporal resolution, real-time imaging capacity, selectivity for oxytocin over vasopressin, and application in young and non-model organisms. To avoid the use of endogenous oxytocin receptors for oxytocin probe development, we employed a protocol to evolve purely synthetic molecular recognition on the surface of near-infrared fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This probe reversibly undergoes up to a 172% fluorescence increase in response to oxytocin with a Kd of 4.93 uM. Furthermore, this probe responds selectively to oxytocin over oxytocin analogs, receptor agonists and antagonists, and most other neurochemicals. Lastly, we show our probe can image synaptic evoked oxytocin release in live mouse brain slices. Optical probes with the specificity and resolution requisite to image endogenous oxytocin signaling can advance the study of oxytocin neurotransmission for its role in both health and disease.

">Depression in Parkinson's disease is associated with dopamine unresponsive reduced reward sensitivity during effort-based decision making</a></h4>

              
                Willingness to exert effort for a given goal is dependent on the magnitude of the potential rewards and effort costs of an action. Such effort-based decision making is an essential component of motivation, in which the dopaminergic system plays a key role. Depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common, disabling and has poor outcomes. Motivational symptoms such as apathy and anhedonia, are prominent in PD depression and related to dopaminergic loss. We hypothesised that dopamine-dependent disruption in effort-based decision-making contributes to depression in PD. In the present study, an effort-based decision-making task was administered to 62 patients with PD, with and without depression, ON and OFF their dopaminergic medication across two sessions, as well as to 34 patients with depression and 29 matched controls on a single occasion. During the task, on each trial, participants decided whether to accept or reject offers of different levels of monetary reward in return for exerting varying levels of physical effort via grip force, measured using individually calibrated dynamometers. The primary outcome variable was choice (accept/decline offer), analysed using both logistic mixed-effects modelling and a computational model which dissected the individual contributions of reward and effort on depression and dopamine state in PD. We found PD depression was characterised by lower acceptance of offers, driven by markedly lower incentivisation by reward (reward sensitivity), compared to all other groups. Within-subjects analysis of the effect of dopamine medication revealed that, although dopamine treatment improves reward sensitivity in non-depressed PD patients, this therapeutic effect is not present in PD patients with depression. These findings suggest that disrupted effort-based decision-making, unresponsive to dopamine, contributes to PD depression. This highlights reward sensitivity as a key mechanism and treatment target for PD depression that potentially requires non-dopaminergic therapies.

">AVN: A Deep Learning Approach for the Analysis of Birdsong</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning tools for behavior analysis have enabled important new insights and discoveries in neuroscience. Yet, they often compromise interpretability and generalizability for performance, making it difficult to quantitively compare phenotypes across datasets and research groups. We developed a novel deep learning-based behavior analysis pipeline, Avian Vocalization Network (AVN), for the learned vocalizations of the most extensively studied vocal learning model species - the zebra finch. AVN annotates songs with high accuracy across multiple animal colonies without the need for any additional training data and generates a comprehensive set of interpretable features to describe the syntax, timing, and acoustic properties of song. We use this feature set to compare song phenotypes across multiple research groups and experiments, and to predict a bird's stage in song development. Additionally, we have developed a novel method to measure song imitation that requires no additional training data for new comparisons or recording environments, and outperforms existing similarity scoring methods in its sensitivity and agreement with expert human judgements of song similarity. These tools are available through the open-source AVN python package and graphical application, which makes them accessible to researchers without any prior coding experience. Altogether, this behavior analysis toolkit stands to facilitate and accelerate the study of vocal behavior by enabling a standardized mapping of phenotypes and learning outcomes, thus helping scientists better link behavior to the underlying neural processes.

">Optimal AAV capsid/promoter combinations to target specific cell types in the common marmoset cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                To achieve cell type-specific gene expression, using target cell-tropic AAV capsids is advantageous. However, their tropism across brain cell types remains unexplored in non-human primates. We assessed the tropism of nine AAV serotype capsids (AAV1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, rh.10 (rh10), and DJ) on marmoset cerebral cortical cell types. Marmoset cerebral cortex was injected with different serotype AAVs expressing enhanced GFP (EGFP) by the ubiquitous chicken beta-actin hybrid (CBh) promoter. After 4 weeks, all nine AAV capsid vectors, especially AAV9 and AAVrh10, caused highly neuron-selective EGFP expression. Some AAV capsids, including AAV5, caused EGFP expression in oligodendrocytes to a lesser extent, with minimal or no expression in astrocytes and microglia. Different ubiquitous CMV and CAG promoters showed similar neuron-predominant transduction. Conversely, all nine AAV capsid vectors with the astrocyte-specific hGFA(ABC1D) promoter selectively transduced astrocytes, except AAV5, which transduced oligodendrocytes modestly. Oligodendrocyte-specific mouse myeline basic protein (mMBP) promoter in AAV5 vectors transduced oligodendrocytes specifically and efficiently. Our results suggest optimal combinations of capsids and promoters for cell type-specific expression: AAV9 or AAVrh10 and ubiquitous CBh, CMV, or CAG promoter for neuron-specific transduction; AAV2 or 7 and hGFA(ABC1D) promoter for astrocyte-specific transduction; and AAV5 and mMBP promoter for oligodendrocyte-specific transduction.

">Two-photon voltage imaging with rhodopsin-based sensors</a></h4>

              
                The recent advances in sophisticated optical techniques, coupled with two-photon sensitive genetic voltage indicators (GEVIs), have enabled in-depth voltage imaging in vivo at single spike and single-cell resolution. To date, these results have been only achieved using ASAP-type sensors, as the complex photocycle of rhodopsin-based voltage indicators posed challenges for their two-photon use, restricting their application to one-photon approaches. In this work, we demonstrate that rhodopsin-based GEVIs (FRET-opsin) can be used under two-photon illumination when their peculiar light intensity dependence of kinetics and sensitivity are considered. We rationally engineer a fully genetically-encoded, rhodopsin-based voltage indicator with the brightest known fluorophore AaFP1, Jarvis, and demonstrate its utility under both one- and two-photon illumination. We also showed two-photon usability of the similar FRET-opsin sensor pAce. Our comparison of 2P scanless with fast 2P scanning illumination revealed that the latter approach is less suitable for this class of indicators and, on the contrary, both sensors responded well when scanless approaches were used. Furthermore, utilising Jarvis, we demonstrated high-fidelity, high-SNR action potential detection at kilohertz-imaging rates both in mouse hippocampal slices and in zebrafish larvae. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report of a fully genetically-encoded rhodopsin-based voltage indicator for high contrast action potential detection under two-photon illumination in vitro and in vivo.

">Molecular Myelin Dysfunction in the Most Common Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies - CMT1A and HNPP</a></h4>

              
                Increased and decreased dosage of the Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene cause dysmyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (CMT1A, PMP22 duplication) and Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP, PMP22 deletion) are the most common inherited peripheral neuropathies, yet gaps remain about their pathophysiology and pathomechanims. Our previous results with CMT1A model mice demonstrate that muscle atrophy occurs without evidence of secondary axon degeneration suggesting that primary myelin dysfunction may contribute to functional deficits in CMT1A and motivating investigation of myelin dysfunction. Here we used CMT1A and HNPP model mice and confocal immunofluorescence imaging of teased tibial nerve fibers to determine how altered PMP22 expression disrupts myelin integrity and reveal CMT1A and HNPP pathomechanisms. We identified dramatic changes to molecular machinery at Schmidt-Lanterman incisures (SLIs) and Nodes of Ranvier that led us to propose two potential pathomechanisms for CMT1A and HNPP: impaired metabolic support and axonal ion disequilibrium. We also developed a working model for these pathomechanims that is driven by PMP22-mediated regulation of adherens junctions. Ongoing studies are aimed at testing these proposed pathomechanisms and determining how altered PMP22 and adherens junctions cause these defects. This work will provide insight into CMT1A and HNPP pathogenesis and may reveal novel approaches for developing therapeutics.

">EVIDENCE OF SPATIAL PERIODIC FIRING IN THE SUBICULUM OF MICE</a></h4>

              
                The subiculum (SUB) is a region located at the core of the hippocampal formation. The SUB receives inputs from grid cells located in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and from place cells in the CA1 area. Moreover, this structure mediates the output from the hippocampus to cortical and sub-cortical areas involved in the processing of different types of information. Despite the potential relevance of the SUB, its role in memory and spatial coding remains poorly studied. Previous work described a heterogeneous population of SUB spatial neurons, with evidence of its role in coding the geometry of the environment and spatial navigation in darkness. With the aim of understanding further the properties of spatial coding in the SUB, we implanted mice with microdrives carrying tetrodes to target CA1 and the SUB. Apart from the classical place cells described before, we discovered a fraction of SUB pyramidal neurons that generated spatial periodic firing. SUB spatial neurons presented lower spatial resolution and spatial stability than CA1 place cells. The role of spatial periodic neurons in the SUB might be relevant in several computations through the interaction of this region with CA1, the pre-parasubiculum and the MEC.

">Cannabinoid receptor 1 positive allosteric modulator ZCZ011 shows differential effects on behavior and the endocannabinoid system in HIV-1 Tat transgenic female and male mice</a></h4>

              
                The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) is a promising therapeutic target for various neurodegenerative diseases, including HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). However, the therapeutic potential of CB1R by direct activation is limited due to its psychoactive side effects. Therefore, research has focused on indirectly activating the CB1R by utilizing positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). Studies have shown that CB1R PAMs (ZCZ011 and GAT211) are effective in mouse models of Huntington's disease and neuropathic pain, and hence, we assess the therapeutic potential of ZCZ011 in a well-established mouse model of neuroHIV. The current study investigates the effect of chronic ZCZ011 treatment (14 days) on various behavioral paradigms and the endocannabinoid system in HIV-1 Tat transgenic female and male mice. Chronic ZCZ011 treatment (10 mg/kg) did not alter body mass, locomotor activity, or anxiety-like behavior regardless of sex or genotype. However, differential effects were noted in hot plate latency, motor coordination, and recognition memory in female mice only, with ZCZ011 treatment increasing hot plate latency and improving motor coordination and recognition memory. Only minor effects or no alterations were seen in the endocannabinoid system and related lipids except in the cerebellum, where the effect of ZCZ011 was more pronounced in female mice. Moreover, AEA and PEA levels in the cerebellum were positively correlated with improved motor coordination in female mice. In summary, these findings indicate that chronic ZCZ011 treatment has differential effects on antinociception, motor coordination, and memory, based on sex and HIV-1 Tat expression, making CB1R PAMs potential treatment options for HAND without the psychoactive side effects.

">25-hydroxycholesterol dysregulates brain endothelial cell function and exacerbates cerebral haemorrhage</a></h4>

              
                Viral infection and hypocholesterolaemia are two independent risk factors for intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), but the molecular mechanisms leading to vascular rupture via these risk factors remain unknown. We hypothesised that the enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and its metabolite 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which modulates cholesterol metabolism during infection, may offer a mechanistic link between cholesterol dysregulation and infection during neurovascular dysfunction. We identified an upregulation of CH25H in infection-associated cerebral haemorrhage, in a SARS-CoV-2-induced zebrafish ICH model and foetal human SARS-CoV-2-associated cortical microbleeds. Using human brain endothelial cells and zebrafish ICH models, we show that 25HC promotes endothelial dysfunction and exacerbates brain bleeding. These effects involved cholesterol metabolism modulation, as cholesterol supplementation rescued these effects, while 25HC and statin treatments interacted to exacerbate dysfunction. We propose that the CH25H/25HC pathway represents an important component in the pathophysiology of brain vessel dysfunction associated with infection and cholesterol dysregulation in the context of ICH.

">States of functional connectivity flow and their multiplex dynamics in human epilepsy and postictal aphasia</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms that cause aphasia as a transient post-seizure symptom in epileptic patients are yet unknown. We analyse intracranial EEG (sEEG) recordings of patients suffering from pharmaco- resistant epilepsy with postictal aphasia. We study the Functional Connectivity (FC) between different cortical sites in a time- and frequency-resolved manner, representing each recording as a time-varying, multilayer network (dynamic multiplex). We studied in particular: the rate of overall reconfiguration of links from one frame to the next, or dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) speed; and the stability of network modules through time, by means of a dynamic modular Allegiance (dA) analysis. The combination of these two approaches allows identifying states of "Functional Connectivity flow" (beyond connectivity states), defined as epochs in which network reconfiguration occurs with comparable speed and degree of spatio-temporal coordination. Our unsupervised analyses reveal then that high-frequency dFC is slowed down in a long postictal phase lasting well beyond the ictal episodes themselves. Furthermore, a pathological state of slow and poorly structured network flow consistently co-occurs with episodes of aphasia symptoms annotated by the clinicians. In conclusion, our multiplex network dynamics description cast light on functional mechanisms of postictal cognitive dysfunction at the level of individual patients.

">Connecting the Dots: Approaching a Standardized Nomenclature for Molecular Connectivity Combining Data and Literature</a></h4>

              
                PET-based connectivity computation is a molecular approach that complements fMRI-derived functional connectivity. However, the diversity of methodologies and terms employed in PET connectivity analysis has resulted in ambiguities and confounded interpretations, highlighting the need for a standardized nomenclature. Drawing parallels from other imaging modalities, we propose 'molecular connectivity' as an umbrella term to characterize statistical dependencies between PET signals across brain regions at the individual level (within-subject). Like fMRI resting-state functional connectivity, 'molecular connectivity' leverages temporal associations in the PET signal to derive brain network associations. Another within-subject approach evaluates regional similarities of tracer kinetics, which are unique in PET imaging, thus referred to as 'kinetic connectivity'. On the other hand, 'molecular covariance' denotes group-level computations of covariance matrices across-subject. Further specification of the terminology can be achieved by including the employed radioligand, such as 'metabolic connectivity/covariance' for [18F]FDG as well as 'tau/amyloid covariance' for [18F]flutemetamol / [18F]flortaucipir. To augment these distinctions, high-temporal resolution functional [18F]FDG PET scans from 17 healthy participants were analysed with common techniques of molecular connectivity and covariance, allowing for a data-driven support of the above terminology. Our findings demonstrate that temporal band-pass filtering yields structured network organization, whereas other techniques like 3rd order polynomial fitting, spatio-temporal filtering and baseline normalization require further methodological refinement for high-temporal resolution data. Conversely, molecular covariance from across-subject data provided a simple means to estimate brain region interactions through regularized or sparse inverse covariance estimation. A standardized nomenclature in PET-based connectivity research can reduce ambiguity, enhance reproducibility, and facilitate interpretability across radiotracers and imaging modalities. Via a data-driven approach, this work provides a transparent framework for categorizing and comparing PET-derived connectivity and covariance metrics, laying the foundation for future investigations in the field.

">EEG frequency tagging reveals the integration of dissimilar observed actions</a></h4>

              
                Extensive research has demonstrated that visual and motor cortices can simultaneously represent multiple observed actions. This ability undoubtedly constitutes a crucial ingredient for the understanding of complex visual scenes involving different agents. However, it is still unclear how these distinct representations are integrated into coherent and meaningful percepts. In line with studies of perceptual binding, we hypothesized that similar movements would be more easily integrated. To test this hypothesis, we developed an EEG frequency tagging experiment in which two hand movements were displayed simultaneously at two different presentation rates. Crucially, the degree of similarity between the two movements varied along two dimensions, namely action identity (i.e., same or different performed movement), and agent identity (i.e., one agent performing a bimanual movement, or two agents moving each one hand). Contrary to our predictions, we found a larger intermodulation oscillatory component, indexing the integrated processing of the two individual movements, when they were less similar. We propose that integration-by-dissimilarity might serve as a top-down process to solve conflict caused by incongruent movements in a complex social scene.

">Impairments in proprioceptively-referenced limb and eye movements in chronic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Background: Upper limb proprioceptive impairments are common after stroke and can affect daily function. Recent work has shown that stroke survivors have difficulty using visual information to improve proprioception. It is unclear how eye movements are impacted to guide action of the arm after stroke. Here, we aimed to understand how upper limb proprioceptive impairments impact eye movements in individuals with stroke. Methods: Control (N=20) and stroke participants (N=20) performed a proprioceptive matching task with upper limb and eye movements. A KINARM exoskeleton with eye tracking was used to assess limb and eye kinematics. The upper limb was passively moved by the robot and participants matched the location with either an arm or eye movement. Accuracy was measured as the difference between passive robot movement location and the active limb matching (Hand-End Point Error) or the active eye movement matching (Eye-End Point Error). Results: We found that individuals with stroke had significantly larger Hand and Eye-End Point Errors compared to controls. Further, we found that stroke participants had proprioceptive errors of the hand and eye were highly correlated [r=0.67, p=0.001], a relationship not observed for controls. Conclusions: Eye movement accuracy declined as a function of proprioceptive impairment of the more-affected limb, which was used as a proprioceptive reference. The inability to use proprioceptive information of the arm to coordinate eye movements suggests that disordered proprioception impacts integration of sensory information across different modalities. These results have important implications for how vision is used to actively guide limb movement during rehabilitation.

">Neuronal protein phosphatase 1β regulates glutamate release, cortical myelination, node of Ranvier formation, and action potential propagation in the optic nerve</a></h4>

              
                Precise regulation of protein phosphorylation is critical for many cellular processes, and dysfunction in this process has been linked to various neurological disorders and diseases. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine phosphatase with three major isoforms, (, {beta}, {gamma}) and hundreds of known substrates. Previously, we reported that PP1 and PP1{gamma} are essential for the known role of PP1 in synaptic physiology and learning/memory, while PP1{beta} displayed a surprising opposing function. De novo mutations in PP1{beta} cause neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, but the mechanisms involved are currently unknown. A Cre-Lox system was used to delete PP1{beta} specifically in neurons in order to study its effects on developing mice. These animals fail to survive to 3 postnatal weeks, and exhibit deficits in cortical myelination and glutamate release. There was defective compound action potential (CAP) propagation in the optic nerve of the null mice, which was traced to a deficit in the formation of nodes of Ranvier. Finally, it was found that phosphorylation of the PP1{beta}-specific substrate, myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), is significantly enhanced in PP1{beta} null optic nerves. Several novel important in vivo roles of PP1{beta} in neurons were discovered, and these data will aid future investigations in delineating the mechanisms by which de novo mutations in PP1{beta} lead to intellectual and developmental delays in patients.

">Individual differences in prefrontal coding of visual features</a></h4>

              
                The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is commonly associated with high-level cognition, such as attention, language and cognitive control. However, recent work has demonstrated that it is also critical for basic perceptual functions including object recognition. Here we characterize the role of LPFC in visual processing with computational models. Using a dataset of human fMRI data at 7T, we built encoding models relating visual features extracted from a deep neural network (the image encoder of a CLIP [Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training] network) to brain responses to thousands of natural images. Within each of the eight subjects, we were able to robustly predict responses in patches of LPFC, most notably in FEF (frontal eye field) and vlPFC (ventrolateral PFC) regions. Leveraging these robust encoding models, we then explored the representational structures and screened for images with high predicted responses in LPFC . We found striking individual differences in the coding schemes of LPFC. In contrast, the coding scheme of the ventral visual stream remains more consistent across individuals. Overall, our study demonstrates the under-appreciated role of LPFC in visual processing and suggests that LPFC may underlie the idiosyncrasies in how different individuals experience the visual world. Methodologically, these findings may also explain why previous group studies have often failed to observe robust visual functions in LPFC, as subjects' responses may need to be calibrated individually.

">Encoding of interdependent features of head direction and angular head velocity in navigation</a></h4>

              
                To comprehend the complex world around us, our brains are tasked with the remarkable job of integrating multiple features into a cohesive whole. While previous studies have primarily focused on the processing and integration of independent features, here we investigated the simultaneous encoding of the interdependent features, specifically head direction (HD) and its temporal derivative, angular head velocity (AHV), by first employing computational modeling on HD systems to explore emergent algorithms and then validated its biological plausibility with empirical data from mice's HD systems. Our analysis revealed two distinct neuron populations: those with multiphasic tuning curves for HD compromised their HD encoding capacity to better capture AHV dynamics, while those with monophasic tuning curves primarily encoded HD. This pattern of functional dissociation was observed in both artificial HD systems and the cortical and subcortical regions upstream of biological HD systems, suggesting a general principle for encoding interdependent features. Further, exploration of the underlying mechanisms involved examining neural manifolds embedded within the representational space constructed by these neurons. We found that the manifold by neurons with multiphasic tuning curves was locally jagged and complex, which effectively expanded the dimensionality of the neural representation space and in turn facilitated a high-precision representation of AHV. Therefore, the encoding strategy for HD and AHV likely integrates characteristics of both dense and sparse coding schemes to achieve a balance between preserving specificity for individual features and maintaining their interdependency nature, marking a significant departure from the encoding of independent features and thus advocating future research delving into the encoding strategies of interdependent features.

">Emerging neurodevelopmental mechanisms in patient induced pluripotent stem cells-derived spheroids modelling SCN1A Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                SCN1A encodes Nav1.1, a voltage-gated sodium channel preferentially expressed in GABAergic interneurons, and it is the major cause of Dravet Syndrome (DS), a rare condition of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). Among over 1000 DS mutations reported to date, almost all cause SCN1A loss-of function (LoF). A reduction in NaV1.1 function in inhibitory neurons would subsequently cause an over-excitation of glutamatergic neurons resulting in seizures, which are exacerbated by the use of sodium channel blocking common anti-seizure medications (ASM). In this study we generated and assessed 3D spheroids enriched with GABAergic neurons from SCN1A DS patient to establish a 3D human-derived DS model. To investigate developmental disruptions in DS pathophysiology we profiled the transcriptome of patient-derived spheroids and subsequently, tested the capability of this 3D in vitro model to reveal the cellular mechanisms of DS and predict drug response. In summary, our patient iPSC-derived neuronal model of SCN1A DS revealed a profound dysregulation of developmental processes which correlated with functional disruption in GABAergic neurons and predicted response to fenfluramine, an ASM increasingly used for the treatment of DS.

">Neuropeptide Y co-opts neuronal ensembles for memory lability and stability</a></h4>

              
                Memory engrams are formed by activity-dependent recruitment of distinct subsets of excitatory principal neurons (or neuronal ensembles) whereas inhibitory neurons pivot memory lability and stability (1-5). However, the molecular logic for memory engrams to preferentially recruit specific type of interneurons over other subtypes remains enigmatic. Using activity-dependent single-cell transcriptomic profiling6-8 in mice with training of cued fear memory and extinction, we discovered that neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing (NPY+) GABAergic interneurons in the ventral hippocampal CA1 (vCA1) region exert fast GABAergic inhibition to facilitate the acquisition of memory, but bifurcate NPY-mediated slow peptidergic inhibition onto distinct sub-ensembles underlying the extinction of single memory trace. Genetically encoded calcium and NPY sensors revealed that both calcium dynamics of NPY+ neurons and their NPY release in vCA1 ramp up as extinction learning progresses while behavioral state switches from "fear-on" to "fear-off". Bidirectional manipulations of NPY+ neurons or NPY itself demonstrated NPY is both necessary and sufficient to control the rate and degree of memory extinction by acting on two physically non-overlapping sub-ensembles composed of NPY1R- and NPY2R-expressing neurons. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of NPY2R or NPY1R further unravels that NPY co-opts its actions on these two sub-ensembles to gate early fast and late slow stages of extinction. These findings exemplify the intricate spatiotemporal orchestration of slow peptidergic inhibitions from single subtype of GABAergic interneurons to fine-tune engram lability verse stability of memory.

">Augmenting visual errors or variability does not enhance motor learning in remote web application tasks</a></h4>

              
                Laboratory experiments employing robotic manipulandum are far from achieving their goal of helping people improve their motor learning. Remote experiments using web applications are an effective tool for bridging the gap between robotic manipulandum experiments in the laboratory and general motor tasks outside. However, the influence of interventions that increase error or variability in remote motor tasks on motor learning has not yet been determined. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effects of interventions that visually increase errors and variability in remote experiments using web applications. In particular, 48 people participated in a web-based study on the cursor-manipulation of motor tasks using laptops. Three motor tasks (visuomotor-rotation reaching, virtual curling, and virtual ball-throwing tasks) were conducted, and each task consisted of 120 trials a day conducted for three days in this study. For each task, no intervention was provided on Day 1 and the intervention to augment motor error or variability was provided on Days 2 and 3. Differences between the groups in post-intervention test trials were examined using statistical analyses. Contrary to our expectations, the interventions of error-augmentation did not exhibit positive effects in Experiments 1 and 2, which could be attributed to a lack of haptic and proprioceptive information or inaccuracies in movement kinematics. In addition, the interventions of variability-augmentation did not exhibit positive effects in Experiment 3, which could be attributed to the complex dynamics in the relationship between perceived body movements and motor outcomes. Further research is required to identify the differences between the conditions when the interventions are effective or ineffective. Moreover, interventions must be developed to further improve general motor skills.

">Maximising the translational potential of neurophysiology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a study on compound muscle action potentials</a></h4>

              
                Transgenic mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, such as the widely used SOD1G93A mouse, enable investigation of disease mechanisms and testing of novel therapeutic interventions. However, treatments that have been considered successful in mice have often failed to translate into human benefit in clinical trials, particularly when relying on the so-called 'survival' read-out. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs), are a simple neurophysiological test that measures the summation of muscle fibre depolarisation in response to maximal stimulation of the innervating nerve. CMAPs can be measured in both mice and humans and decline with motor axon loss in ALS, making them a potential translational read-out of disease progression which could help bridge the preclinical and clinical divide. Herein we assess the translational potential of CMAPs and ascertain at what time points human and mouse data aligned most closely. We extracted data from 18 human studies and compared with results generated from SOD1G93A and control mice at different ages across different muscles. We found that the relative CMAP amplitude difference between SOD1G93A and control mice in tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles at 70 days of age was most similar to the relative difference between baseline ALS patient CMAP measurements and healthy controls in the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. We also found that the relative decline in SOD1G93A tibialis anterior CMAP amplitude between 70-140 days was similar to that observed in 12 month human longitudinal studies in APB. Our findings suggest CMAP amplitudes can provide a 'translational window', from which to make comparisons between the SOD1G93A model and human ALS patients. CMAPs are easy to perform and can help determine the most clinically relevant starting/end points for preclinical studies and provide a basis for predicting potential clinical effect sizes.

">Intracranial substrates of meditation-induced neuromodulation in amygdala and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Meditation is an accessible mental practice associated with emotional regulation and well-being. Loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a specific sub-type of meditative practice, involves focusing attention on thoughts of well-being for oneself and others. Meditation has been proven to be beneficial in a variety of settings, including therapeutical applications, but the neural activity underlying meditative practices and their positive effects are not well understood. In particular, it has been difficult to understand the contribution of deep limbic structures given the difficulty of studying neural activity directly in the human brain. Here, we leverage a unique patient population, epilepsy patients chronically implanted with responsive neurostimulation device that allow chronic, invasive electrophysiology recording to investigate the physiological correlates of loving-kindness meditation in the amygdala and hippocampus of novice meditators. We find that LKM-associated changes in physiological activity specific to periodic, but not aperiodic, features of neural activity. LKM was associated with an increase in gamma (30-55 Hz) power and an alternation in the duration of beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma; oscillatory bursts in both the amygdala and hippocampus, two regions associated with mood disorders. These findings reveals the nature of LKM-induced modulation of limbic activity in first-time meditators.

">Cell-type specific auditory responses in the striatum are shaped by feed forward inhibition</a></h4>

              
                The posterior "tail" region of the striatum receives dense innervation from sensory brain regions and has been demonstrated to play a role in behaviors that require sensorimotor integration including discrimination avoidance and defense responses. The output neurons of the striatum, the D1 and D2 striatal projection neurons (SPNs) that make up the direct and indirect pathways, respectively, are thought to play differential roles in these behavioral responses, although it remains unclear if or how these neurons display differential responsivity to sensory stimuli. Here, we used whole-cell recordings in vivo and ex vivo to examine the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto D1 and D2 SPNs following the stimulation of upstream auditory pathways. While D1 and D2 SPNs both displayed stimulus-evoked depolarizations, D1 SPN responses were stronger and faster for all stimuli tested in vivo as well as in brain slices. This difference did not arise from differences in the strength of excitatory inputs but from differences in the strength of feed forward inhibition. Indeed, fast spiking interneurons, which are readily engaged by auditory afferents exerted stronger inhibition onto D2 SPNs compared to D1 SPNs. Our results support a model in which differences in feed forward inhibition enable the preferential recruitment of the direct pathway in response to auditory stimuli, positioning this pathway to initiate sound-driven actions.

">Neuron Derived Cytokine Interleukin-34 Controls Developmental Microglia Function</a></h4>

              
                Neuron-microglia interactions dictate the development of neuronal circuits in the brain. However, the factors that support and broadly regulate these processes across developmental stages are largely unknown. Here, we find that IL34, a neuron-derived cytokine, is upregulated in development and plays a critical role in supporting and maintaining neuroprotective, mature microglia in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of mice. We show that IL34 mRNA and protein is upregulated in neurons in the second week of postnatal life and that this increase coincides with increases in microglia number and expression of mature, homeostatic markers, e.g., TMEM119. We also found that IL34 mRNA is higher in more active neurons, and higher in excitatory (compared to inhibitory) neurons. Genetic KO of IL34 prevents the functional maturation of microglia and results in an anxiolytic phenotype in these mice by adulthood. Acute, low dose blocking of IL34 at postnatal day (P)15 in mice decreased microglial TMEM119 expression and increased aberrant microglial phagocytosis of thalamocortical synapses within the ACC. In contrast, viral overexpression of IL34 early in life (P1-P8) caused early maturation of microglia and prevented microglial phagocytosis of thalamocortical synapses during the appropriate neurodevelopmental refinement window. Taken together, these findings establish IL34 as a key regulator of neuron-microglia crosstalk in postnatal brain development, controlling both microglial maturation and synapse engulfment.

">Task-specific topographical maps of neural activity in the primate lateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the primate lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) flexibly adapt their activity to support a wide range of cognitive tasks. Whether and how the topography of LPFC neural activity changes as a function of task is unclear. In the present study, we address this issue by characterizing the functional topography of LPFC neural activity in awake behaving macaques performing three distinct cognitive tasks. We recorded from chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays and show that the topography of LPFC activity is stable within a task, but adaptive across tasks. The topography of neural activity exhibits a spatial scale compatible with that of cortical columns and prior anatomical tracing work on afferent LPFC inputs. Our findings show that LPFC maps of neural population activity are stable for a specific task, providing robust neural codes that support task specialization. Moreover, the variability in functional topographies across tasks indicates activity landscapes can adapt, providing flexibility to LPFC neural codes.

">Deciphering the ferroptosis pathways in dorsal root ganglia of Friedreich ataxia models. The role of LKB1/AMPK, KEAP1, and GSK3beta in the impairment of the NRF2 response</a></h4>

              
                Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by decreased levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Frataxin has been related in iron homeostasis, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress. Ferroptosis has recently been shown to be involved in FA cellular degeneration; however, its role in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, the cells that are affected the most and the earliest, is mostly unknown. In this study, we used primary cultures of frataxin-deficient DRG neurons as well as DRG from the FXNI151F mouse model to study ferroptosis and its regulatory pathways. A lack of frataxin induced upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and decreased ferritin and mitochondrial iron accumulation, a source of oxidative stress. However, there was impaired activation of NRF2, a key transcription factor involved in the antioxidant response pathway. Decreased total and nuclear NRF2 explains the downregulation of both SLC7A11 (a member of the system Xc, which transports cystine required for glutathione synthesis) and glutathione peroxidase 4, responsible for increased lipid peroxidation, the main markers of ferroptosis. Such dysregulation could be due to the increase in KEAP1 and pGSK3beta (Tyr216), which promote cytosolic localization and degradation of NRF2. Moreover, there was a deficiency in the LKB1/AMPK pathway, which would also impair NRF2 activity. AMPK acts as a positive regulator of NRF2 and it is activated by the upstream kinase LKB1. The levels of LKB1 were reduced when frataxin decreased, in agreement with reduced pAMPK (Thr172), the active form of AMPK. SIRT1, a known activator of LKB1, was also reduced when frataxin decreased. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that frataxin deficiency in DRG neurons disrupts iron homeostasis and the intricate regulation of molecular pathways affecting NRF2 activation and the cellular response to oxidative stress, leading to ferroptosis.

	<p>Background: Parents report associations between children&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep disturbances and behaviors. Children with neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., Williams Syndrome and autism) are consistently reported to experience increased sleeping problems. Sleep in children with vision impairment and children with a dual diagnosis of vision impairment and autism remains understudied. Methods: Our exploratory study compared sleep profiles in 52 children (aged 4&amp;amp;ndash;12 years) and their parents (n = 37), across four groups: children with vision impairment (VI; n = 9), autism (n = 10), comorbid vision impairment + autism (n = 6), and typically developing children (n = 27). Childhood sleep was measured using the parental report Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire and sleep diaries. Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive functioning was measured using digit span, semantic, and phonemic verbal fluency measures. Parental sleep was measured via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Results: Clinically disordered sleep was reported in all child groups (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), particularly children with VI + autism. Age, not sleep quality/quantity, predicted cognitive task performance in TD and autistic groups, but not in VI and VI + autism groups. The child&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagnosis affected parental sleep, particularly in children with a dual diagnosis of VI + autism. Conclusions: All participants experienced problematic sleep to varying degrees. Those most affected were children and parents in the VI + autism group, suggesting that autism may be the main driver of sleep problems in our sample.</p>

	<p>Recently, we and others have shown that manipulating the activity of cholinergic interneurons (CIN) present in the NAc can modulate binge alcohol consumption. The present study is designed to examine the relationship between binge alcohol consumption and the activity of the CIN in real time by using an in vivo microendoscopic technique. We hypothesized that mice exposed to Drinking in the Dark (DID)&amp;amp;mdash;a recognized mouse model for binge drinking&amp;amp;mdash;would exhibit increased activity in the accumbal shell region (NAcSh). To test this hypothesis, male mice expressing Cre-recombinase in the cholinergic neurons were exposed to binge alcohol consumption (alcohol group), employing the DID method, and utilized in vivo calcium imaging to observe CIN activity in real time during alcohol consumption. The control (sucrose) group was exposed to 10% (w/v) sucrose. As compared to sucrose, mice in the alcohol group displayed a significant increase in the frequency and amplitude of discharge activity, which was measured using calcium transients in the CIN present in the NAcSh. In summary, our findings suggest that the activity of CIN in the NAcSh plays a crucial role in alcohol self-administration. These results emphasize the potential significance of targeting CIN activity as a therapeutic approach for addressing AUD.</p>

	<p>Background: Despite the availability of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treating obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD), alternative approaches need to be explored due to the high likelihood of treatment resistance. Neuronavigated 20 Hz theta burst stimulation (TBS-20 Hz), targeting the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) augmented with the right orbitofrontal cortex (ROFC), was tested for treating OCD comorbid with depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on fourteen patients treated for moderate-to-severe OCD in a private outpatient clinic. Twelve patients had comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), and thirteen patients had either generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder (PD). Patients completed the Y-BOCS-SR, BDI-II, and BAI rating scales weekly, which were used to measure the changes in OCD, depression, and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Results: Neuronavigated TBS-20 Hz was sequentially applied to the right DLPFC (RDLPFC), left DLPFC (LDLPFC), and ROFC. A total of 64% (9/14) of patients achieved remission from OCD (Y-BOCS-SR &amp;amp;le; 14) in an average of 6.1 weeks of treatment (SD = 4.0). A total of 58% (7/12) of patients remitted from MDD (BDI &amp;amp;lt; 13) in an average of 4.1 weeks (SD = 2.8), and 62% (8/13) of patients remitted from GAD/PD (BAI &amp;amp;lt; 8) in an average of 4.3 weeks (SD = 2.5). Conclusions: The neuronavigated TBS-20 Hz sequential stimulation of RDLPFC and LDLPFC, followed by ROFC, significantly reduced OCD, MDD, and GAD/PD symptoms. Randomized sham controls are warranted to validate these results.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between Cathepsin B and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD), with a particular focus on determining the role of N-acetylaspartate as a potential mediator. Methods: We used summary-level data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, exploring the association between Cathepsin B (3301 cases) and PD (4681 cases). A sequential two-step MR approach was applied (8148 cases) to study the role of N-acetylaspartate. Results: The MR analysis yielded that genetically predicted elevated Cathepsin B levels correlated with a reduced risk of developing PD (p = 0.0133, OR: 0.9171, 95% CI: 0.8563&amp;amp;ndash;0.9821). On the other hand, the analysis provided insufficient evidence to determine that PD affected Cathepsin B levels (p = 0.8567, OR: 1.0035, 95% CI: 0.9666&amp;amp;ndash;1.0418). The estimated effect of N-acetylaspartate in this process was 7.52% (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;3.65% to 18.69%). Conclusions: This study suggested that elevated Cathepsin B levels decreased the risk of developing PD, with the mediation effect of N-acetylaspartate. Further research is needed to better understand this relationship.</p>

	<p>Hyperserotonemia is one of the most studied endophenotypes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there are still no unequivocal results about its causes or biological and behavioral outcomes. This systematic review summarizes the studies investigating the relationship between blood serotonin (5-HT) levels and ASD, comparing diagnostic tools, analytical methods, and clinical outcomes. A literature search on peripheral 5-HT levels and ASD was conducted. In total, 1104 publications were screened, of which 113 entered the present systematic review. Of these, 59 articles reported hyperserotonemia in subjects with ASD, and 26 presented correlations between 5-HT levels and ASD-core clinical outcomes. The 5-HT levels are increased in about half, and correlations between hyperserotonemia and clinical outcomes are detected in a quarter of the studies. The present research highlights a large amount of heterogeneity in this field, ranging from the characterization of ASD and control groups to diagnostic and clinical assessments, from blood sampling procedures to analytical methods, allowing us to delineate critical topics for future studies.</p>

                <p>The primary motor cortex (M1) integrates sensory and cognitive inputs to generate voluntary movement. Its functional impairments have been implicated in the pathophysiology of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, dopaminergic degeneration and basal ganglia dysfunction entrain M1 neurons into the abnormally synchronized bursting pattern of activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. However, how degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons affects the anatomy, microcircuit connectivity, and function of the M1 network remains poorly understood. The present study examined whether and how the loss of dopamine (DA) affects the morphology, cellular excitability, and synaptic physiology of Layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing (PV<sup>+</sup>) cells in the M1 of mice of both sexes. Here, we reported that loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons does not alter the number, morphology, and physiology of Layer 5 PV<sup>+</sup> cells in M1. Moreover, we demonstrated that the number of perisomatic PV<sup>+</sup> puncta of M1 pyramidal neurons as well as their functional innervation of cortical pyramidal neurons were not altered following the loss of DA. Together, the present study documents an intact GABAergic inhibitory network formed by PV<sup>+</sup> cells following the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.</p>

                <p>More and more patients worldwide are diagnosed with dementia, which emphasizes the urgent need for early detection markers. In this study, we built on the auditory hypersensitivity theory of a previous study&mdash;which postulated that responses to auditory input in the subcortex as well as cortex are enhanced in cognitive decline&mdash;and examined auditory encoding of natural continuous speech at both neural levels for its indicative potential for cognitive decline. We recruited study participants aged 60 years and older, who were divided into two groups based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, one group with low scores (<I>n</I> = 19, participants with signs of cognitive decline) and a control group (<I>n</I> = 25). Participants completed an audiometric assessment and then we recorded their electroencephalography while they listened to an audiobook and click sounds. We derived temporal response functions and evoked potentials from the data and examined response amplitudes for their potential to predict cognitive decline, controlling for hearing ability and age. Contrary to our expectations, no evidence of auditory hypersensitivity was observed in participants with signs of cognitive decline; response amplitudes were comparable in both cognitive groups. Moreover, the combination of response amplitudes showed no predictive value for cognitive decline. These results challenge the proposed hypothesis and emphasize the need for further research to identify reliable auditory markers for the early detection of cognitive decline.</p>

                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                Introduction This study protocol outlines a comprehensive investigation into the impact of phototherapy on electrolyte levels in newborns with hyperbilirubinemia. With a focus on neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and AVBR Hospital, Sawangi, Wardha, Central India, the research aims to contribute valuable insights into the physiological changes associated with this common neonatal condition. The study’s introduction highlights the rationale, significance, and gaps in current knowledge, emphasising the need for a detailed exploration of electrolyte dynamics before and after phototherapy. Method The methodology involves a descriptive, interventional cross-sectional design with a calculated sample size of 264 neonates. Standardised protocols for data collection, including serum electrolyte analysis and urine-specific gravity assessment, will be employed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are clearly defined to ensure a homogenous study population. Statistical analyses, utilising R Studio 4.3.1 will encompass descriptive statistics, comparative analysis, correlation analysis, and multivariate analysis to explore the nuanced relationships between variables. Rigorous ethical considerations and transparency in reporting will guide the data collection process. Expected Result Anticipated outcomes include a nuanced understanding of changes in serum electrolyte levels following phototherapy and the correlation of these changes with the treatment duration. The study is poised to shed light on the impact of gestational age and birth weight on electrolyte responses. Through rigorous statistical analysis, the research aims to provide evidence-based insights that can inform neonatal care protocols. The anticipated findings hold the potential to influence clinical practices, enhancing the quality of care provided to newborns with hyperbilirubinemia undergoing phototherapy.

                The routine genomic surveillance of pathogens in diverse geographical settings and equitable data sharing are critical to inform effective infection control and therapeutic development. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of routine genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to detect emerging variants of concern. However, the majority of high-income countries sequenced >0.5% of their COVID-19 cases, unlike low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, many countries around the world had managed to establish capacity for pathogen genomic surveillance. Notably, Beta and Omicron; 2 of the 5 current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were first discovered in Africa through an aggressive sequencing campaign led by African scientists. To sustain such infrastructure and expertise beyond this pandemic, other endemic pathogens should leverage this investment. Therefore, countries are establishing multi-pathogen genomic surveillance strategies. Here we provide a catalog of the current landscape of sequenced and publicly shared pathogens in different countries in Africa. Drawing upon our collective knowledge and expertise, we review the ever-evolving challenges and propose innovative recommendations.

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                <p>by Hazal Koptagel, Seong-Hwan Jun, Joanna Hård, Jens Lagergren</p>

Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method’s robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells.

                <p>by Raphael Sonabend, Hugo Gruson, Leo Wolansky, Agnes Kiragga, Daniel S. Katz</p>

This paper extends the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines to provide criteria for assessing if software conforms to best practices in open source. By adding “USE” (User-Centered, Sustainable, Equitable), software development can adhere to open source best practice by incorporating user-input early on, ensuring front-end designs are accessible to all possible stakeholders, and planning long-term sustainability alongside software design. The FAIR-USE4OS guidelines will allow funders and researchers to more effectively evaluate and plan open-source software projects. There is good evidence of funders increasingly mandating that all funded research software is open source; however, even under the FAIR guidelines, this could simply mean software released on public repositories with a Zenodo DOI. By creating FAIR-USE software, best practice can be demonstrated from the very beginning of the design process and the software has the greatest chance of success by being impactful.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1546/v3?src=rss">In vitro assessment and comparison of quality of alcohol-based hand rubs, pre- and peri-COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Kenya [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organization recommended the use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) to curb transmission, leading to increased production and use. This has posed a danger of production and use of poor-quality ABHRs. Methods This study assessed and compared the quality of ABHRs in the Kenyan market that were produced before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Quality testing was carried out against European EN 1500:2013 and Kenyan EAS 789:2013 Standards and 20 samples analyzed for alcohol content by GC-FID. Results The study found that 27.8% of the peri-COVID-19 pandemic sanitizers had less than 90% bactericidal reduction activity as compared to 12.5% manufactured pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Only 25% peri-COVID-19 pandemic ABHRs met the EAS 789:2013 acceptable limit of over 60% alcohol content. Product adulteration with methanol was found in 20 % of the samples with only 5% complying with FDA approval limit of <0.063% v/v methanol. Study found no correlation between the total alcohol content and the efficacy of ABHRs. Conclusions The study found that more substandard products were produced during the pandemic. This raises a concern about possible emergence of alcohol resistant strains of microorganisms. The study therefore recommends an adequate quality monitoring system to curb against substandard products.

                Background Parthenium is an invasive annual weed that affects crop production, rangelands, grasslands, animals, the environment, and human health. Since its introduction into Ethiopia, different management options such as uprooting, slashing, burning, plowing, and applying synthetic herbicides have been practiced. However, these options are not sustainable in weed management. However, Zygogramma bicolorata is known to be used in different countries. Although many countries use it under field conditions, its population-based efficacy has not been well studied in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Z. bicolorata populations on parthenium plants under greenhouse conditions. Methods This experiment was conducted at the Ambo Agricultural Research Center. Different numbers of Z. bicolorata per plant were used as treatments and were laid out in a completely randomized design with three replications. The numbers of damaged leaves, eggs, and larvae were recorded daily until the leaves were completely defoliated. The collected data and the correlation between beetle population and leaf defoliation were analyzed using SAS. Results The result revealed that all beetle populations caused damage to weed plants. A higher population of beetles completely defoliated the leaves within 12 days. However, lower numbers required 21 days to completely defoliate the weed. In contrast, a higher number of eggs (328.67) and larvae (272.33) were obtained from plants that received 20 pairs of beetles. The beetle population and exposure time were positively correlated, and the effectiveness of the bioagent was greater following the emergence of larvae. Conclusions Z. bicolorata can manage parthenium weeds, even with a lower population. However, more than 15 pairs of beetles could be suggested to manage weeds in a shorter time, and further study is needed under field conditions by considering the different agroecologies of the country.

                Background This study aims to develop a vulnerability map for Surabaya using GIS-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to assess the city’s vulnerability to COVID-19. Methods Six key factors influencing vulnerability were identified and their relative importance determined through the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) pairwise comparison matrix. GIS was utilized to classify Surabaya’s vulnerability into five levels: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Results The resulting vulnerability map provides essential insights for decision-makers, healthcare professionals, and disaster management teams. It enables strategic resource allocation, targeted interventions, and formulation of comprehensive response strategies tailored to specific needs of vulnerable districts. Conclusions Through these measures, Surabaya can enhance its resilience and preparedness, ensuring the well-being of its residents in the face of potential emergency outbreaks.

                Small intestinal adenocarcinomas, comprising less than 5% of digestive cancers, present diagnostic and therapeutic intricacies often overshadowed by more common digestive malignancies. This report highlights the unique metachronous characteristic of the case, emphasizing the presence of intussusception, to contribute valuable knowledge and refine medical approaches for optimizing outcomes in these rare and complex scenarios. A 73-year-old male, previously operated for right colon adenocarcinoma, developed metachronous liver metastasis a year later, successfully treated. Presenting with acute intestinal obstruction, imaging confirmed mechanical obstruction, prompting small intestine resection and stoma creation. The postoperative phase, characterized by meticulous care, ensures ongoing close oncological follow-up for this complex medical journey, with the added complication of intussusception. Amid the rarity of small intestinal adenocarcinomas in digestive cancers, our unique case sheds light on the challenges in diagnosis and treatment, particularly highlighting the presence of intussusception. The distinctive approach of small intestine resection and stoma creation underscores ongoing debates on adjuvant chemotherapy, reflecting an evolving management landscape. This underscores the crucial role of continuous research and multidisciplinary strategies in optimizing outcomes for patients facing this uncommon malignancy complicated by intussusception. This report provides valuable insights into the complexities of diagnosing and managing small intestinal adenocarcinomas, particularly when complicated by intussusception. As we navigate this nuanced medical terrain, continuous research and multidisciplinary approaches remain pivotal for refining our understanding and optimizing outcomes in small intestinal adenocarcinomas.

                Background Twenty-two Arab countries share a common language, history, and culture. Nevertheless, governmental policies, healthcare systems, and resources differ from one Arab country to another. We have been following Coronavirus (COVID-19) from the beginning in each Arab country. In the present study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world and to compare these findings with other significantly affected countries. Methods Websites of the World Health Organization, World COVID-vaccinations tracker, Worldometer, and Ministries of Health were used to extract COVID-19 data in all Arab countries between the period January 2020 to December 2022. Results All Arab countries had 14,218,042 total confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13,384,924 total recovered cases and 173,544 total related deaths. The trend demonstrated that the third quarter of 2021 recorded the highest death toll and the first quarter of 2022 recorded the highest number of confirmed and recovered cases. Compared to the top 15 affected countries, the Arab world ranked last as it had the lowest overall incidence per million population (PMP) of 31,609. The data on total deaths PMP showed that India had the lowest number of deaths with only 377 cases followed by the Arab world with 386 cases. Conclusions Although the number of confirmed, death, and subsequently recovered cases of COVID-19 have greatly reduced in the last quarter of 2022 in most Arab countries, many Arab countries still need to re-campaign about COVID-19 vaccines and raise awareness programs about boosters. COVID-19 has had a relatively smaller impact on Arab countries than on other countries that have been significantly affected.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity are considered closely related motor signs in Parkinson disease (PD), but recent neurophysiological findings suggest distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. This study aims to examine and compare longitudinal changes in bradykinesia and rigidity in PD patients treated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical progression of appendicular and axial bradykinesia and rigidity was assessed up to 15 years after STN-DBS in the best treatment conditions (ON medication and ON stimulation). The severity of bradykinesia and rigidity was examined using ad hoc composite scores from specific subitems of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III). Short- and long-term predictors of bradykinesia and rigidity were analyzed through linear regression analysis, considering various preoperative demographic and clinical data, including disease duration and severity, phenotype, motor and cognitive scores (eg, frontal score), and medication.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 301 patients were examined before and 1 year after surgery. Among them, 101 and 56 individuals were also evaluated at 10-year and 15-year follow-ups, respectively. Bradykinesia significantly worsened after surgery, especially in appendicular segments (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, rigidity showed sustained benefit, with unchanged clinical scores compared to preoperative assessment (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Preoperative motor disability (eg, composite scores from the UPDRS-III) predicted short- and long-term outcomes for both bradykinesia and rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Executive dysfunction was specifically linked to bradykinesia but not to rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity show long-term divergent progression in PD following STN-DBS and are associated with independent clinical factors, supporting the hypothesis of partially distinct pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26948?af=R">Electroencephalographic Correlates of Clinical Severity in the Natural history study of RTT and Related Disorders</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to characterize quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) features in participants from the Natural history study of RTT and Related Disorders and to assess the potential for these features to act as objective measures of cortical function for Rett syndrome (RTT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>EEG amplitude and power features were derived from the resting EEG of 60 females with RTT (median age = 10.7 years) and 26 neurotypical females (median age = 10.6 years). Analyses focus on group differences and within the RTT group, associations between the EEG parameters and clinical severity. For a subset of participants (n = 20), follow-up data were available for assessing the reproducibility of the results and the stability in the parameters over 1 year.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to neurotypical participants, participants with RTT had greater amplitude variability and greater low-frequency activity as reflected by greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower theta/delta, alpha/delta, beta/delta, alpha/theta, and beta/theta ratios. Greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower power ratios were associated with greater severity. Analyses of year 1 data replicated the associations between 1/f slope and power ratios and clinical severity and demonstrated good within-subject consistency in these measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, group comparisons reflected a greater predominance of lower versus higher frequency activity in participants with RTT, which is consistent with prior clinical interpretations of resting EEG in this population. The observed associations between the EEG power measures and clinical assessments and the repeatability of these measures underscore the potential for EEG to provide an objective measure of cortical function and clinical severity for RTT.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Classic research has shown a division in the neuroanatomical structures that support flexible (e.g., short-cutting) and habitual (e.g., familiar route following) navigational behavior, with hippocampal–caudate systems associated with the former and putamen systems with the latter. There is, however, disagreement about whether the neural structures involved in navigation process particular forms of spatial information, such as associations between constellations of cues forming a cognitive map, versus single landmark-action associations, or alternatively, perform particular reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the use of different spatial strategies, so-called model-based (flexible) or model-free (habitual) forms of learning. We sought to test these theories by asking participants (<i>N</i> = 24) to navigate within a virtual environment through a previously learned, 9-junction route with distinctive landmarks at each junction while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a series of probe trials, we distinguished knowledge of individual landmark-action associations along the route versus knowledge of the correct <i>sequence</i> of landmark-action associations, either by having absent landmarks, or “out-of-sequence” landmarks. Under a map-based perspective, sequence knowledge would not require hippocampal systems, because there are no constellations of cues available for cognitive map formation. Within a learning-based model, however, responding based on knowledge of sequence <i>would</i> require hippocampal systems because prior context has to be utilized. We found that hippocampal–caudate systems were more active in probes requiring sequence knowledge, supporting the learning-based model. However, we also found greater putamen activation in probes where navigation based purely on sequence memory could be planned, supporting models of putamen function that emphasize its role in action sequencing.</p>

                Aging may lead to low-level chronic inflammation that increases the susceptibility to age-related conditions, including memory impairment and progressive loss of brain volume. As brain health is essential to promoting healthspan and lifespan, it is vital to understand age-related changes in the immune system and central nervous system (CNS) that drive normal brain aging. However, the relative importance, mechanistic interrelationships, and hierarchical order of such changes and their impact on normal brain aging remain to be clarified. Here, we synthesize accumulating evidence that age-related DNA damage and cellular senescence in the immune system and CNS contribute to the escalation of neuroinflammation and cognitive decline during normal brain aging. Targeting cellular senescence and immune modulation may provide a logical rationale for developing new treatment options to restore immune homeostasis and counteract age-related brain dysfunction and diseases.

                Neurons capable of mixed selectivity enhance the brain’s computational capabilities by responding to various inputs in complex ways, beyond simple combinations. Here, we describe possible neural mechanisms underlying mixed selectivity and discuss how they contribute to the brain’s dynamic flexibility in processing diverse information with efficiency.

                Gauld et al. use all-optical interrogation to probe sparse coding in the barrel cortex. They find that targeted photostimulation of task-silent neurons evokes perceptual choice bias and that these neurons are selectively suppressed by inhibition during whisker processing. Their findings show that silent neurons can be recruited to enhance behavior.

                Peterman et al. show that skin-resident macrophages, known as Langerhans cells, possess dynamic dendrites capable of surveilling the skin using actin- and ROCK-dependent mechanisms. Under steady-state conditions and upon tissue damage, Langerhans cells require the ROCK pathway to maintain cell morphology and respond to tissue damage.

                This study investigates the goal/habit imbalance theory of compulsion in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which postulates enhanced habit formation, increased automaticity, and impaired goal/habit arbitration. It directly tests these hypotheses using newly developed behavioral tasks. First, OCD patients and healthy participants were trained daily for a month using a smartphone app to perform chunked action sequences. Despite similar procedural learning and attainment of habitual performance (measured by an objective automaticity criterion) by both groups, OCD patients self-reported higher subjective habitual tendencies via a recently developed questionnaire. Subsequently, in a re-evaluation task assessing choices between established automatic and novel goal-directed actions, both groups were sensitive to re-evaluation based on monetary feedback. However, OCD patients, especially those with higher compulsive symptoms and habitual tendencies, showed a clear preference for trained/habitual sequences when choices were based on physical effort, possibly due to their higher attributed intrinsic value. These patients also used the habit-training app more extensively and reported symptom relief post-study. The tendency to attribute higher intrinsic value to familiar actions may be a potential mechanism leading to compulsions and an important addition to the goal/habit imbalance hypothesis in OCD. We also highlight the potential of smartphone app training as a habit reversal therapeutic tool.

                Environmental air irritants including nanosized carbon black (nCB) can drive systemic inflammation, promoting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema development. The <i>let-7</i> microRNA (<i>Mirlet7</i> miRNA) family is associated with IL-17-driven T cell inflammation, a canonical signature of lung inflammation. Recent evidence suggests the <i>Mirlet7</i> family is downregulated in patients with COPD, however, whether this repression conveys a functional consequence on emphysema pathology has not been elucidated. Here, we show that overall expression of the <i>Mirlet7</i> clusters, <i>Mirlet7b/Mirlet7c2</i> and <i>Mirlet7a1/Mirlet7f1/Mirlet7d</i>, are reduced in the lungs and T cells of smokers with emphysema as well as in mice with cigarette smoke (CS)- or nCB-elicited emphysema. We demonstrate that loss of the <i>Mirlet7b/Mirlet7c2</i> cluster in T cells predisposed mice to exaggerated CS- or nCB-elicited emphysema. Furthermore, ablation of the <i>Mirlet7b/Mirlet7c2</i> cluster enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup>IL17a<sup>+</sup> T cells (Tc17) formation in emphysema development in mice. Additionally, transgenic mice overexpressing <i>Mirlet7g</i> in T cells are resistant to Tc17 and CD4<sup>+</sup>IL17a<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th17) development when exposed to nCB. Mechanistically, our findings reveal the master regulator of Tc17/Th17 differentiation, RAR-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), as a direct target of <i>Mirlet7</i> in T cells. Overall, our findings shed light on the <i>Mirlet7/</i>RORγt axis with <i>Mirlet7</i> acting as a molecular brake in the generation of Tc17 cells and suggest a novel therapeutic approach for tempering the augmented IL-17-mediated response in emphysema.

                Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro. To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE, we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells (iPSC-RPE) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level. For this purpose, we utilized our recent invention, Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System (ALPS), which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression, the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles. We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation, from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/74940">SAFB regulates hippocampal stem cell fate by targeting Drosha to destabilize Nfib mRNA</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent and correct fate determination is crucial to guarantee brain formation and homeostasis. How NSCs are instructed to generate neuronal or glial progeny is not well understood. Here we addressed how murine adult hippocampal NSC fate is regulated and describe how Scaffold Attachment Factor B (SAFB) blocks oligodendrocyte production to enable neuron generation. We found that SAFB prevents NSC expression of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor I/B (NFIB) by binding to sequences in the <i>Nfib</i> mRNA and enhancing Drosha-dependent cleavage of the transcripts. We show that increasing SAFB expression prevents oligodendrocyte production by multipotent adult NSCs, and conditional deletion of <i>Safb</i> increases NFIB expression and oligodendrocyte formation in the adult hippocampus. Our results provide novel insights into a mechanism that controls Drosha functions for selective regulation of NSC fate by modulating the post-transcriptional destabilization of <i>Nfib</i> mRNA in a lineage-specific manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89947">Improved clinical data imputation via classical and quantum determinantal point processes</a></h4>

              
                Imputing data is a critical issue for machine learning practitioners, including in the life sciences domain, where missing clinical data is a typical situation and the reliability of the imputation is of great importance. Currently, there is no canonical approach for imputation of clinical data and widely used algorithms introduce variance in the downstream classification. Here we propose novel imputation methods based on determinantal point processes (DPP) that enhance popular techniques such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations and MissForest. Their advantages are twofold: improving the quality of the imputed data demonstrated by increased accuracy of the downstream classification and providing deterministic and reliable imputations that remove the variance from the classification results. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our methods by performing extensive imputations on synthetic and real clinical data. We also perform quantum hardware experiments by applying the quantum circuits for DPP sampling since such quantum algorithms provide a computational advantage with respect to classical ones. We demonstrate competitive results with up to 10 qubits for small-scale imputation tasks on a state-of-the-art IBM quantum processor. Our classical and quantum methods improve the effectiveness and robustness of clinical data prediction modeling by providing better and more reliable data imputations. These improvements can add significant value in settings demanding high precision, such as in pharmaceutical drug trials where our approach can provide higher confidence in the predictions made.

	<p>In patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a lower level of cognitive function is associated with a higher likelihood of progression to dementia. In addition, gait disturbances and structural changes on brain MRI scans reflect cognitive levels. Therefore, we aimed to classify MCI based on cognitive level using gait parameters and brain MRI data. Eighty patients diagnosed with MCI from three dementia centres in Gangwon-do, Korea, were recruited for this study. We defined MCI as a Clinical Dementia Rating global score of &amp;amp;ge;0.5, with a memory domain score of &amp;amp;ge;0.5. Patients were classified as early-stage or late-stage MCI based on their mini-mental status examination (MMSE) z-scores. We trained a machine learning model using gait and MRI data parameters. The convolutional neural network (CNN) resulted in the best classifier performance in separating late-stage MCI from early-stage MCI; its performance was maximised when feature patterns that included multimodal features (GAIT + white matter dataset) were used. The single support time was the strongest predictor. Machine learning that incorporated gait and white matter parameters achieved the highest accuracy in distinguishing between late-stage MCI and early-stage MCI.</p>

	<p>The Michelangelo effect is a phenomenon that shows a reduction in perceived effort and an improvement in performance among both healthy subjects and patients when completing a motor task related to artistic stimuli, compared to performing the same task with non-artistic stimuli. It could contribute to the efficacy of art therapy in neurorehabilitation. In this study, the possible occurrence of this effect was tested in a cognitive task by asking 15 healthy subjects and 17 patients with a history of stroke to solve a digital version of the classical memory card game. Three different types of images were used in a randomized order: French cards, artistic portraits, and photos of famous people (to compensate for the possible effects of face recognition). Healthy subjects were involved to test the usability and the load demand of the developed system, reporting no statistically significant differences among the three sessions (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conversely, patients had a better performance in terms of time (p = 0.014) and the number of attempts (p = 0.007) needed to complete the task in the presence of artistic stimuli, accompanied by a reduction in the perceived effort (p = 0.033). Furthermore, artistic stimuli, with respect to the other two types of images, seemed more associated with visuospatial control than linguistic functions.</p>

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysian consumers were more likely to purchase food online and have it delivered to their doorstep. To stay afloat, many restaurants were pushed to provide online food delivery services (OFDS), and this sector has grown tremendously. However, will the trend persist after the pandemic? This study aims to look into how consumers’ perceptions of OFDS affect their attitude towards them. It investigates the relationship between convenience motivation, perceived ease of use, time-saving orientation and price-saving orientation in terms of future intent to use OFDS. Method Primary data was collected from 307 respondents in Malaysia using convenience sampling method through an online survey. Respondents’ demographic background was presented statistically in cross tabulation tables to study the ratio comparison implicitly. Consistent Partial Least Square approach and bootstrapping techniques with 5,000 subsamples was employed, with the aid of SmartPLS.V3 software, to identify the significant factors influencing consumers’ continuance intention after the pandemic. Result Perceived ease of use does not contribute significantly to continuance intention as most consumers have prior online purchase experience. Nevertheless, time-saving orientation has a positive correlation with perceived ease of use due to the simplicity of placing an order with just a click. It is also found that price-saving orientation is related to convenience motivation, particularly when prices can be compared on the websites or online ordering platforms. Consumers’ intention to continue using OFDS even after the COVID-19 pandemic is positively influenced by all the parameters studied, except for perceived ease of use. Conclusion Limited work has been done on the continuance intention to use OFDS beyond the pandemic. This study provides insight for food retailers on how to enhance their business and retain their customers with the support of technology, even after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Introduction HIV affects over 38 million people worldwide, affecting the immune system and leading to symptoms like fever, lymphadenopathy, and sore throat. High viral loads can lead to opportunistic infections and tumors. The life expectancy of HIV patients has increased due to high-efficiency combination anti-retroviral therapy. Urothelial carcinoma, a malignant development, damages the urinary canal lining. The connection between HIV and urinary cancers is unclear, the aims of this study to report a case of urethral urothelial Carcinoma in HIV patient who underwent total urethrectomy and perineal urethrostomy. Case presentation A 34-year-old male patient with a papilliferous lump on the glans penis for over six months was admitted to the hospital. Preoperative screening revealed HIV and a urethral mass was found. A partial urethrectomy was performed, revealing high grade papillary urothelial Carcinoma. Five months after surgery, the patient developed a recurrent lump, requiring a total urethrectomy, TUR (transurethral resection) of the mass in the prostatic urethra, and perineal urethrostomy. Conclusion Primary carcinoma of the urethra in HIV patient is an extremely rare case. To date, there is no consensus on the primary urethral carcinoma therapy. The treatment of primary urethral carcinoma is tailored specifically to the patient based on the location, histology, and stage of the carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-460/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Branch retinal vein occlusion following COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection while taking oral contraceptives [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Oral contraceptive use, vaccination for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) generally develops mid-60s patients. Herein, we present a case of BRVO caused by the above mentioned risk factors in a young woman. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about BRVO associated with oral contraceptives, COVID-19 vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2. A 21-year-old woman presented with loss of visual acuity in her right eye for 10 days. She had been receiving oral contraceptives for 2 years for oligomenorrhea before noticing ophthalmological symptoms. Despite having received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, she contracted COVID-19 and developed fever, sore throat, cough, low back pain, and general malaise about 40 days before the initial visit. However, only cough persisted for more than a month. The right eye showed BRVO with macular edema (ME). She did not smoke nor had diabetes or hypertension. Blood test results, including cardiolipin antibody IgG, were normal. She was treated with an intravitreal aflibercept injection. ME in the fundus showed rapid improvement and resolution. Although more than 20 months have passed since the first injection, there has been no relapse of ME. The combination of oral contraceptive use, COVID-19 vaccination, and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce the development of venous thromboembolism, thereby leading to BRVO. Given that cases of COVID-19 have increased globally, patients with retinal vein occlusion who use oral contraceptives are likely to be encountered more frequently.

                <p>A classic example of experience-dependent plasticity is ocular dominance (OD) shift, in which the responsiveness of neurons in the visual cortex is profoundly altered following monocular deprivation (MD). It has been postulated that OD shifts also modify global neural networks, but such effects have never been demonstrated. Here, we use wide-field fluorescence optical imaging (WFOI) to characterize calcium-based resting-state functional connectivity during acute (3&nbsp;d) MD in female and male mice with genetically encoded calcium indicators (<I>Thy1</I>-GCaMP6f). We first establish the fundamental performance of WFOI by computing signal to noise properties throughout our data processing pipeline. Following MD, we found that  band (0.4&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) GCaMP6 activity in the deprived visual cortex decreased, suggesting that excitatory activity in this region was reduced by MD. In addition, interhemispheric visual homotopic functional connectivity decreased following MD, which was accompanied by a reduction in parietal and motor homotopic connectivity. Finally, we observed enhanced internetwork connectivity between the visual and parietal cortex that peaked 2&nbsp;d after MD. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that early MD induces dynamic reorganization of disparate functional networks including the association cortices.</p>

                <p>GPR37L1 is an orphan receptor that couples through heterotrimeric G-proteins to regulate physiological functions. Since its role in humans is not fully defined, we used an unbiased computational approach to assess the clinical significance of rare <I>G-protein-coupled receptor 37-like 1</I> (<I>GPR37L1</I>) genetic variants found among 51,289 whole-exome sequences from the DiscovEHR cohort. Rare <I>GPR37L1</I> coding variants were binned according to predicted pathogenicity and analyzed by sequence kernel association testing to reveal significant associations with disease diagnostic codes for epilepsy and migraine, among others. Since associations do not prove causality, rare <I>GPR37L1</I> variants were functionally analyzed in SK-N-MC cells to evaluate potential signaling differences and pathogenicity. Notably, receptor variants exhibited varying abilities to reduce cAMP levels, activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and/or upregulate receptor expression in response to the agonist prosaptide (TX14(A)), as compared with the wild-type receptor. In addition to signaling changes, knock-out (KO) of <I>GPR37L1</I> or expression of certain rare variants altered cellular cholesterol levels, which were also acutely regulated by administration of the agonist TX14(A) via activation of the MAPK pathway. Finally, to simulate the impact of rare nonsense variants found in the large patient cohort, a KO mouse line lacking <I>Gpr37l1</I> was generated. Although KO animals did not recapitulate an acute migraine phenotype, the loss of this receptor produced sex-specific changes in anxiety-related disorders often seen in chronic migraineurs. Collectively, these observations define the existence of rare <I>GPR37L1</I> variants associated with neuropsychiatric conditions in the human population and identify the signaling changes contributing to pathological processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/19/e1397232024?rss=1">Balancing the Senses: Electrophysiological Responses Reveal the Interplay between Somatosensory and Visual Processing During Body-Related Multisensory Conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the study of bodily awareness, the predictive coding theory has revealed that our brain continuously modulates sensory experiences to integrate them into a unitary body representation. Indeed, during multisensory illusions (e.g., the rubber hand illusion, RHI), the synchronous stroking of the participant&rsquo;s concealed hand and a fake visible one creates a visuotactile conflict, generating a prediction error. Within the predictive coding framework, through sensory processing modulation, prediction errors are solved, inducing participants to feel as if touches originated from the fake hand, thus ascribing the fake hand to their own body. Here, we aimed to address sensory processing modulation under multisensory conflict, by disentangling somatosensory and visual stimuli processing that are intrinsically associated during the illusion induction. To this aim, we designed two EEG experiments, in which somatosensory- (SEPs; Experiment 1; <I>N</I> = 18; <I>F</I> = 10) and visual-evoked potentials (VEPs; Experiment 2; <I>N</I> = 18; <I>F</I> = 9) were recorded in human males and females following the RHI. Our results show that, in both experiments, ERP amplitude is significantly modulated in the illusion as compared with both control and baseline conditions, with a modality-dependent diametrical pattern showing decreased SEP amplitude and increased VEP amplitude. Importantly, both somatosensory and visual modulations occur in long-latency time windows previously associated with tactile and visual awareness, thus explaining the illusion of perceiving touch at the sight location. In conclusion, we describe a diametrical modulation of somatosensory and visual processing as the neural mechanism that allows maintaining a stable body representation, by restoring visuotactile congruency under the occurrence of multisensory conflicts.</p>

                <p>How humans transform sensory information into decisions that steer purposeful behavior is a central question in psychology and neuroscience that is traditionally investigated during the sampling of external environmental signals. The decision-making framework of gradual information sampling toward a decision has also been proposed to apply when sampling internal sensory evidence from working memory. However, neural evidence for this proposal remains scarce. Here we show (using scalp EEG in male and female human volunteers) that sampling internal visual representations from working memory elicits a scalp EEG potential associated with gradual evidence accumulation&mdash;the central parietal positivity. Consistent with an evolving decision process, we show how this signal (1) scales with the time participants require to reach a decision about the cued memory content and (2) is amplified when having to decide among multiple contents in working memory. These results bring the electrophysiology of decision-making into the domain of working memory and suggest that variability in memory-guided behavior may be driven (at least in part) by variations in the sampling of our inner mental contents.</p>

                <p>The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B is implicated in recessive intellectual disability disorders, and heterozygous, protein-truncating variants in <I>KDM5B</I> are associated with reduced cognitive function in the population. The KDM5 family of lysine demethylases has developmental and homeostatic functions in the brain, some of which appear to be independent of lysine demethylase activity. To determine the functions of KDM5B in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we first studied male and female mice homozygous for a <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> allele that lacks demethylase activity. <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID/</I><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> mice exhibited hyperactivity and long-term memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks. The expression of immediate early, activity-dependent genes was downregulated in these mice and hyperactivated upon a learning stimulus compared with wild-type (WT) mice. A number of other learning-associated genes were also significantly dysregulated in the <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID/</I><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> hippocampus. Next, we knocked down <I>Kdm5b</I> specifically in the adult, WT mouse hippocampus with shRNA. <I>Kdm5b</I> knockdown resulted in spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and long-term potentiation deficits. These findings identify KDM5B as a critical regulator of gene expression and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus and suggest that at least some of the cognitive phenotypes associated with <I>KDM5B</I> gene variants are caused by direct effects on memory consolidation mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Glycinergic neurons regulate nociceptive and pruriceptive signaling in the spinal cord, but the identity and role of the glycine-regulated neurons are not fully known. Herein, we have characterized spinal glycine receptor alpha 3 (<I>Glra3</I>) subunit-expressing neurons in <I>Glra3</I>-Cre female and male mice. <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons express <I>Glra3</I>, are located mainly in laminae III&ndash;VI, and respond to glycine. Chemogenetic activation of spinal <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons induced biting/licking, stomping, and guarding behaviors, indicative of both a nociceptive and pruriceptive role for this population. Chemogenetic inhibition did not affect mechanical or thermal responses but reduced behaviors evoked by compound 48/80 and chloroquine, revealing a pruriceptive role for these neurons. Spinal cells activated by compound 48/80 or chloroquine express <I>Glra3</I>, further supporting the phenotype. Retrograde tracing revealed that spinal <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons receive input from afferents associated with pain and itch, and dorsal root stimulation validated the monosynaptic input. In conclusion, these results show that spinal <I>Glra3</I>(+) neurons contribute to acute communication of compound 48/80- and chloroquine-induced itch in hairy skin.</p>

                <p>Coordinated neuronal activity has been identified to play an important role in information processing and transmission in the brain. However, current research predominantly focuses on understanding the properties and functions of neuronal coordination in hippocampal and cortical areas, leaving subcortical regions relatively unexplored. In this study, we use single-unit recordings in female Sprague Dawley rats to investigate the properties and functions of groups of neurons exhibiting coordinated activity in the auditory thalamus&mdash;the medial geniculate body (MGB). We reliably identify coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs), which are groups of neurons that fire synchronously, in the MGB. cNEs are shown not to be the result of false-positive detections or by-products of slow-state oscillations in anesthetized animals. We demonstrate that cNEs in the MGB have enhanced information-encoding properties over individual neurons. Their neuronal composition is stable between spontaneous and evoked activity, suggesting limited stimulus-induced ensemble dynamics. These MGB cNE properties are similar to what is observed in cNEs in the primary auditory cortex (A1), suggesting that ensembles serve as a ubiquitous mechanism for organizing local networks and play a fundamental role in sensory processing within the brain.</p>

                <p>Excitotoxicity and the concurrent loss of inhibition are well-defined mechanisms driving acute elevation in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and neuronal cell death following an ischemic insult to the brain. Despite the high prevalence of long-term disability in survivors of global cerebral ischemia (GCI) as a consequence of cardiac arrest, it remains unclear whether E/I imbalance persists beyond the acute phase and negatively affects functional recovery. We previously demonstrated sustained impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons correlating with deficits in learning and memory tasks in a murine model of cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Here, we use CA/CPR and an in vitro ischemia model to elucidate mechanisms by which E/I imbalance contributes to ongoing hippocampal dysfunction in male mice. We reveal increased postsynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) clustering and function in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that reduces the E/I ratio. Importantly, reduced GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R clustering observed in the first 24&nbsp;h rebounds to an elevation of GABAergic clustering by 3&nbsp;d postischemia. This increase in GABAergic inhibition required activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ion channel transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2), previously implicated in persistent LTP and memory deficits following CA/CPR. Furthermore, we find Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling, likely downstream of TRPM2 activation, upregulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity, thereby driving the elevation of postsynaptic inhibitory function. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism by which inhibitory synaptic strength is upregulated in the context of ischemia and identify TRPM2 and CaMKII as potential pharmacological targets to restore perturbed synaptic plasticity and ameliorate cognitive function.</p>

                <p>BMAL2 (ARNTL2) is a paralog of BMAL1 that can form heterodimers with the other circadian factors CLOCK and NPAS2 to activate transcription of clock and clock-controlled genes. To assess a possible role of <I>Bmal2</I> in the circadian regulation of metabolism, we investigated daily variations of energy metabolism, feeding behavior, and locomotor behavior, as well as ability to anticipate restricted food access in male mice knock-out for <I>Bmal2</I> (B2KO). While their amount of food intake and locomotor activity were normal compared with wild-type mice, B2KO mice displayed increased adiposity (1.5-fold higher) and fasted hyperinsulinemia (fourfold higher) and tended to have lower energy expenditure at night. Impairment of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei was evidenced by the shorter free-running period (&ndash;14&nbsp;min/cycle) of B2KO mice compared with wild-type controls and by a loss of daily rhythmicity in expression of intracellular metabolic regulators (e.g., <I>Lipoprotein lipase</I> and <I>Uncoupling protein 2</I>). The circadian window of eating was longer in B2KO mice. The circadian patterns of food intake and meal numbers were bimodal in control mice but not in B2KO mice. In response to restricted feeding, food-anticipatory activity was almost prevented in B2KO mice, suggesting altered food clock that controls anticipation of food availability. In the mediobasal hypothalamus of B2KO mice, expression of genes coding orexigenic neuropeptides (including <I>Neuropeptide y</I> and <I>Agouti-Related Peptide</I>) was downregulated, while <I>Lipoprotein lipase</I> expression lost its rhythmicity. Together, these data highlight that BMAL2 has major impacts on brain regulation of metabolic rhythms, sleep&ndash;wake cycle, and food anticipation.</p>

                <p>Perception is a probabilistic process dependent on external stimulus properties and one's internal state. However, which internal states influence perception and via what mechanisms remain debated. We studied how spontaneous alpha-band activity (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) and pupil fluctuations impact visual detection and confidence across stimulus contrast levels (i.e., the contrast response function, CRF). In human subjects of both sexes, we found that low prestimulus alpha power induced an "additive" shift in the CRF, whereby stimuli were reported present more frequently at all contrast levels, including contrast of zero (i.e., false alarms). Conversely, prestimulus pupil size had a "multiplicative" effect on detection such that stimuli occurring during large pupil states (putatively corresponding to higher arousal) were perceived more frequently as contrast increased. Signal detection modeling reveals that alpha power changes detection criteria equally across the CRF but not detection sensitivity (<I>d</I>'), whereas pupil-linked arousal modulated sensitivity, particularly for higher contrasts. Interestingly, pupil size and alpha power were positively correlated, meaning that some of the effect of alpha on detection may be mediated by pupil fluctuations. However, pupil-independent alpha still induced an additive shift in the CRF corresponding to a criterion effect. Our data imply that low alpha boosts detection and confidence by an additive factor, rather than by a multiplicative scaling of contrast responses, a profile which captures the effect of pupil-linked arousal. We suggest that alpha power and arousal fluctuations have dissociable effects on behavior. Alpha reflects the baseline level of visual excitability, which can vary independent of arousal.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus receives powerful synaptic inputs from corticotectal neurons in the visual cortex. The function of these corticotectal neurons remains largely unknown due to a limited understanding of their response properties and connectivity. Here, we use antidromic methods to identify corticotectal neurons in awake male and female rabbits, and measure their axonal conduction times, thalamic inputs and receptive field properties. All corticotectal neurons responded to sinusoidal drifting gratings with a nonlinear (nonsinusoidal) increase in mean firing rate but showed pronounced differences in their ON&ndash;OFF receptive field structures that we classified into three groups, Cx, S2, and S1. Cx receptive fields had highly overlapping ON and OFF subfields as classical complex cells, S2 had largely separated ON and OFF subfields as classical simple cells, and S1 had a single ON or OFF subfield. Thus, all corticotectal neurons are homogeneous in their nonlinear spatial summation but very heterogeneous in their spatial integration of ON and OFF inputs. The Cx type had the fastest conducting axons, the highest spontaneous activity, and the strongest and fastest visual responses. The S2 type had the highest orientation selectivity, and the S1 type had the slowest conducting axons. Moreover, our cross-correlation analyses found that a subpopulation of corticotectal neurons with very fast conducting axons and high spontaneous firing rates (largely "Cx" type) receives monosynaptic input from retinotopically aligned thalamic neurons. This previously unrecognized fast-conducting thalamic-mediated corticotectal pathway may provide specialized information to superior colliculus and prime recipient neurons for subsequent corticotectal or retinal synaptic input.</p>

                <p>Elevated iron deposition in the brain has been observed in older adult humans and persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has been associated with lower cognitive performance. We investigated the impact of iron deposition, and its topographical distribution across hippocampal subfields and segments (anterior, posterior) measured along its longitudinal axis, on episodic memory in a sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults at elevated familial risk for AD (<I>N</I> = 172, 120 females, 52 males; mean age = 68.8 &plusmn; 5.4 years). MRI-based quantitative susceptibility maps were acquired to derive estimates of hippocampal iron deposition. The Mnemonic Similarity Task was used to measure pattern separation and pattern completion, two hippocampally mediated episodic memory processes. Greater hippocampal iron load was associated with lower pattern separation and higher pattern completion scores, both indicators of poorer episodic memory. Examination of iron levels within hippocampal subfields across its long axis revealed topographic specificity. Among the subfields and segments investigated here, iron deposition in the posterior hippocampal CA1 was the most robustly and negatively associated with the fidelity memory representations. This association remained after controlling for hippocampal volume and was observed in the context of normal performance on standard neuropsychological memory measures. These findings reveal that the impact of iron load on episodic memory performance is not uniform across the hippocampus. Both iron deposition levels as well as its spatial distribution, must be taken into account when examining the relationship between hippocampal iron and episodic memory in older adults at elevated risk for AD.</p>

                <p>Exercise is known to benefit motor skill learning in health and neurological disease. Evidence from brain stimulation, genotyping, and Parkinson's disease studies converge to suggest that the dopamine D2 receptor, and shifts in the cortical excitation and inhibition (E:I) balance, are prime candidates for the drivers of exercise-enhanced motor learning. However, causal evidence using experimental pharmacological challenge is lacking. We hypothesized that the modulatory effect of the dopamine D2 receptor on exercise-induced changes in the E:I balance would determine the magnitude of motor skill acquisition. To test this, we measured exercise-induced changes in excitation and inhibition using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 22 healthy female and male humans, and then had participants learn a novel motor skill&mdash;the sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT). We examined the effect of D2 receptor blockade (800&nbsp;mg sulpiride) on these measures within a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our key result was that motor skill acquisition was driven by an interaction between the D2 receptor and E:I balance. Specifically, poorer skill learning was related to an attenuated shift in the E:I balance in the sulpiride condition, whereas this interaction was not evident in placebo. Our results demonstrate that exercise-primed motor skill acquisition is causally influenced by D2 receptor activity on motor cortical circuits.</p>

                <p>Animals must distinguish the sensory consequences of self-generated movements (reafference) from those of other-generated movements (exafference). Only self-generated movements entail the production of motor copies (i.e., corollary discharges), which are compared with reafference in the cerebellum to compute predictive or internal models of movement. Internal models emerge gradually over the first three postnatal weeks in rats through a process that is not yet fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated in postnatal day (P) 8 and P12 rats that precerebellar nuclei convey corollary discharge and reafference to the cerebellum during active (REM) sleep when pups produce limb twitches. Here, recording from a deep cerebellar nucleus (interpositus, IP) in P12 rats of both sexes, we compared reafferent and exafferent responses with twitches and limb stimulations, respectively. As expected, most IP units showed robust responses to twitches. However, in contrast with other sensory structures throughout the brain, relatively few IP units showed exafferent responses. Upon finding that exafferent responses occurred in pups under urethane anesthesia, we hypothesized that urethane inhibits cerebellar cortical cells, thereby disinhibiting exafferent responses in IP. In support of this hypothesis, ablating cortical tissue dorsal to IP mimicked the effects of urethane on exafference. Finally, the results suggest that twitch-related corollary discharge and reafference are conveyed simultaneously and in parallel to cerebellar cortex and IP. Based on these results, we propose that twitches provide opportunities for the nascent cerebellum to integrate somatotopically organized corollary discharge and reafference, thereby enabling the development of closed-loop circuits and, subsequently, internal models.</p>

                <p>Forebrain neurons deprived of activity become hyperactive when activity is restored. Rebound activity has been linked to spontaneous seizures in vivo following prolonged activity blockade. Here, we measured the time course of rebound activity and the contributing circuit mechanisms using calcium imaging, synaptic staining, and whole-cell patch clamp in organotypic slice cultures of mouse neocortex. Calcium imaging revealed hypersynchronous activity increasing in intensity with longer periods of deprivation. While activity partially recovered 3&nbsp;d after slices were released from 5&nbsp;d of deprivation, they were less able to recover after 10&nbsp;d of deprivation. However, even after the longer period of deprivation, activity patterns eventually returned to baseline levels. The degree of deprivation-induced rebound was age-dependent, with the greatest effects occurring when silencing began in the second week. Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors indicated that hypersynchronous rebound activity did not require activation of Hebbian plasticity. In single-neuron recordings, input resistance roughly doubled with a concomitant increase in intrinsic excitability. Synaptic imaging of pre- and postsynaptic proteins revealed dramatic reductions in the number of presumptive synapses with a larger effect on inhibitory than excitatory synapses. Putative excitatory synapses colocalizing PSD-95 and Bassoon declined by 39 and 56% following 5 and 10&nbsp;d of deprivation, but presumptive inhibitory synapses colocalizing gephyrin and VGAT declined by 55 and 73%, respectively. The results suggest that with prolonged deprivation, a progressive reduction in synapse number is accompanied by a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition and increased cellular excitability.</p>

                Background Relationship age, hemoglobin, and physical frailty have all been investigated in older people with more than one chronic disease. There has been little analysis of the relationship between hemoglobin, age, physical frailty, plasma levels of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), and the gene polymorphism (SNP) rs7895833 A>G. The goal of this study was to find out how SIRT1 level, SNP rs7895833, hemoglobin, age, and physical frailty (frail score) are related in older Indonesian adults with comorbid chronic diseases. Methods This was an observational study. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from the electronic health records of Universitas Sumatera Utara Hospital, Medan, Indonesia. Physical frailty, SIRT1 level, and SNP rs7895833 were measured using an appropriate and valid method. Purposive sampling was used to determine the eligibility of 132 elderly adults from November 2022 to February 2023. Results The indirect effect of hemoglobin on the frail score (FS) through age was negative and significant, according to a conditional mediation analysis (β=-0.0731; p=0.023). Meanwhile, the direct effect of hemoglobin on the FS was negative and not significant (β=0.1632; p=0.052). According to the conditional moderated mediation analysis, the size of the direct effect of age on FS was increased by genotype AG-GG and SIRT1 level (βlow=0.2647; p=0.002, βmiddle=0.2956; p<0.001, and βhigh=0.319; p<0.001). The size of the conditional indirect effect of Hemoglobin on FS through age was negative and significantly increased by SNP genotype AG-GG and SIRT1 level (βlow=-0.0647; p=0.032, βmiddle=-0.0723; p=0.024, and βhigh=-0.078; p=0.02). Conclusions Higher plasma levels of SIRT1 and the SNP genotype AG-GG may both contribute to physical frailty in the elderly population. Hemoglobin levels in the blood fall with age, which can negatively impact older persons who already have chronic diseases. However, the interactions between these factors are intricate, requiring more study to completely understand the processes underlying development.

                The study reported in this paper investigates the impact of the interaction between brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments and its impact on the development of informational concepts among cybersecurity students. The quantitative data were collected by means of Information Concept Test to determine the levels of information concepts according to the Frayer model (1969). The research sample consists of 80 male and female undergraduate students in Qassim University, who were classified into four quasi-experimental groups according to their preferred patterns in the infographic. Quantitative analysis of findings from this study shows an effect for the interaction between the variables of brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments in the test scores of information concepts in the post-administration, where the significance level (.011) is less than the significance level (0.05). Findings also revealed that the repetition of information at increasing intervals of time using the infographics is effective to learning concepts in an organized manner and to improving short memory. Furthermore, the mental model’s strategy also helped to retain information. The study recommends encouraging the use of brain-based learning strategies and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments to explore the relationships between different scientific concepts, to expand students’ knowledge, and to discover inter-relationships between different subject elements. The study provides a platform for further research to employ different brain-based learning strategies within e-learning environments to acquire higher-order thinking skills and improve students’ memory and mental capacity with the use of modern technological techniques that achieve learning quality.

The activation levels of biologically significant gene sets are emerging tumor molecular markers and play an irreplaceable role in the tumor research field; however, web-based tools for prognostic analyses using it as a tumor molecular marker remain scarce. We developed a web-based tool PESSA for survival analysis using gene set activation levels. All data analyses were implemented via R. Activation levels of The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets were assessed using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method based on data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and supplementary tables of articles. PESSA was used to perform median and optimal cut-off dichotomous grouping of ssGSEA scores for each dataset, relying on the survival and survminer packages for survival analysis and visualisation. PESSA is an open-access web tool for visualizing the results of tumor prognostic analyses using gene set activation levels. A total of 238 datasets from the GEO, TCGA, EGA, and supplementary tables of articles; covering 51 cancer types and 13 survival outcome types; and 13,434 tumor-related gene sets are obtained from MSigDB for pre-grouping. Users can obtain the results, including Kaplan–Meier analyses based on the median and optimal cut-off values and accompanying visualization plots and the Cox regression analyses of dichotomous and continuous variables, by selecting the gene set markers of interest. PESSA (https://smuonco.shinyapps.io/PESSA/ OR http://robinl-lab.com/PESSA) is a large-scale web-based tumor survival analysis tool covering a large amount of data that creatively uses predefined gene set activation levels as molecular markers of tumors.

                <p>by Ryeonghwa Kang, Kyungdeok Kim, Yewon Jung, Sang-Han Choi, Chanhee Lee, Geun Ho Im, Miram Shin, Kwangmin Ryu, Subin Choi, Esther Yang, Wangyong Shin, Seungjoon Lee, Suho Lee, Zachary Papadopoulos, Ji Hoon Ahn, Gou-Young Koh, Jonathan Kipnis, Hyojin Kang, Hyun Kim, Won-Ki Cho, Soochul Park, Seong-Gi Kim, Eunjoon Kim</p>

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently accompany macrocephaly, which often involves hydrocephalic enlargement of brain ventricles. Katnal2 is a microtubule-regulatory protein strongly linked to ASD, but it remains unclear whether Katnal2 knockout (KO) in mice leads to microtubule- and ASD-related molecular, synaptic, brain, and behavioral phenotypes. We found that Katnal2-KO mice display ASD-like social communication deficits and age-dependent progressive ventricular enlargements. The latter involves increased length and beating frequency of motile cilia on ependymal cells lining ventricles. Katnal2-KO hippocampal neurons surrounded by enlarged lateral ventricles show progressive synaptic deficits that correlate with ASD-like transcriptomic changes involving synaptic gene down-regulation. Importantly, early postnatal Katnal2 re-expression prevents ciliary, ventricular, and behavioral phenotypes in Katnal2-KO adults, suggesting a causal relationship and a potential treatment. Therefore, Katnal2 negatively regulates ependymal ciliary function and its deletion in mice leads to ependymal ciliary hyperfunction and hydrocephalus accompanying ASD-related behavioral, synaptic, and transcriptomic changes.

                In statistical analyses, a common practice for enhancing the validity of variance analysis is the application of data transformation to convert measurements into a different mathematical scale. This technique was first employed in 1898 by Edgeworth and remains relevant in current scientific publications despite the proliferation of more modern and advanced techniques that obviate the need for certain assumptions. Data transformations, when appropriately used, can make the model error terms approximate a normal distribution. It is also possible to use the technique to correct the heterogeneity of variances or to render an additive model, ensuring the validity of the analysis of variances. Given that this technique can be hastily applied, potentially leading to erroneous or invalid results, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies in the field of agrarian sciences that utilized data transformations for the validation of analysis of variances. The aim was to check the transformations employed by the scientific community, the motivation behind their use, and to identify possible errors and inconsistencies in applying the technique in publications. In this study, we identified shortcomings and misconceptions associated with using this method, and we observed incomplete and inadequate utilization of the technique in 94.28% of the analysed sample, resulting in misguided and erroneous conclusions in scientific research outcomes.
