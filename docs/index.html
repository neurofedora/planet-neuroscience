              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23629?af=R">Don't ignore the middle: Distinct mnemonic functions of intermediate hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal region of the hippocampus (dHC) mediates many of the mnemonic functions traditionally associated with the hippocampus proper, such as spatial and episodic memory, whereas ventral hippocampus (vHC) has been extensively implicated in emotional memory and motivational processes. By contrast, the functions of the intermediate hippocampus (iHC) are far less understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mnemonic functions of iHC by reversibly inactivating iHC prior to testing memory in behavioral tasks dependent on the integrity of dHC, iHC, or vHC, namely, rapid place water maze, inhibitory avoidance, spontaneous alternation, and temporal ordering of odors. Given our previous findings showing that dHC and vHC are involved in mnemonic control of ingestive behavior, we also assessed the effects of iHC inactivation on sucrose intake. The results showed that pharmacological inhibition of iHC impairs rapid place water maze memory, which has been previously shown to be dependent on iHC but not dHC or vHC. iHC inactivation does not impact memory dependent on dHC (spontaneous alternation), vHC (temporal odor memory), or either dHC or vHC (inhibitory avoidance), and only modestly affects sucrose intake. These findings provide support for the involvement of iHC in mnemonic functions that are distinct from dHC and vHC and highlight the need to further advance our understanding of the functions of this hippocampal region that has been relatively understudied.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23624?af=R">Scene construction processes in the anterior hippocampus during temporal episodic memory retrieval</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the hippocampus has been implicated in both the temporal organization of memories and association of scene elements, some theoretical accounts posit that the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory is largely atemporal. In this study, we set out to explore this discrepancy by identifying hippocampal activity patterns related to scene construction while participants performed a temporal order memory task. Participants in the fMRI scanner were shown a sequence of photographs, each consisting of a central object and a contextual background scene. On each retrieval trial, participants were shown a pair of the original photographs (FULL), objects from the scenes without the background (OBJ), or background contexts without the main foreground object (BACK). In the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, participants judged the temporal order of the pair of scenes; in the Viewing trials, two identical scenes were shown without any task. First, we found that the anterior hippocampus—particularly the CA1 and subiculum—showed similar patterns of activation between the BACK and OBJ conditions, suggesting that scene construction occurred spontaneously during both TOJ and Viewing. Furthermore, neural markers of scene construction in the anterior hippocampus did not apply to incorrect trials, showing that successful temporal memory retrieval was functionally linked to scene construction. In the cortex, time-processing areas, such as the supplementary motor area and the precuneus, and scene-processing areas, such as the parahippocampal cortex, were activated and functionally connected with the hippocampus. Together, these results support the view that the hippocampus is concurrently involved in scene construction and temporal organization of memory and propose a model of hippocampal episodic memory that takes both processes into account.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27049?af=R">Multiparametric Characterization of Focal Cortical Dysplasia Using 3D MR Fingerprinting</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To develop a multiparametric machine-learning (ML) framework using high-resolution 3 dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) fingerprinting (MRF) data for quantitative characterization of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD).</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>We included 119 subjects, 33 patients with focal epilepsy and histopathologically confirmed FCD, 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs), and 26 disease controls (DCs). Subjects underwent whole-brain 3 Tesla MRF acquisition, the reconstruction of which generated T1 and T2 relaxometry maps. A 3D region of interest was manually created for each lesion, and z-score normalization using HC data was performed. We conducted 2D classification with ensemble models using MRF T1 and T2 mean and standard deviation from gray matter and white matter for FCD versus controls. Subtype classification additionally incorporated entropy and uniformity of MRF metrics, as well as morphometric features from the morphometric analysis program (MAP). We translated 2D results to individual probabilities using the percentage of slices above an adaptive threshold. These probabilities and clinical variables were input into a support vector machine for individual-level classification. Fivefold cross-validation was performed and performance metrics were reported using receiver-operating-characteristic-curve analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>FCD versus HC classification yielded mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.945, 0.980, and 0.962, respectively; FCD versus DC classification achieved 0.918, 0.965, and 0.939. In comparison, visual review of the clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected 48% (16/33) of the lesions by official radiology report. In the subgroup where both clinical MRI and MAP were negative, the MRF-ML models correctly distinguished FCD patients from HCs and DCs in 98.3% of cross-validation trials for the magnetic resonance imaging negative group and MAP negative group. Type II versus non-type-II classification exhibited mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.835, 0.823, and 0.83, respectively; type IIa versus IIb classification showed 0.85, 0.9, and 0.87. In comparison, the transmantle sign was present in 58% (7/12) of the IIb cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The MRF-ML framework presented in this study demonstrated strong efficacy in noninvasively classifying FCD from normal cortex and distinguishing FCD subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27047?af=R">Evaluation of Glymphatic System Development in Neonatal Brain via Diffusion Analysis along the Perivascular Space Index</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system is a recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system associated with numerous neurological diseases. However, little is known about glymphatic system development in neonates. We sought to evaluate diffusion along the perivascular space (ALPS) index, a proxy for glymphatic system function, in neonates and investigate its potential associations with maturation, sex, and preterm birth.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 418 neonates, including 92 preterm neonates (57 males) and 326 term neonates (175 males), from the Developing Human Connectome Project were used for evaluating ALPS index. Linear regression modeling was performed to assess group differences in the ALPS index according to preterm birth and sex. Pearson's and partial correlation analysis were performed to assess the association between the ALPS index and gestational age (GA) as well as postmenstrual age (PMA) at MRI. Moderation analysis was performed to assess the moderation effect of preterm birth on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to term neonates, preterm neonates exhibited lower ALPS indices (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The ALPS index positively correlated with PMA (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and GA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Preterm birth (<i>p</i> = 0.013) had a significant moderation effect on the relationship between the ALPS index and PMA. Sex had no significant direct effect (<i>p</i> = 0.639) or moderation effect (<i>p</i> = 0.333) on ALPS index.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system development is a dynamic process in neonates, which can be moderated by preterm birth, the ALPS index could serve as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring this process. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27041?af=R">Solving the Etiology of Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy with Spike–Wave Activation in Sleep (D/EE‐SWAS)</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To understand the etiological landscape and phenotypic differences between 2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) syndromes: DEE with spike–wave activation in sleep (DEE-SWAS) and epileptic encephalopathy with spike–wave activation in sleep (EE-SWAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All patients fulfilled International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) DEE-SWAS or EE-SWAS criteria with a Core cohort (n = 91) drawn from our Epilepsy Genetics research program, together with 10 etiologically solved patients referred by collaborators in the Expanded cohort (n = 101). Detailed phenotyping and analysis of molecular genetic results were performed. We compared the phenotypic features of individuals with DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS. Brain-specific gene co-expression analysis was performed for D/EE-SWAS genes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified the etiology in 42/91 (46%) patients in our Core cohort, including 29/44 (66%) with DEE-SWAS and 13/47 (28%) with EE-SWAS. A genetic etiology was identified in 31/91 (34%). D/EE-SWAS genes were highly co-expressed in brain, highlighting the importance of channelopathies and transcriptional regulators. Structural etiologies were found in 12/91 (13%) individuals. We identified 10 novel D/EE-SWAS genes with a range of functions: <i>ATP1A2</i>, <i>CACNA1A</i>, <i>FOXP1</i>, <i>GRIN1</i>, <i>KCNMA1</i>, <i>KCNQ3</i>, <i>PPFIA3</i>, <i>PUF60</i>, <i>SETD1B, and ZBTB18</i>, and 2 novel copy number variants, 17p11.2 duplication and 5q22 deletion. Although developmental regression patterns were similar in both syndromes, DEE-SWAS was associated with a longer duration of epilepsy and poorer intellectual outcome than EE-SWAS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS have highly heterogeneous genetic and structural etiologies. Phenotypic analysis highlights valuable clinical differences between DEE-SWAS and EE-SWAS which inform clinical care and prognostic counseling. Our etiological findings pave the way for the development of precision therapies. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

">The estrous cycle modulates hippocampal spine dynamics, dendritic processing, and spatial coding</a></h4>

              
                Histological evidence suggests that the estrous cycle exerts a powerful effect on CA1 neurons in mammalian hippocampus. Decades have passed since this landmark observation, yet how the estrous cycle shapes dendritic spine dynamics and hippocampal spatial coding in vivo remains a mystery. Here, we used a custom hippocampal microperiscope and two-photon calcium imaging to track CA1 pyramidal neurons in female mice over multiple cycles. Estrous cycle stage had a potent effect on spine dynamics, with heightened density during periods of greater estradiol (proestrus). These morphological changes were accompanied by greater somatodendritic coupling and increased infiltration of back-propagating action potentials into the apical dendrite. Finally, tracking CA1 response properties during navigation revealed enhanced place field stability during proestrus, evident at the single-cell and population level. These results establish the estrous cycle as a driver of large-scale structural and functional plasticity in hippocampal circuits essential for learning and memory.

">A general principle governing neuronal evolution reveals a human-accelerated neuron type potentially underlying the high prevalence of autism in humans</a></h4>

              
                The remarkable ability of a single genome sequence to encode a diverse collection of distinct cell types, including the thousands of cell types found in the mammalian brain, is a key characteristic of multicellular life. While it has been observed that some cell types are far more evolutionarily conserved than others, the factors driving these differences in evolutionary rate remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that highly abundant neuronal cell types may be under greater selective constraint than rarer neuronal types, leading to variation in their rates of evolution. To test this, we leveraged recently published cross-species single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from three distinct regions of the mammalian neocortex. We found a strikingly consistent relationship where more abundant neuronal subtypes show greater gene expression conservation between species, which replicated across three independent datasets covering >1,000,000 neurons from six species. Based on this principle, we discovered that the most abundant type of neocortical neurons-layer 2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons-has evolved exceptionally quickly in the human lineage compared to other apes. Surprisingly, this accelerated evolution was accompanied by the dramatic down-regulation of autism-associated genes, which was likely driven by polygenic positive selection specific to the human lineage. In sum, we introduce a general principle governing neuronal evolution and suggest that the exceptionally high prevalence of autism in humans may be a direct result of natural selection for lower expression of a suite of genes that conferred a fitness benefit to our ancestors while also rendering an abundant class of neurons more sensitive to perturbation.

">Concerted modulation of spontaneous behavior and time-integrated whole-brain neuronal activity by serotonin receptors</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin neurons from the raphe nuclei project across the entire brain and modulate diverse physiology and behavior by acting on 14 distinct receptors. Here, we take a step dissecting this complex process by examining the effects of agonists and antagonists of four widely expressed serotonin receptors (2A, 2C, 1A, and 1B) on spontaneous mouse behavior. We also analyzed time-integrated whole-brain neuronal activity of these same mice based on intensity of Fos, product of an immediate-early gene. Low-dimensional representations of behavioral and Fos map data shed light on the dominant factors of variation in each domain, captured predictable differences across drug groups, and enabled predictions of behavioral changes following perturbations in Fos maps and vice versa. Our study provides rich resources on the effects of manipulating serotonin receptors on animal behavior and whole-brain integrated neuronal activity. It also establishes an experimental and analysis paradigm for interrogating the relationship between behavior and neuronal activity across different time scales.

">Humans use local spectrotemporal correlations to detect rising and falling pitch</a></h4>

              
                To discern speech or appreciate music, the human auditory system detects how pitch increases or decreases over time. However, the algorithms used to detect changes in pitch, or pitch motion, are incompletely understood. Here, using psychophysics, computational modeling, functional neuroimaging, and analysis of recorded speech, we ask if humans detect pitch motion using computations analogous to those used by the visual system. We adapted stimuli from studies of vision to create novel auditory correlated noise stimuli that elicited robust pitch motion percepts. Crucially, these stimuli possess no persistent features across frequency or time, but do possess positive or negative local spectrotemporal correlations in intensity. In psychophysical experiments, we found clear evidence that humans judge pitch direction based on both positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations. The observed sensitivity to negative correlations is a direct analogue of illusory "reverse-phi" motion in vision, and thus constitutes a new auditory illusion. Our behavioral results and computational modeling led us to hypothesize that human auditory processing employs pitch direction opponency. fMRI measurements in auditory cortex supported this hypothesis. To link our psychophysical findings to real-world pitch perception, we analyzed recordings of English and Mandarin speech and discovered that pitch direction was robustly signaled by the same positive and negative spectrotemporal correlations used in our psychophysical tests, suggesting that sensitivity to both positive and negative correlations confers ecological benefits. Overall, this work reveals that motion detection algorithms sensitive to local correlations are deployed by the central nervous system across disparate modalities (vision and audition) and dimensions (space and frequency).

">Bezafibrate treatment rescues neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative defects in 3D cortical organoid model of MAPT frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: The intronic MAPT mutation IVS10+16 is linked to familiar frontotemporal dementia, causing hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of tau protein, resulting in synaptic and neuronal loss and neuroinflammation in patients. This mutation disrupts MAPT gene splicing, increasing exon 10 inclusion and leading to an imbalance of 3R and 4R Tau isoforms. METHODS: We generated patterned cortical organoids from isogenic control and mutant human iPSC lines. Nanostring gene expression analysis immunofluorescence and calcium imaging recordings were used to study the impact of the MAPT IVS10+16 mutation on neuronal development and function. RESULTS: tau mutant cortical organoids showed altered mitochondrial function and gene expression related to neuronal development, with synaptic markers and neuronal activity reduction. Bezafibrate treatment, which restored mitochondrial content, rescued synaptic functionality and tau physiology. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that targeting mitochondrial function with bezafibrate could potentially reverse tau-induced neurodevelopmental deficits, highlighting its therapeutic potential for tauopathies like FTD.

">Biophysical Simulation Enables Multi-Scale Segmentation and Atlas Mapping for Top-Down Spatial Omics of the Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Spatial omics (SO) has produced high-definition mappings of subcellular molecules (like transcripts or proteins) within various tissue samples. Most applications of SO are molecule-driven i.e. the spatial distributions of transcripts are used to make distinctions between samples. However, such inferences do not automatically utilize brain atlas regions. Here, we present SiDoLa-NS (Simulate, Don't Label - Nervous System), an image-driven (top-down) approach to SO analysis in the nervous system. We utilize the biophysical properties of tissue architectures to design synthetic images mimicking tissue samples. With these in silico samples, we train supervised instance segmentation models for nucleus segmentation, achieving near perfect precision and F1-scores > 0.95. We take this a step further with generalizable models that can identify macroscopic tissue structures in the mouse brain (mAP50 = 0.869) and spinal cord (mAP50 = 0.96) and pig sciatic nerve (mAP50 = 0.995). SiDoLa-NS provides a framework in applying and analyzing SO data that leverages high-definition images that are taken alongside spatial omics pipelines. Notably, SiDoLa-NS provides solutions for common challenges in supervised model training, including but not limited to annotator bias, limited generalizability, and production of massive, high-quality training sets.

">Acute stress causes sex-dependent changes to ventral subiculum synapses, circuitry, and anxiety-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Experiencing a single severe stressor is sufficient to drive sexually dimorphic psychiatric disease development. The ventral subiculum (vSUB) emerges as a site where stress may induce sexually dimorphic adaptations due to its sex-specific organization and pivotal role in stress integration. Using a 1-hr acute restraint stress model, we uncover that stress causes a net decrease in vSUB activity in females that is potent, long-lasting, and driven by adrenergic receptor signaling. By contrast, males exhibit a net increase in vSUB activity that is transient and driven by corticosterone signaling. We further identified sex-dependent changes in vSUB output to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and in anxiety-like behavior in response to stress. These findings reveal striking changes in psychiatric disease-relevant brain regions and behavior following stress with sex-, cell-type, and synapse-specificity that contribute to our understanding of sex-dependent adaptations that may shape stress-related psychiatric disease risk.

                Parkinsons disease-associated, activating mutations in Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) block primary cilia formation in cholinergic and parvalbumin interneurons and astrocytes in the striatum, decreasing the production of GDNF and NRTN neuroprotective factors that normally support dopaminergic neuron viability. We show here that 3 month-dietary administration of the MLi-2 LRRK2 kinase inhibitor restores primary cilia and the Hedgehog-responsive production of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN by these neurons; cilia are also restored on cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus. Importantly, we detect recovery of striatal dopaminergic processes and decreased stress-triggered Hedgehog signaling by nigral dopaminergic neurons. Thus, pathogenic LRRK2-driven cilia loss is reversible in post-mitotic neurons and astrocytes, which suggests that early administration of specific LRRK2 inhibitors may have significant therapeutic benefit for patients in the future.

">Integration of sensory and fear memories in the rat medial temporal lobe</a></h4>

              
                Wong et al. (2019) used a sensory preconditioning protocol to examine how sensory and fear memories are integrated in the rat medial temporal lobe. In this protocol, rats integrate a sound-light (sensory) memory that forms in stage 1 with a light-shock (fear) memory that forms in stage 2 to generate fear responses (freezing) across test presentations of the sound in stage 3. Here, we advance this research by showing that: 1) how/when rats integrate the sound-light and light-shock memories (online in stage 2 or at test in stage 3) changes with the number of sound-light pairings in stage 1; and 2) regardless of how/when it occurs, the integration requires communication between two regions of the medial temporal lobe: the perirhinal cortex and basolateral amygdala complex. Thus, "event familiarity" determines how/when sensory and fear memories are integrated but not the circuitry by which the integration occurs: this remains the same.

">Optogenetic hedonic hotspots in orbitofrontal cortex and insula: causing enhancement of sweetness liking</a></h4>

              
                Hedonic hotspots are brain subregions that causally amplify the hedonic impact of palatable tastes, measured as increases in affective orofacial liking reactions to sweetness. Previously, two cortical hedonic hotspots in orbitofrontal cortex and insula were identified by neurochemical stimulation using opioid or orexin microinjections. Here we used optogenetic stimulation in rats as an independent neurobiological technique for activating cortical hedonic hotspots to identify hedonic functions and map boundaries. We report that channelrhodopsin stimulations within rostral orbitofrontal and caudal insula hotspots doubled the number of hedonic liking reactions elicited by sucrose taste. This independently confirms their robust functional identity as causal amplifiers of hedonic liking and confirms their anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we confirmed an intervening suppressive hedonic coldstrip, to stretching from caudal orbitofrontal cortex to rostral insula. By contrast to localized hedonic hotspots for liking enhancement, motivational wanting for reward, measured as laser self-stimulation, was mediated by more widely distributed anatomical sites.

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has been shown to increase the outcome of speech and language therapy (SLT) in chronic aphasia. Only a few studies have investigated the effect of add-on tDCS on SLT in the early stage of aphasia; this may be due to methodological reasons, in particular the influence of spontaneous remission and the difficulty of establishing stimulation protocols in clinical routines. Thirty-seven participants with subacute aphasia (PwA) after stroke (23 men, 14 women; mean age 62 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12 years; mean duration 49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28 days) were included in two consecutive periods of treatment lasting two weeks each. During the first period (P1) the participants received 10 sessions of SLT, during the second period (P2) the aphasia therapy was supplemented by anodal left hemispheric 2 mA tDCS over the left hemisphere. Severity-specific language tests (Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT), n = 27 and Bielefeld Aphasia Screening-Reha (BIAS-R), n = 10) were administered before P1, between P1 and P2, and after P2. Where information was available, the results were corrected for spontaneous remission (AAT sample), and the therapy outcomes of P1 and P2 were compared. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; overall language abilities improved significantly during P1 and P2. However, improvement&amp;amp;mdash;as measured by the AAT profile level or the BIAS-R mean percentage value&amp;amp;mdash;during P2 (with tDCS) was significantly higher than during P1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; AAT sample and p = 0.005; BIAS-R sample). Thus, tDCS protocols can be implemented in early aphasia rehabilitation. Despite the limitations of the research design, which are also discussed from an implementation science perspective, this is preliminary evidence that an individually tailored anodal tDCS can have a significant add-on effect on the outcome of behavioral aphasia therapy in subacute aphasia.</p>

                <p>Cognitive dysfunction is associated with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to examine the involvement of either Group 2 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) or mGlu3 receptors in memory deficit induced by methamphetamine in mice. Methamphetamine treatment (1&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 5&nbsp;d followed by 7&nbsp;d of withdrawal) caused an impaired performance in the novel object recognition test in wild-type mice, but not in mGlu2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> or mGlu3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Memory deficit in wild-type mice challenged with methamphetamine was corrected by systemic treatment with selectively negative allosteric modulators of mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors (compounds VU6001966 and VU0650786, respectively). Methamphetamine treatment in wild-type mice caused large increases in levels of mGlu2/3 receptors, the Type 3 activator of G-protein signaling (AGS3), Rab3A, and the vesicular glutamate transporter, vGlut1, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Methamphetamine did not alter mGlu2/3-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation but abolished the ability of postsynaptic mGlu3 receptors to boost mGlu5 receptor-mediated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in PFC slices. Remarkably, activation of presynaptic mGlu2/3 receptors did not inhibit but rather amplified depolarization-induced [<sup>3</sup>H]-D-aspartate release in synaptosomes prepared from the PFC of methamphetamine-treated mice. These findings demonstrate that exposure to methamphetamine causes changes in the expression and function of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, which might alter excitatory synaptic transmission in the PFC and raise the attractive possibility that selective inhibitors of mGlu2 or mGlu3 receptors (or both) may be used to improve cognitive dysfunction in individuals affected by MUD.</p>

                Background: Cataracts are common causes of visual impairment. Preventing blindness requires an early and accurate diagnosis. This review examines current cataract diagnosis strategies, explores data-driven machine learning algorithms for early detection, investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, assesses improvements in cataract detection accuracy, identifies research gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies. Methods: We gathered labelled cataract and non-cataract fundus data from the Kaggle. Scholarly publications were sourced from reliable databases such as ProQuest, IEEE, ELSEVIER, Google Scholar, and PubMed. A detailed literature search with specific terms expanded the scope of this review. We included studies that used cataract and non-cataract fundus eye images from cross-sectional, retrospective, and prospective studies. The quality assessment used the AMSTAR tool, considering factors such as literature search comprehensiveness, study selection criteria, data extraction methodologies, and study validity (Table 1). Results: This study encompassed 130 research publications, focusing on machine learning models and clinical-based diagnostic approaches for early-stage cataract identification. The performance of machine-learning models is influenced by factors such as dataset noise and limited reliable data. Barriers to the successful implementation of AI for cataract diagnosis were identified. Conclusions: This review emphasises the obstacles hindering the broad application of AI in cataract diagnosis. Addressing these findings is vital for developing strategies to overcome these challenges and enhance cataract detection systems. To achieve improved accuracy and efficiency in cataract diagnosis, future research should prioritise efforts to enhance dataset availability and quality, reduce data noise, and refine machine-learning algorithms. Unlocking the full potential of AI and/or machine learning can lead to significant breakthroughs in cataract diagnosis, ultimately resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced visual impairments.

                Lymphomas of the oral and oropharyngeal regions are rather uncommon, and diagnosis can be challenging and confusing due to the multiple histological subgroups. Lymphomas are the third most common type of tumor in the head and neck region and are brought on by the lymphoreticular system. The two forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case report of oropharyngeal lymphoma. The female patient reported with a complaint of swelling over the palatal region for two to three months. An ulceroproliferative lesion was evident over the posterior palatal region. We diagnosed reactive lymphadenitis based on an incisional biopsy. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions, a punch biopsy followed by immunohistochemical studies were done. Features suggestive of activated B-cell-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were confirmed. Among malignant lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most prevalent variety. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of this disease. In this case report, we aim to correlate the clinical presentation, histology features and immunohistochemical significance in order to promote early discovery, diagnosis, and treatment for a better prognosis of the patient.

                Introduction and importance The cholecystoenteric fistula, a rare complication of cholelithiasis, usually occurs as an internal biliary fistula. Our case features a cholecystoduodenal fistula presenting with severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding originating from the cystic artery. Symptoms vary, and preoperative diagnosis is uncommon. Case presentation A 63-year-old diabetic patient, who had undergone surgical treatment for a left forearm fracture, presented with persistent bleeding, hematemesis, and melena. Diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an actively bleeding ulcer on the duodenal bulb, with an attempted hemostasis. Initial stabilization was achieved, but a recurrence occurred after 17 hours with hemodynamic instability. Emergency laparotomy revealed cholecystitis with a cholecystoduodenal fistula, necessitating cholecystectomy and ulcer resection. The source of bleeding was the cystic artery. The patient had a positive postoperative outcome with no recurrence of hemorrhage. Clinical discussion Cholecystoenteric fistulas, forming from obstructed cystic duct inflammation, are rare complications of biliary lithiasis. Most cases are spontaneous, linked to gallstones. Severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding from cholecystoduodenal fistulas is uncommon, often requiring surgical intervention due to cystic artery erosion. Despite advancements in laparoscopic methods, open operations are preferred for anatomical distortion and inflammation. A clear diagnosis involves hepatic angiography and may necessitate embolization. The rarity of this condition emphasizes the need for vigilant diagnosis, especially in patients with gallstone history. Conclusion Massive bleeding from cystic artery erosion by duodenal ulcer through cholecystoduodenal fistula underscores the need for clinicians’ vigilance. Recognition of gallstone disease history is crucial for timely diagnosis in this rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding.

                Background The absence of a culturally adapted and validated Smile Aesthetics Scale for Peruvian university students reveals a significant gap in aesthetic dentistry and public health research. Addressing this gap is essential for accurately assessing dental aesthetic satisfaction within this demographic, ensuring the scale’s relevance and effectiveness across Spanish-speaking cultures. The aim of the study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Smile Aesthetics Satisfaction Scale for Peruvian university students. Methods This research was applied, with an instrumental, cross-sectional, and descriptive design. Face validity was conducted with 10 students through unstructured interviews. Content validity was carried out by three experts. The validation of psychometric properties was performed on 190 students recruited through university dentistry social networks using simple random probability sampling. The Aiken test was used for face and content validity. Construct validity and internal consistency were examined through principal component and exploratory factor analysis, using promax and varimax rotations, and internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s Alpha. Results Face and content validity confirmed that the items were relevant and applicable, highlighting the significance of the construct evaluated within the specific cultural context of the research. The adapted scale reflected high content validity, with a global Aiken’s V of 0.83, emphasizing the clarity, coherence, and relevance of the items according to expert evaluation. The psychometric properties of the adapted scale were exceptional among the student population, evidenced by a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.889. Conclusions The translation and cultural adaptation process of the Smile Aesthetics Satisfaction Scale has proven to be successful not only in terms of coherence and fidelity with the original instrument but also in its applicability and relevance within the context of university dental students.

                Introduction Due to the specific work content, healthcare workers (HCWs) showed a high risk of mental health and well-being issues. And the COVID-19 pandemic has increased this effect. At the same time, the psychological well-being of HCWs from Central Asian countries remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health and well-being of HCWs from Central Asian countries, as well as associated factors, including the role of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional questioner-based study was carried out among HCWs from Central Asian countries during the July-November, 2022. The study included socio-demographic questions, DASS-21 scale, WHO-5 Well-being Index, and questions to assess the impact of COVID-19 on personal life and work of HCWs. Results The study involved 2,685 HCWs from the Kazakhstan (1,817), Kyrgyzstan (534), and Uzbekistan (334). The overall prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 17.7%, 24.9% and 5.2%, respectively. Socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, marital and family status, occupation, managerial position; as well as pandemic-related frontline work history and changes in work and social life were associated with mental health and well-being. Conclusion The study underscores the pressing need to address the mental health challenges faced by HCWs in Central Asia, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings reveal concerning levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among HCWs, with socio-demographic factors and pandemic-related experiences influencing mental well-being. Urgent interventions, tailored support, and resources are essential to safeguard the psychological health of HCWs and sustain effective healthcare delivery.

Understanding the computational mechanisms that underlie the encoding and decoding of environmental stimuli is a crucial investigation in neuroscience. Central to this pursuit is the exploration of how the brain represents visual information across its hierarchical architecture. A prominent challenge resides in discerning the neural underpinnings of the processing of dynamic natural visual scenes. Although considerable research efforts have been made to characterize individual components of the visual pathway, a systematic understanding of the distinctive neural coding associated with visual stimuli, as they traverse this hierarchical landscape, remains elusive. In this study, we leverage the comprehensive Allen Visual Coding—Neuropixels dataset and utilize the capabilities of deep learning neural network models to study neural coding in response to dynamic natural visual scenes across an expansive array of brain regions. Our study reveals that our decoding model adeptly deciphers visual scenes from neural spiking patterns exhibited within each distinct brain area. A compelling observation arises from the comparative analysis of decoding performances, which manifests as a notable encoding proficiency within the visual cortex and subcortical nuclei, in contrast to a relatively reduced encoding activity within hippocampal neurons. Strikingly, our results unveil a robust correlation between our decoding metrics and well-established anatomical and functional hierarchy indexes. These findings corroborate existing knowledge in visual coding related to artificial visual stimuli and illuminate the functional role of these deeper brain regions using dynamic stimuli. Consequently, our results suggest a novel perspective on the utility of decoding neural network models as a metric for quantifying the encoding quality of dynamic natural visual scenes represented by neural responses, thereby advancing our comprehension of visual coding within the complex hierarchy of the brain.

                <p>by Ulysse Rançon, Timothée Masquelier, Benoit R. Cottereau</p>

Sounds are temporal stimuli decomposed into numerous elementary components by the auditory nervous system. For instance, a temporal to spectro-temporal transformation modelling the frequency decomposition performed by the cochlea is a widely adopted first processing step in today’s computational models of auditory neural responses. Similarly, increments and decrements in sound intensity (i.e., of the raw waveform itself or of its spectral bands) constitute critical features of the neural code, with high behavioural significance. However, despite the growing attention of the scientific community on auditory OFF responses, their relationship with transient ON, sustained responses and adaptation remains unclear. In this context, we propose a new general model, based on a pair of linear filters, named <i>AdapTrans</i>, that captures both sustained and transient ON and OFF responses into a unifying and easy to expand framework. We demonstrate that filtering audio cochleagrams with AdapTrans permits to accurately render known properties of neural responses measured in different mammal species such as the dependence of OFF responses on the stimulus fall time and on the preceding sound duration. Furthermore, by integrating our framework into gold standard and state-of-the-art machine learning models that predict neural responses from audio stimuli, following a supervised training on a large compilation of electrophysiology datasets (ready-to-deploy PyTorch models and pre-processed datasets shared publicly), we show that AdapTrans systematically improves the prediction accuracy of estimated responses within different cortical areas of the rat and ferret auditory brain. Together, these results motivate the use of our framework for computational and systems neuroscientists willing to increase the plausibility and performances of their models of audition.

                <p>by Einar Bjarki Gunnarsson, Seungil Kim, Brandon Choi, J. Karl Schmid, Karn Kaura, Heinz-Josef Lenz, Shannon M. Mumenthaler, Jasmine Foo</p>

Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) are novel cellular models that maintain the genetic, phenotypic and structural features of patient tumor tissue and are useful for studying tumorigenesis and drug response. When integrated with advanced 3D imaging and analysis techniques, PDTOs can be used to establish physiologically relevant high-throughput and high-content drug screening platforms that support the development of patient-specific treatment strategies. However, in order to effectively leverage high-throughput PDTO observations for clinical predictions, it is critical to establish a quantitative understanding of the basic properties and variability of organoid growth dynamics. In this work, we introduced an innovative workflow for analyzing and understanding PDTO growth dynamics, by integrating a high-throughput imaging deep learning platform with mathematical modeling, incorporating flexible growth laws and variable dormancy times. We applied the workflow to colon cancer organoids and demonstrated that organoid growth is well-described by the Gompertz model of growth. Our analysis showed significant intrapatient heterogeneity in PDTO growth dynamics, with the initial exponential growth rate of an organoid following a lognormal distribution within each dataset. The level of intrapatient heterogeneity varied between patients, as did organoid growth rates and dormancy times of single seeded cells. Our work contributes to an emerging understanding of the basic growth characteristics of PDTOs, and it highlights the heterogeneity in organoid growth both within and between patients. These results pave the way for further modeling efforts aimed at predicting treatment response dynamics and drug resistance timing.

                <p>by Janani Ravi, Kewalin Samart, Jason Zwolak</p>

Budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, is widely used as a model organism to study the genetics underlying eukaryotic cellular processes and growth critical to cancer development, such as cell division and cell cycle progression. The budding yeast cell cycle is also one of the best-studied dynamical systems owing to its thoroughly resolved genetics. However, the dynamics underlying the crucial cell cycle decision point called the START transition, at which the cell commits to a new round of DNA replication and cell division, are under-studied. The START machinery involves a central cyclin-dependent kinase; cyclins responsible for starting the transition, bud formation, and initiating DNA synthesis; and their transcriptional regulators. However, evidence has shown that the mechanism is more complicated than a simple irreversible transition switch. Activating a key transcription regulator SBF requires the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, Whi5, or an SBF/MBF monomeric component, Swi6, but not necessarily both. Also, the timing and mechanism of the inhibitor Whi5’s nuclear export, while important, are not critical for the timing and execution of START. Therefore, there is a need for a consolidated model for the budding yeast START transition, reconciling regulatory and spatial dynamics. We built a detailed mathematical model (START-BYCC) for the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle based on established molecular interactions and experimental phenotypes. START-BYCC recapitulates the underlying dynamics and correctly emulates key phenotypic traits of ~150 known START mutants, including regulation of size control, localization of inhibitor/transcription factor complexes, and the nutritional effects on size control. Such a detailed mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamics gets us closer towards deconvoluting the aberrant cellular development in cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011854">scaDA: A novel statistical method for differential analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fengdi Zhao, Xin Ma, Bing Yao, Qing Lu, Li Chen</p>

Single-cell ATAC-seq sequencing data (scATAC-seq) has been widely used to investigate chromatin accessibility on the single-cell level. One important application of scATAC-seq data analysis is differential chromatin accessibility (DA) analysis. However, the data characteristics of scATAC-seq such as excessive zeros and large variability of chromatin accessibility across cells impose a unique challenge for DA analysis. Existing statistical methods focus on detecting the mean difference of the chromatin accessible regions while overlooking the distribution difference. Motivated by real data exploration that distribution difference exists among cell types, we introduce a novel composite statistical test named “scaDA”, which is based on zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB), for performing differential distribution analysis of chromatin accessibility by jointly testing the abundance, prevalence and dispersion simultaneously. Benefiting from both dispersion shrinkage and iterative refinement of mean and prevalence parameter estimates, scaDA demonstrates its superiority to both ZINB-based likelihood ratio tests and published methods by achieving the highest power and best FDR control in a comprehensive simulation study. In addition to demonstrating the highest power in three real sc-multiome data analyses, scaDA successfully identifies differentially accessible regions in microglia from sc-multiome data for an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) study that are most enriched in GO terms related to neurogenesis and the clinical phenotype of AD, and AD-associated GWAS SNPs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-871/v1?src=rss">Effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing and cross platform messaging application in improving oral health knowledge, attitude and behaviours among pregnant women- A Randomized Controlled Trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Body goes through significant hormonal and physiological changes during pregnancy, which could be linked to changes in oral health. Many women are unaware of the negative consequences of poor dental health during and after pregnancy, both for themselves and their children. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing (MI) and cross platform messaging application (WhatsApp messenger) for oral health education on the oral health knowledge, attitude and behaviours among pregnant women attending ante natal care. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 84 pregnant women. Simple random sampling was employed to select participants after oral examination. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups (Group 1: Cross-platform messaging application [WhatsApp]; Group 2: MI) using a lottery method. Pregnant women aged 18 years and older, gestational age between 8 and 30 weeks were included. A face-to-face interview and oral examination were conducted to assess baseline knowledge and oral hygiene status. A follow-up examination was conducted after one month of intervention. Inferential statistics, including the chi-square test and independent t-test, were used to compare variables between the two groups. Results The mean knowledge score at baseline was comparable between Group 1 (WhatsApp) and Group 2 (MI). However, post-intervention, Group 2 showed a significantly higher mean knowledge score compared to Group 1. Post-intervention, Group 2 exhibited a significantly better oral hygiene status compared to Group 1. Significant improvements in oral health behaviours were observed in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (p < 0.001). Conclusions The findings suggested that while both interventions were effective, MI showed superior results in improving knowledge, oral hygiene status, and oral health behaviours. The personalized and client-centred approach of MI enables participants to explore and resolve ambivalence, promoting a deeper understanding of the importance of oral health during pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27030?af=R">Multiple Acyl‐Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Deficiency Is Associated with Sertraline Use – Is There an Acquired Form?</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation and considered an inborn error of metabolism. In recent years, we have diagnosed an increasing number of patients where, despite extensive investigation, no disease-causing mutations have been found. We therefore investigated a cohort of consecutive patients, with the objective to detect possible non-genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We searched the patient records and the registry of muscle biopsies, for patients with MADD, diagnosed within the past 10 years. The patient records were reviewed regarding symptoms, clinical findings, comorbidities, drugs, diagnostic investigations, and response to treatment. In addition, complementary investigations of muscle tissue were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 9 patients diagnosed with late-onset MADD. All presented with muscle weakness and elevated levels of creatine kinase. A lipid storage myopathy was evident in the muscle biopsies, as was elevated acylcarnitines in blood. Despite thorough genetic investigations, a probable genetic cause was found in only 2 patients. Remarkably, all 7 patients without disease-causing mutations were treated with sertraline. In some cases, a deterioration of symptoms closely followed dose increase, and discontinuation resulted in an improved acylcarnitine profile. All 9 patients responded to riboflavin treatment with normalization of creatine kinase and muscle biopsy findings, and in 8 patients the clinical symptoms clearly improved.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings strongly suggest that sertraline may induce an acquired form of MADD in some patients. Importantly, riboflavin treatment seems to be similarly effective as in genetic MADD, but discontinuation of sertraline is reasonably warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal area CA2 has garnered attention in recent times owing to its significant involvement in social memory and distinctive plasticity characteristics. Research has revealed that the CA2 region demonstrates a remarkable resistance to plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer Collateral (SC)-CA2 pathway. In this study we investigated the role of Nogo-A, a well-known axon growth inhibitor and more recently discovered plasticity regulator, in modulating plasticity within the CA2 region. The findings demonstrate that blocking Nogo-A in male rat hippocampal slices facilitates the establishment of both short-term and long-term plasticity in the SC-CA2 pathway, while having no impact on the Entorhinal Cortical (EC)-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the study reveals that inhibiting Nogo-A enables association between the SC and EC pathways. Mechanistically, we confirm that Nogo-A operates through its well-known co-receptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), and its downstream signaling factor such as Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), as their inhibition also allows plasticity induction in the SC-CA2 pathway. Additionally, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in both the EC and SC-CA2 pathways led to persistent LTD, which was not affected by Nogo-A inhibition. Our study demonstrates the involvement of Nogo-A mediated signaling mechanisms in limiting synaptic plasticity within the CA2 region.</p>

                Muik et al. show that, in individuals pre-immunized with SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain mRNA vaccines, cross-reactive humoral immunity targeting conserved epitopes remains dominant after two exposures to Omicron BA.1 spike. Their observations indicate that persistent immune imprinting may limit strain-specific naive B cell priming even after repeated variant spike exposure.

                Cobb-Lewis et al. demonstrate that the LHb plays distinct roles in infant and juvenile rat social approach behaviors. Early adversity disrupts LHb structural and functional growth curves, including volume, protein expression, and firing properties. Finally, inhibiting a specific corticohabenular projection rescues social deficits in adversity-reared pups.

They observed that neurons with NFTs died less frequently than neurons without NFTs. Dying neurons could also be identified by local cortical microstructure changes, providing a method to identify susceptible populations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95257">Deciphering the actin structure-dependent preferential cooperative binding of cofilin</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism underlying the preferential and cooperative binding of cofilin and the expansion of clusters toward the pointed-end side of actin filaments remains poorly understood. To address this, we conducted a principal component analysis based on available filamentous actin (F-actin) and C-actin (cofilins were excluded from cofilactin) structures and compared to monomeric G-actin. The results strongly suggest that C-actin, rather than F-ADP-actin, represented the favourable structure for binding preference of cofilin. High-speed atomic force microscopy explored that the shortened bare half helix adjacent to the cofilin clusters on the pointed end side included fewer actin protomers than normal helices. The mean axial distance (MAD) between two adjacent actin protomers along the same long-pitch strand within shortened bare half helices was longer (5.0–6.3 nm) than the MAD within typical helices (4.3–5.6 nm). The inhibition of torsional motion during helical twisting, achieved through stronger attachment to the lipid membrane, led to more pronounced inhibition of cofilin binding and cluster formation than the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in solution. F-ADP-actin exhibited more naturally supertwisted half helices than F-ADP.Pi-actin, explaining how Pi inhibits cofilin binding to F-actin with variable helical twists. We propose that protomers within the shorter bare helical twists, either influenced by thermal fluctuation or induced allosterically by cofilin clusters, exhibit characteristics of C-actin-like structures with an elongated MAD, leading to preferential and cooperative binding of cofilin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84875">Spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent mitotic delay is required for cell division in absence of centrosomes</a></h4>

              
                The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) temporally regulates mitosis by preventing progression from metaphase to anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle. Centrosomes refine the spatial organization of the mitotic spindle at the spindle poles. However, centrosome loss leads to elongated mitosis, suggesting that centrosomes also inform the temporal organization of mitosis in mammalian cells. Here, we find that the mitotic delay in acentrosomal cells is enforced by the SAC in a MPS1-dependent manner, and that a SAC-dependent mitotic delay is required for bipolar cell division to occur in acentrosomal cells. Although acentrosomal cells become polyploid, polyploidy is not sufficient to cause dependency on a SAC-mediated delay to complete cell division. Rather, the division failure in absence of MPS1 activity results from mitotic exit occurring before acentrosomal spindles can become bipolar. Furthermore, prevention of centrosome separation suffices to make cell division reliant on a SAC-dependent mitotic delay. Thus, centrosomes and their definition of two spindle poles early in mitosis provide a ‘timely two-ness’ that allows cell division to occur in absence of a SAC-dependent mitotic delay.

                Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. Lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94903">Metabolic disruption impairs ribosomal protein levels, resulting in enhanced aminoglycoside tolerance</a></h4>

              
                Aminoglycoside antibiotics target ribosomes and are effective against a wide range of bacteria. Here, we demonstrated that knockout strains related to energy metabolism in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed increased tolerance to aminoglycosides during the mid-exponential growth phase. Contrary to expectations, these mutations did not reduce the proton motive force or aminoglycoside uptake, as there were no significant changes in metabolic indicators or intracellular gentamicin levels between wild-type and mutant strains. Our comprehensive proteomics analysis unveiled a noteworthy upregulation of proteins linked to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mutant strains during the mid-exponential growth phase, suggesting that these strains compensate for the perturbation in their energy metabolism by increasing TCA cycle activity to maintain their membrane potential and ATP levels. Furthermore, our pathway enrichment analysis shed light on local network clusters displaying downregulation across all mutant strains, which were associated with both large and small ribosomal binding proteins, ribosome biogenesis, translation factor activity, and the biosynthesis of ribonucleoside monophosphates. These findings offer a plausible explanation for the observed tolerance of aminoglycosides in the mutant strains. Altogether, this research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of aminoglycoside tolerance, paving the way for novel strategies to combat such cells.

">Uncovering Individualized Cerebellar Atrophy Pattern and Behavioral Links in Children with Brainstem Tumor</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brainstem tumors are rare and result in enduring behavioral issues, posing challenges for patients and surgeons. Despite similarities in symptoms to those resulting from cerebellar injuries, limited research has investigated cerebellar changes in patients with brainstem tumors. Methods: Here, we employed U-Net-based segmentation to analyze the cerebellum in 26 regions, assessing individual volume deviations. Additionally, we developed a behavior prediction model using the total outlier count (tOC) index and brain volume as features. Findings: Our normative model results revealed that most patients exhibited negative deviation in most cerebellar regions, particularly in lobule Right V, Left I-III, Right X, and Left X. The results found a significant association between a higher tOC and severe social problems (r = 0.31, p = 0.001) and withdrawal behavior (r = 0.28, p = 0.001). Further analysis showed that smaller cerebellar regions correlated strongly with more pronounced social problems (r = 0.27, p = 0.007) and withdrawal behavior (r = 0.25, p = 0.015). Notably, lobules such as Right X, V, IV, and VIIB, along with Left IX, VIII, and X exerted the greatest influence on social problems, whereas regions including Left V, Right IV, and Vermis VI and VIII were most impactful on withdrawal behavior. Interpretation: In summary, our study revealed cerebellar atrophy patterns in patients with brainstem tumors, emphasizing the role of both anterior and posterior cerebellar lobes in social problems and withdrawal behavior. This research sheds light on the brain mechanisms underlying complex behavioral disorders in brainstem tumor patients. Funding: This study was supported by the STI2030-Major Projects 2021ZD0200201 and Beijing Municipal Public Welfare Development and Reform Pilot Project for Medical Research Institutes (grant ID: JYY202X-X).

">Co-activation of LIN28A and CTNNB1 disturbs cortical neuronal migration and pia mater integrity</a></h4>

              
                Developmental signalling pathways act in stage and tissue dependent relation and mis-activation can drive tumour formation. The RNA-binding protein LIN28A maintains stemness and is overexpressed in embryonal brain tumours. Activating mutations of CTNNB1 - the WNT pathway effector - have been reported in respective brain tumours. The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay of these oncogenic proteins during embryonal brain development. The combination of both oncogenic factors did not lead to brain tumour formation but resulted in disturbed lamination and impaired cell migration in the cerebral cortex. Spatially resolved proteome analysis revealed imbalances of the extracellular matrix protein LAMB1 and its receptors RPSA and ITGB1 accompanied by a porous pial border and overmigration of neural cells. Cajal-Retzius cells were misplaced in deeper cortex regions without affecting general REELIN levels and additional reduced levels of -DYSTROGLYCAN. Taken together, the interplay of LIN28A and CTNNB1 resulted in a cortical migration disorder showing histomorphological and molecular similarities to human Cobblestone lissencephaly (type 2), highlighting novel implications of the oncogene LIN28A in extracellular matrix integrity.

">Distinct neuromodulatory effects of endogenous orexin and dynorphin corelease on projection-defined ventral tegmental dopamine neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to motivationally relevant cues and circuit-specific signaling drives different aspects of motivated behavior. Orexins (ox; also known as hypocretin) and dynorphin (dyn) are co-expressed lateral hypothalamic (LH) neuropeptides that project to the VTA. These peptides have opposing effects on the firing activity of VTADA neurons via orexin 1 (Ox1R) or kappa opioid (KOR) receptors, respectively. Given that Ox1R activation increases VTADA firing, and KOR decreases firing, it is unclear how the co-released peptides contribute to the net activity of DA neurons. We tested if optical stimulation of LHox/dyn neuromodulates VTADA neuronal activity via peptide release and if the effects of optically driven LHox/dyn release segregates based on VTADA projection targets including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the lateral or medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (lAcbSh, mAchSh). Using a combination of circuit tracing, optogenetics, and patch clamp electrophysiology in male and female orexincre mice we showed a diverse response of LHox/dyn optical stimulation on VTADA neuronal firing, that are not mediated by fast transmitter release and are blocked by antagonists to KOR and Ox1R signaling. Additionally, where optical stimulation of LHox/dyn inputs in the VTA inhibited firing of the majority of BLA projecting VTADA neurons, optical stimulation of LHox/dyn inputs in the VTA bidirectionally affects firing of either lAcbSh or mAchSh projecting VTADA neurons. These findings indicate that LHox/dyn corelease may influence the output of the VTA by balancing ensembles of neurons within each population which contribute to different aspects of reward seeking.

">Word-selective EEG/MEG responses in the English language obtained with Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS)</a></h4>

              
                Fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) allows the recording of objective brain responses of human word discrimination (i.e., reproducible word-category-selective responses) with a high signal-to-noise ratio. This approach has been successfully employed over the last decade in a number of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) studies. Three important advances were achieved in this study: (1) robust measures of written word-selective responses with this approach have not been reported in English; (2) responses have only been reported in EEG but not with MEG, and (3) without source localization. Thus, we presented English words periodically (2 Hz) among different types of letter strings (10Hz; consonant strings, non-words, pseudowords) whilst recording simultaneous EEG and MEG in 25 participants who performed a simple non-linguistic color detection task. Data were analyzed in sensor and in source space (L2-minimum-norm estimation, MNE). With only 4 minutes of stimulation we observed a robust word discrimination response in each condition including, importantly, even when words were embedded in word-like pseudowords. This response was larger in nonwords and largest in consonant strings. We observed left-lateralized responses in all conditions in the majority of our participants. Cluster-based permutation tests revealed that these responses were left-lateralized in sensor as well as in source space, with peaks in left posterior regions. Our results demonstrate that the FPVS paradigm can elicit robust English word-discrimination responses in EEG and MEG within only a few minutes of recording time. Together with source estimation, this can provide novel insights into the neural basis of visual word recognition in healthy and clinical populations.

">The Body Mirroring Thought: The Relationship Between Thought Transitions and Fluctuations in Autonomic Nervous Activity Mediated by Interoception</a></h4>

              
                Our thought states change unconsciously. This study verified that the transference of thought states varies with fluctuations in autonomic nervous activity, and that this effect is modulated by interoceptive accuracy. The participants completed the heartbeat counting task (HCT) and vigilance task (VT). We assessed the participants' interoceptive accuracy based on their performance on the HCT. The VT is a simple attention task, and during this task, we asked the participants to report the content and contemplation of their thoughts. Consequently, participants with accurate interoception were more likely to remain in a highly contemplative thought state when sympathetic activity was activated. In contrast, the dominance of parasympathetic activity facilitated transitions to different thought states or experiences of less contemplative thought states in them. The results suggest that even subtle changes in bodily responses at rest can affect thought transitions in people with accurate interoception.

">Unraveling the Neural Landscape of Mental Disorders using Double Functional Independent Primitives (dFIPs)</a></h4>

              
                Mental illnesses extract a high personal and societal cost, and thus explorations of the links between mental illness and functional connectivity in the brain are critical. Investigating major mental illnesses, believed to arise from disruptions in sophisticated neural connections, allows us to comprehend how these neural network disruptions may be linked to altered cognition, emotional regulation, and social interactions. Although neuroimaging has opened new avenues to explore neural alterations linked to mental illnesses, the field still requires precise and sensitive methodologies to inspect these neural substrates of various psychological disorders. In this study, we employ a hierarchical methodology to derive double functionally independent primitives (dFIPs) from resting state functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging data (rs-fMRI). These dFIPs encapsulate canonical overlapping patterns of functional network connectivity (FNC) within the brain. Our investigation focuses on the examination of how combinations of these dFIPs relate to different mental disorder diagnoses. The central aim is to unravel the complex patterns of FNC that correspond to the diverse manifestations of mental illnesses. To achieve this objective, we used a large brain imaging dataset from multiple sites, comprising 5805 total individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BPD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and controls. The key revelations of our study unveil distinct patterns associated with each mental disorder through the combination of dFIPs. Notably, certain individual dFIPs exhibit disorder-specific characteristics, while others demonstrate commonalities across disorders. This approach offers a novel, data-driven synthesis of intricate neuroimaging data, thereby illuminating the functional changes intertwined with various mental illnesses. Our results show distinct signatures associated with psychiatric disorders, revealing unique connectivity patterns such as heightened cerebellar connectivity in SCZ and sensory domain hyperconnectivity in ASD, both contrasted with reduced cerebellar-subcortical connectivity. Utilizing the dFIP concept, we pinpoint specific functional connections that differentiate healthy controls from individuals with mental illness, underscoring its utility in identifying neurobiological markers. In summary, our findings delineate how dFIPs serve as unique fingerprints for different mental disorders.

">Augmenting complex and dynamic performance through mindfulness-based cognitive training: an investigation of on-task EEG dynamics.</a></h4>

              
                Mindfulness-based cognitive training exhibits great propensity for improving cognitive performance across a range of contexts. However, the neurophysiological basis of these cognitive enhancements has remained relatively unclear. Previous studies have widely examined EEG during mindfulness practice - or made comparisons with long-term meditators and controls - but have failed to capture how EEG dynamics in subsequent cognitive testing scenarios might be altered as a function of mindfulness-based interventions. The current study therefore aimed to assess a variety of EEG dynamics (oscillatory, aperiodic, and event-related) during engagement in a dynamic and complex cognitive task, following a mindfulness-based cognitive training regime. Participants (n = 40, age range = 18 - 38) attended the lab on two separate occasions (pre- and post- a web-based one-week mindfulness intervention), where EEG was recorded during engagement in the Target Motion Analyst (TMA) task. Previous analysis of the same participants demonstrated that greater adherence to the mindfulness-based cognitive training was associated with improved performance on the TMA task (Dziego, Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, Schlesewsky et al., 2024). Here, we capitalise on these previous findings to assess whether adherence is paralleled by measurable differences in on-task EEG dynamics. Linear mixed-effects modelling demonstrated that, while main effects were observed across session, adherence to cognitive training was not directly associated with alpha power, theta power or 1/f parameters. Challenges also arose when computing event-related potentials (ERPs), illustrating the difficulties of using this technique in more complex testing environments. While these results are challenging to place within the context of previous EEG studies on meditation and cognitive performance, our findings highlight the complexities in understanding the cognitive benefits of mindfulness-based training interventions through EEG dynamics observed during subsequent cognitive testing.

">Normative Growth Modeling of Cortical Thickness Identify Neuroanatomical Variability and Distinct Subtypes in Brainstem Tumor Patients</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brainstem tumors can cause structural brain changes, but the resulting heterogeneity within wholebrain structure is not well-studied. This study examines cortical thickness to identify patterns of structural alterations and explore underlying biological subtypes and their associations with clinical factors. Materials and Methods: This study involved 124 pediatric brainstem tumor patients, aged 4-18 years. Cortical thickness was measured using CAT12 segmentation of 3D T1-weighted structural MRI. A normative model was established using data from 849 healthy children. Deviations in cortical thickness were estimated, and patients were classified into two subtypes using spectral clustering. Clinical statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 26.0. Results: The normative model revealed significant heterogeneity in cortical thickness deviations, which correlated with tumor size and growth patterns. Focal tumors primarily caused negative deviations (t = 3.14, p = 0.02). There was a significant positive correlation between extreme positive deviations and tumor volume (r = 0.214, p = 0.010), and between extreme negative deviations and progression-free survival (r = 0.39, p = 0.008). Two subtypes were identified: Subtype 1, consisting of diffuse tumors with extreme positive deviations, and Subtype 2, consisting of focal tumors with extreme negative deviations. Subtype and tumor growth pattern significantly influenced duration (p < 0.01). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for Subtype 1 and Subtype 2 demonstrated a significant difference in survival probabilities over time (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Overall, this study identifies two major patterns of cortical thickness changes in brainstem tumor patients, enhancing our understanding of their relationship with cortical morphology. The findings suggest that cortical thickness alterations could serve as valuable biomarkers for predicting progression-free survival, which is crucial for clinical assessment and personalized treatment strategies. This research provides new insights into the physiological mechanisms by which brainstem tumors affect brain structure, supporting more precise clinical interventions and efficacy monitoring in the future.

">Reducing maladaptive behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders using network modification</a></h4>

              
                Neuropsychiatric disorders are caused by many factors and produce a wide range of symptomatic maladaptive behaviors in patients. Despite this great variance in causes and resulting behavior, we believe the maladaptive behaviors that characterize neuropsychiatric disorders are most proximally determined by networks of neurons and that this forms a common conceptual link between these disorders. Operating from this premise, it follows that treating neuropsychiatric disorders to reduce maladaptive behavior can be accomplished by modifying the patient's network of neurons. In this proof-of-concept computational psychiatry study, we tested this approach in a simple neural network model that produces aversion-resistant alcohol drinking - a key maladaptive behavior associated with alcohol use disorder. We demonstrated that it was possible to predict personalized network modifications that substantially reduced maladaptive behavior without inducing side effects. Furthermore, we found that it was possible to predict effective treatments with limited knowledge of the model and that information about neural activity during certain types of trials was more helpful in predicting treatment than information about model parameters. We hypothesize that this is a general feature of developing effective treatment strategies for networks of neurons. This computational study lays the groundwork for future studies utilizing more biologically realistic network models in conjunction with in vivo data.

">Inhibitory mechanisms in the prefrontal-cortex differentially mediate Putamen activity during valence-based learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning from appetitive and aversive stimuli is important for survival. It involves interactions between the prefrontal cortex and subcortical structures, with inhibition playing a crucial role. However, direct evidence for this in humans is limited. Here, we overcome the difficulty of measuring inhibition in the human brain and find that GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, affects how the dACC interacts with subcortical structures during appetitive and aversive learning differently. We used 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to track GABA levels in the dACC alongside whole-brain fMRI scans while participants engaged in appetitive and aversive learning tasks. During appetitive learning, dACC GABA levels were negatively correlated with learning performance and BOLD activity measured from the dACC and the Putamen. While under aversive learning, dACC GABA concentration negatively correlated with the functional connectivity between the dACC and the Putamen. Our results show that inhibition in the dACC mediates appetitive and aversive learning in humans through distinct mechanisms.

">Direct imaging of neural activity reveals neural circuits via spatiotemporal activation mapping</a></h4>

              
                Two years ago, our group reported direct imaging of neuronal activity (DIANA), a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique that directly detects neuronal activity at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, we successfully reproduced the DIANA response in medetomidine-anesthetized mice using forelimb electrical stimulation at 11.7 T. More importantly, we showed that multiple neural circuits can be effectively revealed by DIANA fMRI through spatiotemporal activation mapping. The spatiotemporal activation mapping proposed here utilizes the temporal information of the DIANA response, that is, the time when the DIANA response reaches its peak, which is a unique feature that distinguishes it from the activation mapping method used in existing fMRI. Based on DIANA activation areas, we identified several neural circuits involved in forelimb sensory processing in the somatosensory network, which includes multiple brain regions: ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL), posteromedial thalamic nucleus (POm), forelimb primary somatosensory cortex (S1FL), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), primary motor cortex (M1), and secondary motor cortex (M2). Additionally, we also identified a pain-related neural circuit involving brain regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Interestingly, the spatiotemporal activation mapping also allowed us to identify subregions with different DIANA response times within the same functional region (e.g., VPL, POm, S1FL, and S2). Our study highlights the potential of DIANA fMRI to advance our understanding of sensory information processing throughout the brain and to provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain networks at the level of neural circuits.

">Spatial 3D genome organization controls the activity of bivalent chromatin during human neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear genome is spatially organized into a three-dimensional (3D) architecture by physical association of large chromosomal domains with subnuclear compartments including the nuclear lamina at the radial periphery and nuclear speckles within the nucleoplasm. However, how spatial genome architecture regulates human brain development has been overlooked owing to technical limitations. Here, we generate high-resolution maps of genomic interactions with the lamina and speckles in cells of the neurogenic lineage isolated from midgestational human cortex, uncovering an intimate association between subnuclear genome compartmentalization, chromatin state and transcription. During cortical neurogenesis, spatial genome organization is extensively remodeled, relocating hundreds of neuronal genes from the lamina to speckles including key neurodevelopmental genes bivalent for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. At the lamina, bivalent genes have exceptionally low expression, and relocation to speckles enhances resolution of bivalent chromatin to H3K4me3 and increases transcription >7-fold. We further demonstrate that proximity to the nuclear periphery - not the presence of H3K27me3 - is the dominant factor in maintaining the lowly expressed, poised state of bivalent genes embedded in the lamina. In addition to uncovering a critical role of subnuclear genome compartmentalization in neurogenic transcriptional regulation, our results establish a new paradigm in which knowing the spatial location of a gene is necessary to understanding its epigenomic regulation.

	<p>To better understand the individual differences in fairness, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the fairness characteristics of deaf college students through the ultimatum game task. Behaviorally, the significant main effect of the proposal type was found, which meant both deaf and hearing college students showed a lower acceptance rate for the more unfair proposal. Interestingly, we found a significant interaction between group and proposal type in the early stage (N1). Moreover, in the deaf college group, N1 (induced by moderately and very unfair proposals) was significantly larger than that of fair proposals. However, we found that deaf college students had smaller amplitudes on P2 and P3 than hearing college students. These results suggested that deaf college students might pursue more equity strongly so they are more sensitive to unfair information in the early stage. In a word, we should provide more fair allocations for deaf college students in our harmonious society.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive impairment is common in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and occurs through multiple mechanisms, including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) pathology and the involvement of &amp;amp;alpha;-synucleinopathies. We aimed to investigate the pathological biomarkers of both PD and AD in plasma and neuronal extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their association with different types of cognitive impairment in PD patients. Methods: A total of 122 patients with PD and 30 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional cohort study between March 2021 and July 2023. Non-dementia PD patients were divided into amnestic and non-amnestic groups according to the memory domain of a neuropsychological assessment. Plasma and neuronal EV biomarkers, including &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein (&amp;amp;alpha;-syn), beta-amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;), total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), were measured using a single-molecule array and a chemiluminescence immunoassay, respectively. Results: Neuronal EV but not plasma &amp;amp;alpha;-syn levels, were significantly increased in PD as compared to healthy controls, and they were positively associated with UPDRS part III scores and the severity of cognitive impairment. A lower plasma A&amp;amp;beta;42 level and higher neuronal EV T-tau level were found in the amnestic PD group compared to the non-amnestic PD group. Conclusions: The results of the current study demonstrate that neuronal EV &amp;amp;alpha;-syn levels can be a sensitive biomarker for assisting in the diagnosis and disease severity prediction of PD. Both AD and PD pathologies are important factors in cognitive impairment associated with PD, and AD pathologies are more involved in amnestic memory deficit in PD.</p>

	<p>Incidental visuospatial learning acquired under incidental conditions is more vulnerable to aging than in the intentional case. The theta and gamma correlates of the coding and retrieval of episodic memory change during aging. Based on the vulnerability of incidental coding to aging, different theta and gamma correlates could occur under the incidental versus intentional coding and retrieval of visuospatial information. Theta and gamma EEG was recorded from the frontotemporal regions, and incidental/intentional visuospatial learning was evaluated in young (25&amp;amp;ndash;60 years old) and elderly (60&amp;amp;ndash;85 years old) participants. The EEG recorded during encoding and retrieval was compared between incidental low-demand, incidental high-demand, and intentional conditions through an ANCOVA considering the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s gender, IQ, and years of schooling as covariates. Older adults exhibited worse performances, especially in place&amp;amp;ndash;object associations. After the intentional study, older participants showed a further increase in false-positive errors. Higher power at the theta and gamma bands was observed for frontotemporal derivations in older participants for both encoding and retrieval. Under retrieval, only young participants had lower power in terms of errors compared with correct responses. In conclusion, the different patterns of power and coherence support incidental and intentional visuospatial encoding and retrieval in young and elderly individuals. The correlates of power with behavior are sensitive to age and performance.</p>

                <p>Language is an evolutionarily salient faculty for humans that relies on a distributed brain network spanning across frontal, temporal, parietal, and subcortical regions. To understand whether the complex language network shares common or distinct genetic mechanisms, we examined the relationships between the genetic effects underlying the brain responses to language and a set of object domains that have been suggested to coevolve with language: tools, faces (indicating social), and body parts (indicating social and gesturing). Analyzing the twin datasets released by the Human Connectome Project that had functional magnetic resonance imaging data from human twin subjects (monozygotic and dizygotic) undergoing language and working memory tasks contrasting multiple object domains (198 females and 144 males for the language task; 192 females and 142 males for the working memory task), we identified a set of cortical regions in the frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical regions whose activity to language was significantly genetically influenced. The heterogeneity of the genetic effects among these language clusters was corroborated by significant differences of the human gene expression profiles (Allen Human Brain Atlas dataset). Among them, the bilateral basal ganglia (mainly dorsal caudate) exhibited a common genetic basis for language, tool, and body part processing, and the right superior temporal gyrus exhibited a common genetic basis for language and tool processing across multiple types of analyses. These results uncovered the heterogeneous genetic patterns of language neural processes, shedding light on the evolution of language and its shared origins with tools and bodily functions.</p>

                Background The global construction industry causes considerable stress to workers, affecting them physically and mentally. Stress, a reaction to difficult situations, can cause negative health effects. The demanding environment of a construction site increases stress, which leads to psychological, physical, and behavioral reactions. Traditional treatments often have side effects and social stigma. Hydrotherapy, which uses water for healing, offers a promising alternative that promotes relaxation and detoxification. Its multiple benefits make it a valuable stress management tool. This scoping review aims to critically analyze existing interventions on physiological well-being popular in the construction industry and to investigate the biological responses of hydrotherapy to stress markers. Finally, make recommendations that support the health of construction industry workers. Methods An evaluation funneled by the Arksey and O’Malley framework, improvements plus suggestions by Levac, Colquhoun and O’Brien, Daudt et al., with the 2015 Johanna Briggs Institute guidelines will be performed. Organized electronic explorations of records and search engines including Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Google Scholar, plus IEEE Xplore will be conducted to retrieve distributed peer-reviewed articles from all research projects, excluding reviews and gray published works. All literature, research questions and sub-questions meeting the inclusion criteria will be integrated in this evaluation. All searched literature is transferred to the Endnote 21 library. The quality evaluation of the involved papers will be achieved by applying the MMAT 2018 version. Discussion We envision charting applicable sources on stress, researching the efficacy of treatment alternatives for stress as well as assessing their correlation with quality of life in construction workers. This study is expected to expose research gaps, which could guide future accomplishment research on stress treatment mediations.

                Background Academic achievement is the result of both effort and perseverance exerted by the students. This mixed-methods study aims to investigate the factors affecting the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was utilized. In the quantitative phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 1008 students (773 females and 235 males) from 23 Syrian universities. A questionnaire consisting of 48 items was designed to be completed by pharmacy students using a 5-point Likert scale. In the qualitative phase, twelve questions were developed to interview thirty pharmacy students from five Syrian universities to obtain in-depth insights into the factors influencing their academic achievement. Results A significant number of students lacked effective time management skills, identified as a weakness among students. The majority of students faced challenges in maintaining a consistent study routine, averaging a score of (2.0). Motivation towards learning emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing academic performance. Lecturers in the pharmacy faculty employed traditional teaching methods (2.01), and the pharmacy curriculum was perceived as lacking modernity (1.92). Quantitative findings demonstrated that pharmacy students experienced exam-related anxiety (2.05), identified as a weakness in the qualitative phase. Factors associated with the Syrian crisis, like unreliable electricity (1.87) and transportation issues (1.83), could have an impact on academic achievement. Economic conditions were identified as challenging to students’ academic performance, negatively affecting the learning process (1.98). Conclusion The results of the study demonstrate that personal factors, lecturers, educational environment, exams, and the Syrian crisis influence the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-867/v1?src=rss">More foreign-accented but more comprehensible: Attrition and amelioration of L1 speech in proficient L2 learners [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background There is an increasing interest in cross-linguistic influences of the second language (L2) on the first (L1), but its communicative impact remains to be elucidated. This study investigates how L2 learners’ L1 pronunciation is perceived as foreign-accented and (in) comprehensible as a function of their L2 learning experience and proficiency levels. Methods Read speech of 154 L1 Japanese learners of L2 English in the J-AESOP corpus was examined, where approximately one-third of them had lived in English-speaking countries and the rest had never lived outside of Japan. Their L1 speech was rated by another group of native Japanese listeners for accentedness and comprehensibility (from October 25, 2022 to August 20, 2023), while their L2 speech was previously rated by native American English listeners for nativelikeness or proficiency. The speakers’ vowel acoustics were also examined. Results More proficient L2 speakers were perceived as more foreign-accented in their L1, but only if they had lived overseas; their length of residence abroad predicted the degree of perceived accentedness. In contrast, more proficient L2 speakers were consistently perceived as more comprehensible in the L1, regardless of prior overseas experience. Acoustic analyses indicated that perceived accentedness is associated with a clockwise chain shift of all vowel categories in the vowel space. It was also revealed that the dispersion, rather than compactness, of vowel production contributed to perceived comprehensibility, although the degree of L1 vowel dispersion did not predict L2 proficiency. Conclusions The overall results suggest two main conclusions. First, perceptible L1 foreign accent likely results from L1 disuse rather than L2 interference, thereby L1 pronunciation differs from native norms at a system-wide rather than category-specific level. Second, L2 learning has a positive influence on perceived L1 comprehensibility, rather than individuals with clearer and more comprehensible L1 speech being inherently better L2 learners.

                Background Music, a profound human expression, can have physical implications for its practitioners. Musicians face various physical challenges that can impact their well-being, with craniofacial and temporomandibular pain being prevalent yet understudied. Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) affects up to one-third of the population, though prevalence varies by study. While musculoskeletal issues like carpal tunnel syndrome are well-documented in musicians, craniofacial and temporomandibular pain is less explored. This study aims to determine the differences in TMJD frequency among music students of different instrumental specialties. Methods The sample was composed of students between 12 and 25 years of age from the National University of Music of Peru. A stratified random probability sample was chosen. Data were collected using a structured instrument covering general data, academic information, dental malocclusion, the Fonseca Simplified Anamnestic Index, and the Global Stress Perception Scale. Statistical analysis included Pearson's Chi-square test and a generalized linear model regression. Results The sample included 71.4% males with a median age of 23 years. Class II dental occlusion was most common (51.4%). TMJD prevalence was: 14.3% no TMJD, 60.0% mild TMJD, 22.9% moderate TMJD, and 2.9% severe TMJD. Metal wind (PR=0.04, 95%CI [0.00; 50.04], p=0.002) and woodwind players (PR=0.03, 95%CI [0.00; 0.56], p=0.018) had lower TMJD prevalence compared to plucked string and percussion players. Post-regression analysis indicated significant differences between metal wind and percussion students (p=0.030) and between percussion and woodwind students (p=0.025). These results are supported by the adjusted ratio of proportions analysis, which maintains statistical significance. Conclusion We found significant differences in TMJD prevalence among music students based on their instrumental specialty, with lower rates in metal wind and woodwind players compared to plucked string and percussion players.

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

                Background Pragmatic language assessment in children is performed in line with standard protocols, guidelines, and best practices. The absence of these aspects in the Indian context has resulted in the quest to explore the approaches used by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to assess pragmatic language impairments. This survey explored the current practices of SLPs towards the assessment of pragmatic language among preschool children in India. It also aimed to identify the barriers, facilitators and identify the level of knowledge, skill and overall practice of SLPs towards their practices using self-appraisal. Methods A total of 100 SLPs(94 females and 6 males) working with preschool aged children (three-to-six-year-olds) from across different Indian states participated in the survey. Participants were enquired about the aspects of pragmatic language assessed, methods used for assessment, awareness and use of Indian tools, the settings, members, and language used for the assessment. Additionally, they were asked to mention the specific tools used, informal methods used, barriers and facilitators, and self-appraise their knowledge, skill and overall practice. Results Majority of participants assessed multiple aspects of pragmatic language. All used a combination of different assessment methods, with the participants commonly using informal compared to formal approaches. Preschoolers were assessed at multiple settings, along with different communication partners. Lack of awareness on assessment tools developed in India was the major barrier, while the use of informal tasks or activities were the major facilitators influencing pragmatic language assessment to a greater extent. The knowledge and skills for the assessment of pragmatic language obtained poorer scores compared to practices. Conclusions The assessment practices of the SLPs were largely influenced by the unavailability of developed or adapted tools for Indian preschoolers, leading to the need to develop indigenous assessment tools. Certain considerations for further assessment practices have been identified and discussed.

                Occipital horn syndrome (OHS) is a rare genetic disease and copper transport disorder caused by a faulty ATP7A gene with multisystemic presentations, most originally related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue affections. In our case, a male neonate with OHS presented soon after birth with pathognomonic occipital exostosis, cutis laxa at the nape region, and widely opened skull sutures and fontanels. A skeletal survey showed occipital exostosis projecting from the line of insertion of the trapezius muscle and wide fontanels on skull X-ray films with no exostoses or deformities elsewhere. In addition to our case report being the second reported case for the condition detected early in the neonatal period, it also emphasizes the importance of investigating any sign thoroughly, as it may be an early alarming sign of a progressive disease that may affect the patient’s quality of life. In addition, it highlights the value of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of these patients.

                Patients with hepatitis C share a variety of anemia, including bleeding, nutritional deficiencies, and anemia of chronic disease. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is usually reported with interferon-alpha and/or ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We report an unusual case of AIHA occurring in a49-year-old patient with untreated hepatitis C infection who presented with functional anemia syndrome. Monospecific direct antiglobulin test showed the presence of anti-complement (C3d++). Cold agglutinin titer was 1/16 at 4°C. The patient improved following blood transfusion, steroid therapy and direct acting antivirals.

                Background Excessive smartphone use has become a growing public health concern, especially among young people. Previous studies have suggested a possible relationship between excessive smartphone use and bruxism. However, the evidence on this relationship is still limited and inconclusive. This study aimed to determine the relationship between smartphone dependence and addiction and bruxism in “NEET” (not in education, employment or training) young people in two coastal cities in Peru: Piura and Chincha. Methods A cross-sectional, correlational, and exploratory study was conducted. The sample consisted of 195 "NEETs" young people who attended to dental office. Two data collection instruments were used: the Smartphone Dependence and Addiction Scale (EDAS-18) and the self-reported bruxism questionnaire (CBA). The Chi2 Pearson test was used to analyze the association between the variables. Results In Piura, a significant association was found between smartphone dependence or addiction and bruxism (49.3% of young people with smartphone dependence or addiction had bruxism, p-value = 0.003). However, in Chincha this relationship was not significant. In the latter city, bruxism showed a significant association with gender (men had a higher prevalence of bruxism, p-value = 0.034), but not with smartphone dependence or addiction (p-value = 0.171). In Piura, the proportion of bruxism was 3.77 times higher in those with smartphone dependence or addiction in the simple model (p-value = 0.004), and 5.38 times higher in the adjusted model (p-value = 0.001). Conclusion This study highlights the regional variability in the relationship between smartphone use and bruxism among “NEETs” young people. A significant association is evident in Piura but not in Chincha, which underscores the need for context-adapted interventions to address the effects of excessive technology use on oral health.

                Background Heat induced by thermogenesis is an essential therapeutic intervention in medical practice. Moreover, thermogenesis improves the innate immune response. This study focuses on hand-clasping with a raised thumb (HCRT) as a thermogenic source and its effect on heart rate variability (HRV). Methods The study analyzed the ECG, thermal images of the upper body, axillary temperature, and breath exergy of 15 participants. The metabolic effect of thermogenesis is an important factor in type II diabetes mellitus (type II DM). Therefore, the clinical application included recording capillary blood glucose of 12 type-II DM subjects before and after the HCRT intervention. Results The mean axillary temperature slope increased by 11.5 %. The spatial change in temperature gradient (∇2T) at hot and cold spots also slightly increased by 3.42 % and 2.53 %, respectively. HRV improved as the VLFHF ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.05) by 52.62 %. The very low frequency (VLF) component of HRV has a relationship to thermoregulation, which is reflected through a significant increase (p < 0.05) of 41.7 % for the power under sub-VLF at 0.0327-0.04 Hz during HCRT. The spot width (SW), range, and norm of ∇2T reduces insignificantly during HCRT. There was a significant (p < 0.001) increase in the exhaled temperature by 0.5 ° C in both nostrils during 1st phase of HCRT. The standard deviation of exergy in the right nostril showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) of 72.72 % during HCRT. The Clinical tests showed a significant reduction (p < 0.001) of 24.14 % in capillary blood glucose (CBG) after HCRT. Conclusions HCRT aids in thermogenesis with higher exergy and HRV owing to a significant reduction in the VLFHF ratio.

                Background Determine the effects of a multifactorial lifestyle intervention on physical activity (PA), BMI and health-related quality of life (QoL) in obese and overweight adolescents. Methods Nine schools in India were clustered randomly in a 12-month study with students allocated to a multifactorial intervention (MFI), or exercise only (EX) or control (CON) group. Participants were adolescents aged 11-16 years (n=671). In the MFI group, adolescents and their parents received lifestyle education using a validated booklet combined with a PA intervention for school students. The EX group received school-based PA only; the CON group continued regular activities. Primary outcomes were PA levels measured with the PAQ-A, and BMI; the secondary outcome was health-related QoL. A linear regression statistical model was used to analyse time, group effects and interactions, with Bonferroni correction for within-group differences at baseline (T0) and at 12-weeks (T1) (post-intervention), 6-month (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups. Results Significant time and group effects observed for all groups with PA scores (p<0.001), with MFI group having largest increase in PA; with BMI (p<0.001) and MFI showing the least gain in BMI; and HRQOL (p<0.001), with MFI group showing greatest improvement in scores. There were significant increases in PA at T1 and T3 time-points with the EX group, and at T3 time-point only for MFI and CON, with MFI group showing largest increase in HRQOL scores. BMI increased significantly for all groups at T2 (MFI p=0.001, EX p<0.001) and T3 (p<0.001), while HRQOL increased significantly for both MFI and EX at both follow-ups (p<0.001). Conclusions School-based lifestyle MFI was more effective for improving PA, lifestyle behaviours and HRQOL than exercise alone for adolescents, although BMI was not reduced. MFI with PA could be an effective school-based approach for behaviour modification but BMI has limitations for measuring body composition changes.

                The translation of animal-based biomedical research into clinical research is often inadequate. Maximizing translation should be central to animal research on human diseases, guiding researchers in study design and animal model selection. However, practical considerations often drive the choice of animal model, which may not always reflect key patient characteristics, such as sex and age, impacting the disease's course. Despite diseases affecting both sexes, researchers frequently use male mice. To address this imbalance, journals and funding agencies have begun questioning the sex of animals used in studies and issued new guidelines. Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade. By systematically assessing the age and sex of the mice, we aim to initiate a discussion on the appropriate choice of animal model to improve the translatability of research results.

                Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, with early diagnosis and risk factor identification crucial for improving outcomes. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) measurements have emerged as promising tools in breast cancer diagnostics. However, the influence of hormonal status on these measurements remains unclear. Objective This scoping review aims to synthesize current evidence on how hormonal changes in pre- and post-menopausal women influence ADC values of benign, malignant, and fibroglandular breast tissues. Method Following the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we conducted a comprehensive search of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases for relevant studies published between January 2000 and 2021. Inclusion criteria encompassed 1.5 Tesla MRI studies reporting ADC values in female subjects, considering menopausal status. Results Six studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 612 patients, were analyzed. Findings suggest that menopausal status may influence ADC values, with postmenopausal women generally showing lower ADC values in both normal fibroglandular tissue and breast lesions. The impact of menstrual cycle phases on ADC values was less consistent across studies. Conclusions This review highlights the potential influence of hormonal status on ADC values in breast tissues. While DWI with ADC mapping shows promise as a reliable diagnostic tool across different hormonal states, further research is needed to fully understand and account for hormonal influences on ADC measurements. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, standardization of DWI protocols, and integration of hormonal status information into breast cancer risk assessment models.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Sui's hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

                Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are aquatic sessile metazoans found worldwide in marine and freshwater environments. They are significant in the animal tree of life as one of the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and as filter feeders play crucial ecological roles, particularly in coral reefs, but are susceptible to the effects of climate change. In the face of the current biodiversity crisis, genomic data is crucial for species conservation efforts and predicting their evolutionary potential in response to environmental changes. However, there is a limited availability of culturable sponge species with annotated high-quality genomes to further comprehensive insights into animal evolution, function, and their response to the ongoing global change. Despite the publication of a few high-quality annotated sponge genomes, there remains a gap in resources for culturable sponge species. To address this gap, we provide high quality draft genomes of the two congeneric aquarium species Tethya wilhelma and Tethya minuta, small ball-shaped demosponges that are easily maintained long-term in ex situ culture. As such, they offer promising opportunities as laboratory models to contribute to advancing our understanding of sponge biology and provide valuable resources for studying animal evolution, function, and responses to environmental challenges.

                Purpose: This study aims to survey the demographic status of aesthetic plastic surgeons in an economically developed region and to investigate their continuing training needs in contents, training methods, and barriers in private and government hospitals.   Methods: A cross-sectional survey with a self-administered questionnaire was conducted from January to December, 2022 in Guangdong, China. In-depth interviews were conducted with key informants to gain insights on the current demographic status. Demographic data and training needs assessment were collected and compared with the chi-square test, Fisher’s test, Mann-Whitney U-test using R software. Results: The disparity of surgeons’ demographic data between private and government hospitals was small. Over 60% of practicing aesthetic plastic surgeons transferred from other specialties, and one third of them had less than three years of working experience. Half of surgeons attended training less than three times with an affordable expense of 1000-5000RMB. Almost 80% of them had strong willingness to attend a continuing training program. They prefer to attend further study in a tertiary hospital, with a short topic-focused training course and operation demonstrations. Their favorable training contents were rhinoplasty, eye surgery, and new technologies. Our questionnaire survey revealed the likelihood that the surgeons had a graduate degree in government hospitals outweighed those in private hospitals (P<0.05). Results also showed that the government hospitals focused more on repair and reconstructive surgery and academic research, whereas, private hospitals focused on market needs and were more profit-driven, where the organizational needs had influence on their different training needs for aesthetic plastic surgeons. Conclusion: It would be favorable to take the demographic status of aesthetic plastic surgeons and organizational needs into consideration in designing a continuing training program in plastic surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-204/v2?src=rss">How effective is dentin autograft for socket preservation and implant site preparation: A systematic review protocol. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Socket preservation is a surgical procedure aimed at preserving the dimensions of the alveolar bone following tooth extraction. It is performed by filling the extraction socket with bone graft material with or without a barrier membrane. Recently, dentine obtained from extracted teeth has been tried as an autograft for socket preservation. Studies have compared the use of dentin to other bone grafts, however, systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy of dentin for socket preservation are limited. Hence, this systematic review protocol is proposed to generate evidence on the efficacy of dentin as a viable alternative to other bone graft materials for socket preservation. Methods This systematic review protocol was prepared according to the Methodological Expectations of the Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) guidelines. It will be conducted using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, Cochrane Central, and EBSCO databases and clinical trial registries, will be searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies that have used autologous dentin graft (either in particulate/putty, or/matrix form) for socket preservation. The radiographic and clinical assessment of bone and soft tissue healing of the preserved sockets along with patient-related outcomes following surgery will be assessed. The risk of bias assessment of the RCTs and Non-RCTs will be assessed using the ‘Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool (ROB II) and ROBINS-I respectively. The certainty of evidence will be assessed by the GRADE approach. Discussion This evidence is important for dental clinicians and the public to make an informed decision when choosing graft material for socket preservation. The extracted teeth are considered biological waste; however, this evidence provides scope for using a less invasive autograft for bone regenerative procedures. Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42021201958 (Registered on 15/02/2021).

                Midkine is a secreted protein that acts as a growth factor or cytokine involved in cell survival and inflammatory processes. It accumulates in amyloid plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The reproducibility of Midkine research would be enhanced if the community had access to well-characterized anti-Midkine antibodies. In this study, we characterized 8 commercial Midkine antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in a knockout cell line and isogenic parental control. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

<p>+)-Catechin exerts neuroprotective effects by triggering the Nrf2-induced antioxidant system and attenuates NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle activation through inhibition of ROS production and the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, thereby alleviating CCI-induced neuropathic pain in male rats.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the potential mechanisms by which (+)-catechin alleviates neuropathic pain. Thirty-two male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into four groups: the sham group, the chronic constriction injury (CCI)group, the CCI+ ibuprofen group, and the CCI+ (+)-catechin group. CCI surgery induces thermal hyperalgesia in rats and (+)-catechin ameliorated CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and repaired damaged sciatic nerve in rats. CCI decreased SOD levels in male rat spinal cord dorsal horn and promoted MDA production, induced oxidative stress by increasing NOX4 levels and decreasing antioxidant enzyme HO-1 levels, and also increased protein levels of TLR4, p-NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome components, and IL-1β. In contrast, (+)-catechin reversed the above results. In i vitro experiments, (+)-catechin reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GMI-R1 cells after LPS stimulation and attenuated the co-expression of IBA-1 and NLRP3. It also showed significant inhibition of the NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammatory pathways and activation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant system. Overall, these findings suggest that (+)-catechin inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through the triggering of the Nrf2-induced antioxidant system, the inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, and the production of ROS to alleviate CCI-induced neuropathic pain in male rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95821">Bidirectional fear modulation by discrete anterior insular circuits in male mice</a></h4>

              
                The brain’s ability to appraise threats and execute appropriate defensive responses is essential for survival in a dynamic environment. Humans studies have implicated the anterior insular cortex (aIC) in subjective fear regulation and its abnormal activity in fear/anxiety disorders. However, the complex aIC connectivity patterns involved in regulating fear remain under investigated. To address this, we recorded single units in the aIC of freely moving male mice that had previously undergone auditory fear conditioning, assessed the effect of optogenetically activating specific aIC output structures in fear, and examined the organization of aIC neurons projecting to the specific structures with retrograde tracing. Single-unit recordings revealed that a balanced number of aIC pyramidal neurons’ activity either positively or negatively correlated with a conditioned tone-induced freezing (fear) response. Optogenetic manipulations of aIC pyramidal neuronal activity during conditioned tone presentation altered the expression of conditioned freezing. Neural tracing showed that non-overlapping populations of aIC neurons project to the amygdala or the medial thalamus, and the pathway bidirectionally modulated conditioned fear. Specifically, optogenetic stimulation of the aIC-amygdala pathway increased conditioned freezing, while optogenetic stimulation of the aIC-medial thalamus pathway decreased it. Our findings suggest that the balance of freezing-excited and freezing-inhibited neuronal activity in the aIC and the distinct efferent circuits interact collectively to modulate fear behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94755">Impact of protein and small molecule interactions on kinase conformations</a></h4>

              
                Protein kinases act as central molecular switches in the control of cellular functions. Alterations in the regulation and function of protein kinases may provoke diseases including cancer. In this study we investigate the conformational states of such disease-associated kinases using the high sensitivity of the kinase conformation (KinCon) reporter system. We first track BRAF kinase activity conformational changes upon melanoma drug binding. Second, we also use the KinCon reporter technology to examine the impact of regulatory protein interactions on LKB1 kinase tumor suppressor functions. Third, we explore the conformational dynamics of RIP kinases in response to TNF pathway activation and small molecule interactions. Finally, we show that CDK4/6 interactions with regulatory proteins alter conformations which remain unaffected in the presence of clinically applied inhibitors. Apart from its predictive value, the KinCon technology helps to identify cellular factors that impact drug efficacies. The understanding of the structural dynamics of full-length protein kinases when interacting with small molecule inhibitors or regulatory proteins is crucial for designing more effective therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89911">Determinantal point process attention over grid cell code supports out of distribution generalization</a></h4>

              
                Deep neural networks have made tremendous gains in emulating human-like intelligence, and have been used increasingly as ways of understanding how the brain may solve the complex computational problems on which this relies. However, these still fall short of, and therefore fail to provide insight into how the brain supports strong forms of generalization of which humans are capable. One such case is out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization – successful performance on test examples that lie outside the distribution of the training set. Here, we identify properties of processing in the brain that may contribute to this ability. We describe a two-part algorithm that draws on speciﬁc features of neural computation to achieve OOD generalization, and provide a proof of concept by evaluating performance on two challenging cognitive tasks. First we draw on the fact that the mammalian brain represents metric spaces using grid cell code (e.g., in the entorhinal cortex): abstract representations of relational structure, organized in recurring motifs that cover the representational space. Second, we propose an attentional mechanism that operates over the grid cell code using determinantal point process (DPP), that we call DPP attention (DPP-A) – a transformation that ensures maximum sparseness in the coverage of that space. We show that a loss function that combines standard task-optimized error with DPP-A can exploit the recurring motifs in the grid cell code, and can be integrated with common architectures to achieve strong OOD generalization performance on analogy and arithmetic tasks. This provides both an interpretation of how the grid cell code in the mammalian brain may contribute to generalization performance, and at the same time a potential means for improving such capabilities in artiﬁcial neural networks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95180">Modulation of α-synuclein aggregation amid diverse environmental perturbation</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein (αS) is implicated in Parkinson’s disease due to its aberrant aggregation propensity. In a bid to identify the traits of its aggregation, here we computationally simulate the multi-chain association process of αS in aqueous as well as under diverse environmental perturbations. In particular, the aggregation of αS in aqueous and varied environmental condition led to marked concentration differences within protein aggregates, resembling liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Both saline and crowded settings enhanced the LLPS propensity. However, the surface tension of αS droplet responds differently to crowders (entropy-driven) and salt (enthalpy-driven). Conformational analysis reveals that the IDP chains would adopt extended conformations within aggregates and would maintain mutually perpendicular orientations to minimize inter-chain electrostatic repulsions. The droplet stability is found to stem from a diminished intra-chain interactions in the C-terminal regions of αS, fostering inter-chain residue-residue interactions. Intriguingly, a graph theory analysis identifies <i>small-world-like networks</i> within droplets across environmental conditions, suggesting the prevalence of a consensus interaction patterns among the chains. Together these findings suggest a delicate balance between molecular grammar and environment-dependent nuanced aggregation behavior of αS.

                Motor learning is often viewed as a unitary process that operates outside of conscious awareness. This perspective has led to the development of sophisticated models designed to elucidate the mechanisms of implicit sensorimotor learning. In this review, we argue for a broader perspective, emphasizing the contribution of explicit strategies to sensorimotor learning tasks. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical framework for motor learning that consists of three fundamental processes: reasoning, the process of understanding action–outcome relationships; refinement, the process of optimizing sensorimotor and cognitive parameters to achieve motor goals; and retrieval, the process of inferring the context and recalling a control policy. We anticipate that this ‘3R’ framework for understanding how complex movements are learned will open exciting avenues for future research at the intersection between cognition and action.

">Assessing the Impact of Selective Attention on the Cortical Tracking of the Speech Envelope in the Delta and Theta Frequency Bands and How Musical Training Does (Not) Affect It</a></h4>

              
                Oral communication regularly takes place amidst background noise, requiring the ability to selectively attend to a target speech stream. Musical training has been shown to be beneficial for this task. Regarding the underlying neural mechanisms, recent studies showed that the speech envelope is tracked by neural activity in the auditory cortex, which plays a role in the neural processing of speech, including speech in noise. The neural tracking occurs predominantly in two frequency bands, the delta and the theta band. However, much regarding the specifics of these neural responses, as well as their modulation through musical training, still remain unclear. Here, we investigated the delta- and theta- band cortical tracking of the speech envelope of attended and ignored speech using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We thereby assessed both musicians and non-musicians to explore potential differences between these groups. The cortical speech tracking was quantified through source-reconstructing the MEG data and subsequently relating the speech envelope in a certain frequency band to the MEG data using linear models. We thereby found the theta-band tracking to be dominated by early responses with comparable magnitudes for attended and ignored speech, whereas the delta band tracking exhibited both earlier and later responses that were modulated by selective attention. Almost no significant differences emerged in the neural responses between musicians and non-musicians. Our findings show that only the speech tracking in the delta but not in the theta band contributes to selective attention, but that this mechanism is essentially unaffected by musical training.

">What the Average Really Means: Dissociating Effect Size and Effect Prevalence using p-curve Mixtures</a></h4>

              
                Most research in the behavioral sciences aims to characterize effects of interest using sample means intended to describe the "typical" person. A difference in means is usually construed as a size difference in an effect common across subjects. However, mean effect size varies with both within-subject effect size and population prevalence (proportion of population showing the effect) in compared groups or across conditions. Few studies consider how prevalence affects mean effect size measurements and existing estimators of prevalence are, conversely, confounded by uncertainty about within-subject power. We introduce a widely applicable Bayesian method, the p-curve mixture model, that jointly estimates prevalence and effect size. Our approach outperforms existing prevalence estimation methods when within-subject power is uncertain and is sensitive to differences in prevalence or effect size across groups or experimental conditions. We present examples, extracting novel insights from existing datasets, and provide a user-facing software tool.

">Iowa Brain-Behavior Modeling Toolkit: An Open-Source MATLAB Tool for Inferential and Predictive Modeling of Imaging-Behavior and Lesion-Deficit Relationships</a></h4>

              
                The traditional analytical framework taken by neuroimaging studies in general, and lesion-behavior studies in particular, has been inferential in nature and has focused on identifying and interpreting statistically significant effects within the sample under study. While this framework is well-suited for hypothesis testing approaches, achieving the modern goal of precision medicine requires a different framework that is predictive in nature and that focuses on maximizing the predictive power of models and evaluating their ability to generalize beyond the data that were used to train them. However, few tools exist to support the development and evaluation of predictive models in the context of neuroimaging or lesion-behavior research, creating an obstacle to the widespread adoption of predictive modeling approaches in the field. Further, existing tools for lesion-behavior analysis are often unable to accommodate categorical outcome variables and often impose restrictions on the predictor data. Researchers therefore often must use different software packages and analytical approaches depending on whether they are addressing a classification vs. regression problem and on whether their predictor data correspond to binary lesion images, continuous lesion-network images, connectivity matrices, or other data modalities. To address these limitations, we have developed a MATLAB software toolkit that supports both inferential and predictive modeling frameworks, accommodates both classification and regression problems, and does not impose restrictions on the modality of the predictor data. The toolkit features both a graphical user interface and scripting interface, includes implementations of multiple mass-univariate, multivariate, and machine learning models, features built-in and customizable routines for hyper-parameter optimization, cross-validation, model stacking, and significance testing, and automatically generates text-based descriptions of key methodological details and modeling results to improve reproducibility and minimize errors in the reporting of methods and results. Here, we provide an overview and discussion of the toolkit features and demonstrate its functionality by applying it to the question of how expressive and receptive language impairments relate to lesion location, structural disconnection, and functional network disruption in a large sample of patients with left hemispheric brain lesions. We find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are most strongly associated with left lateral prefrontal and left posterior temporal/parietal damage, respectively. We also find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are associated with partially overlapping patterns of fronto-temporal structural disconnection, and that the associated functional networks are also similar. Importantly, we find that lesion location and lesion-derived network measures are highly predictive of both types of impairment, with predictions from models trained on these measures explaining ~30-40% of the variance on average when applied to data from patients not used to train the models. We have made the toolkit publicly available, and we have included a comprehensive set of tutorial notebooks to support new users in applying the toolkit in their studies.

">Experience instructs the refinement of feature-selectivity in the mouse primary visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Neurons exhibit selectivity for specific features: a property essential for extracting and encoding relevant information in the environment. This feature-selectivity is thought to be modifiable by experience at the level of the cortex. Here, we demonstrate that selective exposure to a feature during development can instruct the population representation for that feature in the primary visual thalamus. This thalamic plasticity is not simply inherited from the cortex because it is still observed when recordings were performed in the absence of cortical feedback. Moreover, plasticity is blocked in mutant mice that exhibit deficits in retinogeniculate refinement, indicating that alterations in feature-selectivity are a direct result of changes in feedforward connectivity. These experience-dependent changes persist into older ages-highlighting the importance of this developmental period in shaping population coding in the thalamus. Our results show that salient environmental features are hard-wired into thalamic circuits during a discrete developmental window.

">Single-cell spatial transcriptomics reveals molecular patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to α-synuclein pathology in a transgenic mouse model of Lewy body disease</a></h4>

              
                One of the unifying pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the presence of misfolded, aggregated, and often phosphorylated forms of the protein -synuclein in neurons. -Synuclein pathology appears in select populations of neurons throughout various cortical and subcortical regions, and little is currently known about why some neurons develop pathology while others are spared. Here, we utilized subcellular-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses wild-type human -synuclein (-syn-tg) to evaluate patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to -synuclein pathology. By performing post-IST immunofluorescence for -synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSyn), we identified cell types in the cortex and hippocampus that were vulnerable or resistant to developing pSyn pathology. Next, we investigated the transcriptional underpinnings of the observed selective vulnerability using a set of custom probes to detect genes involved in -synuclein processing and toxicity. We identified expression of the kinase:substrate pair Plk2, which phosphorylates -synuclein at Ser129, and human SNCA (hSNCA), as underlying the selective vulnerability to pSyn pathology. Finally, we performed differential gene expression analysis, comparing non-transgenic cells to pSyn- and pSyn+ -syn- tg cells to reveal gene expression changes downstream of hSNCA overexpression and pSyn pathology, which included pSyn-dependent alterations in mitochondrial and endolysosomal genes. This study provides a comprehensive use case of IST, yielding new biological insights into the formation of -synuclein pathology and its downstream effects in a PD/DLB mouse model.

">Social Isolation During Adolescence Differentially Affects Spatial Learning in Adult Male and Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                Social isolation is a risk factor for cognitive impairment. Adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to these effects, because they are in a critical period of development marked by significant physical, hormonal, and social changes. However, it is unclear if the effects of social isolation on learning and memory are similar in both sexes or if they persist into adulthood after a period of recovery. We socially isolated male and female 129Sv/Ev mice throughout adolescence (post-natal days 29-56), provided a 2-week resocialization recovery period, and then tested spatial learning and cognitive flexibility in the active place avoidance task. After behavioral testing, mice were injected with 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) so that lasting effects of social isolation on cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus could be examined. We found that in males, isolation led to a modest impairment in the rate of initial spatial learning, whereas in females, initial learning was unaffected. However, when the location of the shock zone was switched during the conflict variant of the task, cognitive flexibility was impaired in females only. Similarly, social isolation reduced cell proliferation in the ventral dentate gyrus only in females. Together, these findings indicate that social isolation during adolescence differentially impairs spatial processing in males and females, with effects that persist into adulthood.

">Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 activation promotes sociability and regulates the expression of genes associated with anxiolytic-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                We previously demonstrated that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) prevents stress-mediated reductions in sociability. S1PR3 is a ubiquitously expressed G-protein coupled receptor that regulates immune system function, although its regulation of other biological processes is not well understood. Pharmacological activators of S1PR3 might provide important insights for understanding the neural substrates underlying sociability and/or serve as novel, preclinical treatments for social anxiety. Here we show that in mice, systemic injections of an S1PR3-specific agonist, CYM5541, promotes sociability in males and females whereas an S1PR3-specific antagonist, CAY10444, increases amygdala activation and promotes social anxiety-like behavior in females. S1PR3 expression is increased in the mPFC and dentate gyrus of females compared to males. RNA sequencing in the mPFC reveals that S1PR3 activation alters the expression of transcripts related to immune function, neurotransmission, transmembrane ion transport, and intracellular signaling. This work provides evidence that S1PR3 agonists, which have classically been used as immune modulators, might also be used as novel anxiolytics. S1PR3 might be an important hub gene for anxiolytic effects as it reduces inflammatory processes caused by stress and increases transcripts linked to anxiolytic neurotransmission.

">Characterization of Social and Repetitive Behaviors of Mllt11/Af1q/TcF7c Conditional Knockout Mice</a></h4>

              
                Mllt11 (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to chromosome 11; also known as Af1q/TcF7c) has been identified as a novel regulator of neural development, playing a role in the migration and outgrowth of cortical projection neurons. We previously reported that the conditional inactivation of the Mllt11 gene in the mouse superficial cortex resulted in reduced connectivity of the corpus callosum and white fiber tracts, resulting in reduced cortical thickness. However, the behavioral consequences of Mllt11 loss are unknown. Callosal abnormalities are thought to be present in 3-5% of all neurodevelopmental disorders and reduced corpus callosum volume correlates with core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in humans. Cortical thickness dysregulation is likewise shared among various neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. We therefore investigated the behavioral consequences of conditional knockout of Mllt11 in upper cortical layer 2/3 projection neurons using transgenic Cux2iresCre mice. Utilizing tasks designed to reflect core ASD symptoms, we examined the behaviors of both male and female conditional knockout animals. These tests included olfaction habituation/dishabituation, three-chambered social approach, marble burying, and nestlet shredding. We found sex-dependent disruptions in social preference, and nestlet shredding in animals lacking Mllt11, with the female mice presenting with more disruptions than the males. Understanding the behavioral phenotype associated with genes of interest specifically in the context of sex differences is crucial to individualized treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<p>In recent years, there has been marked interest in looking at the psychological consequences of medical conditions, such as traumatic or acquired brain injuries. Coping strategies are essential for clinical recovery and for dealing with the stressful events that a clinical condition brings with it. The purpose of this review is to analyze studies that explore how coping strategies influence psychological changes in patients with acquired brain injury. Studies were identified from research in the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. According to our findings, patients with ABI utilize different coping strategies based on the circumstances and factors such as the diagnosis severity, their age, time lived with the pathology, and personal characteristics, which have an influence on quality of life and rehabilitation. This review demonstrated that coping strategies have an impact on different aspects of the clinical and personal lives of patients with ABI. The rehabilitation process must consider the influence of these mechanisms on dealing with situations, as they can change cognitive and emotional perceptions of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; experience with the disease, as well as laying the foundations for functional or dysfunction in terms of the propensity of a person for the path of psychological and physical recovery.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study aims to explore the changes in dynamic overlapping communities in the brains of schizophrenia (SZ) patients and further investigate the dynamic restructuring patterns of overlapping communities in SZ patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 43 SZ patients and 49 normal controls (NC) were selected for resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis was conducted separately on SZ patients and NC using rs-fMRI and Jackknife Correlation techniques to construct dynamic brain network models. Based on these models, a dynamic overlapping community detection method was utilized to explore the abnormal overlapping community structure in SZ patients using evaluation metrics such as the structural stability of overlapping communities, nodes&amp;amp;rsquo; functional diversity, and activity level of overlapping communities. Results: The stability of communities in SZ patients showed a decreasing trend. The changes in the overlapping community structure of SZ patients may be related to a decrease in the diversity of overlapping node functions. Additionally, compared to the NC group, the activity level of overlapping communities of SZ patients was significantly reduced. Conclusion: The structure or organization of the brain functional network in SZ patients is abnormal or disrupted, and the activity of the brain network in information processing and transmission is weakened in SZ patients.</p>

                <p>The release of neurotransmitters (NTs) at central synapses is dependent on a cascade of protein interactions, specific to the presynaptic compartment. Among those dedicated molecules, the cytosolic complexins play an incompletely defined role as synaptic transmission regulators. Complexins are multidomain proteins that bind soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complexes, conferring both inhibitory and stimulatory functions. Using systematic mutagenesis and comparing reconstituted in vitro membrane fusion assays with electrophysiology in cultured neurons from mice of either sex, we deciphered the function of the N-terminus of complexin (Cpx) II. The N-terminus (amino acid 1&ndash;27) starts with a region enriched in hydrophobic amino acids (1&ndash;12), which binds lipids. Mutants maintaining this hydrophobic character retained the stimulatory function of Cpx, whereas exchanges introducing charged residues perturbed both spontaneous and evoked exocytosis. Mutants in the more distal region of the N-terminal domain (amino acid 11&ndash;18) showed a spectrum of effects. On the one hand, mutation of residue A12 increased spontaneous release without affecting evoked release. On the other hand, replacing D15 with amino acids of different shapes or hydrophobic properties (but not charge) not only increased spontaneous release but also impaired evoked release. Most surprising, this substitution reduced the size of the readily releasable pool, a novel function for Cpx at mammalian synapses. Thus, the exact amino acid composition of the Cpx N-terminus fine-tunes the degree of spontaneous and evoked NT release.</p>

                <p>Metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGlu8) is a heterogeneously expressed and poorly understood glutamate receptor with potential pharmacological significance. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical inhibitory modulator of the thalamocortical&ndash;corticothalamic (TC&ndash;CT) network and plays a crucial role in information processing throughout the brain, is implicated in a variety of psychiatric conditions, and is also a site of significant mGlu8 expression. Using both male and female mice, we determined via fluorescent in situ hybridization that parvalbumin-expressing cells in the TRN core and shell matrices (identified by <I>spp1+</I> and <I>ecel1+</I> expression, respectively), as well as the cortical layers involved in CT signaling, express <I>grm8</I> mRNA. We then assayed the physiological and behavioral impacts of perturbing <I>grm8</I> signaling in the TC circuit through conditional (adeno-associated virus-CRE mediated) and cell-type-specific constitutive deletion strategies. We show that constitutive parvalbumin <I>grm8</I> knock-out (PV<I><sup>grm8</sup></I> knock-out) mice exhibited (1) increased spontaneous excitatory drive onto dorsal thalamus relay cells and (2) impaired sensorimotor gating, measured via paired-pulse inhibition, but observed no differences in locomotion and thigmotaxis in repeated bouts of open field test (OFT). Conversely, we observed hyperlocomotive phenotypes and anxiolytic effects of AAV-mediated conditional knockdown of <I>grm8</I> in the TRN (TRN<I><sup>grm8</sup></I> knockdown) in repeated OFT. Our findings underscore a role for mGlu8 in regulating excitatory neurotransmission as well as anxiety-related locomotor behavior and sensorimotor gating, revealing potential therapeutic applications for various neuropsychiatric disorders and guiding future research endeavors into mGlu8 signaling and TRN function.</p>

                <p>Aberrant increase of arachidonic acid (ARA) has long been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the underlying causal mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we revealed a link between ARA mobilization and microglial dysfunction in A&beta; pathology. Lipidomic analysis of primary microglia from App<sup>NL-GF</sup> mice showed a marked increase in free ARA and lysophospholipids (LPLs) along with a decrease in ARA-containing phospholipids, suggesting increased ARA release from phospholipids (PLs). To manipulate ARA-containing PLs in microglia, we genetically deleted lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (<I>Lpcat3</I>), the main enzyme catalyzing the incorporation of ARA into PLs. Loss of microglial <I>Lpcat3</I> reduced the levels of ARA-containing PLs, free ARA and LPLs, leading to a compensatory increase in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-containing PLs in both male and female <I>App</I><sup>NL-GF</sup> mice. Notably, the reduction of ARA in microglia significantly ameliorated oxidative stress and inflammatory responses while enhancing the phagocytosis of A&beta; plaques and promoting the compaction of A&beta; deposits. Mechanistically, scRNA seq suggested that LPCAT3 deficiency facilitates phagocytosis by facilitating de novo lipid synthesis while protecting microglia from oxidative damage. Collectively, our study reveals a novel mechanistic link between ARA mobilization and microglial dysfunction in AD. Lowering brain ARA levels through pharmacological or dietary interventions may be a potential therapeutic strategy to slow down AD progression.</p>

                <p>Engaging the retrieval state (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Tulving, 1983</cross-ref>) impacts processing and behavior (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B34">Long and Kuhl, 2019</cross-ref>, <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">2021</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Smith et al., 2022</cross-ref>), but the extent to which top-down factors&mdash;explicit instructions and goals&mdash;versus bottom-up factors&mdash;stimulus properties such as repetition and similarity&mdash;jointly or independently induce the retrieval state is unclear. Identifying the impact of bottom-up and top-down factors on retrieval state engagement is critical for understanding how control of task-relevant versus task-irrelevant brain states influence cognition. We conducted between-subjects recognition memory tasks on male and female human participants in which we varied test phase goals. We recorded scalp electroencephalography and used an independently validated mnemonic state classifier (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Long, 2023</cross-ref>) to measure retrieval state engagement as a function of top-down task goals (recognize old vs detect new items) and bottom-up stimulus repetition (hits vs correct rejections (CRs)). We find that whereas the retrieval state is engaged for hits regardless of top-down goals, the retrieval state is only engaged during CRs when the top-down goal is to recognize old items. Furthermore, retrieval state engagement is greater for low compared to high confidence hits when the task goal is to recognize old items. Together, these results suggest that top-down demands to recognize old items induce the retrieval state independent from bottom-up factors, potentially reflecting the recruitment of internal attention to enable access of a stored representation.</p>

                <p>At chemical synapses, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) translate electrical signals into a trigger for synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion. VGCCs and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains they elicit must be located precisely to primed SVs to evoke rapid transmitter release. Localization is mediated by Rab3-interacting molecule (RIM) and RIM-binding proteins, which interact and bind to the C terminus of the CaV2 VGCC &alpha;-subunit. We studied this machinery at the mixed cholinergic/GABAergic neuromuscular junction of <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> hermaphrodites. <I>rimb-1</I> mutants had mild synaptic defects, through loosening the anchoring of UNC-2/CaV2 and delaying the onset of SV fusion. UNC-10/RIM deletion much more severely affected transmission. Although postsynaptic depolarization was reduced, <I>rimb-1</I> mutants had increased cholinergic (but reduced GABAergic) transmission, to compensate for the delayed release. This did not occur when the excitation&ndash;inhibition (E&ndash;I) balance was altered by removing GABA transmission. Further analyses of GABA defective mutants and GABA<SUB>A</SUB> or GABA<SUB>B</SUB> receptor deletions, as well as cholinergic rescue of RIMB-1, emphasized that GABA neurons may be more affected than cholinergic neurons. Thus, RIMB-1 function differentially affects excitation&ndash;inhibition balance in the different motor neurons, and RIMB-1 thus may differentially regulate transmission within circuits. Untethering the UNC-2/CaV2 channel by removing its C-terminal PDZ ligand exacerbated the <I>rimb-1</I> defects, and similar phenotypes resulted from acute degradation of the CaV2 &beta;-subunit CCB-1. Therefore, untethering of the CaV2 complex is as severe as its elimination, yet it does not abolish transmission, likely due to compensation by CaV1. Thus, robustness and flexibility of synaptic transmission emerge from VGCC regulation.</p>

                <p>During navigation, the neocortex actively integrates learned spatial context with current sensory experience to guide behaviors. However, the relative encoding of spatial and sensorimotor information among cortical cells, and whether hippocampal feedback continues to modify these properties after learning, remains poorly understood. Thus, two-photon microscopy of male and female Thy1-GCaMP6s mice was used to longitudinally image neurons spanning superficial retrosplenial cortex and layers II&ndash;Va of primary and secondary motor cortices before and after bilateral dorsal hippocampal lesions. During behavior on a familiar cued treadmill, the locations of two obstacles were interchanged to decouple place-tuning from cue-tuning among position-correlated cells with fields at those locations. Subpopulations of place and cue cells each formed interareal gradients such that higher-level cortical regions exhibited higher fractions of place cells, whereas lower-level regions exhibited higher fractions of cue cells. Position-correlated cells in the motor cortex also formed translaminar gradients; more superficial cells were more likely to exhibit fields and were more sparsely and precisely tuned than deeper cells. After dorsal hippocampal lesions, a neural representation of the learned environment persisted, but retrosplenial cortex exhibited significantly increased cue-tuning, and, in motor cortices, both position-correlated cell recruitment and population activity at the unstable obstacle locations became more homogeneously elevated across laminae. Altogether, these results support that the hippocampus continues to modulate cortical responses in familiar environments, and the relative impact of descending feedback obeys hierarchical interareal and interlaminar gradients opposite to the flow of ascending sensory inputs.</p>

                <p>Neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) and intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) that express the glucagon gene (<I>Gcg</I>) give rise to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)-immunopositive axons in the spinal cord and many subcortical brain regions. Central GLP1 receptor signaling contributes to motivated behavior and stress responses in rats and mice, in which hindbrain GLP1 neurons are activated to express c-Fos in a metabolic state-dependent manner. The present study examined whether GLP1 inputs to distinct brain regions arise from distinct subsets of <I>Gcg</I>-expressing neurons, and mapped the distribution of axon collaterals arising from projection-defined GLP1 neural populations. Using our Gcg-Cre knock-in rat model, Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) tracing was conducted in adult male and female rats to compare axonal projections of IRt versus cNTS GLP1 neurons. Overlapping projections were observed in all brain regions that receive GLP1 input, with the caveat that cNTS injections produced Cre-dependent labeling of some IRt neurons, and vice versa. In additional experiments, specific diencephalic or limbic forebrain nuclei were microinjected with Cre-dependent retrograde AAVs (AAVrg) that expressed reporters to fully label the axon collaterals of transduced GLP1 neurons. AAVrg injected into each forebrain site labeled <I>Gcg</I>-expressing neurons in both the cNTS and IRt. The collective axon collaterals of labeled neurons entered the spinal cord and every brain region previously reported to contain GLP1-positive axons. These results indicate that the axons of GLP1 neural populations that innervate the thalamic paraventricular nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and/or bed nucleus of the stria terminalis collectively innervate all central regions that receive GLP1 axonal input.</p>

                <p>The ventrolateral medulla (VLM) is a crucial region in the brain for visceral and somatic control, serving as a significant source of synaptic input to the spinal cord. Experimental studies have shown that gene expression in individual VLM neurons is predictive of their function. However, the molecular and cellular organization of the VLM has remained uncertain. This study aimed to create a comprehensive dataset of VLM cells using single-cell RNA sequencing in male and female mice. The dataset was enriched with targeted sequencing of spinally-projecting and adrenergic/noradrenergic VLM neurons. Based on differentially expressed genes, the resulting dataset of 114,805 VLM cells identifies 23 subtypes of neurons, excluding those in the inferior olive, and five subtypes of astrocytes. Spinally-projecting neurons were found to be abundant in seven subtypes of neurons, which were validated through in situ hybridization. These subtypes included adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, and neurons expressing gene markers associated with premotor neurons in the ventromedial medulla. Further analysis of adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons and serotonergic neurons identified nine and six subtypes, respectively, within each class of monoaminergic neurons. Marker genes that identify the neural network responsible for breathing were concentrated in two subtypes of neurons, delineated from each other by markers for excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These datasets are available for public download and for analysis with a user-friendly interface. Collectively, this study provides a fine-scale molecular identification of cells in the VLM, forming the foundation for a better understanding of the VLM's role in vital functions and motor control.</p>

                <p>Although hyperactivity is associated with a wide variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, the early embryonic origins of locomotion have hindered investigation of pathogenesis of these debilitating behaviors. The earliest motor output in vertebrate animals is generated by clusters of early-born motor neurons (MNs) that occupy distinct regions of the spinal cord, innervating stereotyped muscle groups. Gap junction electrical synapses drive early spontaneous behavior in zebrafish, prior to the emergence of chemical neurotransmitter networks. We use a genetic model of hyperactivity to gain critical insight into the consequences of errors in motor circuit formation and function, finding that Fragile X syndrome model mutant zebrafish are hyperexcitable from the earliest phases of spontaneous behavior, show altered sensitivity to blockade of electrical gap junctions, and have increased expression of the gap junction protein Connexin 34/35. We further show that this hyperexcitable behavior can be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of electrical synapses. We also use functional imaging to examine MN and interneuron (IN) activity in early embryogenesis, finding genetic disruption of electrical gap junctions uncouples activity between <I>mnx1</I><sup>+</sup> MNs and INs. Taken together, our work highlights the importance of electrical synapses in motor development and suggests that the origins of hyperactivity in neurodevelopmental disorders may be established during the initial formation of locomotive circuits.</p>

Genome sequence analyses have identified variants in <I>GRIN</I> genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying disease mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we have created and evaluated a transgenic mouse line carrying a missense variant <I>Grin2b<sup>L825V</sup></I>, corresponding to a de novo <I>GRIN2B</I> variant encoding GluN2B(L825V) found in a patient with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used HEK293T cells expressing recombinant receptors and primary hippocampal neurons prepared from heterozygous <I>Grin2b<sup>L825V/+</sup></I> (L825V/+) and wild-type (WT) <I>Grin2b<sup>+/+</sup></I> (+/+) male and female mice to assess the functional impact of the variant. Whole-cell NMDAR currents were reduced in neurons from L825V/+ compared with +/+ mice. The peak amplitude of NMDAR-mediated evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDAR-eEPSCs) was unchanged, but NMDAR-eEPSCs in L825V/+ neurons had faster deactivation compared with +/+ neurons and were less sensitive to a GluN2B-selective antagonist ifenprodil. Together, these results suggest a decreased functional contribution of GluN2B subunits to synaptic NMDAR currents in hippocampal neurons from L825V/+ mice. The analysis of the GluN2B(L825V) subunit surface expression and synaptic localization revealed no differences compared with WT GluN2B. Behavioral testing of mice of both sexes demonstrated hypoactivity, anxiety, and impaired sensorimotor gating in the L825V/+ strain, particularly affecting males, as well as cognitive symptoms. The heterozygous L825V/+ mouse offers a clinically relevant model of <I>GRIN2B</I>-related ID/ASD, and our results suggest synaptic-level functional changes that may contribute to neurodevelopmental pathology.</p>

                <p>Complex auditory scenes pose a challenge to attentive listening, rendering listeners slower and more uncertain in their perceptual decisions. How can we explain such behaviors from the dynamics of cortical networks that pertain to the control of listening behavior? We here follow up on the hypothesis that human adaptive perception in challenging listening situations is supported by modular reconfiguration of auditory&ndash;control networks in a sample of <I>N</I> = 40 participants (13 males) who underwent resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Individual titration of a spatial selective auditory attention task maintained an average accuracy of ~70% but yielded considerable interindividual differences in listeners&rsquo; response speed and reported confidence in their own perceptual decisions. Whole-brain network modularity increased from rest to task by reconfiguring auditory, cinguloopercular, and dorsal attention networks. Specifically, interconnectivity between the auditory network and cinguloopercular network decreased during the task relative to the resting state. Additionally, interconnectivity between the dorsal attention network and cinguloopercular network increased. These interconnectivity dynamics were predictive of individual differences in response confidence, the degree of which was more pronounced after incorrect judgments. Our findings uncover the behavioral relevance of functional cross talk between auditory and attentional-control networks during metacognitive assessment of one's own perception in challenging listening situations and suggest two functionally dissociable cortical networked systems that shape the considerable metacognitive differences between individuals in adaptive listening behavior.</p>

                Background Road traffic accidents are a severe health concern in Ethiopia. This study aims to examine the primary contributing variables of road traffic accidents in Ethiopia, North Gondar Zone, under 24 administrative wereda’s. Methods This study utilized secondary data collected from both the werda-level and North Gondar central-level offices within the study areas. The sector police typically submit reports to the zonal-level offices annually. Information regarding crashes, fatalities, and injuries during the study period was extracted from these police reports. The research focused on analyzing the frequency and severity of traffic accidents attributed to various factors of drivers, vehicles, road conditions, pedestrians, and environmental influences. Results In a sample of 603 aggregate road traffic accidents, the data reveals that the majority of damage results are attributed to young drivers, accounting for 58% of the cases, with junior grade level drivers contributing 29.4%. Driving without a license was a significant factor, representing 87%, while accidents involving recruited driver stood at 63.2%. Vehicles with small to articulated trucks contributing to 39%. Mechanical failures were prevalent, with an unknown diagnosis rate of 48.3%. Vehicles in service for 2-5 years accounted for 29.4%. Road surface conditions were 46%, while rural roads saw a higher percentage at 51.2%. Weather conditions played a role also influential, as dry asphalt and gravel roads under main access ownership were linked to of accident, with 91.2% occurring during visible daylight hours between 8:00-12:00 and 15:00-17:00. The victims were predominantly farmers at 49.6%, followed by students at 23%. Conclusions To reduce road traffic accidents in the study area, it is essential to manage causative factors such as driver and road users, vehicles, roads, pedestrians, and environmental behaviors. The study suggests the development of a successful, up-to-date traffic accident database system regionally within respective offices.

                Blast-related craniofacial and ocular injuries have traditionally been associated with battlefields. In civilian populations, these injuries were infrequent, primarily arising from accidental explosions or terrorism incidents. Explosions can inflict severe damage to the neurological, ocular, and auditory systems through blast waves, high-velocity foreign bodies, and thermal radiation. The pathophysiology of blast-related craniofacial injuries is specific and complex, with severe cases often involving both penetrating and blunt trauma, leading to high mortality and morbidity rates. These injuries necessitate multidisciplinary management and can be defined as intracranial polytrauma. Recently, Niger has seen a surge in blast injuries, predominantly due to the increase in clandestine artisanal gold mining. Managing these injuries in resource-limited settings poses significant challenge. Comprehensive national data on these injuries are sparse due to high pre-hospital mortality rates and their infrequent occurrence, resulting in limited experience among our local physicians in their management. We present a rare case involving an artisanal gold miner with a history of smoking and previous concussions from explosion exposures. The patient was transferred to our hospital following severe craniofacial and ocular injuries caused by an accidental dynamite explosion at a mining site. On admission, the patient presented altered consciousness, agitation, unstable vital signs, multiple craniofacial wounds, including a large frontal wound with brain substance extrusion, diffuse facial burns, left globe rupture, and rhinorrhagia. After resuscitation and stabilization, brain imaging revealed multiple complex craniofacial fractures with foreign bodies. The patient underwent multidisciplinary surgical management. However, the postoperative course was complicated by post-concussive syndrome, and infection of the surgical wounds, necessitating surgical revision. Following the second surgery, the postoperative course was uneventful, although the patient experienced reduced visual acuity. This case highlights the management challenges in Niger and underscores the urgent need for clinical studies and training for gold miners to enhance safety practices in their activities.

Neural population responses in sensory systems are driven by external physical stimuli. This stimulus-response relationship is typically characterized by receptive fields, which have been estimated by <i>neural system identification</i> approaches. Such models usually require a large amount of training data, yet, the recording time for animal experiments is limited, giving rise to epistemic uncertainty for the learned neural transfer functions. While deep neural network models have demonstrated excellent power on neural prediction, they usually do not provide the uncertainty of the resulting neural representations and derived statistics, such as most exciting inputs (MEIs), from <i>in silico</i> experiments. Here, we present a Bayesian system identification approach to predict neural responses to visual stimuli, and explore whether explicitly modeling network weight variability can be beneficial for identifying neural response properties. To this end, we use variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of each model weight given the training data. Tests with different neural datasets demonstrate that this method can achieve higher or comparable performance on neural prediction, with a much higher data efficiency compared to Monte Carlo dropout methods and traditional models using point estimates of the model parameters. At the same time, our variational method provides us with an effectively infinite ensemble, avoiding the idiosyncrasy of any single model, to generate MEIs. It allows to estimate the uncertainty of stimulus-response function, which we have found to be negatively correlated with the predictive performance at model level and may serve to evaluate models. Furthermore, our approach enables us to identify response properties with credible intervals and to determine whether the inferred features are meaningful by performing statistical tests on MEIs. Finally, <i>in silico</i> experiments show that our model generates stimuli driving neuronal activity significantly better than traditional models in the limited-data regime.

                <p>by Yiu-Chung Lau, Songwei Shan, Dong Wang, Dongxuan Chen, Zhanwei Du, Eric H. Y. Lau, Daihai He, Linwei Tian, Peng Wu, Benjamin J. Cowling, Sheikh Taslim Ali</p>

Like other tropical and subtropical regions, influenza viruses can circulate year-round in Hong Kong. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in influenza activity. The objective of this study was to retrospectively forecast influenza activity during the year 2020 and assess the impact of COVID-19 public health social measures (PHSMs) on influenza activity and hospital admissions in Hong Kong. Using weekly surveillance data on influenza virus activity in Hong Kong from 2010 to 2019, we developed a statistical modeling framework to forecast influenza virus activity and associated hospital admissions. We conducted short-term forecasts (1–4 weeks ahead) and medium-term forecasts (1–13 weeks ahead) for the year 2020, assuming no PHSMs were implemented against COVID-19. We estimated the reduction in transmissibility, peak magnitude, attack rates, and influenza-associated hospitalization rate resulting from these PHSMs. For short-term forecasts, mean ambient ozone concentration and school holidays were found to contribute to better prediction performance, while absolute humidity and ozone concentration improved the accuracy of medium-term forecasts. We observed a maximum reduction of 44.6% (95% CI: 38.6% - 51.9%) in transmissibility, 75.5% (95% CI: 73.0% - 77.6%) in attack rate, 41.5% (95% CI: 13.9% - 55.7%) in peak magnitude, and 63.1% (95% CI: 59.3% - 66.3%) in cumulative influenza-associated hospitalizations during the winter-spring period of the 2019/2020 season in Hong Kong. The implementation of PHSMs to control COVID-19 had a substantial impact on influenza transmission and associated burden in Hong Kong. Incorporating information on factors influencing influenza transmission improved the accuracy of our predictions.

                <p>by Wilfredo Blanco, Joel Tabak, Richard Bertram</p>

The pulsatile activity of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons (GnRH neurons) is a key factor in the regulation of reproductive hormones. This pulsatility is orchestrated by a network of neurons that release the neurotransmitters kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy neurons), and produce episodic bursts of activity driving the GnRH neurons. We show in this computational study that the features of coordinated KNDy neuron activity can be explained by a neural network in which connectivity among neurons is modular. That is, a network structure consisting of clusters of highly-connected neurons with sparse coupling among the clusters. This modular structure, with distinct parameters for intracluster and intercluster coupling, also yields predictions for the differential effects on synchronization of changes in the coupling strength within clusters versus between clusters.

                <p>by Jonas Verhellen, Kosio Beshkov, Sebastian Amundsen, Torbjørn V. Ness, Gaute T. Einevoll</p>

The human brain operates at multiple levels, from molecules to circuits, and understanding these complex processes requires integrated research efforts. Simulating biophysically-detailed neuron models is a computationally expensive but effective method for studying local neural circuits. Recent innovations have shown that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can accurately predict the behavior of these detailed models in terms of spikes, electrical potentials, and optical readouts. While these methods have the potential to accelerate large network simulations by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional differential equation based modelling, they currently only predict voltage outputs for the soma or a select few neuron compartments. Our novel approach, based on enhanced state-of-the-art architectures for multitask learning (MTL), allows for the simultaneous prediction of membrane potentials in each compartment of a neuron model, at a speed of up to two orders of magnitude faster than classical simulation methods. By predicting all membrane potentials together, our approach not only allows for comparison of model output with a wider range of experimental recordings (patch-electrode, voltage-sensitive dye imaging), it also provides the first stepping stone towards predicting local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from ANN-based simulations. While LFP and EEG are an important downstream application, the main focus of this paper lies in predicting dendritic voltages within each compartment to capture the entire electrophysiology of a biophysically-detailed neuron model. It further presents a challenging benchmark for MTL architectures due to the large amount of data involved, the presence of correlations between neighbouring compartments, and the non-Gaussian distribution of membrane potentials.

                <p>by Kaleeckal G. Harikumar, Peishen Zhao, Brian P. Cary, Xiaomeng Xu, Aditya J. Desai, Maoqing Dong, Jesse I. Mobbs, Chirine Toufaily, Sebastian G. B. Furness, Arthur Christopoulos, Matthew J. Belousoff, Denise Wootten, Patrick M. Sexton, Laurence J. Miller</p>

Development of optimal therapeutics for disease states that can be associated with increased membrane cholesterol requires better molecular understanding of lipid modulation of the drug target. Type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1R) agonist actions are affected by increased membrane cholesterol, enhancing ligand binding and reducing calcium signaling, while agonist actions of the closely related CCK2R are not. In this work, we identified a set of chimeric human CCK1R/CCK2R mutations that exchange the cholesterol sensitivity of these 2 receptors, providing powerful tools when expressed in CHO and HEK-293 model cell lines to explore mechanisms. Static, low energy, high-resolution structures of the mutant CCK1R constructs, stabilized in complex with G protein, were not substantially different, suggesting that alterations to receptor dynamics were key to altered function. We reveal that cholesterol-dependent dynamic changes in the conformation of the helical bundle of CCK receptors affects both ligand binding at the extracellular surface and G protein coupling at the cytosolic surface, as well as their interrelationships involved in stimulus-response coupling. This provides an ideal setting for potential allosteric modulators to correct the negative impact of membrane cholesterol on CCK1R.

                Background Preserving the structural integrity of the alveolar ridge is paramount in ensuring the success of dental implant procedures and optimizing both aesthetic and physiological outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of autologous dental grafting and explore intriguing results achieved through the utilization of allogeneic dental grafts obtained from a familial participant within the study’s framework. Methods Eleven patients necessitating bilateral dental extractions were enrolled in the study. Ten patients underwent autologous dental grafting on one side, while the contralateral side remained untreated. In the eleventh case, one side received autogenous dental grafting, while the other side was augmented with an allogeneic graft sourced from the patient’s son. Outcomes were monitored over a four-month period. Results Autogenous dental grafting led to a significant enhancement in bone density values and a reduction in osseous absorption rates(P<0.05) when compared to untreated sites among the ten patients who underwent the procedure. However, notable advancements were observed in patient 11 who received an allogeneic dental graft from a familial donor, suggesting potential superiority over autologous grafting in promoting bone regeneration. These findings underscore the promising prospects of employing allogeneic dental grafts sourced from family members to achieve optimal outcomes in alveolar ridge preservation. Conclusions The study underscores the significance of utilizing autologous dental grafts for preserving alveolar ridge dimensions. Importantly, the noteworthy improvement observed in patient outcomes resulting from the use of allogeneic dental grafts compared to autologous grafts raises several inquiries, particularly concerning the potential relationship between the patient and the donor. Trial registration The study is registered as a BRAZILIAN CLINICAL TEST RECORD (ReBEC): U1111-1305-2793 on 28-05-2024 ( https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-65qchvs).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-273/v2?src=rss">Development and application of a learning enjoyment scale for pedagogical activities [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The impact of learning enjoyment on motivation, enthusiasm, and overall learning experiences is significant. Previous studies, lacking an unbiased tool for measuring enjoyment and confronting various influencing factors, produced conflicting results regarding enjoyment levels in different instructional methods. Hence, we developed a learning enjoyment scale for evaluating both active and passive educational activities. We applied the developed scale to 112 first-year medical and dental students to assess their enjoyment during didactic physiology lectures and explored possible associated factors. Within this data note, we present students’ responses to the developed LES. The LES encompasses six dimensions: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, concentration, and enjoyment. Students provided ratings for each dimension on a five-point Likert scale, spanning from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The cumulative scores across the six dimensions range from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 30. These total scores can be categorized as excellent (> 24), acceptable (18-24), or low (< 18). The second section of the dataset examines specific factors influencing overall enjoyment, such as teacher proficiency, topic difficulty, active student participation, objectives fulfillment, low stress levels, and self-perceived acquisition of skills. In addition to objective measurement of students’ enjoyment level, the LES can be utilized for quantitative cross-comparisons between different teaching activities. By employing this dataset, we will undertake an analysis to determine the internal consistency of the Learning Enjoyment Scale (LES), with the anticipation that the outcomes will be published in another venue.
