                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25841?af=R">The distinct traits of the UNC13A polymorphism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The rs12608932 single nucleotide polymorphism in <i>UNC13A </i> is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) susceptibility, and may underlie differences in treatment response. We aimed to characterize the clinical, cognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging phenotype of <i>UNC13A </i> in ALS patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 2,216 ALS patients without a <i>C9orf72 </i> mutation to identify clinical characteristics associated with the <i>UNC13A </i> polymorphism. A subcohort of 428 ALS patients was used to study cognitive and behavioral profiles, and 375 patients to study neuroimaging characteristics. Associations were analyzed under an additive genetic model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genotyping rs12608932 resulted in 854 A/A, 988 A/C and 374 C/C genotypes. The C allele was associated with a higher age at symptom onset (median years A/A 63.5, A/C 65.6, C/C 65.5, p&lt;0.001), more frequent bulbar onset (A/A 29.6%, A/C 31.8%, C/C 43.1%, p&lt;0.001), higher incidences of ALS‐FTD (A/A 4.3%, A/C 5.2%, C/C 9.5%, p=0.003), lower forced vital capacity at diagnosis (median percentage A/A 92.0, A/C 90.0, C/C 86.5, p&lt;0.001), and a shorter survival (median in months A/A 33.3, A.C 30.7, C/C 26.6, p&lt;0.001). <i>UNC13A </i> was associated with lower scores on ALS‐specific cognition tests (means A/A 79.5, A/C 78.1, C/C 76.6, p=0.037) and more frequent behavioral disturbances (A/A 16.7%, A/C 24.4% C/C 27.7%, p=0.045). Thinner left inferior temporal and right fusiform cortex were associated with the <i>UNC13A </i> SNP (p=0.045 and p=0.036).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Phenotypical distinctions associated with <i>UNC13A </i> make it an important factor to take into account in clinical trial design, studies on cognition and behavior, and prognostic counselling.</p>

<p>Existing domain adaptation focuses on transferring knowledge between domains
with categorical indices (e.g., between datasets A and B). However, many tasks
involve continuously indexed domains. For example, in medical applications, one
often needs to transfer disease analysis and prediction across patients of
different ages, where age acts as a continuous domain index. Such tasks are
challenging for prior domain adaptation methods since they ignore the
underlying relation among domains.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose the first method for continuously indexed domain
adaptation. Our approach combines traditional adversarial adaptation with a
novel discriminator that models the encoding-conditioned domain index
distribution. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the value of leveraging the
domain index to generate invariant features across a continuous range of
domains. Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art domain adaption methods on both synthetic and real-world
medical datasets.

<p>We present a learned unsupervised denoising method for arbitrary types of
data, which we explore on images and one-dimensional signals. The training is
solely based on samples of noisy data and examples of noise, which --
critically -- do not need to come in pairs. We only need the assumption that
the noise is independent and additive (although we describe how this can be
extended). The method rests on a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network
setting, which utilizes two critics and one generator.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01556">Surrogate-assisted Particle Swarm Optimisation for Evolving Variable-length Transferable Blocks for Image Classification. (arXiv:2007.01556v1 [cs.CV])</a></h4>

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising performance on
image classification tasks, but the manual design process becomes more and more
complex due to the fast depth growth and the increasingly complex topologies of
convolutional neural networks. As a result, neural architecture search has
emerged to automatically design convolutional neural networks that outperform
handcrafted counterparts. However, the computational cost is immense, e.g.
22,400 GPU-days and 2,000 GPU-days for two outstanding neural architecture
search works named NAS and NASNet, respectively, which motivates this work. A
new effective and efficient surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimisation
algorithm is proposed to automatically evolve convolutional neural networks.
This is achieved by proposing a novel surrogate model, a new method of creating
a surrogate dataset and a new encoding strategy to encode variable-length
blocks of convolutional neural networks, all of which are integrated into a
particle swarm optimisation algorithm to form the proposed method. The proposed
method shows its effectiveness by achieving competitive error rates of 3.49% on
the CIFAR-10 dataset, 18.49% on the CIFAR-100 dataset, and 1.82% on the SVHN
dataset. The convolutional neural network blocks are efficiently learned by the
proposed method from CIFAR-10 within 3 GPU-days due to the acceleration
achieved by the surrogate model and the surrogate dataset to avoid the training
of 80.1% of convolutional neural network blocks represented by the particles.
Without any further search, the evolved blocks from CIFAR-10 can be
successfully transferred to CIFAR-100 and SVHN, which exhibits the
transferability of the block learned by the proposed method.

<p>Most algorithms used in neural networks(NN)-based leaning tasks are strongly
affected by the choices of initialization. Good initialization can avoid
sub-optimal solutions and alleviate saturation during training. However,
designing improved initialization strategies is a difficult task and our
understanding of good initialization is still very primitive. Here, we propose
persistent neurons, a strategy that optimizes the learning trajectory using
information from previous converged solutions. More precisely, we let the
parameters explore new landscapes by penalizing the model from converging to
the previous solutions under the same initialization. Specifically, we show
that persistent neurons, under certain data distribution, is able to converge
to more optimal solutions while initializations under popular framework find
bad local minima. We further demonstrate that persistent neurons helps improve
the model's performance under both good and poor initializations. Moreover, we
evaluate full and partial persistent model and show it can be used to boost the
performance on a range of NN structures, such as AlexNet and residual neural
network. Saturation of activation functions during persistent training is also
studied.

<p>Training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is still highly time-consuming and
compute-intensive. It has been shown that adapting a pretrained model may
significantly accelerate this process. With a focus on classification, we show
that current fine-tuning techniques make the pretrained models catastrophically
forget the transferred knowledge even before anything about the new task is
learned. Such rapid knowledge loss undermines the merits of transfer learning
and may result in a much slower convergence rate compared to when the maximum
amount of knowledge is exploited. We investigate the source of this problem
from different perspectives and to alleviate it, introduce Fast And Stable
Task-adaptation (FAST), an easy to apply fine-tuning algorithm. The paper
provides a novel geometric perspective on how the loss landscape of source and
target tasks are linked in different transfer learning strategies. We
empirically show that compared to prevailing fine-tuning practices, FAST learns
the target task faster and forgets the source task slower. The code is
available at https://github.com/fvarno/FAST.

<p>We consider the problem of encoding pairwise correlations between coupled
dynamical systems in a low-dimensional latent space based on few distinct
observations. We used variational autoencoders (VAE) to embed temporal
correlations between coupled nonlinear oscillators that model brain states in
the wake-sleep cycle into a two-dimensional manifold. Training a VAE with
samples generated using two different parameter combinations resulted in an
embedding that represented the whole repertoire of collective dynamics, as well
as the topology of the underlying connectivity network. We first followed this
approach to infer the trajectory of brain states measured from wakefulness to
deep sleep from the two endpoints of this trajectory; next, we showed that the
same architecture was capable of representing the pairwise correlations of
generic Landau-Stuart oscillators coupled by complex network topology

<p>Adversarial Training (AT) is proposed to alleviate the adversarial
vulnerability of machine learning models by extracting only robust features
from the input, which, however, inevitably leads to severe accuracy reduction
as it discards the non-robust yet useful features. This motivates us to
preserve both robust and non-robust features and separate them with
disentangled representation learning. Our proposed Adversarial Asymmetric
Training (AAT) algorithm can reliably disentangle robust and non-robust
representations without additional supervision on robustness. Empirical results
show our method does not only successfully preserve accuracy by combining two
representations, but also achieve much better disentanglement than previous
work.

<p>While probabilistic models describe the dependence structure between observed
variables, causal models go one step further: they predict, for example, how
cognitive functions are affected by external interventions that perturb
neuronal activity. In this review and perspective article, we introduce the
concept of causality in the context of cognitive neuroscience and review
existing methods for inferring causal relationships from data. Causal inference
is an ambitious task that is particularly challenging in cognitive
neuroscience. We discuss two difficulties in more detail: the scarcity of
interventional data and the challenge of finding the right variables. We argue
for distributional robustness as a guiding principle to tackle these problems.
Robustness (or invariance) is a fundamental principle underlying causal
methodology. A causal model of a target variable generalises across
environments or subjects as long as these environments leave the causal
mechanisms intact. Consequently, if a candidate model does not generalise, then
either it does not consist of the target variable's causes or the underlying
variables do not represent the correct granularity of the problem. In this
sense, assessing generalisability may be useful when defining relevant
variables and can be used to partially compensate for the lack of
interventional data.

<p>Multi-view learning improves the learning performance by utilizing multi-view
data: data collected from multiple sources, or feature sets extracted from the
same data source. This approach is suitable for primate brain state decoding
using cortical neural signals. This is because the complementary components of
simultaneously recorded neural signals, local field potentials (LFPs) and
action potentials (spikes), can be treated as two views. In this paper, we
extended broad learning system (BLS), a recently proposed wide neural network
architecture, from single-view learning to multi-view learning, and validated
its performance in decoding monkeys' oculomotor decision from medial frontal
LFPs and spikes. We demonstrated that medial frontal LFPs and spikes in
non-human primate do contain complementary information about the oculomotor
decision, and that the proposed multi-view BLS is a more effective approach for
decoding the oculomotor decision than several classical and state-of-the-art
single-view and multi-view learning approaches.

<p>Transformer is a popularly used neural network architecture, especially for
language understanding. We introduce an extended and unified architecture that
can be used for tasks involving a variety of modalities like image, text,
videos, etc. We propose a spatio-temporal cache mechanism that enables learning
spatial dimension of the input in addition to the hidden states corresponding
to the temporal input sequence. The proposed architecture further enables a
single model to support tasks with multiple input modalities as well as
asynchronous multi-task learning, thus we refer to it as OmniNet. For example,
a single instance of OmniNet can concurrently learn to perform the tasks of
part-of-speech tagging, image captioning, visual question answering and video
activity recognition. We demonstrate that training these four tasks together
results in about three times compressed model while retaining the performance
in comparison to training them individually. We also show that using this
neural network pre-trained on some modalities assists in learning unseen tasks
such as video captioning and video question answering. This illustrates the
generalization capacity of the self-attention mechanism on the spatio-temporal
cache present in OmniNet.

<p>Despite rapid advances in machine learning tools, the majority of neural
decoding approaches still use traditional methods. Modern machine learning
tools, which are versatile and easy to use, have the potential to significantly
improve decoding performance. This tutorial describes how to effectively apply
these algorithms for typical decoding problems. We provide descriptions, best
practices, and code for applying common machine learning methods, including
neural networks and gradient boosting. We also provide detailed comparisons of
the performance of various methods at the task of decoding spiking activity in
motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and hippocampus. Modern methods,
particularly neural networks and ensembles, significantly outperform
traditional approaches, such as Wiener and Kalman filters. Improving the
performance of neural decoding algorithms allows neuroscientists to better
understand the information contained in a neural population and can help
advance engineering applications such as brain machine interfaces.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58880">Extrinsic Activin signaling cooperates with an intrinsic temporal program to increase mushroom body neuronal diversity</a></h4>

Temporal patterning of neural progenitors leads to the sequential production of diverse neuronal types. To better understand how extrinsic cues interact with intrinsic temporal programs to contribute to temporal patterning, we studied the <i>Drosophila </i>mushroom body neural progenitors (neuroblasts). Each of these four neuroblasts divides ~250 times to sequentially produce only three main neuronal types over the course of ~9 days of development: g, followed by α'β', and finally αβ neurons. The intrinsic temporal clock is composed of two RNA-binding proteins, IGF-II mRNA binding protein (Imp) and Syncrip (Syp), that are expressed in opposing temporal gradients. Activin signaling affects the production of α'β' neurons but whether and how this extrinsic cue interacts with the intrinsic temporal program was not known. We show that the Activin ligand Myoglianin produced from glia downregulates the levels of the intrinsic temporal factor Imp in mushroom body neuroblasts. In neuroblasts mutant for the Activin signaling receptor <i>baboon,</i> Imp levels are higher than normal during the α'β' temporal window, leading to the specific loss of the α'β' neurons. The intrinsic temporal clock still progresses but with a delay, skipping the α'β' window without affecting the total number of neurons produced: The number of g neurons likely increases, α'β' disappear, and the number of αβ neurons decreases. Our results illustrate that an extrinsic cue modifies an intrinsic temporal program to increase neuronal diversity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54313">Stable and dynamic representations of value in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

Optimal decision-making requires that stimulus-value associations are kept up to date by constantly comparing the expected value of a stimulus with its experienced outcome. To do this, value information must be held in mind when a stimulus and outcome are separated in time. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms of working memory (WM) for value. Contradicting theories have suggested WM requires either persistent or transient neuronal activity, with stable or dynamic representations respectively. To test these hypotheses, we recorded neuronal activity in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex of two monkeys performing a valuation task. We found that features of all hypotheses were simultaneously present in prefrontal activity, and no single hypothesis was exclusively supported. Instead, mixed dynamics supported robust, time invariant value representations while also encoding the information in a temporally specific manner. We suggest that this hybrid coding is a critical mechanism supporting flexible cognitive abilities.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54139">Movement initiation and grasp representation in premotor and primary motor cortex mirror neurons</a></h4>

Pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) within macaque rostral ventral premotor cortex (F5) and primary motor cortex (M1) provide direct input to spinal circuitry and are critical for skilled movement control. Contrary to initial hypotheses, they can also be active during action observation, in the absence of any movement. A population-level understanding of this phenomenon is currently lacking. We recorded from single neurons, including identified PTNs, in M1 (n=187), and area F5 (n=115) as two adult male macaques executed, observed, or withheld (NoGo) reach-to-grasp actions. F5 maintained a similar representation of grasping actions during both execution and observation. In contrast, although many individual M1 neurons were active during observation, M1 population activity was distinct from execution, and more closely aligned to NoGo activity, suggesting this activity contributes to withholding of self-movement. M1 and its outputs may dissociate the initiation of movement from the representation of grasp in order to flexibly guide behaviour.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53985">The head direction circuit of two insect species</a></h4>

Recent studies of the Central Complex in the brain of the fruit fly have identified neurons with activity that tracks the animal's heading direction. These neurons are part of a neuronal circuit with dynamics resembling those of a ring attractor. The homologous circuit in other insects has similar topographic structure but with significant structural and connectivity differences. We model the connectivity patterns of two insect species to investigate the effect of these differences on the dynamics of the circuit. We illustrate that the circuit found in locusts can also operate as a ring attractor but differences in the inhibition pattern enable the fruit fly circuit to respond faster to heading changes while additional recurrent connections render the locust circuit more tolerant to noise. Our findings demonstrate that subtle differences in neuronal projection patterns can have a significant effect on circuit performance and illustrate the need for a comparative approach in neuroscience.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53850">Consistent patterns of distractor effects during decision making</a></h4>

The value of a third potential option or distractor can alter the way in which decisions are made between two other options. Two hypotheses have received empirical support: that a high value distractor improves the accuracy with which decisions between two other options are made and that it impairs accuracy. Recently, however, it has been argued that neither observation is replicable. Inspired by neuroimaging data showing that high value distractors have different impacts on prefrontal and parietal regions, we designed a dual route decision-making model that mimics the neural signals of these regions. Here we show in the dual route model and empirical data that both enhancement and impairment effects are robust phenomena but predominate in different parts of the decision space defined by the options' and the distractor's values. However, beyond these constraints, both effects co-exist under similar conditions. Moreover, both effects are robust and observable in six experiments.

The thalamus is the gateway to the cortex. Cortical encoding of sensory information can therefore only be understood by considering the influence of thalamic processing on sensory input. Despite modulating sensory processing, little is known about the role of the thalamus during sensory-based behavior, let alone goal-directed behavior. Here, we use two-photon Ca2+ imaging, patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics to investigate the role of axonal projections from the posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (POm) to the forepaw area of the primary somatosensory cortex (forepaw S1) during sensory processing and goal-directed behavior. We demonstrate that POm axons are active during tactile stimulus and increase activity specifically during the response and, to a lesser extent, reward epochs of a tactile goal-directed task. Furthermore, POm axons in forepaw S1 preferentially signaled correct behavior, with greatest activity during HIT responses. This activity is important for behavioral performance, as photoinhibition of archaerhodopsin-expressing neurons in the POm decreased overall behavioral success. Direct juxtacelluar recordings in the awake state illustrates POm neurons fire sustained action potentials during tactile stimulus. This tactile-evoked POm firing pattern was used during ChR2 photoactivation of POm axons in forepaw S1, revealing that action potentials in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons are inhibited during sustained POm input. Taken together, POm axonal projections in forepaw S1 encode correct goal-directed active behavior, leading to GABAA-mediated inhibition of L2/3 pyramidal neurons.

<p>Delta opioid receptor agonist potency and efficacy are enhanced chronic neuropathic pain states. Activation of these receptors produces negative reinforcement in pain animals, demonstrating the importance of this receptor in its ability to modulate the tonic aversive component of pain. Neuropathic pain engages enkephalin circuits that when blocked exaggerates the affective component of pain. One of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the increased activity of delta opioid receptors is trafficking of receptors to cell membranes of deep dorsal horn spinal neurons. Finally, presynaptic and postsynaptic delta opioid receptors modulate thermal and mechanical nociception, respectively.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonists alleviate nociceptive behaviors in various chronic pain models, including neuropathic pain, while having minimal effect on sensory thresholds in the absence of injury. The mechanisms underlying nerve injury‐induced enhancement of DOR function are unclear. We used a peripheral nerve injury (PNI) model of neuropathic pain to assess changes in the function and localization of DORs in mice and rats. Intrathecal administration of DOR agonists reversed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. The dose‐dependent thermal antinociceptive effects of DOR agonists were shifted to the left in PNI rats. Administration of DOR agonists produced a conditioned place preference in PNI, but not in sham, animals, whereas the DOR antagonist naltrindole produced a place aversion in PNI, but not in sham, mice, suggesting the engagement of endogenous DOR activity in suppressing pain associated with the injury. GTPγS autoradiography revealed an increase in DOR function in the dorsal spinal cord, ipsilateral to PNI. Immunogold electron microscopy and <i>in vivo </i> fluorescent agonist assays were used to assess changes in the ultrastructural localization of DORs in the spinal dorsal horn. In shams, DORs were primarily localized within intracellular compartments. PNI significantly increased the cell surface expression of DORs within lamina IV‐V dendritic profiles. Using neonatal capsaicin treatment, we identified that DOR agonist‐induced thermal antinociception was mediated via receptors expressed on primary afferent sensory neurons but did not alter mechanical thresholds. These data reveal that the regulation of DORs following PNI and suggest the importance of endogenous activation of DORs in regulating chronic pain states.</p>

<p>Mutations in leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>lrrk2 </i>) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease. Here, we generated a zebrafish <i>lrrk2 </i> allelic series to study the requirements for Lrrk2 during development and to dissect the importance of its various domains. The alleles are predicted to encode proteins that either lack all functional domains (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu304</sup>) </i>, the GTPase and kinase domains (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu71</sup> 
</i>) or the kinase domain (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu96</sup> 
</i>). We found that Wnt pathway activation is attenuated in <i>lrrk2<sup>sbu304/sbu304</sup> 
</i>, which lacks both scaffolding and catalytic domains, but not in the other alleles during late embryogenesis. This supports a model in which Lrrk2 scaffolding functions are key to a context‐dependent role in promoting canonical Wnt signaling.</p>

Difficulty in elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms resulting from disease‐associated Lrrk2 variants stems from the complexity of Lrrk2 function and activities. Lrrk2 contains multiple protein–protein interacting domains, a GTPase domain, and a kinase domain. Lrrk2 is implicated in many cellular processes including vesicular trafficking, autophagy, cytoskeleton dynamics, and Wnt signaling. Here, we generated a zebrafish <i>lrrk2 </i> allelic series to study the requirements for Lrrk2 during development and to dissect the importance of its various domains. The alleles are predicted to encode proteins that either lack all functional domains (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu304</sup>) </i>, the GTPase, and kinase domains (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu71</sup> 
</i>) or the kinase domain (<i>lrrk2<sup>sbu96</sup> 
</i>). All three <i>lrrk2 </i> mutants are viable, morphologically normal, and display wild‐type‐like locomotion. Because Lrrk2 modulates Wnt signaling in some contexts, we assessed Wnt signaling in all three mutant lines. Analysis of Wnt signaling by studying the expression of target genes using whole mount RNA <i>in situ </i> hybridization and a transgenic Wnt reporter revealed wild‐type domains of Wnt activity in each of the mutants. However, we found that Wnt pathway activation is attenuated in <i>lrrk2<sup>sbu304/sbu304</sup> 
</i>, which lacks both scaffolding and catalytic domains, but not in the other alleles during late embryogenesis. This supports a model in which Lrrk2 scaffolding functions are key to a context‐dependent role in promoting canonical Wnt signaling.</p>

Traumatic brain injury confers a significant and growing public health burden and represents a major environmental risk factor for dementia. Previous efforts to model traumatic brain injury and elucidate pathologic mechanisms have been hindered by complex interactions between multiple cell types, biophysical, and degenerative properties of the human brain. Here, we use high-intensity focused ultrasound to induce mechanical injury in 3D human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids to mimic traumatic brain injury in vitro. Our results show that mechanically injured organoids recapitulate key hallmarks of traumatic brain injury, phosphorylation of tau and TDP-43, neurodegeneration, and transcriptional programs indicative of energy deficits. We present high-intensity focused ultrasound as a novel, reproducible model of traumatic brain injury in cortical organoids with potential for scalable and temporally-defined mechanistic studies.

Flexible behavior requires switching between different task demands. It is known that such task-switching is associated with costs in terms of slowed reaction time, reduced accuracy, or both. The neural correlates of task-switching have usually been studied by requiring participants to switch between distinct tasks that recruit different brain networks. Here, we investigated the transition of neural states underlying switching between two memory-related processes with opposite task demands (i.e., memory retrieval and memory suppression). We investigated 26 healthy participants who performed a Think/No-Think task while being in the fMRI scanner. Behaviorally, we show that it was more difficult for participants to suppress unwanted memories when a No-Think was preceded by a Think trial instead of another No-Think trial. Neurally, we demonstrate that Think-to-No-Think switches were associated with an increase in control-related and a decrease in memory-related brain activity. Neural representations of task demand, assessed by decoding accuracy, were lower immediately after task switching compared to the non-switch transitions, suggesting a switch-induced delay in the neural transition towards the required task demand. This suggestion is corroborated by an association between demand-specific representational strength and demand-specific performance in switch trials. Taken together, we propose that the brain's delayed transition of neural states towards the task demand at hand is associated with a switch cost leading to less successful memory suppression.

Recent studies show that a single MAPT gene mutation can promote alternative tau misfolding pathways engendering divergent forms of frontotemporal dementia and that under conditions of molecular crowding, the repertoire of tau forms can include liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). We show here that following pathogenic seeding, tau condenses on the nuclear envelope (NE) and disrupts nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (NCT). Interestingly, NE fluorescent tau signals and small fluorescent inclusions behaved as demixed liquid droplets in living cells. Thioflavin S-positive intracellular aggregates were prevalent in tau-derived inclusions with a size bigger than 3 m2, indicating that a threshold of critical mass in the liquid state condensation may drive liquid-solid phase transitions. Our findings indicate that tau undergoing LLPS is more toxic amongst a spectrum of alternative conformers; LLPS droplets on the NE that disrupt NCT serve to trigger cell death and can act as nurseries for fibrillar structures abundantly detected in end-stage disease.

Sleep is under homeostatic control, whereby increasing wakefulness generates sleep need and triggers sleep drive. However, the molecular and cellular pathways by which sleep need is encoded are poorly understood. In addition, the mechanisms underlying both how and when sleep need is transformed to sleep drive are unknown. Here, using ex vivo and in vivo imaging, we show in Drosophila that astroglial Ca2+ signaling increases with sleep need. We demonstrate that this signaling is dependent on a specific L-type Ca2+ channel and is required for homeostatic sleep rebound. Thermogenetically increasing Ca2+ in astrocytes induces persistent sleep behavior, and we exploit this phenotype to conduct a genetic screen for genes required for the homeostatic regulation of sleep. From this large-scale screen, we identify TyrRII, a monoaminergic receptor required in astrocytes for sleep homeostasis. TyrRII levels rise following sleep deprivation in a Ca2+-dependent manner, promoting further increases in astrocytic Ca2+ and resulting in a positive-feedback loop. These data suggest that TyrRII acts as a gate to enable the transformation of sleep need to sleep drive at the appropriate time. Moreover, our findings suggest that astrocytes then transmit this sleep need to the R5 sleep drive circuit, by upregulation and release of the interleukin-1 analog Spatzle. These findings define astroglial Ca2+ signaling mechanisms encoding sleep need and reveal dynamic properties of the sleep homeostatic control system.

Useful memory must balance between stability and malleability. This puts effective memory storage at odds with plasticity processes like reconsolidation. What becomes of memory maintenance processes during synaptic plasticity is unknown. Here we examined the fate of the memory maintenance protein PKM{zeta} during memory destabilization and reconsolidation. We found that NMDA receptor activation and proteasome activity induced a transient reduction in PKM{zeta} protein following retrieval. During reconsolidation, new PKM{zeta} was synthesized to re-store the memory. Failure to synthesize new PKM{zeta} during reconsolidation impaired memory but uninterrupted PKM{zeta} translation was not necessary for maintenance itself. Finally, NMDA receptor activation was necessary to render memories vulnerable to the amnesic effect of PKM{zeta}-antisense. These findings outline a transient collapse and renewal of the PKM{zeta} memory maintenance mechanism during plasticity. We argue that dynamic changes in PKM{zeta} protein levels can serve as an exemplary model of the molecular changes underlying memory destabilization and reconsolidation.

Reward-specific satiety changes the subjective value of one reward relative to other rewards. Two-dimensional indifference curves (IC) capture relative reward-specific values of two-component choice options according to Revealed Preference Theory. Any change of reward value would be captured by specific IC distortions. We estimated two-dimensional ICs from stochastic choice and found that natural on-going consumption of two liquid rewards led to characteristic IC changes indicative of relative value reduction of specific rewards, suggesting reward-specific satiety. Licking changes confirmed the satiety in a mechanism-independent manner. Neuronal reward signals in monkey orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) followed the specific IC distortions and indicated value changes compatible with relative reward-specific satiety. A neuronal classifier predicted well the value changes inferred from the altered behavioral choices. These results demonstrate that neuronal signals in OFC reflect the altered subjective value of selectively sated rewards during economic choice.

<p>The parabrachial nucleus surrounds the superior cerebellar peduncle at the midbrain‐hindbrain junction. Its glutamatergic neurons form subpopulations with distinct genetic identities, two of which express <i>Foxp2 </i> and <i>Pdyn </i>. Here, we detail the location of <i>Foxp2 </i>‐ and <i>Pdyn </i>‐expressing neurons within the larger <i>Vglut2 </i>‐expressing population. We then use Cre‐conditional expression of synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of each population. Salient findings include the identification of glutamatergic output from the parabrachial nucleus to the rostral entorhinal cortex and lateral superior colliculus, plus an absence of <i>Foxp2 </i> or <i>Pdyn </i> output to the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and amygdala.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is a complex structure located at the junction of the midbrain and hindbrain. Its neurons have diverse genetic profiles and influence a variety of homeostatic functions. While its cytoarchitecture and overall efferent projections are known, we lack comprehensive information on the projection patterns of specific neuronal subtypes in the PB. In this study, we compared the projection patterns of glutamatergic neurons here with a subpopulation expressing the transcription factor <i>Foxp2 </i> and a further subpopulation expressing the neuropeptide <i>Pdyn </i>. To do this, we injected an AAV into the PB region to deliver a Cre‐dependent anterograde tracer (synaptophysin‐mCherry) in three different strains of Cre‐driver mice. We then analyzed 147 neuroanatomical regions for labeled boutons in every brain (n = 11). Overall, glutamatergic neurons in the PB region project to a wide variety of sites in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, diencephalon, and brainstem. <i>Foxp2 </i> and <i>Pdyn </i> subpopulations project heavily to the hypothalamus, but not to the cortex, basal forebrain, or amygdala. Among the few differences between <i>Foxp2 </i> and <i>Pdyn </i> cases was a notable lack of <i>Pdyn </i> projections to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Our results indicate that genetic identity determines connectivity (and therefore, function), providing a framework for mapping all PB output projections based on the genetic identity of its neurons. Using genetic markers to systematically classify PB neurons and their efferent projections will enhance the translation of research findings from experimental animals to humans.</p>

The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is becoming increasingly popular in the neuroscience field where chromatin regulation is thought to be involved in neurodevelopment, activity-dependent gene regulation, hormonal and environmental responses, and the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. The advantages of using this assay include a small amount of material needed, relatively simple and fast protocol, and the ability to capture a range of gene regulatory elements with a single assay. However, with increasing interest in chromatin research, it is an imperative to have feasible, reliable assays that are compatible with a range of neuroscience study designs in both animals and humans. Here we tested three different protocols for neuronal chromatin accessibility analysis, including a varying brain tissue freezing method followed by fluorescent-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) and the ATAC-seq analysis. Our study shows that the cryopreservation method impacts the number of open chromatin regions that can be identified from frozen brain tissue using the cell-type specific ATAC-seq assay. However, we show that all three protocols generate consistent and robust data and enable the identification of functional regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers, in neuronal cells. Our study also implies that the broad biological interpretation of chromatin accessibility data is not significantly affected by the freezing condition. In comparison to the mouse brain analysis, we reveal the additional challenges of doing chromatin analysis on post mortem human brain tissue. However, we also show that these studies are revealing important cell type-specific information about gene regulation in the human brain. Overall, the ATAC-seq coupled with FANS is a powerful method to capture cell-type specific chromatin accessibility information in the mouse and human brain. Our study provides alternative brain preservation methods that generate high quality ATAC-seq data while fitting in different study designs, and further encourages the use of this method to uncover the role of epigenetic (dys)regulation in healthy and malfunctioning brain.

Selective attention enhances cortical responses to attended sensory inputs while suppressing others, which can be an effective strategy for speech-in-noise (SiN) understanding. Here, we introduce a training paradigm designed to reinforce attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses. Subjects attended one of two speech streams while our EEG-based attention decoder provided online feedback. After four weeks of this neurofeedback training, subjects exhibited enhanced cortical response to target speech and improved performance during a SiN task. Such training effects were not found in the Placebo group that underwent attention training without neurofeedback. These results suggest an effective rehabilitation for SiN deficits.

Perceiving the temporal regularity in a sequence of repetitive sensory events facilitates the preparation and execution of relevant behaviors with tight temporal constraints. How we estimate temporal regularity from repeating patterns of sensory stimuli is not completely understood. We developed a decision-making task in which participants had to decide whether a train of visual, auditory, or tactile pulses, had a regular or an irregular temporal pattern. We tested the hypothesis that subjects categorize stimuli as irregular by accumulating the time differences between the predicted and observed times of sensory pulses defining a temporal rhythm. Results show that instead of waiting for a single large temporal deviation, participants accumulate timing-error signals and judge a pattern as irregular when the amount of evidence reaches a decision threshold. Model fits of bounded integration showed that this accumulation occurs with negligible leak of evidence. Consistent with previous findings, we show that participants perform better when evaluating the regularity of auditory pulses, as compared with visual or tactile stimuli. Our results suggest that temporal regularity is estimated by comparing expected and measured pulse onset times, and that each prediction error is accumulated towards a threshold to generate a behavioral choice.

Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a gain-of-function protein with toxic activities, containing an expanded polyQ tract in the coding region. Actually, there are no treatments available to delay the onset, stop or slow down the progression of this pathology. Many approaches developed over the years involve the use of siRNAs and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Here we develop and validate a CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic strategy in fibroblasts isolated from SCA1 patients. We started from the screening of 10 different sgRNAs able to recognize regions upstream and downstream the CAG repeats, in exon 8 of ATXN1 gene. The two most promising sgRNAs, G3 and G8, whose efficiency was evaluated with an in vitro system, significantly downregulated the ATXN 1 protein expression. This downregulation was due to the introduction of indels mutations into the ATXN1 gene. Notably, with an RNA-seq analysis, we demonstrated minimal off-target effects of our sgRNAs. These preliminary results support CRISPR/Cas9 as a promising approach for treated polyQ-expanded diseases.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.04.186478v1?rss=1">MOD: A novel machine-learning optimal-filtering method for accurate and efficient detection of subthreshold synaptic events in vivo</a></h4>

To understand the mechanisms of information coding in single neurons, it is necessary to analyze subthreshold synaptic events, action potentials (APs), and the interrelation between these two forms of activity in different behavioral states. However, detecting excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) or currents (EPSCs) in awake, behaving animals remains challenging, because of unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio, high frequency, fluctuating amplitude, and variable time course of synaptic events. Here, we developed a new method for synaptic event detection, termed MOD (Machine-learning Optimal-filtering Detectionprocedure), which combines concepts of supervised machine learning and optimal Wiener filtering. First, experts were asked to manually score short epochs of data. Second, the algorithm was trained to obtain the optimal filter coefficients of a Wiener filter and the optimal detection threshold. Third, scored and unscored data were processed with the optimal filter, and events were detected as peaks above threshold. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to quantify accuracy and efficiency of detection. Additionally, cross-validation was performed to exclude overfitting of the scored data, a potential concern with machine-learning approaches. We then challenged the new detection method with EPSP traces in vivo in mice during spatial navigation and EPSC traces in vitro in slices under conditions of enhanced transmitter release. When benchmarked using a 1/(1-AUC) metric, MOD outperformed previous methods (template-fit and deconvolution) by a factor of up to 3. Thus, MOD may become an important tool for large-scale analysis of synaptic activity in vivo and in vitro.

Information is coded in the brain at different scales for different phenomena: locally, distributed across regions and networks, and globally. For pain, the scale of representation is controversial. Although generally believed to be an integrated cognitive and sensory phenomenon implicating diverse brain systems, quantitative characterizations of which regions and networks are sufficient to represent pain are lacking. In this meta-analysis (or mega-analysis) using data from 289 participants across 10 studies, we use model comparison combined with multivariate predictive models to investigate the spatial scale and location of acute pain representation. We compare models based on (a) a single most pain-predictive module, either previously identified elementary regions or a single best large-scale cortical resting-state network module; (b) selected cortical-subcortical systems related to evoked pain in prior literature ('multi-system models'); and (c) a model spanning the full brain. We estimate the accuracy of pain intensity predictions using cross validation (7 studies) and subsequently validate in three independent holdout studies. All spatial scales convey information about pain intensity, but distributed, multi-system models better characterize pain representations than any individual region or network (e.g. multisystem models explain &gt;20% more of individual subject pain ratings than the best elementary region). Full brain models showed no predictive advantage over multi-system models. These findings quantify the extent that representation of evoked pain experience is distributed across multiple cortical and subcortical systems, show that pain representation is not circumscribed by any elementary region or conical network, and provide a blueprint for identifying the spatial scale of information in other domains.

The ability to extract regularities from the environment is arguably an adaptive characteristic of intelligent systems. In the context of speech, statistical word-learning is thought to be an important mechanism for language acquisition. By taking into account individual differences in speech auditory-motor synchronization, an independent component analysis of fMRI data reveals that the neural substrates of this cognitive ability are not shared across individuals. While a network of auditory and superior pre/motor regions is universally activated to produce learning, a fronto-parietal network is instead additionally and selectively engaged by some individuals, boosting their performance. Interfering with the use of this network via articulatory suppression (producing irrelevant speech during learning) normalizes performance across the entire sample. Crucially, the engagement of this network predicts speech auditory-motor synchrony, directly relating this cognitive skill with language abilities.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The enteric nervous system (ENS) coordinates essential intestinal functions through the concerted action of diverse enteric neurons (EN). However, integrated molecular knowledge of EN subtypes is lacking. To compare human and mouse ENs, we transcriptionally profiled healthy ENS from adult humans and mice. We aimed to identify transcripts marking discrete neuron subtypes and visualize conserved EN subtypes for humans and mice in multiple bowel regions. METHODS: Human myenteric ganglia and adjacent smooth muscle were isolated by laser-capture microdissection for RNA-Seq. Ganglia-specific transcriptional profiles were identified by computationally subtracting muscle gene signatures. Nuclei from mouse myenteric neurons were isolated and subjected to single-nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq), totaling over four billion reads and 25,208 neurons. Neuronal subtypes were defined using mouse snRNA-Seq data. Comparative informatics between human and mouse datasets identified shared EN subtype markers, which were visualized in situ using hybridization chain reaction (HCR). RESULTS: Several EN subtypes in the duodenum, ileum, and colon are conserved between humans and mice based on orthologous gene expression. However, some EN subtype-specific genes from mice are expressed in completely distinct morphologically defined subtypes in humans. In mice, we identified several neuronal subtypes that stably express gene modules across all intestinal segments, with graded, regional expression of one or more marker genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our combined transcriptional profiling of human myenteric ganglia and mouse EN provides a rich foundation for developing novel intestinal therapeutics. There is congruency among some EN subtypes, but we note multiple species differences that should be carefully considered.

Humans perceive expected stimuli faster and more accurately. However, the mechanism behind the integration of expectations with sensory information during perception remains unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that such integration depends on 'fusion' - the weighted averaging of different cues informative about stimulus identity. We first trained participants to map a range of tones onto faces spanning a male-female continuum via associative learning. These two features served as expectation and sensory cues to sex, respectively. We then tested specific predictions about the consequences of fusion by manipulating the congruence of these cues in psychophysical and fMRI experiments. Behavioral judgments and patterns of neural activity in auditory association regions revealed fusion of sensory and expectation cues, providing evidence for a precise computational account of how expectations influence perception.

How the brain encodes information about simultaneously occurring stimuli is largely unknown, especially if those stimuli recruit largely overlapping populations of neurons. One hypothesis is that tuning curves might sharpen or shift to limit the number of stimuli driving any given neuron. To investigate this possibility, we recorded the activity of neurons in the inferior colliculus while monkeys localized either one or two simultaneous sounds that differed in frequency. Although monkeys were quite capable of performing this task (~90% correct), comparison of frequency tuning in single versus dual sound trials revealed frequency selectivity was degraded in the dual-sound case. Frequency tuning curves broadened, and frequency modulation of firing rate was attenuated in dual sound conditions. These tuning curve changes led to a slightly worse performance on dual sound trials by a maximum-likelihood decoder trained to predict the presented condition only from held-out spike counts. These results do not support that changes in frequency response functions could be used to overcome the overlap problem in the representation of simultaneous sounds, and suggest recent evidence of alternations in firing rate between rates corresponding to each of the two stimuli may be a more promising line of research.

The intrinsic dynamics of neuronal populations are shaped by both macroscale connectome architecture and microscale attributes. Neural activity arising from the interplay of these local and global factors therefore varies from moment to moment, with rich temporal patterns. Here we comprehensively characterize intrinsic dynamics throughout the human brain. Applying massive temporal feature extraction to regional haemodynamic activity, we estimate over 6,000 statistical properties of individual brain regions' time series across the neocortex. We identify two robust topographic gradients of intrinsic dynamics, one spanning a ventromedial-dorsolateral axis and the other spanning a unimodal-transmodal axis. These gradients are distinct in terms of their temporal composition and reflect spatial patterns of microarray gene expression, intracortical myelin and cortical thickness, as well as structural and functional network embedding. Importantly, these gradients are closely correlated with patterns of functional activation, differentiating cognitive versus affective processing and sensory versus higher-order cognitive processing. Altogether, these findings demonstrate a link between microscale and macroscale architecture, intrinsic dynamics, and cognition.

Ca2+ entry to nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons and axons via L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCCs) contributes to pacemaker activity and DA release, but burdens cells with a metabolic stress promoting their vulnerability to parkinsonian degeneration. The level of LTCC function varies between subtypes of DA neurons, but is not proportional to LTCC expression level, indicating that LTCC function is governed by other factors. We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in mouse brain slices to identify mechanisms that govern whether LTCCs contribute to DA release in dorsal and ventral striatum. We find that calbindin-D28K limits LTCC function in a regionally and sexually divergent manner; D2-receptors and DA transporters are negative and positive regulators respectively; and lastly, that targeting 2{delta} subunits with gabapentinoid drugs restricts LTCC function without compromising DA release. These data reveal that LTCC function in DA axons is dynamically and locally regulated, which may prove useful for future neuroprotective strategies.

Eye-tracking is a method for tracking the position of the eye and size of the pupil, often employed in neuroscience laboratories and clinics. Eye-trackers are widely used, from studying brain dynamics to investigating neuropathology and disease models. Despite this broad utility, eye-trackers are expensive, hardware-intensive, and proprietary, which have limited this approach to high-resource facilities. Besides, experiments have largely been confined to static open-loop designs and post hoc analysis due to the inflexibility of current systems. Here, we developed an open-source eye-tracking system, named EyeLoop, tailored to dynamic experiments. This Python-based software easily integrates custom functions via a modular logic, tracks a multitude of eyes, including rodent, human, and non-human primate eyes, and it operates well on inexpensive consumer-grade hardware. One of the most appealing applications of EyeLoop is closed-loop experiments, in which the eyes evoke stimulus feedback, such as rapid neuronal optogenetic stimulation. By using EyeLoop, we demonstrate its utility in an open-loop, a closed-loop, and a biomedical experiment. With a remarkably low minimal hardware cost amounting to 29 USD, EyeLoop makes dynamic eye-tracking accessible to low-resource facilities, such as high schools, small laboratories, and small clinics.

AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDeep learning has recently allowed substantial progress in language tasks such as translation and completion. Do such models process language similarly to humans, and is this similarity driven by systematic structural, functional and learning principles? To address these issues, we tested whether the activations of 7,400 artificial neural networks trained on image, word and sentence processing linearly map onto the hierarchy of human brain responses elicited during a reading task, using source-localized magneto-encephalography (MEG) recordings of one hundred and four subjects. Our results confirm that visual, word and language models sequentially correlate with distinct areas of the left-lateralized cortical hierarchy of reading. However, only specific subsets of these models converge towards brain-like representations during their training. Specifically, when the algorithms are trained on language modeling, their middle layers become increasingly similar to the late responses of the language network in the brain. By contrast, input and output word embedding layers often diverge away from brain activity during training. These differences are primarily rooted in the sustained and bilateral responses of the temporal and frontal cortices. Together, these results suggest that the compositional - but not the lexical - representations of modern language models converge to a brain-like solution.

Post-stroke cognitive and linguistic impairments are debilitating conditions, with current therapies only showing small improvements. Domain-general brain networks seem to play a critical role in stroke recovery and characterising their residual function with functional neuroimaging (fMRI) has the potential to yield biomarkers capable of guiding patient-specific rehabilitation. However, this is currently challenging in patients as such detailed characterisation requires too many different cognitive tasks. Here, we use neuroadaptive Bayesian optimisation to overcome this problem, an approach combining real-time fMRI with machine-learning. By intelligently searching across many tasks, this approach rapidly maps out patient-specific profiles of residual domain-general network function. Whereas controls have highly similar profiles, patients show idiosyncratic profiles of network abnormalities that are associated with behavioural performance. This approach can be extended to diverse brain networks and combined with brain stimulation or other therapeutics, thereby opening new avenues for precision medicine targeting diverse neurological and psychiatric conditions.

Alcohol dependence results in neurocognitive disorders, including long-lasting deficits in decision-making processes. Neurobiological investigations have identified the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as a key node in inference and outcome-based decision-making, and alcohol dependence alters OFC function. However, which contributing neural computations are disrupted in alcohol dependence is unclear. Here, we combined a well-validated mouse model of alcohol dependence with in vivo extracellular recordings during decision-making. Using an action differentiation task where lever press duration is inferred from an internal associative map and made with regard to outcome value, we identified disruptions to OFC-based computations. Interestingly, alcohol dependence increased OFC activity representing inference-based lever-pressing, but decreased OFC activity during outcome devaluation. This suggests alcohol dependence induces a long-lasting disruption to OFC representations of decision-making such that action representation in enhanced, but OFC contributions to evaluating consequences is diminished. This has important implications for hypotheses regarding compulsive and habitual phenotypes observed in addiction.

PurposeTo introduce and characterize inexpensive and easily produced 3D-printed axon-mimetic (3AM) diffusion MRI (dMRI) phantoms in terms of pore geometry and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) metrics.

MethodsPhantoms were 3D-printed with a composite printing material that exhibits microscopic fibrous pores. Confocal microscopy and synchrotron phase contrast micro-CT imaging were performed to visualize and assess the pore sizes. dMRI scans of four identical phantoms and phantoms with varying print parameters were performed at 9.4T. DKI was fit to both datasets and used to assess the reproducibility between phantoms and effects of print parameters on DKI metrics. Identical scans were performed 25 and 76 days later to test their stability.

ResultsPore segmentation showed 33.6% of pores with diameters of 1.5-8m with mean, median, and standard deviation of 20m, 13m, and 20m, respectively. Phantoms with identical parameters showed a low coefficient of variation ([~]10%) in DKI metrics. Printing temperature and speed had a small effect on DKI metrics (&lt;16%) while infill density had a larger and more variable effect (&gt;16%). The stability analysis showed small changes over 2.5 months (&lt;7%).

Conclusion3AM phantoms can mimic the fibrous structure of axon bundles on a microscopic scale, serving as complex, anisotropic dMRI phantoms.

Background: Human epidemiologic studies have implicated exposure to infectious or inflammatory insults during gestation in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA) have identified the maternal immune response as the critical link between maternal infection and aberrant brain and behavior development in offspring. The nonhuman primate MIA model provides an opportunity to maximize the translational utility of this model in a species more closely related to humans. Methods: Here we evaluate the effects of MIA on brain and behavioral development in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). A modified form of the viral mimic, Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyIC), was delivered to pregnant rhesus monkeys (n=14) in the late first trimester to stimulate a maternal immune response. Control dams received saline injections at the same gestational time points (n=10) or were untreated (n=4). Results: MIA-treated dams exhibited a strong immune response as indexed by transient increases in sickness behavior, temperature and inflammatory cytokines. MIA-exposed offspring developed species typical milestones and demonstrate subtle changes in early in social development. However, magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated significant gray matter volume reductions in prefrontal and frontal cortices at 6, 12 and 24 months of age. Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into the emergence of neuropathology in MIA-exposed primates and have implications for the pathophysiology of human psychiatric disorders associated with maternal gestational infection.

Consciousness transiently fades away during deep sleep, more stably under anesthesia, and sometimes permanently due to brain injury. The development of an index to quantify the level of consciousness across these different states is regarded as a key problem both in basic and clinical neuroscience. We argue that this problem is ill-defined since such an index would not exhaust all the relevant information about a given state of consciousness. While the level of consciousness can be taken to describe the actual brain state, a complete characterization should also include its potential behavior against external perturbations. We developed and analyzed whole-brain computational models to show that the stability of conscious states provides information complementary to their similarity to conscious wakefulness. Our work leads to a novel methodological framework to sort out different brain states by their stability and reversibility, and illustrates its usefulness to dissociate between physiological (sleep), pathological (brain-injured patients), and pharmacologically-induced (anesthesia) loss of consciousness.

Elucidation of the underlying mechanism of dopamine signaling to ERK that underlies plasticity in dopamine D1 receptor expressing neurons leading to acquired cocaine preference is incomplete. NCS-Rapgef2 is a novel cAMP effector, expressed in neuronal and endocrine cells in adult mammals, that is required for D1 dopamine receptor-dependent ERK phosphorylation in mouse brain. In this report, we studied the effects of abrogating NCS-Rapgef2 expression on cAMP-dependent ERK to Egr-1/Zif268 signaling in cultured neuroendocrine cells; in D1 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of nucleus accumbens slices; and in mouse brain in a region-specific manner. NCS-Rapgef2 gene deletion in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in adult mice, using AAV-mediated expression of cre recombinase, eliminated cocaine-induced ERK phosphorylation and Egr-1/Zif268 upregulation in D1-MSNs and cocaine-induced behaviors including locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference (CPP). Abrogation of NCS-Rapgef2 gene expression in medium prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala, by crossing mice bearing a floxed Rapgef2 allele with a cre mouse line driven by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha promoter also eliminated cocaine-induced phospho-ERK activation and Egr-1/Zif268 induction, but without effect on the cocaine-induced behaviors. Our results indicate that NCS-Rapgef2 signaling to ERK in dopamine D1-receptor expressing neurons in the NAc, but not in corticolimbic areas, contributes to cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization and CPP. Ablation of cocaine-dependent ERK activation by elimination of NCS-Rapgef2 occurred with no effect on phosphorylation of CREB in D1 dopaminoceptive neurons of NAc. This study reveals a new cAMP-dependent signaling pathway for cocaine-induced behavioral adaptations, mediated through NCS-Rapgef2/phospho-ERK activation, independently of PKA/CREB signaling.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.02.184515v1?rss=1">Assessing methods for geometric distortion compensation in 7T gradient echo fMRI data</a></h4>

Echo planar imaging (EPI) is widely used in functional and diffusion-weighted MRI, but suffers from significant geometric distortions in the phase encoding direction caused by inhomogeneities in the static magnetic field (B0). This is a particular challenge for EPI at very high field (7T and above), as distortion increases with higher field strength. A number of techniques for correcting geometric distortion exist, including those based on B0 field mapping and acquiring EPI scans with opposite phase encoding directions. However, few quantitative comparisons of distortion compensation methods have been performed using EPI data from the human brain, and even fewer at very high field. In the current study, we compared geometric distortion compensation using B0 field maps and opposite phase encoding scans implemented in two different software packages (FSL and AFNI) applied to 7T gradient echo EPI data from 31 human participants. We assessed the quality of distortion compensation by quantifying the degree of alignment to a T1-weighted anatomical reference scan using Dice coefficients and mutual information. We found that the best distortion compensation was achieved in our dataset using gradient echo scans with opposite phase encoding directions to map the distortion, as compared to B0 field maps or spin echo opposite phase encoding scans. Performance between FSL and AFNI was equivalent. While the ideal geometric distortion compensation approach may vary due to methodological differences across experiments, this study provides a framework for researchers to assess the quality of different distortion compensation methods in their own work.

Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are among the most important techniques for non-invasively studying cognition and disease in the human brain. These signals are known to originate from cortical neural activity, typically described in terms of current dipoles. While the link between cortical current dipoles and EEG/MEG signals is relatively well understood, surprisingly little is known about the link between different kinds of neural activity and the current dipoles themselves. Detailed biophysical modeling has played an important role in exploring the neural origin of intracranial electric signals, like extracellular spikes and local field potentials. However, this approach has not yet been taken full advantage of in the context of exploring the neural origin of the cortical current dipoles that are causing EEG/MEG signals. Here, we present a method for reducing arbitrary simulated neural activity to single current dipoles. We find that the method is applicable for calculating extracranial signals, but less suited for calculating intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) signals. We demonstrate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for investigating the neural origin of EEG/MEG signals. This is done through example studies of the single-neuron EEG contribution, the putative EEG contribution from calcium spikes, and from calculating EEG signals from large-scale neural network simulations. We also demonstrate how the simulated current dipoles can be used directly in combination with detailed head models, allowing for simulated EEG signals with an unprecedented level of biophysical details. In conclusion, this paper presents a framework for biophysically detailed modeling of EEG and MEG signals, which can be used to better our understanding of non-inasively measured neural activity in humans.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence deep learning system with that of expert neuro‐ophthalmologists in classifying optic disc appearance.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of two expert neuro‐ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly‐presented images without clinical information. Area‐under‐the‐receiver‐operating‐characteristic‐curve, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The system correctly classified 678/800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675/800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641/800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded area‐under‐the‐receiver‐operating‐characteristic‐curves of 0.97 (CI 95%, 0.96 ‐ 0.98), 0.96 (CI 95%, 0.94 ‐ 0.97) and 0.89 (CI 95%, 0.87 ‐ 0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema and other disc abnormalities, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the system's classification of optic discs were similar or better than the two experts. Inter‐grader agreement at the eye level was 0.71 (CI 95%, 0.67‐0.76) between Expert 1 and Expert 2, 0.72 (CI 95%, 0.68‐0.76) between the system and Expert 1, and 0.65 (CI 95%, 0.61‐0.70) between the system and Expert 2.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The performance of this deep learning system at classifying optic disc abnormalities was at least as good as two expert neuro‐ophthalmologists. Future prospective studies are needed to validate this system as a diagnostic aid in relevant clinical settings.</p>

<p>Microglia structural reorganization, and altered neuroimmune signaling, are implicated in pathological adaptations that promote excessive drinking. Here we used Iba1 immunohistochemistry, high‐resolution confocal microscopy, and digital reconstruction analyses of Iba1‐positive microglia in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats during withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, rats injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and an ethanol‐naïve (air)‐exposed group. We found that CIE and LPS led to dichotomous alterations in microglia structural complexity in the PL cortex that were largely absent in the NAc. These findings add to a growing body of literature pointing towards altered microglia structural complexity, and presumably function, in ethanol‐induced adaptations in the brain.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence has linked pathological changes associated with chronic alcohol exposure to neuroimmune signaling mediated by microglia. Prior characterization of the microglial structure–function relationship demonstrates that alterations in activity states occur concomitantly with reorganization of cellular architecture. Accordingly, gaining a better understanding of microglial morphological changes associated with ethanol exposure will provide valuable insight into how neuroimmune signaling may contribute to ethanol‐induced reshaping of neuronal function. Here we have used Iba1‐staining combined with high‐resolution confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction to examine microglial structure in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in male Long‐Evans rats. Rats were either sacrificed at peak withdrawal following 15 days of exposure to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) or 24 hr after two consecutive injections of the immune activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS), each separated by 24 hr. LPS exposure resulted in dramatic structural reorganization of microglia in the PL cortex, including increased soma volume, overall cellular volume, and branching complexity. In comparison, CIE exposure was associated with a subtle increase in somatic volume and differential effects on microglia processes, which were largely absent in the NAc. These data reveal that microglial activation following a neuroimmune challenge with LPS or exposure to chronic alcohol exhibits distinct morphometric profiles and brain region‐dependent specificity.</p>

<p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown clear advantages over traditional
artificial neural networks (ANNs) for low latency and high computational
efficiency, due to their event-driven nature and sparse communication. However,
the training of deep SNNs is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a
novel ANN-to-SNN conversion and layer-wise learning framework for rapid and
efficient pattern recognition, which is referred to as progressive tandem
learning of deep SNNs. By studying the equivalence between ANNs and SNNs in the
discrete representation space, a primitive network conversion method is
introduced that takes full advantage of spike count to approximate the
activation value of analog neurons. To compensate for the approximation errors
arising from the primitive network conversion, we further introduce a
layer-wise learning method with an adaptive training scheduler to fine-tune the
network weights. The progressive tandem learning framework also allows hardware
constraints, such as limited weight precision and fan-in connections, to be
progressively imposed during training. The SNNs thus trained have demonstrated
remarkable classification and regression capabilities on large-scale object
recognition, image reconstruction, and speech separation tasks, while requiring
at least an order of magnitude reduced inference time and synaptic operations
than other state-of-the-art SNN implementations. It, therefore, opens up a
myriad of opportunities for pervasive mobile and embedded devices with a
limited power budget.

<p>Deep neural network classifiers have been used frequently and are efficient.
In multiclass deep network classifiers, the burden of classifying samples of
different classes is put on a single classifier. As shown in this paper, the
classification capability of deep networks can be further increased by using an
ensemble of binary classification deep networks. In the proposed approach, a
single (one-versus-all) deep network binary classifier is dedicated to each
category classification. Subsequently, binary classification deep network
ensembles have been investigated. Every network in an ensemble has been trained
by a one-versus-all binary training technique using the Stochastic Gradient
Descent with Momentum Algorithm. For classification of the test sample, the
sample is presented to each network in the ensemble. After softmax-layer score
voting, the network with the largest score is assumed to have classified the
sample. Digit image recognition has been used for experimentation. Three
datasets have been used for experimentation viz. the MATLAB Digit Image
Dataset, the USPS+ Digit Image Dataset, and the MNIST Digit Image Dataset. The
experiments demonstrate that given sufficient training, a Binary Classification
Convolutional Neural Network (BCCNN) ensemble can outperform a conventional
Multi-class Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN). In one of the experiments, it
was noted that after training and testing of a BCCNN ensemble and an MCNN
respectively on a subset of the MNIST Digit Image Dataset, the BCCNN ensemble
gave a higher accuracy of 98.03% as compared to the MCNN which gave an accuracy
of 97.90%. The architecture of the BCCNNs in an ensemble has also been modified
in order to increase their recognition accuracy. On a large subset of the MNIST
Digit Image Dataset, the modified BCCNN ensemble gave a higher accuracy of
98.50%, while as the MCNN gave an accuracy of 98.4875%.

<p>Various methods of measuring unit selectivity have been developed with the
aim of better understanding how neural networks work. But the different
measures provide divergent estimates of selectivity, and this has led to
different conclusions regarding the conditions in which selective object
representations are learned and the functional relevance of these
representations. In an attempt to better characterize object selectivity, we
undertake a comparison of various selectivity measures on a large set of units
in AlexNet, including localist selectivity, precision, class-conditional mean
activity selectivity (CCMAS), network dissection,the human interpretation of
activation maximization (AM) images, and standard signal-detection measures. We
find that the different measures provide different estimates of object
selectivity, with precision and CCMAS measures providing misleadingly high
estimates. Indeed, the most selective units had a poor hit-rate or a high
false-alarm rate (or both) in object classification, making them poor object
detectors. We fail to find any units that are even remotely as selective as the
'grandmother cell' units reported in recurrent neural networks. In order to
generalize these results, we compared selectivity measures on units in VGG-16
and GoogLeNet trained on the ImageNet or Places-365 datasets that have been
described as 'object detectors'. Again, we find poor hit-rates and high
false-alarm rates for object classification. We conclude that signal-detection
measures provide a better assessment of single-unit selectivity compared to
common alternative approaches, and that deep convolutional networks of image
classification do not learn object detectors in their hidden layers.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01016">A Novel DNN Training Framework via Data Sampling and Multi-Task Optimization. (arXiv:2007.01016v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Conventional DNN training paradigms typically rely on one training set and
one validation set, obtained by partitioning an annotated dataset used for
training, namely gross training set, in a certain way. The training set is used
for training the model while the validation set is used to estimate the
generalization performance of the trained model as the training proceeds to
avoid over-fitting. There exist two major issues in this paradigm. Firstly, the
validation set may hardly guarantee an unbiased estimate of generalization
performance due to potential mismatching with test data. Secondly, training a
DNN corresponds to solve a complex optimization problem, which is prone to
getting trapped into inferior local optima and thus leads to undesired training
results. To address these issues, we propose a novel DNN training framework. It
generates multiple pairs of training and validation sets from the gross
training set via random splitting, trains a DNN model of a pre-specified
structure on each pair while making the useful knowledge (e.g., promising
network parameters) obtained from one model training process to be transferred
to other model training processes via multi-task optimization, and outputs the
best, among all trained models, which has the overall best performance across
the validation sets from all pairs. The knowledge transfer mechanism featured
in this new framework can not only enhance training effectiveness by helping
the model training process to escape from local optima but also improve on
generalization performance via implicit regularization imposed on one model
training process from other model training processes. We implement the proposed
framework, parallelize the implementation on a GPU cluster, and apply it to
train several widely used DNN models. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed framework over the conventional training paradigm.

<p>Precise segmentation of organs and tumors plays a crucial role in clinical
applications. It is a challenging task due to the irregular shapes and various
sizes of organs and tumors as well as the significant class imbalance between
the anatomy of interest (AOI) and the background region. In addition, in most
situation tumors and normal organs often overlap in medical images, but current
approaches fail to delineate both tumors and organs accurately. To tackle such
challenges, we propose a position-guided deformable UNet, namely PGD-UNet,
which exploits the spatial deformation capabilities of deformable convolution
to deal with the geometric transformation of both organs and tumors. Position
information is explicitly encoded into the network to enhance the capabilities
of deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce a new pooling module to preserve
position information lost in conventional max-pooling operation. Besides, due
to unclear boundaries between different structures as well as the subjectivity
of annotations, labels are not necessarily accurate for medical image
segmentation tasks. It may cause the overfitting of the trained network due to
label noise. To address this issue, we formulate a novel loss function to
suppress the influence of potential label noise on the training process. Our
method was evaluated on two challenging segmentation tasks and achieved very
promising segmentation accuracy in both tasks.

<p>We present a novel method for learning the weights of an artificial neural
network - a Message Passing Learning Protocol (MPLP). In MPLP, we abstract
every operations occurring in ANNs as independent agents. Each agent is
responsible for ingesting incoming multidimensional messages from other agents,
updating its internal state, and generating multidimensional messages to be
passed on to neighbouring agents. We demonstrate the viability of MPLP as
opposed to traditional gradient-based approaches on simple feed-forward neural
networks, and present a framework capable of generalizing to non-traditional
neural network architectures. MPLP is meta learned using end-to-end
gradient-based meta-optimisation. We further discuss the observed properties of
MPLP and hypothesize its applicability on various fields of deep learning.

<p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a surrogate-assisted global optimization
technique that has been successfully applied in various fields, e.g., automated
machine learning and design optimization. Built upon a so-called
infill-criterion and Gaussian Process regression (GPR), the BO technique
suffers from a substantial computational complexity and hampered convergence
rate as the dimension of the search spaces increases. Scaling up BO for
high-dimensional optimization problems remains a challenging task. In this
paper, we propose to tackle the scalability of BO by hybridizing it with a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), resulting in a novel PCA-assisted BO
(PCA-BO) algorithm. Specifically, the PCA procedure learns a linear
transformation from all the evaluated points during the run and selects
dimensions in the transformed space according to the variability of evaluated
points. We then construct the GPR model, and the infill-criterion in the space
spanned by the selected dimensions. We assess the performance of our PCA-BO in
terms of the empirical convergence rate and CPU time on multi-modal problems
from the COCO benchmark framework. The experimental results show that PCA-BO
can effectively reduce the CPU time incurred on high-dimensional problems, and
maintains the convergence rate on problems with an adequate global structure.
PCA-BO therefore provides a satisfactory trade-off between the convergence rate
and computational efficiency opening new ways to benefit from the strength of
BO approaches in high dimensional numerical optimization.

<p>Decoding the direction of translating objects in front of cluttered moving
backgrounds, accurately and efficiently, is still a challenging problem. In
nature, lightweight and low-powered flying insects apply motion vision to
detect a moving target in highly variable environments during flight, which are
excellent paradigms to learn motion perception strategies. This paper
investigates the fruit fly \textit{Drosophila} motion vision pathways and
presents computational modelling based on cutting-edge physiological
researches. The proposed visual system model features bio-plausible ON and OFF
pathways, wide-field horizontal-sensitive (HS) and vertical-sensitive (VS)
systems. The main contributions of this research are on two aspects: 1) the
proposed model articulates the forming of both direction-selective (DS) and
direction-opponent (DO) responses, revealed as principal features of motion
perception neural circuits, in a feed-forward manner; 2) it also shows robust
direction selectivity to translating objects in front of cluttered moving
backgrounds, via the modelling of spatiotemporal dynamics including combination
of motion pre-filtering mechanisms and ensembles of local correlators inside
both the ON and OFF pathways, which works effectively to suppress irrelevant
background motion or distractors, and to improve the dynamic response.
Accordingly, the direction of translating objects is decoded as global
responses of both the HS and VS systems with positive or negative output
indicating preferred-direction (PD) or null-direction (ND) translation. The
experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed neural system
model, and demonstrated its responsive preference to faster-moving,
higher-contrast and larger-size targets embedded in cluttered moving
backgrounds.

<p>Machine learning (ML) models are widely used in many domains including media
processing and generation, computer vision, medical diagnosis, embedded
systems, high-performance and scientific computing, and recommendation systems.
For efficiently processing these computational- and memory-intensive
applications, tensors of these over-parameterized models are compressed by
leveraging sparsity, size reduction, and quantization of tensors. Unstructured
sparsity and tensors with varying dimensions yield irregular-shaped
computation, communication, and memory access patterns; processing them on
hardware accelerators in a conventional manner does not inherently leverage
acceleration opportunities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on how
to efficiently execute sparse and irregular tensor computations of ML models on
hardware accelerators. In particular, it discusses additional enhancement
modules in architecture design and software support; categorizes different
hardware designs and acceleration techniques and analyzes them in terms of
hardware and execution costs; highlights further opportunities in terms of
hardware/software/algorithm co-design optimizations and joint optimizations
among described hardware and software enhancement modules. The takeaways from
this paper include: understanding the key challenges in accelerating sparse,
irregular-shaped, and quantized tensors; understanding enhancements in
acceleration systems for supporting their efficient computations; analyzing
trade-offs in opting for a specific type of design enhancement; understanding
how to map and compile models with sparse tensors on the accelerators;
understanding recent design trends for efficient accelerations and further
opportunities.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04355">Adversarial Neural Pruning with Latent Vulnerability Suppression. (arXiv:1908.04355v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Despite the remarkable performance of deep neural networks on various
computer vision tasks, they are known to be susceptible to adversarial
perturbations, which makes it challenging to deploy them in real-world
safety-critical applications. In this paper, we conjecture that the leading
cause of adversarial vulnerability is the distortion in the latent feature
space, and provide methods to suppress them effectively. Explicitly, we define
\emph{vulnerability} for each latent feature and then propose a new loss for
adversarial learning, \emph{Vulnerability Suppression (VS)} loss, that aims to
minimize the feature-level vulnerability during training. We further propose a
Bayesian framework to prune features with high vulnerability to reduce both
vulnerability and loss on adversarial samples. We validate our
\emph{Adversarial Neural Pruning with Vulnerability Suppression (ANP-VS)}
method on multiple benchmark datasets, on which it not only obtains
state-of-the-art adversarial robustness but also improves the performance on
clean examples, using only a fraction of the parameters used by the full
network. Further qualitative analysis suggests that the improvements come from
the suppression of feature-level vulnerability.

<p>A comprehensive artificial intelligence system needs to not only perceive the
environment with different `senses' (e.g., seeing and hearing) but also infer
the world's conditional (or even causal) relations and corresponding
uncertainty. The past decade has seen major advances in many perception tasks
such as visual object recognition and speech recognition using deep learning
models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models
with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. In recent
years, Bayesian deep learning has emerged as a unified probabilistic framework
to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models. In this general
framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the
performance of higher-level inference and in turn, the feedback from the
inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This
survey provides a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian deep learning and
reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, control,
etc. Besides, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian
deep learning and other related topics such as Bayesian treatment of neural
networks.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00040">A Pilot Adaptive Neurofeedback Investigation of the Neural Mechanisms of Implicit Emotion Regulation Among Women With PTSD</a></h4>

<p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is widely associated with deficits in implicit emotion regulation. Recently, adaptive fMRI neurofeedback (A-NF) has been developed as a methodology that offers a unique probe of brain networks that mediate implicit emotion regulation and their impairment in PTSD. We designed an A-NF paradigm in which difficulty of an emotional conflict task (i.e., embedding trauma distractors onto a neutral target stimulus) was controlled by a whole-brain classifier trained to differentiate attention to the trauma distractor vs. target. We exploited this methodology to test whether PTSD was associated with: (1) an altered brain state that differentiates attention towards vs. away from trauma cues; and (2) an altered ability to use concurrent feedback about brain states during an implicit emotion regulation task. Adult women with a current diagnosis of PTSD (n = 10) and healthy control (n = 9) women participated in this task during 3T fMRI. During two initial non-feedback runs used to train a whole-brain classifier, we observed: (1) poorer attention performance in PTSD; and (2) a linear relationship between brain state discrimination and attention performance, which was significantly attenuated among the PTSD group when the task contained trauma cues. During the A-NF phase, the PTSD group demonstrated poorer ability to regulate brain states as per attention instructions, and this poorer ability was related to PTSD symptom severity. Further, PTSD was associated with the heightened encoding of feedback in the insula and hippocampus. These results suggest a novel understanding of whole-brain states and their regulation that underlie emotion regulation deficits in PTSD.</p>

<p>Techniques that allow the manipulation of specific neural circuits have greatly increased in the past few years. DREADDs (Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) provide an elegant way to manipulate individual brain structures and/or neural circuits, including neuromodulatory pathways. Considerable efforts have been made to increase cell-type specificity of DREADD expression while decreasing possible limitations due to multiple viral vectors injections. In line with this, a retrograde canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector carrying a Cre-dependent DREADD cassette has been recently developed. In combination with Cre-driver transgenic animals, the vector allows one to target neuromodulatory pathways with cell-type specificity. In the present study, we specifically targeted catecholaminergic pathways by injecting the vector in knock-in rat line containing Cre recombinase cassette under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. We assessed the efficacy of infection of the nigrostriatal pathway and the catecholaminergic pathways ascending to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and found cell-type-specific DREADD expression.</p>

<p>Background: In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuronal degeneration is associated with gliosis and infiltration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which participate in neuroinflammation. Defects at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) facilitate PBMCs migration towards the central nervous system (CNS) and in particular CD4+ T cells have been found in areas severely affected in AD. However, the role of T cells, once they migrate into the CNS, is not well defined. CD4+ cells interact with astrocytes able to release several factors and cytokines that can modulate T cell polarization; similarly, astrocytic properties are modulated after interaction with T cells.</p><p>Methods: In in vitro models, astrocytes were primed with β-amyloid (Aβ; 2.5 μM, 5 h) and then co-cultured with magnetically isolated CD4+ cells. Cytokines expression was evaluated both in co-cultured CD4+ cells and astrocytes. The effects of this crosstalk were further evaluated by co-culturing CD4+ cells with the neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cell line and astrocytes with endothelial cells.</p><p>Results: The pattern of cytokines and trophic factors expressed by CD4+ cells were strongly modulated in the presence of Aβ-primed astrocytes. Specifically, the percentage of IL-4+ and IFNγ+ CD4+ cells was significantly increased and reduced, respectively. Further, increased BDNF mRNA levels were observed in CD4+ cells. When SH-SY5Y cells were co-cultured with astrocyte-conditioned CD4+ cells and exposed to Aβ, the reduction of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin was prevented with a BDNF-dependent mechanism. In astrocytes co-cultured with CD4+ cells, reduced mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and VEGF were observed. This was paralleled by the prevention of the reduction of claudin-5 when astrocytes were co-cultured with endothelial cells.</p><p>Conclusion: Following Aβ exposure, there exists reciprocal crosstalk between infiltrating peripheral cells and astrocytes that in turn affects not only endothelial function and thus BBB properties, but also neuronal behavior. Since astrocytes are the first cells that lymphocytes interact with and are among the principal players in neuroinflammation occurring in AD, understanding this crosstalk may disclose new potential targets of intervention in the treatment of neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Modulating cortical excitability based on a stimulus’ relevance to the task at hand is a component of sensory gating, and serves to protect higher cortical centers from being overwhelmed with irrelevant information (McIlroy et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2005; Wasaka et al., 2005). This study examined relevancy-based modulation of cortical excitability, and corresponding behavioral responses, in the face of distracting stimuli in participants with and without a history of concussion (mean age 22 ± 3 SD years; most recent concussion 39.1 ± 30 SD months). Participants were required to make a scaled motor response to the amplitudes of visual and tactile stimuli presented individually or concurrently. Task relevance was manipulated, and stimuli were occasionally presented with irrelevant distractors. Electroencephalography (EEG) and task accuracy data were collected from participants with and without a history of concussion. The somatosensory-evoked N70 event-related potential (ERP) was significantly modulated by task relevance in the control group but not in those with a history of concussion, and there was a significantly greater cost to task accuracy in the concussion history group when relevant stimuli were presented with an irrelevant distractor. This study demonstrated that relevancy-based modulation of electrophysiological responses and behavioral correlates of sensory gating differ in people with and without a history of concussion, even after patients were symptom-free and considered recovered from their injuries.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain detectable by highly invasive in vivo brain imaging or in post-mortem tissues. A non-invasive and inexpensive screening method is needed for early diagnosis of asymptomatic AD patients. The shared developmental origin and similarities with the brain make the retina a suitable surrogate tissue to assess Aβ load in AD. Using curcumin, a FluoroProbe that binds to Aβ, we labeled and measured the retinal fluorescence in vivo and compared with the immunohistochemical measurements of the brain and retinal Aβ load in the APP/PS1 mouse model. In vivo retinal images were acquired every 2 months using custom fluorescence scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (fSLO) after tail vein injections of curcumin in individual mice followed longitudinally from ages 5 to 19 months. At the same time points, 1–2 mice from the same cohort were sacrificed and immunohistochemistry was performed on their brain and retinal tissues. Results demonstrated cortical and retinal Aβ immunoreactivity were significantly greater in Tg than WT groups. Age-related increase in retinal Aβ immunoreactivity was greater in Tg than WT groups. Retinal Aβ immunoreactivity was present in the inner retinal layers and consisted of small speck-like extracellular deposits and intracellular labeling in the cytoplasm of a subset of retinal ganglion cells. In vivo retinal fluorescence with curcumin injection was significantly greater in older mice (11–19 months) than younger mice (5–9 months) in both Tg and WT groups. In vivo retinal fluorescence with curcumin injection was significantly greater in Tg than WT in older mice (ages 11–19 months). Finally, and most importantly, the correlation between in vivo retinal fluorescence with curcumin injection and Aβ immunoreactivity in the cortex was stronger in Tg compared to WT groups. Our data reveal that retina and brain of APP/PS1 Tg mice increasingly express Aβ with age. In vivo retinal fluorescence with curcumin correlated strongly with cortical Aβ immunohistochemistry in Tg mice. These findings suggest that using in vivo fSLO imaging of AD-susceptible retina may be a useful, non-invasive method of detecting Aβ in the retina as a surrogate indicator of Aβ load in the brain.</p>

<p>Background: A shift towards the dynamic measurement of physiologic resilience and improved technology incorporated into experimental paradigms in aging research is producing high-resolution data. Identifying the most appropriate analysis method for this type of data is a challenge. In this work, the functional principal component analysis (fPCA) was employed to demonstrate a data-driven approach to the analysis of high-resolution data in aging research.</p><p>Methods: Cerebral oxygenation during standing was measured in a large cohort [The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA)]. FPCA was performed on tissue saturation index (TSI) data. A regression analysis was then conducted with the functional principal component (fPC) scores as the explanatory variables and transition time as the response.</p><p>Results: The mean ± SD age of the analysis sample was 64 ± 8 years. Females made up 54% of the sample and overall, 43% had tertiary education. The first PC explained 96% of the variance in cerebral oxygenation upon standing and was related to a baseline shift. Subsequent components described the recovery to before-stand levels (fPC2), drop magnitude and initial recovery (fPC3 and fPC4) as well as a temporal shift in the location of the minimum TSI value (fPC5).

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00256">The Acquisition of Survey Knowledge by Individuals With Down Syndrome</a></h4>

<p>People with Down syndrome often exhibit deficiencies in wayfinding activities, particularly route learning (e.g., Courbois et al., 2013; Davis et al., 2014; Farran et al., 2015). Evidence concerning more sophisticated survey learning has been sparse. In the research reported here, two experiments are reported that evaluated survey learning of youth with DS and typically developing children (TD) matched on mental age. In Experiment 1, participants learned two overlapping routes consisting of three turns each through a virtual environment depicting 9 square city blocks. Following acquisition, they were tested on multiple measures of survey knowledge: finding a shortcut, identifying the direction of landmarks not currently visible from their location in the environment, and recognizing a bird’s-eye representation of the overall environment. Under these conditions, which should provide relatively optimal opportunities for survey learning, the participants with DS performed comparably to TD participants matched on non-verbal ability on all of our measures of survey learning. Hence, we concluded that people with DS can acquire some survey knowledge when tasked with learning a small environment and given the opportunity to do so. In Experiment 2, the experimenter navigated participants through a large, relatively complex, virtual environment along a circuitous path, beginning and ending at a target landmark. Then, the participants were placed at a pre-specified location in the environment that they had viewed previously and instructed to navigate to the same target (a door) using the shortest possible path from their current location. They completed the task three times: once after being shown the environment one time, once after three exposures, and once after five exposures. Results indicated that the participants with DS exhibited significantly less skill at identifying the shortcut than did the TD participants, with differences emerging as the number of exposures increased. Participants with DS were also less able to recall landmarks at the end of the experiment. Overall, however, the performance of both groups was relatively poor in both experiments – with the performance of participants with DS being worse as conditions became less optimal. These results were discussed in terms of underlying mechanisms that may account for variations in survey learning as environmental complexity increases.</p>

<p>Modern operational environments can place significant demands on a service member's cognitive resources, increasing the risk of errors or mishaps due to overburden. The ability to monitor cognitive burden and associated performance within operational environments is critical to improving mission readiness. As a key step toward a field-ready system, we developed a simulated marksmanship scenario with an embedded working memory task in an immersive virtual reality environment. As participants performed the marksmanship task, they were instructed to remember numbered targets and recall the sequence of those targets at the end of the trial. Low and high cognitive load conditions were defined as the recall of three- and six-digit strings, respectively. Physiological and behavioral signals recorded included speech, heart rate, breathing rate, and body movement. These features were input into a random forest classifier that significantly discriminated between the low- and high-cognitive load conditions (AUC = 0.94). Behavioral features of gait were the most informative, followed by features of speech. We also showed the capability to predict performance on the digit recall (AUC = 0.71) and marksmanship (AUC = 0.58) tasks. The experimental framework can be leveraged in future studies to quantify the interaction of other types of stressors and their impact on operational cognitive and physical performance.</p>

<p>The cholinergic potentiation of visual conditioning enhances visual acuity and discrimination of the trained stimulus. To determine if this also induces long-term plastic changes on cortical maps and connectivity in the visual cortex and higher associative areas, mesoscopic calcium imaging was performed in head-fixed awake GCaMP6s adult mice before and after conditioning. The conditioned stimulus (0.03 cpd, 30°, 100% contrast, 1 Hz-drifting gratings) was presented 10 min daily for a week. Saline or Donepezil (DPZ, 0.3 mg/kg, s.c.), a cholinesterase inhibitor that potentiates cholinergic transmission, were injected prior to each conditioning session and compared to a sham-conditioned group. Cortical maps of resting state and evoked response to the monocular presentation of conditioned or non-conditioned stimulus (30°, 50 and 75% contrast; 90°, 50, 75, and 100% contrast) were established. Amplitude, duration, and latency of the peak response, as well as size of activation were measured in the primary visual cortex (V1), secondary visual areas (AL, A, AM, PM, LM, RL), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and higher cortical areas. Visual stimulation increased calcium signaling in all primary and secondary visual areas, the RSC, but no other cortices. There were no significant effects of sham-conditioning or conditioning alone, but DPZ treatment during conditioning significantly decreased the integrated neuronal activity of superficial layers evoked by the conditioned stimulus in V1, AL, PM, and LM. The activity of downstream cortical areas was not changed. The size of the activated area was decreased in V1 and PM, and the signal-to-noise ratio was decreased in AL and PM. Interestingly, signal correlation was seen only between V1, the ventral visual pathway, and the RSC, and was decreased by DPZ administration. The resting state activity was slightly correlated and rarely affected by treatments, except between binocular and monocular V1 in both hemispheres. In conclusion, cholinergic potentiation of visual conditioning induced change in visual processing in the superficial cortical layers. This effect might be a key mechanism in the establishment of the fine cortical tuning in response to the conditioned visual stimulus.</p>

<p>Ischemic stroke causes brain tissue damage and may release central nervous system (CNS)-specific peptides to the periphery. Neural antigen presentation in the lymphoid tissue could prime immune cells and result in adaptive immune response. However, autoimmune responses against neural antigens are not commonly uncovered after stroke. We studied the brain tissue of nine fatal stroke cases and the blood of a cohort of 13 patients and 11 controls. Flow cytometry carried out in three of the brain samples showed CD8 and CD4 T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the ventricles in the patient deceased 1 day poststroke, T cells with an activated phenotype in the CSF of the patient that died at day 6, and T cells in the ischemic brain tissue in the patient deceased 140 days after stroke onset. Immunohistochemistry showed higher T cell numbers in the core of the lesion of the patient deceased 18 days post-stroke than in the patients deceased from 1 to 5 days post-stroke. In blood samples, we studied whether lymphocytes were primed in the periphery against neural antigens at sequential times (on admission, day 5, and day 90) after stroke. T lymphocytes of stroke patients produced IFN-γ and TNF-α and responded to MBP peptides by increasing their production of TNF-α and IL-10 at admission, but not at later time points. In contrast, IL-4 producing T cells showed progressive increases. Higher percentages of TNF-α producing T lymphocytes at admission were independently associated with poorer outcomes at 90 days. However, we did not detect T cell responses to neural-antigen stimulation 90 days post-stroke. Altogether the results suggest acute T cell priming in the periphery in acute stroke, T cell trafficking from the CSF to the ischemic brain tissue, and the existence of active mechanisms preventing autoreactivity.</p>

<p>Aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) regulates general aging and lifespan. However, the contribution of IGF-1 to age-related AD pathology and progression is highly controversial. Based on our previous work, AβPP/PS1 double transgenic mice, which express human mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS-1), demonstrated a decrease in brain IGF-1 levels when they were crossed with IGF-1 deficient Ames dwarf mice (df/df). Subsequently, a reduction in gliosis, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition, and Aβ<sub>1–40/42</sub> concentrations were observed in this mouse model. This supported the hypothesis that IGF-1 may contribute to the progression of the disease. To assess the role of IGF-1 in AD, 9–10-month-old male littermate control wild type and AβPP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into two treatment groups including control vehicle (DMSO) and picropodophyllin (PPP), a selective, competitive, and reversible IGF-1R inhibitor. The brain penetrant inhibitor was given ip. at 1 mg/kg/day. Mice were sacrificed after 7 days of daily injection and the brains, spleens, and livers were collected to quantify histologic and biochemical changes. The PPP-treated AβPP/PS1 mice demonstrated attenuated insoluble Aβ<sub>1–40/42</sub>. Additionally, an attenuation in microgliosis and protein p-tyrosine levels was observed due to drug treatment in the hippocampus. Our data suggest IGF-1R signaling is associated with disease progression in this mouse model. More importantly, modulation of the brain IGF-1R signaling pathway, even at mid-life, was enough to attenuate aspects of the disease phenotype. This suggests that small molecule therapy targeting the IGF-1R pathway may be viable for late-stage disease treatment.</p>

<p>Adiponectin, a cytokine secreted by mature adipocytes, proves to be neuroprotective. We have previously reported that running triggers adiponectin up-regulation which subsequently promotes generation of hippocampal neurons and thereby alleviates depression-like behaviors in non-stressed mice. However, under the stressing condition, whether adiponectin could still exert antidepressant-like effects following exercise remained unexplored. In this study, by means of repeated corticosterone injections to mimic stress insult and voluntary wheel running as physical exercise intervention, we examined whether exercise-elicited antidepressive effects might involve adiponectin’s regulation on hippocampal neurogenesis and dendritic plasticity in stressed mice. Here we show that repeated injections of corticosterone inhibited hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired dendritic morphology of neurons in the dentate gyrus of both wild-type and adiponectin-knockout mice comparably, which subsequently evoked depression-like behaviors. Voluntary wheel running attenuated corticosterone-suppressed neurogenesis and enhanced dendritic plasticity in the hippocampus, ultimately reducing depression-like behaviors in wild-type, but not adiponectin-knockout mice. We further demonstrate that such proneurogenic effects were potentially achieved through activation of the AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) pathway. Our study provides the first evidence that adiponectin signaling is essential for physical exercise-triggered effects on stress-elicited depression by retaining the normal proliferation of neural progenitors and dendritic morphology of neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, which may depend on activation of the AMPK pathway.</p>

<p>After an injury to the central nervous system (CNS), functional recovery is limited by the inability of severed axons to regenerate and form functional connections with appropriate target neurons beyond the injury. Despite tremendous advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of axon growth, and of the inhibitory factors in the injured CNS that prevent it, disappointingly little progress has been made in restoring function to human patients with CNS injuries, such as spinal cord injury (SCI), through regenerative therapies. Clearly, the large number of overlapping neuron-intrinsic and -extrinsic growth-inhibitory factors attenuates the benefit of neutralizing any one target. More daunting is the distances human axons would have to regenerate to reach some threshold number of target neurons, e.g., those that occupy one complete spinal segment, compared to the distances required in most experimental models, such as mice and rats. However, the difficulties inherent in studying mechanisms of axon regeneration in the mature CNS in vivo have caused researchers to rely heavily on extrapolation from studies of axon regeneration in peripheral nerve, or of growth cone-mediated axon development in vitro and in vivo. Unfortunately, evidence from several animal models, including the transected lamprey spinal cord, has suggested important differences between regeneration of mature CNS axons and growth of axons in peripheral nerve, or during embryonic development. Specifically, long-distance regeneration of severed axons may not involve the actin-myosin molecular motors that guide embryonic growth cones in developing axons. Rather, non-growth cone-mediated axon elongation may be required to propel injured axons in the mature CNS. If so, it may be necessary to use other experimental models to promote regeneration that is sufficient to contact a critical number of target neurons distal to a CNS lesion. This review examines the cytoskeletal underpinnings of axon growth, focusing on the elongating axon tip, to gain insights into how CNS axons respond to injury, and how this might affect the development of regenerative therapies for SCI and other CNS injuries.</p>

<p>We have developed a deep learning-based computer algorithm to recognize and predict retinal differentiation in stem cell-derived organoids based on bright-field imaging. The three-dimensional “organoid” approach for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSC) into retinal and other neural tissues has become a major in vitro strategy to recapitulate development. We decided to develop a universal, robust, and non-invasive method to assess retinal differentiation that would not require chemical probes or reporter gene expression. We hypothesized that basic-contrast bright-field (BF) images contain sufficient information on tissue specification, and it is possible to extract this data using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Retina-specific Rx-green fluorescent protein mouse embryonic reporter stem cells have been used for all of the differentiation experiments in this work. The BF images of organoids have been taken on day 5 and fluorescent on day 9. To train the CNN, we utilized a transfer learning approach: ImageNet pre-trained ResNet50v2, VGG19, Xception, and DenseNet121 CNNs had been trained on labeled BF images of the organoids, divided into two categories (retina and non-retina), based on the fluorescent reporter gene expression. The best-performing classifier with ResNet50v2 architecture showed a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve score of 0.91 on a test dataset. A comparison of the best-performing CNN with the human-based classifier showed that the CNN algorithm performs better than the expert in predicting organoid fate (84% vs. 67 ± 6% of correct predictions, respectively), confirming our original hypothesis. Overall, we have demonstrated that the computer algorithm can successfully recognize and predict retinal differentiation in organoids before the onset of reporter gene expression. This is the first demonstration of CNN’s ability to classify stem cell-derived tissue in vitro.</p>

<p>Lipids play a major role for several brain functions, including cognition and memory. There is a series of work on individual lipids showing involvement in memory mechanisms, a concise lipidome was not reported so far. Moreover, there is no evidence for age-related memory decline and there is only work on brain of young vs. aging animals. Aging animals, however, are not a homogeneous group with respect to memory impairments, thus animals with impaired and unimpaired memory can be discriminated. Following recent studies of hippocampal lipid profiles and hypothalamus controlled hormone profiles, the aim of this study was to compare hypothalamic, lipidomic changes in male Sprague-Dawley rats between young (YM), old impaired (OMI) and old unimpaired (OMU) males. Grouping criterions for aged rats were evaluated by testing them in a spatial memory task, the hole-board. YMs were also tested. Subsequently brains were removed, dissected and hypothalami were kept at −80°C until sample preparation and analysis on liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Significant differences in the amounts of a series of lipids from several classes could be detected between young and aged and between OMI and OMU. A large number of lipids were increased in OMI and a smaller number in OMU as compared to young rats. Differences of lipid ratios (log2 of ratio) between OMI and OMU consisted of glycerophosphocholines (aPC 36:2 and 36:3; PC 34:0, 36:1, 36:3 and 40:2); Glycerophosphoethanolamines (aPE 34:2, 38:5 and 40:5; LPE 18:1, 20:1, 20:4, 22:4 and 22:6; PE36:1 and 38:4); glycerophosphoserines (PS 36:1, 40:4, and 40:6); triacylglycerol TG 52:4; ceramide Cer 17:2 and sphingomyelin SM 20:0. Thus, hypothalamic lipid profiles across different lipid classes discriminate aged male animals into OMU and OMI. The underlying mechanisms may be related to different functional networks of lipids in memory mechanisms and differences in metabolic processes. The study underlines the importance of lipidomics in the pathophysiology of age-related cognitive decline. The necessity of evaluating the cognitive status of aged subjects by behavioral tests results in more specific detection of critical lipids in memory decline, on which now can be focused in subsequent memory studies in animals and humans.</p>

<p>Cognitive impairment is a key clinical feature of ischemic leukoaraiosis (ILA); however, the underlying neurobiological mechanism is still unclear. ILA has been associated with widespread gray and white matter (WM) damage mainly located in cortical-cortical and cortico-subcortical pathways. A total of 36 patients with ILA (Fazekas rating score ≥2) and 31 healthy controls (HCs) underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments (covering four cognitive domains, i.e., information processing speed, episodic memory, executive and visuospatial function) and resting-state functional MRI scans. Graph theory-based analyses were employed to explore the topological organization of the brain connectome in ILA patients, and we further sought to explore the associations of connectome-based metrics and neuropsychological performances. An efficient small-world architecture in the functional brain connectome was observed in the ILA and control groups. Moreover, compared with the HCs, the ILA patients showed increased path length and decreased network efficiency (i.e., global and local efficiency) in their functional brain networks. Further network-based statistic (NBS) analysis revealed a functional-disconnected network in ILA, which is comprised of functional connections linking different brain modules (i.e., default mode, frontoparietal, ventral attention and limbic systems) and connections within single modules (i.e., ventral attention and limbic systems). Intriguingly, the abnormal network metrics correlated with cognitive deficits in ILA patients. Therefore, our findings provide further evidence to support the concept that ILA pathologies could disrupt brain connections, impairing network functioning, and cognition via a “disconnection syndrome.”</p>

<i>N</i>-myristoylation is a ubiquitous class of protein lipidation across eukaryotes and <i>N</i>-myristoyl transferase (NMT) has been proposed as an attractive drug target in several pathogens. Myristoylation often primes for subsequent palmitoylation and stable membrane attachment, however, growing evidence suggests additional regulatory roles for myristoylation on proteins. Here we describe the myristoylated proteome of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> using chemoproteomic methods and show that a small-molecule NMT inhibitor developed against related <i>Plasmodium spp</i>. is also functional in <i>Toxoplasma</i>. We identify myristoylation on a transmembrane protein, the microneme protein 7 (MIC7), which enters the secretory pathway in an unconventional fashion with the myristoylated N-terminus facing the lumen of the micronemes. MIC7 and its myristoylation play a crucial role in the initial steps of invasion, likely during the interaction with and penetration of the host cell. Myristoylation of secreted eukaryotic proteins represents a substantial expansion of the functional repertoire of this co-translational modification.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56427">Chemical and structural investigation of the paroxetine-human serotonin transporter complex</a></h4>

Antidepressants target the serotonin transporter (SERT) by inhibiting serotonin reuptake. Structural and biochemical studies aiming to understand binding of small-molecules to conformationally dynamic transporters like SERT often require thermostabilizing mutations and antibodies to stabilize a specific conformation, leading to questions about relationships of these structures to the bonafide conformation and inhibitor binding poses of wild-type transporter. To address these concerns, we determined the structures of ∆N72/∆C13 and ts2-inactive SERT bound to paroxetine analogues using single-particle cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography, respectively. We synthesized enantiopure analogues of paroxetine containing either bromine or iodine instead of fluorine. We exploited the anomalous scattering of bromine and iodine to define the pose of these inhibitors and investigated inhibitor binding to Asn177 mutants of ts2-active SERT. These studies provide mutually consistent insights into how paroxetine and its analogues bind to the central substrate-binding site of SERT, stabilize the outward-open conformation, and inhibit serotonin transport.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55300">Temporal selectivity declines in the aging human auditory cortex</a></h4>

Current models successfully describe the auditory cortical response to natural sounds with a set of spectro-temporal features. However, these models have hardly been linked to the ill-understood neurobiological changes that occur in the aging auditory cortex. Modelling the hemodynamic response to a rich natural sound mixture in N=64 listeners of varying age, we here show that in older listeners' auditory cortex, the key feature of temporal rate is represented with a markedly broader tuning. This loss of temporal selectivity is most prominent in primary auditory cortex and planum temporale, with no such changes in adjacent auditory or other brain areas. Amongst older listeners, we observe a direct relationship between chronological age and temporal-rate tuning, unconfounded by auditory acuity or model goodness of fit. In line with senescent neural dedifferentiation more generally, our results highlight decreased selectivity to temporal information as a hallmark of the aging auditory cortex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54536">Vestigial auriculomotor activity indicates the direction of auditory attention in humans</a></h4>

Unlike dogs and cats, people do not point their ears as they focus attention on novel, salient, or task-relevant stimuli. Our species may nevertheless have retained a vestigial pinna-orienting system that has persisted as a 'neural fossil’ within in the brain for about 25 million years. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that the direction of auditory attention is reflected in sustained electrical activity of muscles within the vestigial auriculomotor system. Surface electromyograms (EMGs) were taken from muscles that either move the pinna or alter its shape. To assess reflexive, stimulus-driven attention we presented novel sounds from speakers at four different lateral locations while the participants silently read a boring text in front of them. To test voluntary, goal-directed attention we instructed participants to listen to a short story coming from one of these speakers, while ignoring a competing story from the corresponding speaker on the opposite side. In both experiments, EMG recordings showed larger activity at the ear on the side of the attended stimulus, but with slightly different patterns. Upward movement (perking) differed according to the lateral focus of attention only during voluntary orienting; rearward folding of the pinna’s upper-lateral edge exhibited such differences only during reflexive orienting. The existence of a pinna-orienting system in humans, one that is experimentally accessible, offers opportunities for basic as well as applied science.

Patients with cerebellar ataxia suffer from various motor learning deficits hampering their ability to adapt movements to perturbations. Motor adaptation is hypothesized to be the result of two subsystems: a fast learning mechanism and a slow learning mechanism. We tested whether training paradigms that emphasize slow learning could alleviate motor learning deficits of cerebellar patients. Twenty patients with cerebellar degeneration and twenty age-matched controls were trained on a visuomotor task under four different paradigms: a standard paradigm, gradual learning, overlearning and long intertrial interval learning. Expectedly, cerebellar participants performed worse compared to control participants. However, both groups demonstrated elevated levels of spontaneous recovery in the overlearning paradigm, which we saw as evidence for enhanced motor memory retention after extended training. Behavioral differences were only found between the overlearning paradigm and standard learning paradigm in both groups. Modelling suggested that, in control participants, additional spontaneous recovery was the result of higher retention rates of the slow system as well as reduced learning rates of the slow system. In cerebellar participants however, additional spontaneous recovery appeared only to be the result of higher retention rates of the slow system and not reduced learning rates of the slow system. Thus, memory resilience was reduced in cerebellar participants and elevated levels of slow learning were less resilient against washing out. Our results suggest that cerebellar patients might still benefit from extended training through use-dependent learning, which could be leveraged to develop more effective therapeutic strategies.

<p>by Joe Hilton, Matt J. Keeling</p>

The 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/45RPAuJPLbM" width="1" />

<p>by Julia Berezutskaya, Zachary V. Freudenburg, Umut Güçlü, Marcel A. J. van Gerven, Nick F. Ramsey</p>

Understanding how the human brain processes auditory input remains a challenge. Traditionally, a distinction between lower- and higher-level sound features is made, but their definition depends on a specific theoretical framework and might not match the neural representation of sound. Here, we postulate that constructing a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features, could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses. We collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film. The raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses. The model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well to a second dataset, where new participants watched a different film. The extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions. Specifically, several features encoded speech-related acoustic properties with some features exhibiting shorter latency profiles (associated with responses in posterior perisylvian cortex) and others exhibiting longer latency profiles (associated with responses in anterior perisylvian cortex). Our results support and extend the current view on speech perception by demonstrating the presence of temporal hierarchies in the perisylvian cortex and involvement of cortical sites outside of this region during audiovisual speech perception.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JUwl69lnZ0w" width="1" />

<p>by August George, Paola Bisignano, John M. Rosenberg, Michael Grabe, Daniel M. Zuckerman</p>

Motivated by growing evidence for pathway heterogeneity and alternative functions of molecular machines, we demonstrate a computational approach for investigating two questions: (1) Are there multiple mechanisms (state-space pathways) by which a machine can perform a given function, such as cotransport across a membrane? (2) How can additional functionality, such as proofreading/error-correction, be built into machine function using standard biochemical processes? Answers to these questions will aid both the understanding of molecular-scale cell biology and the design of synthetic machines. Focusing on transport in this initial study, we sample a variety of mechanisms by employing Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo. Trial moves adjust transition rates among an automatically generated set of conformational and binding states while maintaining fidelity to thermodynamic principles and a user-supplied fitness/functionality goal. Each accepted move generates a new model. The simulations yield both single and mixed reaction pathways for cotransport in a simple environment with a single substrate along with a driving ion. In a “competitive” environment including an additional decoy substrate, several qualitatively distinct reaction pathways are found which are capable of extremely high discrimination coupled to a leak of the driving ion, akin to proofreading. The array of functional models would be difficult to find by intuition alone in the complex state-spaces of interest.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TeY6FGZX6lk" width="1" />

<p>by Alex C. Ferris, Richard O. J. H. Stutt, David Godding, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>

Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a rapidly spreading viral disease that affects a major food security crop in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there are several proposed management interventions to minimize loss in infected fields. Field-scale data comparing the effectiveness of these interventions individually and in combination are limited and expensive to collect. Using a stochastic epidemiological model for the spread and management of CBSD in individual fields, we simulate the effectiveness of a range of management interventions. Specifically we compare the removal of diseased plants by roguing, preferential selection of planting material, deployment of virus-free ‘clean seed’ and pesticide on crop yield and disease status of individual fields with varying levels of whitefly density crops under low and high disease pressure. We examine management interventions for sustainable production of planting material in clean seed systems and how to improve survey protocols to identify the presence of CBSD in a field or quantify the within-field prevalence of CBSD. We also propose guidelines for practical, actionable recommendations for the deployment of management strategies in regions of sub-Saharan Africa under different disease and whitefly pressure.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZRfC7c2MJxM" width="1" />

<p>by Paola Bisignano, Michael A. Lee, August George, Daniel M. Zuckerman, Michael Grabe, John M. Rosenberg</p>

Membrane transport is generally thought to occur via an alternating access mechanism in which the transporter adopts at least two states, accessible from two different sides of the membrane to exchange substrates from the extracellular environment and the cytoplasm or from the cytoplasm and the intracellular matrix of the organelles (only in eukaryotes). In recent years, a number of high resolution structures have supported this general framework for a wide class of transport molecules, although additional states along the transport pathway are emerging as critically important. Given that substrate binding is often weak in order to enhance overall transport rates, there exists the distinct possibility that transporters may transport the incorrect substrate. This is certainly the case for many pharmaceutical compounds that are absorbed in the gut or cross the blood brain barrier through endogenous transporters. Docking studies on the bacterial sugar transporter vSGLT reveal that many highly toxic compounds are compatible with binding to the orthosteric site, further motivating the selective pressure for additional modes of selectivity. Motivated by recent work in which we observed failed substrate delivery in a molecular dynamics simulation where the energized ion still goes down its concentration gradient, we hypothesize that some transporters evolved to harness this ‘slip’ mechanism to increase substrate selectivity and reduce the uptake of toxic molecules. Here, we test this idea by constructing and exploring a kinetic transport model that includes a slip pathway. While slip reduces the overall productive flux, when coupled with a second toxic molecule that is more prone to slippage, the overall substrate selectivity dramatically increases, suppressing the accumulation of the incorrect compound. We show that the mathematical framework for increased substrate selectivity in our model is analogous to the classic proofreading mechanism originally proposed for tRNA synthase; however, because the transport cycle is reversible we identified conditions in which the selectivity is essentially infinite and incorrect substrates are exported from the cell in a ‘detoxification’ mode. The cellular consequences of proofreading and membrane slippage are discussed as well as the impact on future drug development.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pU4pRk9DLoQ" width="1" />

In the absence of any task, both the brain and spinal cord exhibit spontaneous intrinsic activity organised in a set of functionally relevant neural networks. However, whether such resting-state networks (RSNs) are interconnected across the brain and spinal cord is unclear. Here, we used a unique scanning protocol to acquire functional images of both brain and cervical spinal cord (CSC) simultaneously and examined their spatiotemporal correspondence in humans. We show that the brain and spinal cord activities are strongly correlated during rest periods, and specific spinal cord regions are functionally linked to consistently reported brain sensorimotor RSNs. The functional organisation of these networks follows well-established anatomical principles, including the contralateral correspondence between the spinal hemicords and brain hemispheres as well as sensory versus motor segregation of neural pathways along the brain–spinal cord axis. Thus, our findings reveal a unified functional organisation of sensorimotor networks in the entire central nervous system (CNS) at rest.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bCceWAgAYm4" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We analyzed the longitudinal profile of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in early Parkinson's disease (PD) compared with healthy controls (HCs) and tested baseline CSF biomarkers for prediction of clinical decline in PD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Amyloid‐β 1 to 42 (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), total tau (t‐tau) and phosphorylated tau (p‐tau) at the threonine 181 position were measured using the high‐precision Roche Elecsys electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in all available CSF samples from longitudinally studied patients with PD (n = 416) and HCs (n = 192) followed for up to 3 years in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Longitudinal CSF and clinical data were analyzed with linear‐mixed effects models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found patients with PD had lower CSF t‐tau (median = 157.7 pg/mL; range = 80.9–467.0); p‐tau (median = 13.4 pg/mL; range = 8.0–40.1), and Aβ<sub>42</sub> (median = 846.2 pg/mL; range = 238.8–3,707.0) than HCs at baseline (CSF t‐tau median = 173.5 pg/mL; range = 82.0–580.8; p‐tau median = 15.4 pg/mL; range = 8.1–73.6; and Aβ<sub>42</sub> median = 926.5 pg/mL; range = 239.1–3,297.0; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.05–0.001) and a moderate‐to‐strong correlation among these biomarkers in both patients with PD and HCs (Rho = 0.50–0.97; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.001). Of the patients with PD, 31.5% had pathologically low levels of CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> at baseline and these patients with PD had lower p‐tau levels (median = 10.8 pg/mL; range = 8.0–32.8) compared with 27.7% of HCs with pathologically low CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> (CSF p‐tau median = 12.8 pg/mL; range 8.2–73.6; <i>p </i> &lt; 0.03)<sub>.</sub> In longitudinal CSF analysis, we found patients with PD had greater decline in CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> (mean difference = −41.83 pg/mL; <i>p </i> = 0.03) and CSF p‐tau (mean difference = −0.38 pg/mL; <i>p </i> = 0.03) at year 3 compared with HCs. Baseline CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> values predicted small but measurable decline on cognitive, autonomic, and motor function in early PD.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest baseline CSF AD biomarkers may have prognostic value in early PD and that the dynamic change of these markers, although modest over a 3‐year period, suggest biomarker profiles in PD may deviate from healthy aging. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Research on new optimization algorithms is often funded based on the
motivation that such algorithms might improve the capabilities to deal with
real-world and industrially relevant optimization challenges. Besides a huge
variety of different evolutionary and metaheuristic optimization algorithms,
also a large number of test problems and benchmark suites have been developed
and used for comparative assessments of algorithms, in the context of global,
continuous, and black-box optimization. For many of the commonly used synthetic
benchmark problems or artificial fitness landscapes, there are however, no
methods available, to relate the resulting algorithm performance assessments to
technologically relevant real-world optimization problems, or vice versa. Also,
from a theoretical perspective, many of the commonly used benchmark problems
and approaches have little to no generalization value. Based on a mini-review
of publications with critical comments, advice, and new approaches, this
communication aims to give a constructive perspective on several open
challenges and prospective research directions related to systematic and
generalizable benchmarking for black-box optimization.

<p>Incoming sound is in cochlea and auditory nerve encoded into spike trains. At
the third neuron of the auditory pathway, spike trains of the left and right
sides are processed in brainstem nuclei to yield sound localization
information. Two different localization encoding mechanisms are employed in two
centers for low and high sound frequencies in the brainstem. The centers are
superior olivary nuclei, medial and lateral. This paper contains analytical
estimates of parameters needed in description of auditory coding in sound
localization neural circuit. Our model spike trains are based on
electro-physiological recordings. We arrive to best estimates for neuronal
signaling with the use of just noticeable difference of the ideal observer. We
describe spike timing jitter and its role in the spike train processing. All
parameters are accompanied with detailed estimates of their values and
variability. Intervals bounding all the parameter from lower and higher values
are discussed.

<p>Generalization, i.e., the ability of addressing problem instances that are
not available during the system design and development phase, is a critical
goal for intelligent systems. A typical way to achieve good generalization is
to exploit vast data to train a model. In the context of heuristic search, such
a paradigm is termed parameter tuning or algorithm configuration, i.e.,
configuring the parameters of a search method based on a set of "training"
problem instances. However, compared to its counterpart in machine learning,
parameter tuning could more often suffer from the lack of training instances,
and the obtained configuration may fail to generalize. This paper suggests
competitive co-evolution as a remedy to this challenge and proposes a framework
named Co-Evolution of Parameterized Search (CEPS). By alternately evolving a
configuration population and an instance population, CEPS is capable of
obtaining generalizable configurations with few training instances. The
advantage of CEPS in improving generalization is analytically shown. Two
concrete instantiations, namely CEPS-TSP and CEPS-VRPSPDTW, are also presented
for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with
Simultaneous Pickup-Delivery and Time Windows (VRPSPDTW), respectively.
Computational results on the two problems confirm the advantages of CEPS over
state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods.

<p>Humans learn all their life long. They accumulate knowledge from a sequence
of learning experiences and remember the essential concepts without forgetting
what they have learned previously. Artificial neural networks struggle to learn
similarly. They often rely on data rigorously preprocessed to learn solutions
to specific problems such as classification or regression. In particular, they
forget their past learning experiences if trained on new ones. Therefore,
artificial neural networks are often inept to deal with real-life settings such
as an autonomous-robot that has to learn on-line to adapt to new situations and
overcome new problems without forgetting its past learning-experiences.
Continual learning (CL) is a branch of machine learning addressing this type of
problem. Continual algorithms are designed to accumulate and improve knowledge
in a curriculum of learning-experiences without forgetting. In this thesis, we
propose to explore continual algorithms with replay processes. Replay processes
gather together rehearsal methods and generative replay methods. Generative
Replay consists of regenerating past learning experiences with a generative
model to remember them. Rehearsal consists of saving a core-set of samples from
past learning experiences to rehearse them later. The replay processes make
possible a compromise between optimizing the current learning objective and the
past ones enabling learning without forgetting in sequences of tasks settings.
We show that they are very promising methods for continual learning. Notably,
they enable the re-evaluation of past data with new knowledge and the
confrontation of data from different learning-experiences. We demonstrate their
ability to learn continually through unsupervised learning, supervised learning
and reinforcement learning tasks.

<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique for noninvasively
stimulating a brain area for therapeutic, rehabilitation treatments and
neuroscience research. Despite our understanding of the physical principles and
experimental developments pertaining to TMS, it is difficult to identify the
exact brain target as the generated dosage exhibits a non-uniform distribution
owing to the complicated and subject-dependent brain anatomy and the lack of
biomarkers that can quantify the effects of TMS in most cortical areas.
Computational dosimetry has progressed significantly and enables TMS assessment
by computation of the induced electric field (the primary physical agent known
to activate the brain neurons) in a digital representation of the human head.
In this review, TMS dosimetry studies are summarised, clarifying the importance
of the anatomical and human biophysical parameters and computational methods.
This review shows that there is a high consensus on the importance of a
detailed cortical folding representation and an accurate modelling of the
surrounding cerebrospinal fluid. Recent studies have also enabled the
prediction of individually optimised stimulation based on magnetic resonance
imaging of the patient/subject and have attempted to understand the temporal
effects of TMS at the cellular level by incorporating neural modelling. These
efforts, together with the fast deployment of personalised TMS computations,
will permit the adoption of TMS dosimetry as a standard procedure in clinical
procedures.

<p>One of the widely used models for studying economics of climate change is the
Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and Economy (DICE), which has been
developed by Professor William Nordhaus, one of the laureates of the 2018 Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Originally a single-objective optimal
control problem has been defined on DICE dynamics, which is aimed to maximize
the social welfare. In this paper, a bi-objective optimal control problem
defined on DICE model, objectives of which are maximizing social welfare and
minimizing the temperature deviation of atmosphere. This multi-objective
optimal control problem solved using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II
(NSGA-II) also it is compared to previous works on single-objective version of
the problem. The resulting Pareto front rediscovers the previous results and
generalizes to a wide range of non-dominant solutions to minimize the global
temperature deviation while optimizing the economic welfare. The previously
used single-objective approach is unable to create such a variety of
possibilities, hence, its offered solution is limited in vision and reachable
performance. Beside this, resulting Pareto-optimal set reveals the fact that
temperature deviation cannot go below a certain lower limit, unless we have
significant technology advancement or positive change in global conditions.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00212">Structural diverseness of neurons between brain areas and between cases. (arXiv:2007.00212v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The cerebral cortex is composed of multiple cortical areas that exert a wide
variety of brain functions. Although human brain neurons are genetically and
areally mosaic, the three-dimensional structural differences between neurons in
different brain areas or between the neurons of different individuals have not
been delineated. Here, we report a nanometer-scale geometric analysis of brain
tissues of the superior temporal gyrus of 4 schizophrenia and 4 control cases
by using synchrotron radiation nanotomography. The results of the analysis and
a comparison with results for the anterior cingulate cortex indicated that 1)
neuron structures are dissimilar between brain areas and that 2) the
dissimilarity varies from case to case. The structural diverseness was mainly
observed in terms of the neurite curvature that inversely correlates with the
diameters of the neurites and spines. The analysis also revealed the geometric
differences between the neurons of the schizophrenia and control cases,
suggesting that neuron structure is associated with brain function. The area
dependency of the neuron structure and its diverseness between individuals
should represent the individuality of brain functions.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00126">Functional MRI applications for psychiatric disease subtyping: a review. (arXiv:2007.00126v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Psychiatric disorders have historically been classified using symptom
information alone. With the advent of new technologies that allowed researchers
to investigate brain mechanisms more directly, interest in the mechanistic
rationale behind defined pathologies and aetiology redefinition has greatly
increased. This is particularly appealing for the field of personalised
medicine, which searches for data-driven approaches to improve individual
diagnosis, prognosis and treatment selection. Here we intend to systematically
analyse the usage of functional MRI on both the elucidation of psychiatric
disease biotypes and the interpretation of subtypes obtained via unsupervised
learning applied to symptom or biomarker data. We searched the existing
literature for functional MRI applications to the obtention or interpretation
of psychiatric disease subtypes. The PRISMA guidelines were applied to filter
the retrieved studies, and the active learning framework ASReviews was applied
for article prioritization. From the 20 studies that met the inclusion
criteria, 5 used functional MRI data to interpret symptom-derived disease
clusters, 4 used it for the interpretation of clusters derived from biomarker
data other than fMRI itself, and 11 applied clustering to fMRI directly. Major
depression disorder and schizophrenia were the two most studied pathologies,
followed by ADHD, psychosis, autism disorder, and early violence. No
trans-diagnostic studies were retrieved. While interest in personalised
medicine and data-driven disease subtyping is on the rise and psychiatry is not
the exception, unsupervised analyses of functional MRI data are inconsistent to
date, and much remains to be done in terms of gathering and centralising data,
standardising pipelines and model validation, and method refinement. The usage
of fMRI in the field of trans-diagnostic psychiatry remains vastly unexplored.

<p>Oxidative stress (OS) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of several brain-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke, which are the major causes of dementia. The Nrf2-ARE (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant responsive element antioxidant) system, the primary cellular defense against OS, plays an essential role in neuroprotection by regulating the expressions of antioxidant molecules and enzymes. However, simultaneous events resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deregulation of the Nrf2-ARE system damage essential cell components and cause loss of neuron structural and functional integrity. On the other hand, TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B) signaling, a classical neurotrophin signaling pathway, regulates neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity, which play pivotal roles in memory and cognition. Also, TrkB signaling, specifically the TrkB/PI3K/Akt (TrkB/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B) pathway promotes the activation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and thus, confers neuroprotection against OS. However, the TrkB signaling pathway is also known to be downregulated in brain disorders due to lack of neurotrophin support. Therefore, activations of TrkB and the Nrf2-ARE signaling system offer a potential approach to the design of novel therapeutic agents for brain disorders. Here, we briefly overview the development of OS and the association between OS and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury. We propose the cellular antioxidant defense and TrkB signaling-mediated cell survival systems be considered pharmacological targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and review the literature on the neuroprotective effects of phytochemicals that can co-activate these neuronal defense systems.</p>

<p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an immensely powerful method in neuroscience that uses the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal to record and analyze neural activity in the brain. We examined the complexity of brain activity acquired by rs-fMRI to determine whether it exhibits variation across brain regions. In this study the complexity of regional brain activity was analyzed by calculating the sample entropy of 200 whole-brain BOLD volumes as well as of distinct brain networks, cortical regions, and subcortical regions of these brain volumes. It can be seen that different brain regions and networks exhibit distinctly different levels of entropy/complexity, and that entropy in the brain significantly differs between brains at rest and during task performance.</p>

Background<p>Periodontitis is one of the most common oral diseases and is a potential risk factor for systemic diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between periodontitis and learning and memory impairment.</p>Methods<p>We established a periodontitis model by topical application of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P. gingivalis-LPS) into the palatal gingival sulcus of the maxillary first molars of 10-week-old male rats for a 10-week period. We assessed alveolar bone resorption using micro–computed tomography analysis and learning and memory ability using the Morris water maze test. We determined the levels of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-21] and LPS in the peripheral blood and cortex, as well as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB signaling pathway activation, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and western blot. We determined activation of microglia and astrocytes, expression of Aβ1-42, APP and Tau by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we measured the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its key secretases, as well as the Aβ1-40/1-42 ratio, by RT-PCR, western blot, and ELISA.</p>Results<p>We found that periodontitis induced learning and memory impairment in the rats. Further, we observed that it induced significant alveolar bone resorption. There was an increase in the levels of inflammatory cytokines and LPS. Moreover, we confirmed TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway activation. We also observed activated microglia and astrocytes with enlarged cell bodies and irregular protrusions. Finally, we observed the promotion of β- and γ-secretases APP processing.</p>Conclusion<p>Our findings indicated that periodontitis was associated with learning and memory impairment, probably induced by neuroinflammation via activating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, abnormal APP processing could be involved in this progress.</p>

<p>Background: Understanding the action intentions of others is important for social and human-robot interactions. Recently, many state-of-the-art approaches have been proposed for decoding action intention understanding. Although these methods have some advantages, it is still necessary to design other tools that can more efficiently classify the action intention understanding signals.</p><p>New Method: Based on EEG, we first applied phase lag index (PLI) and weighted phase lag index (WPLI) to construct functional connectivity matrices in five frequency bands and 63 micro-time windows, then calculated nine graph metrics from these matrices and subsequently used the network metrics as features to classify different brain signals related to action intention understanding.</p><p>Results: Compared with the single methods (PLI or WPLI), the combination method (PLI+WPLI) demonstrates some overwhelming victories. Most of the average classification accuracies exceed 70%, and some of them approach 80%. In statistical tests of brain network, many significantly different edges appear in the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions.</p><p>Conclusions: Weighted brain networks can effectively retain data information. The integrated method proposed in this study is extremely effective for investigating action intention understanding. Both the mirror neuron and mentalizing systems participate as collaborators in the process of action intention understanding.</p>

<p>Sequence learning is a fundamental cognitive function of the brain. However, the ways in which sequential information is represented and memorized are not dealt with satisfactorily by existing models. To overcome this deficiency, this paper introduces a spiking neural network based on psychological and neurobiological findings at multiple scales. Compared with existing methods, our model has four novel features: (1) It contains several collaborative subnetworks similar to those in brain regions with different cognitive functions. The individual building blocks of the simulated areas are neural functional minicolumns composed of biologically plausible neurons. Both excitatory and inhibitory connections between neurons are modulated dynamically using a spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule. (2) Inspired by the mechanisms of the brain's cortical-striatal loop, a dependent timing module is constructed to encode temporal information, which is essential in sequence learning but has not been processed well by traditional algorithms. (3) Goal-based and episodic retrievals can be achieved at different time scales. (4) Musical memory is used as an application to validate the model. Experiments show that the model can store a huge amount of data on melodies and recall them with high accuracy. In addition, it can remember the entirety of a melody given only an episode or the melody played at different paces.</p>

<p>Axon growth inhibitors generated by reactive glial scars play an important role in failure of axon regeneration after CNS injury in mature mammals. Among the inhibitory factors, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are potent suppressors of axon regeneration and are important molecular targets for designing effective therapies for traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury (SCI). CSPGs bind with high affinity to several transmembrane receptors, including two members of the leukocyte common antigen related (LAR) subfamily of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs). Recent studies demonstrate that multiple intracellular signaling pathways downstream of these two RPTPs mediate the growth-inhibitory actions of CSPGs. A better understanding of these signaling pathways may facilitate development of new and effective therapies for CNS disorders characterized by axonal disconnections. This review will focus on recent advances in the downstream signaling pathways of scar-mediated inhibition and their potential as the molecular targets for CNS repair.</p>

<p>Schwann cell (SC) transplantation is a promising approach for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI); however, SC grafts show a low migratory capacity within the astrocytic environment, which inevitably hampers their therapeutic efficacy. The purpose of this study was to explore mechanisms to modify the characteristics of SCs and astrocytes (ASs), as well as to adjust the SC-AS interface to break the SC-AS boundary, thus improving the benefits of SCI treatment. We observed that the expression levels of miR-124 in SCs and ASs were significantly lower than those in the normal spinal cord. Furthermore, overexpressing miR-124 in SCs (miR-124-SCs) significantly inhibited gene and protein expression levels of SC-specific markers, such as GFAP and Krox20. The expression of neurotrophic factors, Bdnf and Nt-3, was up-regulated in miR-124-SCs without affecting their proliferation. Further, the boundary assay showed an increased number of miR-124-SCs that had actively migrated and entered the astrocytic region to intermingle with ASs, compared with normal SCs. In addition, although Krox20 protein expression was down-regulated in miR-124-SCs, the luciferase assay showed that Krox20 is not a direct target of miR-124. RNA sequencing of miR-124-SCs revealed seven upregulated and eleven downregulated genes involved in cell migration and motility. Based on KEGG pathway and KOG functional analyses, changes in these genes corresponded to the activation of Hippo, FoxO, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and the cell cycle. Finally, co-culturing of miR-124-SCs and ASs in a transwell system revealed that GFAP and p-STAT3 protein expression in ASs was significantly reduced. Collectively, these results show that overexpression of miR-124 in SCs promotes SC-AS integration in vitro and may attenuate the capacity of ASs to form glial scars. Thus, this study provides novel insights into modifying SCs by overexpressing miR-124 to improve their therapeutic potential in SCI.</p>

<p>Purpose: To investigate the structural covariance network disruption in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and explore the functional alterations of disrupted structural covariance network.</p><p>Methods: A cohort of 100 PD patients and 70 healthy participants underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance scanning. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied separately to both deformation-based morphometry (DBM) maps and functional maps with the same calculating parameters (both decomposed into 20 independent components (ICs) and computed 20 times the Infomax algorithm in ICASSO). Disrupted structural covariance network in PD patients was identified, and then, we performed goodness of fit analysis to obtain the functional network that showed the highest spatial overlap with it. We investigated the relationship between structural covariance network and functional network alterations. Finally, to further understand the structural and functional alterations over time, we performed a longitudinal subgroup analysis (51 patients were followed up for 2 years) with the same procedures.</p><p>Results: In a cross-sectional analysis, PD patients showed decreased structural covariance between anterior and posterior cingulate subnetworks. The functional components showed best overlap with anterior and posterior cingulate structural subnetworks were selected as anterior and posterior cingulate functional subnetworks. The functional connectivity between them was significantly increased [assessed by Functional Network Connectivity (FNC) toolbox]; and the increased functional connectivity was negatively correlated with cingulate structural covariance network integrity. Longitudinal subgroup analysis showed cingulate structural covariance network disruption was worse at follow-up, while the functional connectivity between anterior and posterior cingulate network was increased at baseline and decreased at follow-up.</p><p>Conclusion: This study indicated that the cingulate structural covariance network displayed a high susceptibility in PD patients. This study indicated that the cingulate structural covariance network displayed a high susceptibility in PD patients. Considering that disrupted structural covariance network coexisted with enhanced/remained functional activity during disease development, enhanced functional activity underlying the disrupted cingulate structural covariance network might represent a temporal compensation for maintaining clinical performance.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers based on larger-scale tissue neurodegeneration changes, such as atrophy, are currently widely used. Texture analysis evaluates the statistical properties of the tissue image quantitatively; therefore, it could detect smaller-scale changes of neurodegeneration. Entorhinal cortex is the first region affected, and no study has investigated texture analysis on this region before. This study aims to differentiate AD patients from Normal Control (NC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects using entorhinal cortex texture features. Furthermore, it was evaluated whether texture has association to MCI beyond that of volume, to evaluate if atrophy development may precede. Texture features were extracted from 194 NC, 200 MCI, 84 MCI who converted to AD (MCIc), and 130 AD subjects. Receiving operating characteristic curves determined the performance of the various features in discriminating the groups, and a predictive model was used to predict conversion of MCIc subjects to AD. An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.872, 0.710, 0.730, and 0.764 was seen between NC vs. AD, NC vs. MCI, MCI vs. MCIc, and MCI vs. AD subjects, respectively. Including entorhinal cortex volume improved the AUCs to 0.914, 0.740, 0.756, and 0.780, respectively. For the disease prediction, binary logistic regression was applied on five randomly selected test groups and achieved on average AUC’s of 0.760 and 0.764 on the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Entorhinal cortex texture features were significantly different between the four groups and in many cases provided better results compared to other methods such as volumetry.</p>

<p>Introduction: Inactivity and consequent deterioration of cognitive and physical function is a major concern among older adults with the limited walking ability and need a high level of care in nursing homes. We aimed to test whether a drumming communication program (DCP) that uses the rhythmic response function of the elderly with cognitive impairment, dementia, and other debilitating disorders would improve their cognitive and physical function.</p><p>Methods: We conducted a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to investigate the effects of the DCP in 46 nursing home residents who needed high levels of nursing care. The participants were randomly assigned to an intervention and control group. The intervention group attended 30 min of the DCP thrice a week for 3 months. Cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination-Japanese (MMSE-J) and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Physical function was measured using grip strength and active upper limb range of motion with the dominant hand. Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). These measures were analyzed before and after the DCP intervention period, and data for the two groups were compared thereafter.</p><p>Results: Initially, the participants had low scores on the MMSE-J, and 84.78% of them used wheelchairs. Following the DCP intervention, the MMSE-J and FAB scores of the DCP group improved significantly. In terms of motor function, the active range of motion of the wrist palmar and the shoulder flexion improved in the intervention group. Regarding body composition, the skeletal muscle mass index, total body protein, and the dominant hand muscle mass that was adding physical load decreased.</p><p>Conclusions: The DCP provided the participants with an opportunity to engage in continued exercise for 3 months. The intervention group exhibited improved cognitive function and upper limb motion range, and changes in body composition. The results suggest that DCP can be used as an intervention method to promote exercise and improve various health and cognitive functions.</p><p>Trial Registration: This trial was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000024714) on 4 November 2016.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57749">Cortical ChAT+ neurons co-transmit acetylcholine and GABA in a target-and brain-region specific manner</a></h4>

The mouse cerebral cortex contains neurons that express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and are a potential local source of acetylcholine. However, the neurotransmitters released by cortical ChAT<sup>+</sup> neurons and their synaptic connectivity are unknown. We show that the nearly all cortical ChAT<sup>+</sup> neurons in mice are specialized VIP<sup>+</sup> interneurons that release GABA strongly onto other inhibitory interneurons and acetylcholine sparsely onto layer 1 interneurons and other VIP<sup>+</sup>/ChAT<sup>+</sup> interneurons. This differential transmission of ACh and GABA based on the postsynaptic target neuron is reflected in VIP<sup>+</sup>/ChAT<sup>+</sup> interneuron pre-synaptic terminals, as quantitative molecular analysis shows that only a subset of these are specialized to release acetylcholine. In addition, we identify a separate, sparse population of non-VIP ChAT<sup>+</sup> neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex with a distinct developmental origin that robustly release acetylcholine in layer 1. These results demonstrate both cortex-region heterogeneity in cortical ChAT<sup>+</sup> interneurons and target-specific co-release of acetylcholine and GABA.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57306">Interaction mapping of endoplasmic reticulum ubiquitin ligases identifies modulators of innate immune signalling</a></h4>

Ubiquitin ligases (E3s) embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane regulate essential cellular activities including protein quality control, calcium flux, and sterol homeostasis. At least 25 different, transmembrane domain (TMD)-containing E3s are predicted to be ER-localised, but for most their organisation and cellular roles remain poorly defined. Using a comparative proteomic workflow, we mapped over 450 protein-protein interactions for 21 stably expressed, full-length E3s. Bioinformatic analysis linked ER-E3s and their interactors to multiple homeostatic, regulatory, and metabolic pathways. Among these were four membrane-embedded interactors of RNF26, a polytopic E3 whose abundance is auto-regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation. RNF26 co-assembles with TMEM43, ENDOD1, TMEM33 and TMED1 to form a complex capable of modulating innate immune signalling through the cGAS-STING pathway. This RNF26 complex represents a new modulatory axis of STING and innate immune signalling at the ER membrane. Collectively, these data reveal the broad scope of regulation and differential functionalities mediated by ER-E3s for both membrane-tethered and cytoplasmic processes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56717">Evolution of a plant gene cluster in Solanaceae and emergence of metabolic diversity</a></h4>

Plants produce phylogenetically and spatially restricted, as well as structurally diverse specialized metabolites via multistep metabolic pathways. Hallmarks of specialized metabolic evolution include enzymatic promiscuity and recruitment of primary metabolic enzymes and examples of genomic clustering of pathway genes. Solanaceae glandular trichomes produce defensive acylsugars, with sidechains that vary in length across the family. We describe a tomato gene cluster on chromosome 7 involved in medium chain acylsugar accumulation due to trichome specific acyl-CoA synthetase and enoyl-CoA hydratase genes. This cluster co-localizes with a tomato steroidal alkaloid gene cluster and is syntenic to a chromosome 12 region containing another acylsugar pathway gene. We reconstructed the evolutionary events leading to this gene cluster and found that its phylogenetic distribution correlates with medium chain acylsugar accumulation across the Solanaceae. This work reveals insights into the dynamics behind gene cluster evolution and cell-type specific metabolite diversity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55979">Receptor-driven, multimodal mapping of cortical areas in the macaque monkey intraparietal sulcus</a></h4>

The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is structurally and functionally heterogeneous. We performed a quantitative cyto- and receptor architectonical analysis to provide a multimodal map of the macaque IPS. We identified 17 cortical areas, including novel areas PEipe, PEipi (external and internal subdivisions of PEip), and MIPd. Multivariate analyses of receptor densities resulted in a grouping of areas based on the degree of (dis)similarity of their receptor architecture: a cluster encompassing areas located in the posterior portion of the IPS and associated mainly with the processing of visual information, a cluster including areas found in the anterior portion of the IPS and involved in sensorimotor processing, and an 'intermediate' cluster of multimodal association areas. Thus, differences in cyto- and receptor architecture segregate the cortical ribbon within the IPS, and receptor fingerprints provide novel insights into the relationship between the structural and functional segregation of this brain region in the macaque monkey.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55319">Human Fcγ-receptor IIb modulates pathogen-specific versus self-reactive antibody responses in Lyme arthritis</a></h4>

Pathogen specific antibody responses need to be tightly regulated to generate protective but limit self-reactive immune responses. While loss of humoral tolerance has been associated with microbial infections, the pathways involved in balancing protective versus autoreactive antibody responses in humans are incompletely understood. Studies in classical mouse model systems have provided evidence that balancing of immune responses through inhibitory receptors is an important quality control checkpoint. Genetic differences between inbred mouse models and the outbred human population and allelic receptor variants not present in mice, however, argue for caution when directly translating these findings to the human system. By studying <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> infection in humanized mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells from donors homozygous for a functional or non-functional FcgRIIb allele, we show that the human inhibitory FcgRIIb is a critical checkpoint balancing protective and autoreactive immune responses, linking infection with induction of autoimmunity in the human immune system.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54148">Global sleep homeostasis reflects temporally and spatially integrated local cortical neuronal activity</a></h4>

Sleep homeostasis manifests as a relative constancy of its daily amount and intensity. Theoretical descriptions define ‘Process S’, a variable with dynamics dependent on global sleep-wake history, and reflected in electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA, 0.5–4 Hz) during sleep. The notion of sleep as a local, activity-dependent process suggests that activity history must be integrated to determine the dynamics of global Process S. Here, we developed novel mathematical models of Process S based on cortical activity recorded in freely behaving mice, describing local Process S as a function of the deviation of neuronal firing rates from a locally defined set-point, independent of global sleep-wake state. Averaging locally derived Processes S and their rate parameters yielded values resembling those obtained from EEG SWA and global vigilance states. We conclude that local Process S dynamics reflects neuronal activity integrated over time, and global Process S reflects local processes integrated over space.

<p>by Tomasz Pieńko, Joanna Trylska</p>

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (or cobalamin) is an enzymatic cofactor essential both for mammals and bacteria. However, cobalamin can be synthesized only by few microorganisms so most bacteria need to take it up from the environment through the TonB-dependent transport system. The first stage of cobalamin import to <i>E. coli</i> cells occurs through the outer-membrane receptor called BtuB. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> binds with high affinity to the extracellular side of the BtuB protein. BtuB forms a <i>β</i>-barrel with inner luminal domain and extracellular loops. To mechanically allow for cobalamin passage, the luminal domain needs to partially unfold with the help of the inner-membrane TonB protein. However, the mechanism of cobalamin permeation is unknown. Using all-atom molecular dynamics, we simulated the transport of cobalamin through the BtuB receptor embedded in an asymmetric and heterogeneous <i>E. coli</i> outer membrane. To enhance conformational sampling of the BtuB loops, we developed the Gaussian force-simulated annealing method (GF-SA) and coupled it with umbrella sampling. We found that cobalamin needs to rotate in order to permeate through BtuB. We showed that the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops is crucial for cobalamin binding and transport and resembles an induced fit mechanism. Loop mobility depends not only on the position of cobalamin but also on the extension of luminal domain. We provided atomistic details of cobalamin transport through the BtuB receptor showing the essential role of the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops. A similar TonB-dependent transport system is used also by many other compounds, such as haem and siderophores, and importantly, can be hijacked by natural antibiotics. Our work could have implications for future delivery of antibiotics to bacteria using this transport system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wst7y8kEDKI" width="1" />

The effective reproduction number, <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, is a key time-varying prognostic for the growth rate of any infectious disease epidemic. Significant changes in <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> can forewarn about new transmissions within a population or predict the efficacy of interventions. Inferring <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> reliably and in real-time from observed time-series of infected (demographic) data is an important problem in population dynamics. The renewal or branching process model is a popular solution that has been applied to Ebola and Zika virus disease outbreaks, among others, and is currently being used to investigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This model estimates <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> using a heuristically chosen piecewise function. While this facilitates real-time detection of statistically significant <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> changes, inference is highly sensitive to the function choice. Improperly chosen piecewise models might ignore meaningful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones, yet produce visually reasonable estimates. No principled piecewise selection scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the accumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory, which deems the model capable of describing the observed data using the fewest bits as most justified. We derive exact posterior prediction distributions for infected population size and integrate these within an APE framework to obtain an exact and reliable method for identifying the piecewise function best supported by available epidemic data. We find that this choice optimises short-term prediction accuracy and can rapidly detect salient fluctuations in <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, and hence the infected population growth rate, in real-time over the course of an unfolding epidemic. Moreover, we emphasise the need for formal selection by exposing how common heuristic choices, which seem sensible, can be misleading. Our APE-based method is easily computed and broadly applicable to statistically similar models found in phylogenetics and macroevolution, for example. Our results explore the relationships among estimate precision, forecast reliability and model complexity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BuekkNY5tNs" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/XtzYHyZln0o/article">A simple model for learning in volatile environments</a></h4>

<p>by Payam Piray, Nathaniel D. Daw</p>

Sound principles of statistical inference dictate that uncertainty shapes learning. In this work, we revisit the question of learning in volatile environments, in which both the first and second-order statistics of observations dynamically evolve over time. We propose a new model, the volatile Kalman filter (VKF), which is based on a tractable state-space model of uncertainty and extends the Kalman filter algorithm to volatile environments. The proposed model is algorithmically simple and encompasses the Kalman filter as a special case. Specifically, in addition to the error-correcting rule of Kalman filter for learning observations, the VKF learns volatility according to a second error-correcting rule. These dual updates echo and contextualize classical psychological models of learning, in particular hybrid accounts of Pearce-Hall and Rescorla-Wagner. At the computational level, compared with existing models, the VKF gives up some flexibility in the generative model to enable a more faithful approximation to exact inference. When fit to empirical data, the VKF is better behaved than alternatives and better captures human choice data in two independent datasets of probabilistic learning tasks. The proposed model provides a coherent account of learning in stable or volatile environments and has implications for decision neuroscience research.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XtzYHyZln0o" width="1" />

<p>Many patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) remain unresponsive after surviving critical illness. Although several structural brain abnormalities have been described, their impact on brain function and implications for prognosis are unknown. Functional neuroimaging, which has prognostic significance, has yet to be explored in this population. Here we describe a patient with severe COVID‐19 who, despite prolonged unresponsiveness and structural brain abnormalities, demonstrated intact functional network connectivity, and weeks later recovered the ability to follow commands. When prognosticating for survivors of severe COVID‐19, clinicians should consider that brain networks may remain functionally intact despite structural injury and prolonged unresponsiveness.</p>

<p>There is an unmet need to identify biomarkers sensitive to change in rare, slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of muscle may offer this opportunity, as it is noninvasive and can be carried out almost independent of patient cooperation and disease severity. Muscle fat content correlates with muscle function in neuromuscular diseases, and changes in fat content precede changes in function, which suggests that muscle MRI is a strong biomarker candidate to predict prognosis and treatment efficacy. In this paper, we review the evidence suggesting that muscle MRI may be an important biomarker for diagnosis and to monitor change in disease severity. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to investigate whether intensive blood pressure treatment is associated with less hematoma growth and better outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients who received intravenous nicardipine treatment ≤2 hours after onset of symptoms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A post‐hoc exploratory analysis of the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH‐2) trial was performed. This was a multicenter, international, open‐label, randomized clinical trial, in which patients with primary ICH were allocated to intensive versus standard blood pressure treatment with nicardipine ≤4.5 hours after onset of symptoms. We have included 913 patients with complete imaging and follow‐up data in the present analysis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 913 included patients, 354 (38.7%) had intravenous nicardipine treatment initiated within 2 hours. In this subgroup of patients treated within 2 hours, the frequency of ICH expansion was significantly lower in the intensive blood pressure reduction group compared with the standard treatment group (<i>p </i> = 0.02). Multivariable analysis showed that ultra‐early intensive blood pressure treatment was associated with a decreased risk of hematoma growth (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34–0.92; <i>p </i> = 0.02), higher rate of functional independence (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.28–3.68; <i>p </i> = 0.004), and good outcome (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.01–2.83; <i>p </i> = 0.048) at 90 days. Ultra‐early intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with a favorable shift in modified Rankin Scale score distribution at 3 months (<i>p </i> = 0.04).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In a subgroup of ICH patients with elevated blood pressure given intravenous nicardipine ≤2 hours after onset of symptoms, intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with reduced hematoma growth and improved functional outcome. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Facial expressions are important for intentional display of emotions in social interaction. For people with severe paralysis, the ability to display emotions intentionally can be impaired. Current brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) allow for linguistic communication but are cumbersome for expressing emotions. Here, we investigated the feasibility of a BCI to display emotions by decoding facial expressions. We used electrocorticographic recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of people with refractory epilepsy and classified five facial expressions, based on neural activity. The mean classification accuracy was 72%. This approach could be a promising avenue for development of BCI‐based solutions for fast communication of emotions. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55775">Homeostatic plasticity fails at the intersection of autism-gene mutations and a novel class of common genetic modifiers</a></h4>

We identify a set of common phenotypic modifiers that interact with five independent autism gene orthologs (<i>RIMS1</i>, <i>CHD8</i>, <i>CHD2</i>, <i>WDFY3</i>, <i>ASH1L</i>) causing a common failure of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) in <i>Drosophila</i>. Heterozygous null mutations in each autism gene are demonstrated to have normal baseline neurotransmission and PHP. However, PHP is sensitized and rendered prone to failure. A subsequent electrophysiology-based genetic screen identifies the first known heterozygous mutations that commonly genetically interact with multiple ASD gene orthologs, causing PHP to fail. Two phenotypic modifiers identified in the screen, <i>PDPK1</i> and <i>PPP2R5D, </i>are characterized. Finally, transcriptomic, ultrastructural and electrophysiological analyses define one mechanism by which PHP fails; an unexpected, maladaptive up-regulation of <i>CREG</i>, a conserved, neuronally expressed, stress response gene and a novel repressor of PHP. Thus, we define a novel genetic landscape by which diverse, unrelated autism risk genes may converge to commonly affect the robustness of synaptic transmission.

Bayne et al. (2020) [1] envision the fascinating possibility that disconnected hemispheres (through hemispherotomy), ex cranio brains, and cerebral organoids may be islands of awareness (IOAs). They defined IOAs as systems fully disconnected from the external surrounding, both in terms of input (i.e., sensory information) and output (i.e., motor responses), yet capable of conscious experience (i.e., aware). In order to test whether these islands are effectively aware, the authors propose to use measures of human/animal consciousness that have been well validated in human/animal settings by correlation with pretheoretical measures of consciousness (e.g., behavioural reports) or subjective reports (in the case of humans).

Remyelination is the regeneration of myelin sheaths following demyelination. This regenerative process is critical for the re-establishment of axonal conduction velocity and metabolic support to the axons. Successful remyelination in the CNS generally depends on the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). However, other cell types play critical roles in establishing where a lesion is conducive for regeneration. In the last few years, several studies have described beneficial and detrimental roles played by astrocytes in remyelination.

The main neurological manifestation of COVID-19 is loss of smell or taste. The high incidence of smell loss without significant rhinorrhea or nasal congestion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 targets the chemical senses through mechanisms distinct from those used by endemic coronaviruses or other common cold-causing agents. Here we review recently developed hypotheses about how SARS-CoV-2 might alter the cells and circuits involved in chemosensory processing and thereby change perception. Given our limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we propose future experiments to elucidate disease mechanisms and highlight the relevance of this ongoing work to understanding how the virus might alter brain function more broadly.

Exaggerations of the detrimental impact of recreational drug use on the human brain have bolstered support for draconian drug policies and have been used to justify police brutality against Black people. This situation has led to disproportionately high Black incarceration rates and countless Black deaths. Here, Hart offers solutions to remedy this multi-century maltreatment of Black people.

These human neutralizing antibodies target 3 separate epitopes on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and epitope B antibody (553-15) can enhance the neutralizing abilities of most other antibodies.

We present the software platform 2CALM that allows for a comparative analysis of 3D localisation microscopy data representing protein distributions in two biological samples. The in-depth statistical analysis reveals differences between samples at the nanoscopic level using parameters such as cluster-density and -curvature. An automatic classification system combines multiplex and multi-level statistical approaches into one comprehensive parameter for similarity testing of the compared samples. We demonstrated the biological importance of 2CALM, comparing the protein distributions of CD41 and CD62p on activated platelets in a 3D artificial clot. Additionally, using 2CALM, we quantified the impact of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β on platelet activation in clots. The platform is applicable to any other cell type and biological system and can provide new insights into biological and medical applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iMXOo-9hMFA" width="1" />

Coordination of gene expression with nutrient availability supports proliferation and homeostasis and is shaped by protein acetylation. Yet how physiological/pathological signals link acetylation to specific gene expression programs and whether such responses are cell-type–specific is unclear. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key energy sensor, activated by glucose limitation to resolve nutrient supply–demand imbalances, critical for diabetes and cancer. Unexpectedly, we show here that, in gastrointestinal cancer cells, glucose activates AMPK to selectively induce EP300, but not CREB-binding protein (CBP). Consequently, EP300 is redirected away from nuclear receptors that promote differentiation towards β-catenin, a driver of proliferation and colorectal tumorigenesis. Importantly, blocking glycogen synthesis permits reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and AMPK activation in response to glucose in previously nonresponsive cells. Notably, glycogen content and activity of the ROS/AMPK/EP300/β-catenin axis are opposite in healthy versus tumor sections. Glycogen content reduction from healthy to tumor tissue may explain AMPK switching from tumor suppressor to activator during tumor evolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/i2nqplbFQZE" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sensory information is transmitted from peripheral nerves, through the spinal cord, and up to the brain. Sensory information may be modulated by projections from the brain to the spinal cord, but the neural substrates for top‐down sensory control are incompletely understood. We identified a novel population of inhibitory neurons in the mouse brainstem, distinguished by their expression of prodynorphin, which we named LJA5. Here, we identify a similar group of <i>pdyn+ </i> neurons in the human brainstem, and we define the efferent and afferent projection patterns of LJA5 neurons in mouse. Using specific genetic tools, we selectively traced the projections of the <i>pdyn </i>‐expressing LJA5 neurons through the brain and spinal cord. Terminal fields were densest in the lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (PAG), lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB), caudal pressor area, and lamina I of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and all levels of the spinal cord. We then labeled cell types in the PAG, LPB, medulla, and spinal cord to better define the specific targets of LJA5 boutons. LJA5 neurons send the only known inhibitory descending projection specifically to lamina I of the spinal cord, which transmits afferent pain, temperature, and itch information up to the brain. Using retrograde tracing, we found LJA5 neurons receive inputs from sensory and stress areas such as somatosensory/insular cortex, preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamus, PAG, and LPB.

<p>Disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered primarily a result of axonal loss. However, correlation with spinal cord cross‐sectional area – a predictor of disability – is poor, questioning the unique role of axonal loss. We investigated the degree of synaptic loss in post‐mortem spinal cords (18 chronic MS, eight healthy controls) using immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and synapsin. Substantial (58–96%) loss of synapses throughout the spinal cord was detected, along with moderate (47%) loss of anterior horn neurons, notably in demyelinating MS lesions. We conclude that synaptic loss is significant in chronic MS, likely contributing to disability accrual.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>Locations of waking/arousal‐related cell groups of the brainstem and caudal diencephalon at which GA exert anesthetic actions. They include the pontomesencephalic reticular formation (PRF), locus coeruleus (LC), parabrachial nucleus (PB), tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and orexin‐containing cells of the lateral hypothalamus. GAs have been shown to suppress the activity of each of these structures to induce anesthesia whereas their activation (e.g., by electrical stimulation) hastens the recovery from anesthesia.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We review evidence challenging the hypothesis that memories are processed or consolidated in sleep. We argue that the brain is in an unconscious state in sleep, akin to general anesthesia (GA), and hence is incapable of meaningful cognitive processing—the sole purview of waking consciousness. At minimum, the encoding of memories in sleep would require that waking events are faithfully transferred to and reproduced in sleep. Remarkably, however, this has never been demonstrated, as waking experiences are never truly replicated in sleep but rather appear in very altered or distorted forms. General anesthetics (GAs) exert their effects through endogenous sleep–wake control systems and accordingly GA and sleep share several common features: sensory blockade, immobility, amnesia and lack of awareness (unconsciousness). The loss of consciousness in non‐REM (NREM) sleep or to GAs is characterized by: (a) delta oscillations throughout the cortex; (b) marked reductions in neural activity (from waking) over widespread regions of the cortex, most pronounced in frontal and parietal cortices; and (c) a significant disruption of the functional connectivity of thalamocortical and corticocortical networks, particularly those involved in “higher order” cognitive functions. Several (experimental) reports in animals and humans have shown that disrupting the activity of the cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, severely impairs higher order cognitive and executive functions. The profound and widespread deactivation of the cortex in the unconscious states of NREM sleep or GA would be expected to produce an equivalent, or undoubtedly a much greater, disruptive effect on mnemonic and cognitive functions. In conclusion, we contend that the unconscious, severely altered state of the brain in NREM sleep would negate any possibility of cognitive processing in NREM sleep.</p>

<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a key component of the basal ganglia circuitry, receives inputs from broad cerebral cortical areas and relays cortical activity to subcortical structures. Recent human and animal studies have suggested that executive function, which is assumed to consist of a set of different cognitive processes for controlling behavior, depends on precise information processing between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures, leading to the idea that the STN contains neurons that transmit the information required for cognitive processing through their activity, and is involved in such cognitive control directly and dynamically. On the other hand, the STN activity also affects intracellular signal transduction and gene expression profiles influencing plasticity in other basal ganglia components. The STN may also indirectly contribute to information processing for cognitive control in other brain areas by regulating slower signaling mechanisms. However, the precise correspondence and causal relationship between the STN activity and cognitive processes are not fully understood. To address how the STN activity is involved in cognitive processes for controlling behavior, we applied Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic manipulation of neural activity to behavioral analysis using a touchscreen operant platform. We subjected mice selectively expressing DREADD receptors in the STN neurons to a five-choice serial reaction time task, which has been developed to quantitatively measure executive function. Chemogenetic suppression of the STN activity reversibly impaired attention, especially required under highly demanding conditions, and increased impulsivity but not compulsivity. These findings, taken together with the results of previous lesion studies, suggest that the STN activity, directly and indirectly, participates in cognitive processing for controlling behavior, and dynamically regulates specific types of subprocesses in cognitive control probably through fast synaptic transmission.</p>

<p>Background: Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) portends a low probability of recovery, especially in the most severe subset of motor-complete injuries. Active spinal cord stimulation with or without intensive locomotor training has been reported to restore movement after traumatic SCI. Only three cases have been reported where participants developed restored volitional movement with active stimulation turned off after a period of chronic stimulation and only after intensive rehabilitation with locomotor training. It is unknown whether restoration of movement without stimulation is possible after stimulation alone.</p><p>Objective: We describe the development of spontaneous volitional movement (SVM) without active stimulation in a subset of participants in the Epidural Stimulation After Neurologic Damage (ESTAND) trial, in which locomotor training is not prescribed as part of the study protocol, and subject’s rehabilitation therapies are not modified.</p><p>Methods: Volitional movement was evaluated with the Brain Motor Control Assessment using sEMG recordings and visual examination at baseline and at follow-up visits with and without stimulation. Additional functional assessment with a motor-assisted bicycle exercise at follow-up with and without stimulation identified generated work with and without effort.</p><p>Results: The first seven participants had ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) A or B thoracic SCI, a mean age of 42 years, and 7.7 years post-injury on average. Four patients developed evidence of sustained volitional movement, even in the absence of active stimulation after undergoing chronic epidural spinal cord stimulation (eSCS). Significant increases in volitional power were found between those observed to spontaneously move without stimulation and those unable (p &lt; 0.0005). The likelihood of recovery of spontaneous volitional control was correlated with spasticity scores prior to the start of eSCS therapy (p = 0.048). Volitional power progressively improved over time (p = 0.016). Additionally, cycling was possible without stimulation (p &lt; 0.005).</p><p>Conclusion: While some SVM after eSCS has been reported in the literature, this study demonstrates sustained restoration without active stimulation after long-term eSCS stimulation in chronic and complete SCI in a subset of participants. This finding supports previous studies suggesting that “complete” SCI is likely not as common as previously believed, if it exists at all in the absence of transection and that preserved pathways are substrates for eSCS-mediated recovery in clinically motor-complete SCI.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03026816.</p>

<p>Deciphering useful information from electrophysiological data recorded from the brain, in-vivo or in-vitro, is dependent on the capability to analyse spike patterns efficiently and accurately. The spike analysis mechanisms are heavily reliant on the clustering algorithms that enable separation of spike trends based on their spatio-temporal behaviors. Literature review report several clustering algorithms over decades focused on different applications. Although spike analysis algorithms employ only a small subset of clustering algorithms, however, not much work has been reported on the compliance and suitability of such clustering algorithms for spike analysis. In our study, we have attempted to comment on the suitability of available clustering algorithms and performance capacity when exposed to spike analysis. In this regard, the study reports a compatibility evaluation on algorithms previously employed in spike sorting as well as the algorithms yet to be investigated for application in sorting neural spikes. The performance of the algorithms is compared in terms of their accuracy, confusion matrix and accepted validation indices. Three data sets comprising of easy, difficult, and real spike similarity with known ground-truth are chosen for assessment, ensuring a uniform testbed. The procedure also employs two feature-sets, principal component analysis and wavelets. The report also presents a statistical score scheme to evaluate the performance individually and overall. The open nature of the data sets, the clustering algorithms and the evaluation criteria make the proposed evaluation framework widely accessible to the research community. We believe that the study presents a reference guide for emerging neuroscientists to select the most suitable algorithms for their spike analysis requirements.</p>

<p>Protocadherins (Pcdhs) are cell adhesion molecules that belong to the cadherin superfamily, and are subdivided into clustered (cPcdhs) and non-clustered Pcdhs (ncPcdhs) in vertebrates. In this review, we summarize their discovery, expression mechanisms, and roles in neuronal development and cancer, thereby highlighting the context-dependent nature of their actions. We furthermore provide an extensive overview of current structural knowledge, and its implications concerning extracellular interactions between cPcdhs, ncPcdhs, and classical cadherins. Next, we survey the known molecular action mechanisms of Pcdhs, emphasizing the regulatory functions of proteolytic processing and domain shedding. In addition, we outline the importance of Pcdh intracellular domains in the regulation of downstream signaling cascades, and we describe putative Pcdh interactions with intracellular molecules including components of the WAVE complex, the Wnt pathway, and apoptotic cascades. Our overview combines molecular interaction data from different contexts, such as neural development and cancer. This comprehensive approach reveals potential common Pcdh signaling hubs, and points out future directions for research. Functional studies of such key factors within the context of neural development might yield innovative insights into the molecular etiology of Pcdh-related neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<p>Background: Altered white matter connectivity, as evidenced by pervasive microstructural changes in myelination and axonal integrity in neuroimaging studies, has been implicated in the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental conditions such as schizophrenia. Despite an increasing appreciation that such white matter disconnectivity is linked to social behavior deficits, virtually no etiologically meaningful myelin-related genes have been identified in oligodendrocytes, the key myelinating cells in the CNS, to furnish an account on the causes. The impact of neurodevelopmental perturbations during pregnancy such as maternal immune activation (MIA) on these genes in memory-related neural networks has not been experimentally scrutinized.</p><p>Methods: In this study, a mouse model of MIA by the viral dsRNA analog poly(I:C) was employed to mimic the effects of inflammation during pregnancy. Transcriptional expression levels of selected myelin- or oligodendroglia-related genes implicated in schizophrenia or ASD development were analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with brain samples from MIA and control groups. The analysis focused on SOX-10 (SRY-related HMG-box 10), MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein), and Tf (transferrin) expression in the hippocampus and the surrounding memory-related cortical regions in either hemisphere.</p><p>Results: Specifically, ISH reveals that in the brain of prenatal poly(I:C)-exposed mouse offspring in the MIA model (gestation day 9), mRNA expression of the genes SOX10, MAG and Tf were generally reduced in the limbic system including the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex and parahippocampal gyrus on either side of the hemispheres. qRT-PCR further confirms the reduction of SOX10, MAG, and Tf expression in the medial prefrontal cortex, sensory cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus.</p><p>Conclusions: Our present results provide direct evidence that prenatal exposure to poly(I:C) elicits profound and long-term changes in transcript level and spatial distribution of myelin-related genes in multiple neocortical and limbic regions, notably the hippocampus and its surrounding memory-related neural networks. Our work demonstrates the potential utility of oligodendroglia-related genes as biomarkers for modeling neurodevelopmental disorders, in agreement with the hypothesis that MIA during pregnancy could lead to compromised white matter connectivity in ASD.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS) that currently does not have any effective treatment. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is often employed as a model to mimic the clinical manifestations of MS, mainly CNS demyelination. Coagulation is known to participate in crosstalk with inflammation and autoimmunity. We herein explored the correlation between the coagulation cascade and CNS immune diseases in vitro using primary astrocytes isolated from mice and in vivo using a mouse model of EAE. We showed that dabigatran, a clinical oral anti-coagulant drug, suppressed the thrombin-induced activation of astrocytes, and the underlying mechanisms are related to the activity of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and sphingosine kinases (SphKs). Importantly, dabigatran effectively recovered neurological function, reduced inflammation in the spinal cord, and prevented spinal cord demyelination caused by EAE. We suggest that dabigatran, a specific inhibitor of thrombin, antagonized the effect of thrombin in astrocytes by limiting the activation of PAR-1, in turn downregulating SphK1 and disrupting S1P receptor signaling. These findings reveal critical information about the relationship between coagulation mechanisms and CNS immune diseases and will contribute to the clinical translation and development of therapeutic strategies against MS.</p>

<p>Neurons extend long processes known as axons and dendrites, through which they communicate with each other. The neuronal circuits formed by the axons and dendrites are the structural basis of higher brain functions. The formation and maintenance of these processes are essential for physiological brain activities. Membrane components, both lipids, and proteins, that are required for process formation are supplied by vesicle transport. Intracellular membrane trafficking is regulated by a family of Rab small GTPases. A group of Rabs regulating endosomal trafficking has been studied mainly in nonpolarized culture cell lines, and little is known about their regulation in polarized neurons with long processes. As shown in our recent study, lemur tail (former tyrosine) kinase 1 (LMTK1), an as yet uncharacterized Ser/Thr kinase associated with Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, modulates the formation of axons, dendrites, and spines in cultured primary neurons. LMTK1 knockdown or knockout (KO) or the expression of a kinase-negative mutant stimulates the transport of endosomal vesicles in neurons, leading to the overgrowth of axons, dendrites, and spines. More recently, we found that LMTK1 regulates TBC1D9B Rab11 GAP and proposed the Cdk5/p35-LMTK1-TBC1D9B-Rab11 pathway as a signaling cascade that regulates endosomal trafficking. Here, we summarize the biochemical, cell biological, and physiological properties of LMTK1.</p>

<p>M/K<sub>v</sub>7 potassium channels play a key role in regulation of neuronal excitability. Modulation of neuronal excitability of primary sensory neurons determines the itch sensation induced by a variety of itch-causing substances including chloroquine (CQ). In the present study, we demonstrate that suppression of M/K<sub>v</sub>7 channel activity contributes to generation of itch in mice. CQ enhances excitability of the primary sensory neurons through inhibiting M/K<sub>v</sub>7 potassium currents in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-dependent manner. Specific M/K<sub>v</sub>7 channel opener retigabine (RTG) or tannic acid (TA) not only reverses the CQ-induced enhancement of neuronal excitability but also suppresses the CQ-induced itch behavior. Systemic application of RTG or TA also significantly inhibits the itch behavior induced by a variety of pruritogens. Taken together, our findings provide novel insight into the molecular basis of CQ-induced itch sensation in mammals that can be applied to the development of strategies to mitigate itch behavior.</p>

Introduction<p>Ketamine, which is widely used in anesthesia, can induce cortical neurotoxicity in patients. This study aims to investigate the effects of long non-coding RNA LINC00641 on the ketamine-induced neural injury.</p>Materials and Methods<p>In this study, rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) were used as a cell model and Sprague–Dawley postnatal day 7 rats were used for experiments in vivo. Ketamine-induced aberrant expression levels of LINC00641, miR-497-5p and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were examined by qRT-PCR. The effects of LINC00641 and miR-497-5p on ketamine-induced neural injury were then examined by MTT assays and TUNEL analysis. In addition, the activity of ROS and caspase-3 was measured. The regulatory relationships between LINC00641 and miR-497-5p, miR-497-5p and BDNF were detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay, respectively.</p>Results<p>Ketamine induced the apoptosis of PC12 cells, accompanied by down-regulation of LINC00641 and BDNF, and up-regulation of miR-497-5p. LINC00641 overexpression enhanced the resistance to the apoptosis of PC12 cells, while transfection of miR-497-5p had opposite effects. Furthermore, LINC00641 could bind to miR-497-5p and reduce its expression, but indirectly increase the BDNF expression, which was considered as a protective factor in neural injury and activated TrkB/PI3K/Akt pathway.</p>Conclusion<p>Collectively, LINC00641/miR-497-5p/BDNF axis was validated to be an important signaling pathway in modulating ketamine-induced neural injury.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly with a pathogenesis that remains unclear. We aimed to explore its pathogenesis through plasma integrated metabolomics and proteomics analysis. The clinical data of consecutively recruited PD patients and healthy controls were assessed. Fasting plasma samples were obtained and analyzed using metabolomics and proteomics methods. After that, differentially expressed metabolites and proteins were identified for further bioinformatics analysis. No significant difference was found in the clinical data between these two groups. Eighty-three metabolites were differentially expressed in PD patients identified by metabolomics analysis. These metabolites were predominately lipid and lipid-like molecules (63%), among which 25% were sphingolipids. The sphingolipid metabolism pathway was enriched and tended to be activated in the following KEGG pathway analysis. According to the proteomics analysis, forty proteins were identified to be differentially expressed, seven of which were apolipoproteins. Furthermore, five of the six top ranking Gene Ontology terms from cellular components and eleven of the other fourteen Gene Ontology terms from biological processes were directly associated with lipid metabolism. In KEGG pathway analysis, the five enriched pathways were also significantly related with lipid metabolism (p &lt; 0.05). Overall, Parkinson’s disease is associated with plasma lipid metabolic disturbance, including an activated sphingolipid metabolism and decreased apolipoproteins.</p>

<p>All people experience aging, and the related physical and health changes, including changes in memory and brain function. These changes may become debilitating leading to an increase in dependence as people get older. Many external aids and tools have been developed to allow older adults and elderly patients to continue to live normal and comfortable lives. This mini-review describes some of the recent studies on cognitive decline and motor control impairment with the goal of advancing non-invasive brain computer interface (BCI) technologies to improve health and wellness of older adults and elderly patients. First, we describe the state of the art in cognitive prosthetics for psychiatric diseases. Then, we describe the state of the art of possible assistive BCI applications for controlling an exoskeleton, a wheelchair and smart home for elderly people with motor control impairments. The basic age-related brain and body changes, the effects of age on cognitive and motor abilities, and several BCI paradigms with typical tasks and outcomes are thoroughly described. We also discuss likely future trends and technologies to assist healthy older adults and elderly patients using innovative BCI applications with minimal technical oversight.</p>

Background<p>Distinct tissue types are differentiated based on the surgeon’s knowledge and subjective visible information, typically assisted with white-light intraoperative imaging systems. Narrow-band imaging (NBI) assists in tissue identification and enables automated classifiers, but many anatomical details moderate computational predictions and cause bias. In particular, tissues’ light-source-dependent optical characteristics, anatomical location, and potentially hazardous microstructural changes such as peeling have been overlooked in previous literature.</p>Methods<p>Narrow-band images of five (n = 5) facial nerves (FNs) and internal carotid arteries (ICAs) were captured from freshly frozen temporal bones. The FNs were split into intracranial and intratemporal samples, and ICAs’ adventitia was peeled from the distal end. Three-dimensional (3D) spectral data were captured by a custom-built liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) spectral imaging (SI) system. We investigated the normal variance between the samples and utilized descriptive and machine learning analysis on the image stack hypercubes.</p>Results<p>Reflectance between intact and peeled arteries in lower-wavelength domains between 400 and 576 nm was significantly different (p &lt; 0.05). Proximal FN could be differentiated from distal FN in a higher range, 490–720 nm (p &lt; 0.001). ICA with intact tunica differed from proximal FN nearly thorough the VIS range, 412–592 nm (p &lt; 0.001) and 664–720 nm (p &lt; 0.05) as did its distal counterpart, 422–720 nm (p &lt; 0.001). The availed U-Net algorithm classified 90.93% of the pixels correctly in comparison to tissue margins delineated by a specialist.</p>Conclusion<p>Selective NBI represents a promising method for assisting tissue identification and computational segmentation of surgical microanatomy. Further multidisciplinary research is required for its clinical applications and intraoperative integration.</p>

<p>Closed-loop control strategies for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease offer the potential to provide more effective control of patient symptoms and fewer side effects than continuous stimulation, while reducing battery consumption. Most of the closed-loop methods proposed and tested to-date rely on controller parameters, such as controller gains, that remain constant over time. While the controller may operate effectively close to the operating point for which it is set, providing benefits when compared to conventional open-loop DBS, it may perform sub-optimally if the operating conditions evolve. Such changes may result from, for example, diurnal variation in symptoms, disease progression or changes in the properties of the electrode-tissue interface. In contrast, an adaptive or “self-tuning” control mechanism has the potential to accommodate slowly varying changes in system properties over a period of days, months, or years. Such an adaptive mechanism would automatically adjust the controller parameters to maintain the desired performance while limiting side effects, despite changes in the system operating point. In this paper, two neural modeling approaches are utilized to derive and test an adaptive control scheme for closed-loop DBS, whereby the gain of a feedback controller is continuously adjusted to sustain suppression of pathological beta-band oscillatory activity at a desired target level. First, the controller is derived based on a simplified firing-rate model of the reciprocally connected subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GPe). Its efficacy is shown both when pathological oscillations are generated endogenously within the STN-GPe network and when they arise in response to exogenous cortical STN inputs. To account for more realistic biological features, the control scheme is then tested in a physiologically detailed model of the cortical basal ganglia network, comprised of individual conductance-based spiking neurons, and simulates the coupled DBS electric field and STN local field potential. Compared to proportional feedback methods without gain adaptation, the proposed adaptive controller was able to suppress beta-band oscillations with less power consumption, even as the properties of the controlled system evolve over time due to alterations in the target for beta suppression, beta fluctuations and variations in the electrode impedance.</p>

<p>Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, immune-mediated inflammatory peripheral polyneuropathy that is characterized by flaccid paralysis. A few cases have reported that GBS can be caused by head trauma or neurosurgery, but it has never been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage. Here, we report an uncommon case of fulminant GBS that occurred after spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage. A 73-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after sudden unconsciousness and vomiting. A head computed tomography (CT) scan following the incident showed a newly developed intraventricular hemorrhage, which led to an immediate ventriculostomy. After 5 days, the endotracheal tube was removed. Two days later, the external ventricular drainage tube was also removed. At this time, the patient was alert and the neurological examination was normal. However, the patient suddenly presented with acute respiratory failure and bilateral limb weakness 3 days later. An analysis of the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed that albuminocytologic dissociation was present. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/day) for 5 days. Despite timely medical intervention in the hospital, the patient passed away 2 months later. After a cerebral hemorrhagic injury, limb and respiratory muscle weakness can occur on occasion in the ICU. In this context, the potential involvement of GBS should not be ignored. Importantly, the pathogenic mechanism of GBS has been discussed for over a century, and it still remains a mystery. We speculate that the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of GBS following intraventricular hemorrhage. The prognosis of most patients with GBS is usually good, but cerebral hemorrhage and mechanical ventilation may serve as risk factors that exacerbate the condition. This case is reported to remind clinicians to consider the possibility of GBS when patients present limb and respiratory muscle weakness after intraventricular hemorrhage, and to provide a starting point to discuss potential mechanisms of GBS after intraventricular hemorrhage.</p>

<p>A growing number of brain imaging studies show functional connectivity (FC) between regions during emotional and cognitive tasks in humans. However, emotions are accompanied by changes in physiological parameters such as heart rate and respiration. These changes may affect blood oxygen level-dependent signals, as well as connectivity between brain areas. This study aimed to clarify the effects of physiological noise on the connectivity between areas related to the default mode network using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Healthy adult volunteers (age range: 19–51 years, mean age: 26.9 ± 9.1 years, 8 males and 8 females) underwent rs-fMRI for 10 min using a clinical 3T scanner (MAGNETOM Trio A Tim System, Siemens) with simultaneously recorded respiration and cardiac output. Physiological noise signals were subsequently removed from the acquired fMRI data using the DRIFTER toolbox. Image processing and analysis of the FC between areas related to the default mode network were performed using DPARSF. Network-Based Statistic (NBS) analysis of the functional connectome of the DMN and DMN-related area was used to perform three groups of comparison: without physiological noise correction, with cardiac noise correction, and with cardiac and respiratory noise correction. NBS analysis identified 36 networks with significant differences in three conditions in FC matrices. Post hoc comparison showed no differences between the three conditions, indicating that all three had the same networks. Among the 36 networks, strength of FC of 8 networks was modified under physiological noise correction. Connectivity between left and right anterior medial frontal regions increased strength of connectivity. These areas are located on the medial cerebral hemisphere, close to the sagittal sinus and arteries in the cerebral hemispheres, suggesting that medial frontal areas may be sensitive to cardiac rhythm close to arteries. The other networks observed temporal regions and showed a decrease in their connectivity strength by removing physiological noise, indicating that physiological noise, especially respiration, may be sensitive to BOLD signal in the temporal regions during resting state. Temporal lobe was highly correlated with anxiety-related respiration changes (Masaoka and Homma, 2000), speech processing, and respiratory sensation. These factors may affect the rs-fMRI signaling sensitivity.</p>

<p>Graph neural networks (GNN) rely on graph operations that include neural network training for various graph related tasks. Recently, several attempts have been made to apply the GNNs to functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) data. Despite recent progresses, a common limitation is its difficulty to explain the classification results in a neuroscientifically explainable way. Here, we develop a framework for analyzing the fMRI data using the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), which was recently proposed as a powerful GNN for graph classification. One of the important contributions of this paper is the observation that the GIN is a dual representation of convolutional neural network (CNN) in the graph space where the shift operation is defined using the adjacency matrix. This understanding enables us to exploit CNN-based saliency map techniques for the GNN, which we tailor to the proposed GIN with one-hot encoding, to visualize the important regions of the brain. We validate our proposed framework using large-scale resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data for classifying the sex of the subject based on the graph structure of the brain. The experiment was consistent with our expectation such that the obtained saliency map show high correspondence with previous neuroimaging evidences related to sex differences.</p>

<p>We investigated the effects of electric multi-pulse stimulation on electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (eABRs). Multi-pulses with a high burst rate of 10,000 pps were assembled from pulses of 45-μs phase duration. Conditions of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 pulses were investigated. Psychophysical thresholds (THRs) and most comfortable levels (MCLs) in multi-pulse conditions were measured. Psychophysical temporal integration functions (slopes of THRs/MCLs as a function of number of pulses) were −1.30 and −0.93 dB/doubling of the number of pulses, which correspond to the doubling of pulse duration. A total of 15 eABR conditions with different numbers of pulses and amplitudes were measured. The morphology of eABRs to multi-pulse stimuli did not differ from those to conventional single pulses. eABR wave eV amplitudes and latencies were analyzed extensively. At a fixed stimulation amplitude, an increasing number of pulses caused increasing wave eV amplitudes up to a certain, subject-dependent number of pulses. Then, amplitudes either saturated or even decreased. This contradicted the conventional amplitude growth functions and also contradicted psychophysical results. We showed that destructive interference could be a possible reason for such a finding, where peaks and troughs of responses to the first pulses were suppressed by those of successive pulses in the train. This study provides data on psychophysical THRs and MCLs and corresponding eABR responses for stimulation with single-pulse and multi-pulse stimuli with increasing duration. Therefore, it provides insights how pulse trains integrate at the level of the brainstem.</p>

<p>Molecular imaging of tauopathies is complicated by the differing specificities and off-target binding properties of available radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET). [<sup>18</sup>F]-APN-1607 ([<sup>18</sup>F]-PM-PBB3) is a newly developed PET tracer with promising properties for tau imaging. We aimed to characterize the cerebral binding of [<sup>18</sup>F]-APN-1607 in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients compared to normal control (NC) subjects. Therefore, we obtained static late frame PET recordings with [<sup>18</sup>F]-APN-1607 and [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD group, along with an age-matched NC group ([<sup>18</sup>F]-APN-1607 only). Using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and volume of interest (VOI) analyses of the reference region normalized standardized uptake value ratio maps, we then tested for group differences and relationships between both PET biomarkers, as well as their associations with clinical general cognition. In the AD group, [<sup>18</sup>F]-APN-1607 binding was elevated in widespread cortical regions (P &lt; 0.001 for VOI analysis, familywise error-corrected P &lt; 0.01 for SPM analysis). The regional uptake in AD patients correlated negatively with Mini-Mental State Examination score (frontal lobe: R = -0.632, P = 0.004; temporal lobe: R = -0.593, P = 0.008; parietal lobe: R = -0.552, P = 0.014; insula: R = -0.650, P = 0.003; cingulum: R = -0.665, P = 0.002) except occipital lobe (R = -0.417, P = 0.076). The hypometabolism to [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG PET in AD patients also showed negative correlations with regional [<sup>18</sup>F]-APN-1607 binding in some signature areas of AD (temporal lobe: R = -0.530, P = 0.020; parietal lobe: R = -0.637, P = 0.003; occipital lobe: R = -0.567, P = 0.011). In conclusion, our results suggested that [<sup>18</sup>F]-APN-1607 PET sensitively detected tau deposition in AD and that individual tauopathy correlated with impaired cerebral glucose metabolism and cognitive function.</p>

<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique that modulates the neuronal membrane potential. We have previously documented a sustainable increase in extracellular dopamine levels in the rat striatum of cathodal tDCS, suggesting that cathodal tDCS enhances the neuronal excitability of the cortex. In the present study, we investigated changes in neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex induced by tDCS at the point beneath the stimulus electrode in anesthetized rats in vivo. Multiunit recordings were performed to examine changes in neuronal activity before and after the application of tDCS. In the cathodal tDCS group, multiunit activity (indicating the collective firing rate of recorded neuronal populations) increased in the cerebral cortex. Both anodal and cathodal tDCS increased the firing rate of isolated single units in the cerebral cortex. Significant differences in activity were observed immediately following stimulation and persisted for more than an hour after stimulation. The primary finding of this study was that both anodal and cathodal tDCS increased in vivo neuronal activity in the rat cerebral cortex underneath the stimulus electrode.</p>

<p>The induction of synaptic plasticity requires the presence of temporally patterned neural activity. Numerous cellular studies in animals and brain slices have demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) enhances synaptic transmission, which can be evoked by high-frequency intermittent stimulation. In humans, plasticity processes underlying perceptual learning can be reliably induced by repetitive, LTP-like sensory stimulation. These protocols lead to improvement of perceptual abilities parallel to widespread remodeling of cortical processing. However, whether maintained rhythmic cortical activation induced by the LTP-like stimulation is also present during human perceptual learning experiments, remains elusive. To address this question, we here applied a 20 Hz intermittent stimulation protocol for 40 min to the index-, middle- and ring-fingers of the right hand, while continuously recording EEG over the hand representation in primary somatosensory cortex in young adult participants. We find that each train of stimulation initiates a transient series of sensory-evoked potentials which accumulate after about 500 ms into a 20 Hz steady-state response persisting over the entire period of the 2-s-train. During the inter-train interval, no consistent evoked activity can be detected. This response behavior is maintained over the whole 40 min of stimulation without any indication of habituation. However, the early stimulation evoked potentials (SEPs) and the event-related desynchronization (ERD) during the steady-state response change over the 40 min of stimulation. In a second experiment, we demonstrate in a separate cohort of participants that the here-applied pneumatic type of stimulation results in improvement of tactile acuity as typically observed for electrically applied 20 Hz intermittent stimulation. Our data demonstrate that repetitive stimulation using a 20 Hz protocol drives rhythmic activation in the hand representation of somatosensory cortex, which is sustained during the entire stimulation period. At the same time, cortical excitability increases as indicated by altered ERD and SEP amplitudes. Our results, together with previous data underlining the dependence of repetitive sensory stimulation effects on NMDA-receptor activation, support the view that repetitive sensory stimulation elicits LTP-like processes in the cortex, thereby facilitating perceptual learning processes.</p>

<p>Objectives: Evidence from animal studies suggests that aerobic exercise may promote neuroplasticity and could, therefore, provide therapeutic benefits for neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the effects of exercise in human CNS disorders on the topology of brain networks, which might serve as an outcome at the interface between biology and clinical performance, remain poorly understood.</p><p>Methods: We investigated functional and structural networks in patients with relapsing-remitting MS in a clinical trial of standardized aerobic exercise. Fifty-seven patients were randomly assigned to moderate-intensity exercise for 3 months or a non-exercise control group. We reconstructed functional networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and used probabilistic tractography on diffusion-weighted imaging data for structural networks.</p><p>Results: At baseline, compared to 30 healthy controls, patients exhibited decreased structural connectivity that was most pronounced in hub regions of the brain. Vice versa, functional connectivity was increased in hubs. After 3 months, we observed hub independent increased functional connectivity in the exercise group while the control group presented a loss of functional hub connectivity. On a structural level, the control group remained unchanged, while the exercise group had also increased connectivity. Increased clustering of hubs indicates a better structural integration and internal connectivity at the top of the network hierarchy.</p><p>Conclusion: Increased functional connectivity of hubs contrasts a loss of structural connectivity in relapsing-remitting MS. Under an exercise condition, a further hub independent increase of functional connectivity seems to translate in higher structural connectivity of the whole brain.</p>

<p>Mental rotation (MR) is a cognitive skill whose neural dynamics are still a matter of debate as previous neuroimaging studies have produced controversial results. In order to investigate the underlying neurophysiology of MR, hemodynamic responses from the prefrontal cortex of 14 healthy subjects were recorded with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a novel MR task that had three categorical difficulty levels. Hemodynamic activity strength (HAS) parameter, which reflects the ratio of brain activation during the task to the baseline activation level, was used to assess the prefrontal cortex activation localization and strength. Behavioral data indicated that the MR requiring conditions are more difficult than the condition that did not require MR. The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was found to be active in all conditions and to be the dominant region in the easiest task while more complex tasks showed widespread bilateral prefrontal activation. A significant increase in left DLPFC activation was observed with increasing task difficulty. Significantly higher right DLPFC activation was observed when the incongruent trials were contrasted against the congruent trials, which implied the possibility of a robust error or conflict-monitoring process during the incongruent trials. Our results showed that the right DLPFC is a core region for the processing of MR tasks regardless of the task complexity and that the left DLPFC is involved to a greater extent with increasing task complexity, which is consistent with the previous neuroimaging literature.</p>

<p>Cortical oscillations serve as an index of both sensory and cognitive processes and represent one of the most promising candidates for training and targeting the top-down mechanisms underlying executive functions. Research findings suggest that theta (θ) oscillations (3–7 Hz) recorded over frontal-midline electrodes are broadly associated with a number of higher-order cognitive processes and may serve as the mechanistic backbone for cognitive control. Frontal-midline theta (FMθ) oscillations have also been shown to inversely correlate with activity in the default mode network (DMN), a network in the brain linked to spontaneous thought processes such as mind-wandering and rumination. In line with these findings, we previously observed increased FMθ oscillations in expert meditation practitioners during reported periods of focused-attention meditation practice when compared to periods of mind-wandering. In an effort to narrow the explanatory gap by directly connecting observed neurophysiological activity in the brain to the phenomenological nature of reported experience, we designed a methodologically novel and adaptive neurofeedback protocol with the aim of modulating FMθ while having meditation novice participants implement breath-focus strategies derived from focused-attention mediation practices. Participants who received eight sessions of the adaptive FMθ-meditation neurofeedback protocol were able to significantly modulate FMθ over frontal electrodes using focused-attention meditation strategies relative to their baseline by the end of the training and demonstrated significantly faster reaction times on correct trials during the n-back working memory task assessed before and after the FMθ-meditation neurofeedback protocol. No significant differences in frontal theta activity or behavior were observed in the active control participants who received age and gender matched sham neurofeedback. These findings help lay the groundwork for the development of brain training protocols and neurofeedback applications that aim to train features of the mental states and traits associated with focused-attention meditation.</p>

<p>Disrupted cortical neural inhibition has been hypothesized to be a primary contributor to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This hypothesis predicts that ASD will be associated with an increase in neural responses. We tested this prediction by comparing fMRI response magnitudes to simultaneous visual, auditory, and motor stimulation in ASD and neurotypical (NT) individuals. No increases in the initial transient response in any brain region were observed in ASD, suggesting that there is no increase in overall cortical neural excitability. Most notably, there were widespread fMRI magnitude increases in the ASD response following stimulation offset, approximately 6–8 s after the termination of sensory and motor stimulation. In some regions, the higher fMRI offset response in ASD could be attributed to a lack of an “undershoot”—an often observed feature of fMRI responses believed to reflect inhibitory processing. Offset response magnitude was associated with reaction times (RT) in the NT group and may explain an overall reduced RT in the ASD group. Overall, our results suggest that increases in neural responsiveness are present in ASD but are confined to specific components of the neural response, are particularly strong following stimulation offset, and are linked to differences in RT.</p>

<p>Previous studies have investigated the developmental differences of semantic processing regarding brain activation between adults and children. However, little is known about whether the patterns of structural connectivity and effective connectivity differ between adults and children during semantic processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to study the developmental differences of brain activation, structural connectivity, and effective connectivity during semantic judgments. Twenty-six children (8- to 12-year-olds) and 26 adults were asked to indicate if character pairs were related in meaning. Compared to children, adults showed greater activation in the left ventral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Also, adults had significantly greater structural connectivity in the left ventral pathway (inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, IFOF) than children. Moreover, adults showed significantly stronger bottom-up effects from left fusiform gyrus (FG) to ventral IFG than children in the related condition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that age-related increases in brain activation (ventral IFG and MTG), IFOF, and effective connectivity (from FG to ventral IFG) might be associated with the bottom-up influence of orthographic representations on retrieving semantic representations for processing Chinese characters.</p>

<p>Common spatial pattern (CSP) method is widely used for spatial filtering and brain pattern extraction from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The participant-specific time window relative to the visual cue has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the CSP. However, the time window is usually selected experientially or manually. To solve this problem, we propose a novel feature selection approach for MI-based BCIs. Specifically, multiple time segments were obtained by decomposing each EEG sample of the MI task. Furthermore, the features were extracted by CSP from each time segment and were combined to form a new feature vector. Finally, the optimal temporal combination patterns for the new feature vector were selected based on four feature selection algorithms, i.e., mutual information, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, principal component analysis and stepwise linear discriminant analysis (denoted as MUIN, LASSO, PCA, and SWLDA, respectively), and the classification algorithm was employed to evaluate the average classification accuracy. With three BCI competition datasets, the results of the four proposed algorithms were compared with traditional CSP algorithm in classification accuracy. Experimental results show that compared with traditional algorithm, the proposed methods significantly improve performance. Specifically, the LASSO achieved the highest accuracy (88.58%) among the proposed methods. Importantly, the average classification accuracies using the proposed approaches significantly improved 10.14% (MUIN), 11.40% (LASSO), 6.08% (PCA), and 10.25% (SWLDA) compared to that using CSP. These results indicate that the proposed approach is expected to be practical in MI-based BCIs.</p>

<p>Individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) exhibit neurological deficits associated with brain injury including smaller brain volumes. Additional risk factors such as lower socioeconomic status (SES) may also have an impact on brain development for this population. This study examined how brain volumes are related to SES in both neurotypically developing children and adolescents, and those with PAE. 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE images were acquired from 69 participants with PAE (13.0 ± 3.2 years, range 7.1–18.8 years, 49% female) and 70 neurotypical controls (12.4 ± 2.9 years, range 7.0–18.5 years, 60% female) from four scanning sites in Canada. SES scores calculated using Hollingshead’s Four-Factor Index of Social Status from current caregiver placement were not significantly different between groups, though more children with PAE had lower SES scores compared to controls. Psychometric data comprised 14 cognitive measures, including executive functioning, attention and working memory, memory, math/numerical ability, and word reading. All cognitive scores were significantly worse in children with PAE compared to controls, though SES was not correlated with cognitive scores in either group after correction for multiple comparisons. All 13 brain volumes were smaller in children with PAE compared to children in the control group. Higher SES was associated with larger hippocampus and amygdala volumes in controls, but there were no such associations in children with PAE. Direct evaluation of the interaction between SES and diagnostic group did not show a significant differential impact of SES on these structures. These findings support previous links between SES and brain volumes in neurotypically developing children, but the lack of such a relationship with SES in children with PAE may be due to the markedly smaller brain volumes resulting from the initial brain injury and postpartum brain development, regardless of later SES.</p>

The aim of this study was to determine the activity of the brain cortex of children with AOB at rest and during phonation and deglutition and to evaluate the association of intelligence quotient (IQ), attention (Test of Variables of Attention, known as TOVA), beats per minute (BPM), and oxygen saturation measurement (SpO<sub>2</sub>) with brain activity in subjects with AOB. Fourteen children (seven with AOB and seven without AOB) with mixed dentition, aged 10–13 years, underwent an IQ test, TOVA, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). Electrodes were set in the scalp, according to the 10–20 protocol. Data were analyzed using statistical tests to assess comparisons between children with and without AOB. The results showed that IQ, TOVA, SpO<sub>2</sub>, or BPM did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups, except for the response time (contained in TOVA) (p = 0.03). Significant differences were found for the brain activity during rest (Condition 1) of the tongue, between children with and without AOB (p &lt; 0.05 for alpha/theta and alpha peaks), whereas there were no differences during function (Condition 2). The findings of this investigation provide insights about the cortex activity of the brain while the tongue is in the resting position in children with AOB. This may imply an altered activity of the brain cortex, which should be considered when diagnosing and treating AOB. Other diagnostic techniques derived from investigations based on neuroscience could develop new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques to give better solutions to children with malocclusions. Treatments should be focused not only on the teeth but also on the brain cortex.</p>

<p>Normative models of neural computation offer simplified yet lucid mathematical descriptions of murky biological phenomena. Previously, online Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to model a network of single-compartment neurons accounting for weighted summation of upstream neural activity in the soma and Hebbian/anti-Hebbian synaptic learning rules. However, synaptic plasticity in biological neurons often depends on the integration of synaptic currents over a dendritic compartment rather than total current in the soma. Motivated by this observation, we model a pyramidal neuronal network using online Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Given two related datasets represented by distal and proximal dendritic inputs, CCA projects them onto the subspace which maximizes the correlation between their projections. First, adopting a normative approach and starting from a single-channel CCA objective function, we derive an online gradient-based optimization algorithm whose steps can be interpreted as the operation of a pyramidal neuron. To model networks of pyramidal neurons, we introduce a novel multi-channel CCA objective function, and derive from it an online gradient-based optimization algorithm whose steps can be interpreted as the operation of a pyramidal neuron network including its architecture, dynamics, and synaptic learning rules. Next, we model a neuron with more than two dendritic compartments by deriving its operation from a known objective function for multi-view CCA. Finally, we confirm the functionality of our networks via numerical simulations. Overall, our work presents a simplified but informative abstraction of learning in a pyramidal neuron network, and demonstrates how such networks can integrate multiple sources of inputs.</p>

<p>The comorbidity of depression and addiction has become a serious public health issue, and the relationship between these two disorders and their potential mechanisms has attracted extensive attention. Numerous studies have suggested that depression and addiction share common mechanisms and anatomical pathways. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has long been considered a key brain region for regulating many behaviors, especially those related to depression and addiction. In this review article, we focus on the association between addiction and depression, highlighting the potential mediating role of the NAc in this comorbidity via the regulation of changes in the neural circuits and molecular signaling. To clarify the mechanisms underlying this association, we summarize evidence from overlapping reward neurocircuitry, the resemblance of cellular and molecular mechanisms, and common treatments. Understanding the interplay between these disorders should help guide clinical comorbidity prevention and the search for a new target for comorbidity treatment.</p>

<p>In vivo loose patch and breakthrough whole-cell recordings are useful tools for investigating the intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons. However, the correlation among pipette resistance, seal condition, and recording time is not thoroughly clear. Presently, we investigated the recording time of different pipette resistances and seal conditions in loose patch and breakthrough whole-cell recordings. The recording time did not change with pipette resistance for loose patch recording (R<sub>p</sub>-loose) and first increased and then decreased as seal resistance for loose patch recording (R<sub>s</sub>-loose) increased. For a high probability of a recording time ≥30 min, the low and high cutoff values of R<sub>s</sub>-loose were 21.5 and 36 MΩ, respectively. For neurons with R<sub>s</sub>-loose values of 21.5–36 MΩ, the action potential (AP) amplitudes changed slightly 30 min after the seal. The recording time increased as seal resistance for whole-cell recording (R<sub>s</sub>-tight) increased and the zero-current membrane potential for breakthrough whole-cell recording (MP<sub>zero-current</sub>) decreased. For a high probability of a recording time ≥30 min, the cutoff values of R<sub>s</sub>-tight and MP<sub>zero-current</sub> were 2.35 GΩ and −53.5 mV, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of the MP<sub>zero-current</sub> receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was larger than that of the R<sub>s</sub>-tight ROC curve. For neurons with MP<sub>zero-current</sub> values ≤ −53.5 mV, the inhibitory or excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes did not show significant changes 30 min after the seal. In neurons with R<sub>s</sub>-tight values ≥2.35 GΩ, the recording time gradually increased and then decreased as the pipette resistance for whole-cell recording (R<sub>p</sub>-tight) increased. For the high probability of a recording time ≥30 min, the low and high cutoff values of R<sub>p</sub>-tight were 6.15 and 6.45 MΩ, respectively. Together, we concluded that the optimal R<sub>s</sub>-loose range is 21.5–36 MΩ, the optimal R<sub>p</sub>-tight range is 6.15–6.45 MΩ, and the optimal R<sub>s</sub>-tight and MP<sub>zero-current</sub> values are ≥2.35 GΩ and ≤ −53.5 mV, respectively. Compared with R<sub>s</sub>-tight, the MP<sub>zero-current</sub> value can more accurately discriminate recording times ≥30 min and &lt;30 min.</p>

<p>Myelomeningocele (MMC) is the most common congenital defect of the central nervous system and results in devastating and lifelong disability. In MMC, the initial failure of neural tube closure early in gestation is followed by a progressive prenatal injury to the exposed spinal cord, which contributes to the deterioration of neurological function in fetuses. Prenatal strategies to control the spinal cord injury offer an appealing therapeutic approach to improve neurological function, although the definitive pathophysiological mechanisms of injury remain to be fully elucidated. A better understanding of these mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level is of paramount importance for the development of targeted prenatal MMC therapies to minimize or eliminate the effects of the injury and improve neurological function. In this review article, we discuss the pathological development of MMC with a focus on in utero injury to the exposed spinal cord. We emphasize the need for a better understanding of the causative factors in MMC spinal cord injury, pathophysiological alterations associated with the injury, and cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these alterations are induced.</p>

<p>Using a rat model of trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) produced by chronic compression of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION), we investigated the analgesic effect and the underlying mechanisms of ceftriaxone (Cef), a β-lactam antibiotic, that is thought to be a potent stimulator of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1). First, repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of Cef (200 mg/kg) for 5-days since Day 1 of CCI-ION could significantly relieve both mechanical and thermal pain hypersensitivity from day 10 after drug administration. Western blot and immunofluorescent results demonstrated that 5-days administration of Cef resulted in the restoration of GLT-1 expression to a level equivalent to the sham control which was dramatically lost under the TNP condition. Moreover, multi-electrode (8 × 8) array recordings of network field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were performed on the acutely dissociated medullary dorsal horn slice evoked by electrical stimulation of the trigeminal spinal tract. The results showed that the increased number of fEPSPs, induction rate, and maintenance of long-term potentiation caused by CCI-ION were significantly suppressed by 5-days administration of Cef. Taken together, the results indicate that Cef can relieve TNP through suppression of spatiotemporal synaptic plasticity via GLT-1 restoration in the medullary dorsal horn of the trigeminal nerve.</p>

<p>Aging is one of the most important risk factors for the development of several neurodegenerative diseases including progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Cellular senescence (CS) is a key biological process underlying aging. Several stressors associated with aging and MS pathology, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cytokines and replicative exhaustion are known triggers of cellular senescence. Senescent cells exhibit stereotypical metabolic and functional changes, which include cell-cycle arrest and acquiring a pro-inflammatory phenotype secreting cytokines, growth factors, metalloproteinases and reactive oxygen species. They accumulate with aging and can convert neighboring cells to senescence in a paracrine manner. In MS, accelerated cellular senescence may drive disease progression by promoting chronic non-remitting inflammation, loss or altered immune, glial and neuronal function, failure of remyelination, impaired blood-brain barrier integrity and ultimately neurodegeneration. Here we discuss the evidence linking cellular senescence to the pathogenesis of MS and the putative role of senolytic and senomorphic agents as neuroprotective therapies in tackling disease progression.</p>

<p>In bivalves neurotransmitters are involved in a variety of behaviors, but their diversity and distribution in the nervous system of these organisms remains somewhat unclear. Here, we first examined immunohistochemically the distributions of neurons containing different neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and related enzymes, as well as the proliferative status of neurons in the ganglia of the mussel Crenomytilus grayanus. H-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRFamide), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were found to be expressed by neurons in all the ganglia, whereas serotonin (5-HT) neurons were found only in the cerebropleural and pedal, but not visceral ganglia. Moreover, incubation of living mussels in the presence of a 5-HT precursor (5-HTP) confirmed the absence of 5-HT-containing neurons from the visceral ganglia, indicating that the “serotonin center” of the visceral nervous system is located in the cerebral ganglia. Furthermore, immunostaining of molecules related to neurotransmission together with α-acetylated tubulin demonstrated that this cytoskeletal protein may be a potential pan-neuronal marker in bivalves. Adult mussel neurons do not proliferate, but a population of proliferating PCNA-LIP cells which do not express any of the neurotransmitters examined, perhaps glia cells, was detected in the ganglia. These novel findings suggest that the nervous system of bivalves contains a broad variety of signal molecules most likely involved in the regulation of different physiological and behavioral processes. In addition, proliferating cells may maintain and renew glial cells and neurons throughout the lives of bivalves.</p>

<p>Background: Age is an important factor that impacts the variability of tDCS effects.</p><p>Objective/Hypothesis: To compare effects of anodal (a)-tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and primary motor cortex (M1) in adolescents, adults, and elderly on heat pain threshold (HPT; primary outcome) and the working memory (WM; secondary outcome). We hypothesized that the effect of tDCS on HPT and WM performance would be the largest in adolescents because their pre-frontal cortex is more prone to neuroplasticity.</p><p>Methods: We included 30 healthy women within the age ranges of 15–16 (adolescents, n = 10), 30–40 (adults, n = 10), and 60–70 (elderly, n = 10) years. In this crossover single-blinded study, participants received three interventions applied over the DLPF and M1. The active stimulation intensity was two mA for 30 min. From 20 min of stimulation onset, the tDCS session was coupled with an online n-back task. The a-tDCS and sham were applied in a random sequence, with a washout time of a minimum 7 days between each trial. HPT was evaluated before and after stimulation. The WM performance with an n-back task was assessed after the tDCS session.</p><p>Results: A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model revealed a significant effect of the a-tDCS over the left DLPFC to reduce the HPT in adolescents compared with sham. It increased the pain perception significantly [a large effect size (ES) of 1.09)]. In the adults, a-tDCS over M1 enhanced the HPT significantly (a large ES of 1.25) compared to sham. No significant effect for HPT was found in the elderly. Response time for hits was reduced for a-tDCS over the DLPFC in adolescents, as compared to the other two age groups.</p><p>Conclusions: These findings suggest that a-tDCS modulates pain perception and WM differentially according to age and target area of stimulation. In adolescents, anodal stimulation over the DLPFC increased the pain perception, while in adults, the stimulation over the M1 increased the pain threshold. Thus, they elucidate the impact of tDCS for different age groups and can help to define what is the appropriate intervention according to age in further clinical trials.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04328545.</p>

<p>Current researches on default mode network (DMN) in normal elderly have mainly focused on finding some dysfunctional areas with decreased or increased connectivity. The global network dynamics of apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele group is rarely studied. In our previous brain network study, we have demonstrated the advantage of persistent homology. It can distinguish robust and noisy topological features over multiscale nested networks, and the derived properties are more stable. In this study, for the first time we applied persistent homology to analyze APOE-related effects on whole-brain functional network. In our experiments, the risk allele group exhibited lower network radius and modularity in whole brain DMN based on graph theory, suggesting the abnormal organization structure. Moreover, two suggested measures from persistent homology detected significant differences between groups within the left hemisphere and in the whole brain in two datasets. They were more statistically sensitive to APOE genotypic differences than standard graph-based measures. In summary, we provide evidence that the e4 genotype leads to distinct DMN functional alterations in the early phases of Alzheimer’s disease using persistent homology approach. Our study offers a novel insight to explore potential biomarkers in healthy elderly populations carrying APOE e4 allele.</p>

<p>Background: The rs405509 polymorphism ofthe apolipoprotein E (APOE) promoter is related to Alzheimer’sdisease (AD). The T/T allele of rs405509 is known to decrease the transcription of the APOE gene and lead to impairments in specific brain structural networks with aging; thus, it is an important risk factor for AD. However, it remains unknown whether rs405509 affects brain functional connectivity (FC) in aging.</p><p>Methods: We investigated the effect of the rs405509 genotype (T/T vs. G-allele) on age-related brain FC using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Forty-five elderly TT carriers and 45 elderly G-allele carriers were scanned during a working memory (WM) task.</p><p>Results: We found that TT carriers showed an accelerated age-related increase in functional activation in the left postcentral gyrus compared with G-allele carriers. Furthermore, the FC between the left postcentral gyrus and some key regions during WM performance, including the right caudal and superior frontal sulcus (SFS), was differentially modulated by age across rs405509 genotype groups.</p><p>Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the rs405509 T/T allele of APOE causes an age-related brain functional decline in nondemented elderly people, which may be beneficial for understanding the neural mechanisms of rs405509-related cognitive aging and AD pathogenesis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60030">Structure of MlaFB uncovers novel mechanisms of ABC transporter regulation</a></h4>

ABC transporters facilitate the movement of diverse molecules across cellular membranes, but how their activity is regulated post-translationally is not well understood. Here we report the crystal structure of MlaFB from <i>E. coli</i>, the cytoplasmic portion of the larger MlaFEDB ABC transporter complex, which drives phospholipid trafficking across the bacterial envelope to maintain outer membrane integrity. MlaB, a STAS domain protein, binds the ABC nucleotide binding domain, MlaF, and is required for its stability. Our structure also implicates a unique C-terminal tail of MlaF in self-dimerization. Both the C-terminal tail of MlaF and the interaction with MlaB are required for the proper assembly of the MlaFEDB complex and its function in cells. This work leads to a new model for how an important bacterial lipid transporter may be regulated by small proteins, and raises the possibility that similar regulatory mechanisms may exist more broadly across the ABC transporter family.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58281">Membrane characteristics tune activities of endosomal and autophagic human VPS34 complexes</a></h4>

The lipid kinase VPS34 orchestrates diverse processes, including autophagy, endocytic sorting, phagocytosis, anabolic responses and cell division. VPS34 forms various complexes that help adapt it to specific pathways, with complexes I and II being the most prominent ones. We found that physicochemical properties of membranes strongly modulate VPS34 activity. Greater unsaturation of both substrate and non-substrate lipids, negative charge and curvature activate VPS34 complexes, adapting them to their cellular compartments. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) of complexes I and II on membranes elucidated structural determinants that enable them to bind membranes. Among these are the Barkor/ATG14L autophagosome targeting sequence (BATS), which makes autophagy-specific complex I more active than the endocytic complex II, and the Beclin1 BARA domain. Interestingly, even though Beclin1 BARA is common to both complexes, its membrane-interacting loops are critical for complex II, but have only a minor role for complex I.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57860">Transient role of the middle ear as a lower jaw support across mammals</a></h4>

Mammals articulate their jaws using a novel joint between the dentary and squamosal bones. In eutherian mammals, this joint forms in the embryo, supporting feeding and vocalisation from birth. In contrast, marsupials and monotremes exhibit extreme altriciality and are born before the bones of the novel mammalian jaw joint form. These mammals need to rely on other mechanisms to allow them to feed. Here we show that this vital function is carried out by the earlier developing, cartilaginous incus of the middle ear, abutting the cranial base to form a cranio-mandibular articulation. The nature of this articulation varies between monotremes and marsupials, with juvenile monotremes retaining a double articulation, similar to that of the fossil mammaliaform <i>Morganucodon</i>, while marsupials use a versican-rich matrix to stabilise the jaw against the cranial base. These findings provide novel insight into the evolution of mammals and the changing relationship between the jaw and ear.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57008">Divergent sensory investment mirrors potential speciation via niche partitioning across <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

The examination of phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics of the nervous system, such as behavior and neuroanatomy, can be utilized as a means to assess speciation. Recent studies have proposed a fundamental tradeoff between two sensory organs, the eye and the antenna. However, the identification of ecological mechanisms for this observed tradeoff have not been firmly established. Our current study examines several monophyletic species within the <i>obscura</i> group, and asserts that despite their close relatedness and overlapping ecology, they deviate strongly in both visual and olfactory investment. We contend that both courtship and microhabitat preferences support the observed inverse variation in these sensory traits. Here, this variation in visual and olfactory investment seems to provide relaxed competition, a process by which similar species can use a shared environment differently and in ways that help them coexist. Moreover, that behavioral separation according to light gradients occurs first, and subsequently, courtship deviations arise.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56367">Targeted surveillance strategies for efficient detection of novel antibiotic resistance variants</a></h4>

Genotype-based diagnostics for antibiotic resistance represent a promising alternative to empiric therapy, reducing inappropriate antibiotic use. However, because such assays infer resistance based on known genetic markers, their utility will wane with the emergence of novel resistance. Maintenance of these diagnostics will therefore require surveillance to ensure early detection of novel resistance variants, but efficient strategies to do so remain undefined. We evaluate the efficiency of targeted sampling approaches informed by patient and pathogen characteristics in detecting antibiotic resistance and diagnostic escape variants in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, a pathogen associated with a high burden of disease and antibiotic resistance and the development of genotype-based diagnostics. We show that patient characteristic-informed sampling is not a reliable strategy for efficient variant detection. In contrast, sampling informed by pathogen characteristics, such as genomic diversity and genomic background, is significantly more efficient than random sampling in identifying genetic variants associated with resistance and diagnostic escape.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56236">HA stabilization promotes replication and transmission of swine H1N1 gamma influenza viruses in ferrets</a></h4>

Pandemic influenza A viruses can emerge from swine, an intermediate host that supports adaptation of human-preferred receptor-binding specificity by the hemagglutinin (HA) surface antigen. Other HA traits necessary for pandemic potential are poorly understood. For swine influenza viruses isolated in 2009–2016, gamma-clade viruses had less stable HA proteins (activation pH 5.5–5.9) than pandemic clade (pH 5.0–5.5). Gamma-clade viruses replicated to higher levels in mammalian cells than pandemic clade. In ferrets, a model for human adaptation, a relatively stable HA protein (pH 5.5–5.6) was necessary for efficient replication and airborne transmission. The overall airborne transmission frequency in ferrets for four isolates tested was 42%, and isolate G15 airborne transmitted 100% after selection of a variant with a stabilized HA. The results suggest swine influenza viruses containing both a stabilized HA and alpha-2,6 receptor binding in tandem pose greater pandemic risk. Increasing evidence supports adding HA stability to pre-pandemic risk assessment algorithms.

Birds that use their wings for ‘flight’ in both air and water are expected to fly poorly in each fluid relative to single-fluid specialists; that is, these jacks-of-all-trades should be the masters of none. Alcids exhibit exceptional dive performance while retaining aerial flight. We hypothesized that alcids maintain efficient Strouhal numbers and stroke velocities across air and water, allowing them to mitigate the costs of their ‘fluid generalism’. We show that alcids cruise at Strouhal numbers between 0.10 and 0.40 – on par with single-fluid specialists – in both air and water but flap their wings ~ 50% slower in water. Thus, these species either contract their muscles at inefficient velocities or maintain a two-geared muscle system, highlighting a clear cost to using the same morphology for locomotion in two fluids. Additionally, alcids varied stroke-plane angle between air and water and chord angle during aquatic flight, expanding their performance envelope.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55249">Generation of inner ear hair cells by direct lineage conversion of primary somatic cells</a></h4>

The mechanoreceptive sensory hair cells in the inner ear are selectively vulnerable to numerous genetic and environmental insults. In mammals, hair cells lack regenerative capacity, and their death leads to permanent hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Their paucity and inaccessibility has limited the search for otoprotective and regenerative strategies. Growing hair cells in vitro would provide a route to overcome this experimental bottleneck. We report a combination of four transcription factors (<i>Six1, Atoh1, Pou4f3</i>, and <i>Gfi1</i>) that can convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult tail-tip fibroblasts and postnatal supporting cells into induced hair cell-like cells (iHCs). iHCs exhibit hair cell-like morphology, transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles, electrophysiological properties, mechanosensory channel expression, and vulnerability to ototoxin in a high-content phenotypic screening system. Thus, direct reprogramming provides a platform to identify causes and treatments for hair cell loss, and may help identify future gene therapy approaches for restoring hearing.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54125">Parvalbumin interneurons provide spillover to newborn and mature dentate granule cells</a></h4>

Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVs) in the dentate gyrus provide activity-dependent regulation of adult neurogenesis as well as maintain inhibitory control of mature neurons. In mature neurons, PVs evoke GABA<sub>A</sub> postsynaptic currents (GPSCs) with fast rise and decay phases that allow precise control of spike timing, yet synaptic currents with fast kinetics do not appear in adult-born neurons until several weeks after cell birth. Here we used mouse hippocampal slices to address how PVs signal to newborn neurons prior to the appearance of fast GPSCs. Whereas PV-evoked currents in mature neurons exhibit hallmark fast rise and decay phases, newborn neurons display slow GPSCs with characteristics of spillover signaling. We also unmasked slow spillover currents in mature neurons in the absence of fast GPSCs. Our results suggest that PVs mediate slow spillover signaling in addition to conventional fast synaptic signaling, and that spillover transmission mediates activity-dependent regulation of early events in adult neurogenesis.

Women experience many pain conditions more frequently when compared with men, but the biological mechanisms underlying sex differences in pain remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known about possible sex differences in peripheral nociceptors, the fundamental building blocks of pain transmission. Emerging evidence reveals that prolactin (PRL) signaling at its cognate prolactin receptor (PRLR) in primary afferents promotes nociceptor sensitization and pain in a female-selective fashion.

Activation of VTA glutamate neurons leads to dopamine co-release in nucleus accumbens. Zell et al. genetically block this dopamine signal to show that VTA glutamate projections to nucleus accumbens can reinforce behaviors independently. These findings establish a parallel dopamine-independent mesolimbic pathway capable of supporting positive reinforcement.

El-Quessny et al. investigate the structure-function relationship of a ventrally-tuned directionally-selective ganglion cell (vDSGC), which has ventrally oriented dendrites during adulthood. They find that visual experience orients the vDSGC dendrites ventrally, affecting dendritic mechanisms, while sparing circuit mechanisms, for direction computations.

Shih et al. show that neurofibromin (NF1 protein) acts through valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 to regulate endoplasmic reticulum formation and protein synthesis. It consequently controls dendritic spine formation and contextual and social memory of mice. Increased protein synthesis through leucine supplementation ameliorates neuronal and behavioral defects of Nf1 mutant mice.

Vivinetto et al. identify the EMT-related transcription factor ZEB2 as a regulator of the astrocytic response to injury. Mouse models of either stroke or SCI show that knockout of Zeb2 in astrocytes attenuates astrogliosis, increases lesion sizes, and delays recovery motor function. Altogether, the findings suggest that astrogliosis is an EMT-like process.

Liao et al. generate a heme-regulated chromatin atlas by amalgamating ATAC-seq and RNA-seq datasets from cells with normal and sub-physiological heme, and they identify parallel Bach1-dependent and Bach1-independent mechanisms that target heme-sensing chromatin hotspots. The hotspots harbor a DNA motif demarcating heme-regulated chromatin and genes not known to be heme regulated.

Rostami et al. find that treatment type and timing from treatment exposure are key factors affecting cell-free DNA (cfDNA) release kinetics. Distinct mechanisms of cell death mediate the timing of release, and cellular senescence is a major determinant counteracting the process. Selective advancement of senescent cells toward apoptosis increases cfDNA release.

Chen et al. showed that after bacterial lung injury, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is released from lung endothelial cells and regulates alveoli epithelial repair by promoting the progenitor function of alveolar type II cells via a S1P-S1PR2-YAP signaling axis. This work highlighted endothelial-epithelial interaction during lung repair mediated by bioactive lipid S1P.

The role of PD-1 in memory development is poorly understood. Here, Pauken et al. show that constitutive loss of PD-1 during acute infection causes overactivation of CD8+ T cells during the effector phase and impairs memory and recall responses. These data indicate PD-1 is required for optimal memory.

Renoux et al. investigate the role of the AP1 member Fosl2 in autoimmunity. They show that Fosl2 overexpression induces T cell-mediated systemic inflammation in transgenic mice, while Fosl2 deletion in T cells protects against induced autoimmunity. Furthermore, they suggest that Fosl2 is implicated in Treg development in the thymus.

Influenza viruses assemble and package all eight viral RNA segments through intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. Le Sage et al. establish a protocol to capture genome-wide influenza intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. They show that the viral RNA interaction network is flexible, where hotspots on individual segments coordinate interaction with many other segments.

Ruan et al. show that H1N1 influenza A virus cross-activates Gli1, a transcription factor in the sonic hedgehog pathway. Gli1 activation plays a role in downregulating the expression of intercellular junction proteins, increasing the permeability of the alveolar epithelial barrier, and promoting inflammation in the lung tissue.

<p>by Samuel R. Bray, Bo Wang</p>

Forecasting ‘Black Swan’ events in ecosystems is an important but challenging task. Many ecosystems display aperiodic fluctuations in species abundance spanning orders of magnitude in scale, which have vast environmental and economic impact. Empirical evidence and theoretical analyses suggest that these dynamics are in a regime where system nonlinearities limit accurate forecasting of unprecedented events due to poor extrapolation of historical data to unsampled states. Leveraging increasingly available long-term high-frequency ecological tracking data, we analyze multiple natural and experimental ecosystems (marine plankton, intertidal mollusks, and deciduous forest), and recover hidden linearity embedded in universal ‘scaling laws’ of species dynamics. We then develop a method using these scaling laws to reduce data dependence in ecological forecasting and accurately predict extreme events beyond the span of historical observations in diverse ecosystems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bc3qP0k4v_Y" width="1" />

<p>by Ethan D. Evans, Chengzhen Dai, Siavash Isazadeh, Shinkyu Park, Carlo Ratti, Eric J. Alm</p>

Direct sampling of building wastewater has the potential to enable “precision public health” observations and interventions. Temporal sampling offers additional dynamic information that can be used to increase the informational content of individual metabolic “features”, but few studies have focused on high-resolution sampling. Here, we sampled three spatially close buildings, revealing individual metabolomics features, retention time (rt) and mass-to-charge ratio (mz) pairs, that often possess similar stationary statistical properties, as expected from aggregate sampling. However, the temporal profiles of features—providing orthogonal information to physicochemical properties—illustrate that many possess different <i>feature temporal dynamics</i> (fTDs) across buildings, with large and unpredictable single day deviations from the mean. Internal to a building, numerous and seemingly unrelated features, with mz and rt differences up to hundreds of Daltons and seconds, display highly correlated fTDs, suggesting non-obvious feature relationships. Data-driven building classification achieves high sensitivity and specificity, and extracts building-identifying features found to possess unique dynamics. Analysis of fTDs from many short-duration samples allows for tailored community monitoring with applicability in public health studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CS3tfz-Ww-Y" width="1" />

<p>by Nimrod Sherf, Shamir Maoz</p>

Rhythmic activity has been associated with a wide range of cognitive processes including the encoding of sensory information, navigation, the transfer of information and others. Rhythmic activity in the brain has also been suggested to be used for multiplexing information. Multiplexing is the ability to transmit more than one signal via the same channel. Here we focus on frequency division multiplexing, in which different signals are transmitted in different frequency bands. Recent work showed that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can facilitate the transfer of rhythmic activity downstream the information processing pathway. However, STDP has also been known to generate strong winner-take-all like competition between subgroups of correlated synaptic inputs. This competition between different rhythmicity channels, induced by STDP, may prevent the multiplexing of information. Thus, raising doubts whether STDP is consistent with the idea of multiplexing. This study explores whether STDP can facilitate the multiplexing of information across multiple frequency channels, and if so, under what conditions. We address this question in a modelling study, investigating the STDP dynamics of two populations synapsing downstream onto the same neuron in a feed-forward manner. Each population was assumed to exhibit rhythmic activity, albeit in a different frequency band. Our theory reveals that the winner-take-all like competitions between the two populations is limited, in the sense that different rhythmic populations will not necessarily fully suppress each other. Furthermore, we found that for a wide range of parameters, the network converged to a solution in which the downstream neuron responded to both rhythms. Yet, the synaptic weights themselves did not converge to a fixed point, rather remained dynamic. These findings imply that STDP can support the multiplexing of rhythmic information, and demonstrate how functionality (multiplexing of information) can be retained in the face of continuous remodeling of all the synaptic weights. The constraints on the types of STDP rules that can support multiplexing provide a natural test for our theory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MfBafRnagZY" width="1" />

<p>by Mikkel Herholdt Jensen, Eliza J. Morris, Hai Tran, Michael A. Nash, Cheemeng Tan</p>

Top-down proteomics has enabled the elucidation of heterogeneous protein complexes with different cofactors, post-translational modifications, and protein membership. This heterogeneity is believed to play a previously unknown role in cellular processes. The different molecular forms of a protein complex have come to be called “complex isoform” or “complexoform”. Despite the elucidation of the complexoform, it remains unclear how and whether cellular circuits control the distribution of a complexoform. To help address this issue, we first simulate a generic three-protein complexoform to reveal the control of its distribution by the timing of gene transcription, mRNA translation, and protein transport. Overall, we ran 265 computational experiments: each averaged over 1,000 stochastic simulations. Based on the experiments, we show that genes arranged in a single operon, a cascade, or as two operons all give rise to the different protein composition of complexoform because of timing differences in protein-synthesis order. We also show that changes in the kinetics of expression, protein transport, or protein binding dramatically alter the distribution of the complexoform. Furthermore, both stochastic and transient kinetics control the assembly of the complexoform when the expression and assembly occur concurrently. We test our model against the biological cellulosome system. With biologically relevant rates, we find that the genetic circuitry controls the average final complexoform assembly and the variation in the assembly structure. Our results highlight the importance of both the genetic circuit architecture and kinetics in determining the distribution of a complexoform. Our work has a broad impact on our understanding of non-equilibrium processes in both living and synthetic biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rOpI0sFUV9k" width="1" />

<p>by Niklas Korsbo, Henrik Jönsson</p>

Thoughtful use of simplifying assumptions is crucial to make systems biology models tractable while still representative of the underlying biology. A useful simplification can elucidate the core dynamics of a system. A poorly chosen assumption can, however, either render a model too complicated for making conclusions or it can prevent an otherwise accurate model from describing experimentally observed dynamics. Here, we perform a computational investigation of sequential multi-step pathway models that contain fewer pathway steps than the system they are designed to emulate. We demonstrate when such models will fail to reproduce data and how detrimental truncation of a pathway leads to detectable signatures in model dynamics and its optimised parameters. An alternative assumption is suggested for simplifying such pathways. Rather than assuming a truncated number of pathway steps, we propose to use the assumption that the rates of information propagation along the pathway is homogeneous and, instead, letting the length of the pathway be a free parameter. We first focus on linear pathways that are sequential and have first-order kinetics, and we show how this assumption results in a three-parameter model that consistently outperforms its truncated rival and a delay differential equation alternative in recapitulating observed dynamics. We then show how the proposed assumption allows for similarly terse and effective models of non-linear pathways. Our results provide a foundation for well-informed decision making during model simplifications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dQUudZqyIp4" width="1" />

<p>by Shintaro Nagata, Macoto Kikuchi</p>

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are complex systems in which many genes regulate mutually to adapt the cell state to environmental conditions. In addition to function, the GRNs possess several kinds of robustness. This robustness means that systems do not lose their functionality when exposed to disturbances such as mutations or noise, and is widely observed at many levels in living systems. Both function and robustness have been acquired through evolution. In this respect, GRNs utilized in living systems are rare among all possible GRNs. In this study, we explored the fitness landscape of GRNs and investigated how robustness emerged in highly-fit GRNs. We considered a toy model of GRNs with one input gene and one output gene. The difference in the expression level of the output gene between two input states, “on” and “off”, was considered as fitness. Thus, the determination of the fitness of a GRN was based on how sensitively it responded to the input. We employed the multicanonical Monte Carlo method, which can sample GRNs randomly in a wide range of fitness levels, and classified the GRNs according to their fitness. As a result, the following properties were found: (1) Highly-fit GRNs exhibited bistability for intermediate input between “on” and “off”. This means that such GRNs responded to two input states by using different fixed points of dynamics. This bistability emerges necessarily as fitness increases. (2) These highly-fit GRNs were robust against noise because of their bistability. In other words, noise robustness is a byproduct of high fitness. (3) GRNs that were robust against mutations were not extremely rare among the highly-fit GRNs. This implies that mutational robustness is readily acquired through the evolutionary process. These properties are universal irrespective of the evolutionary pathway, because the results do not rely on evolutionary simulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I8GcWQMJSQI" width="1" />

<p>by Jens Karschau, André Scholich, Jonathan Wise, Hernán Morales-Navarrete, Yannis Kalaidzidis, Marino Zerial, Benjamin M. Friedrich</p>

Can three-dimensional, microvasculature networks still ensure blood supply if individual links fail? We address this question in the sinusoidal network, a plexus-like microvasculature network, which transports nutrient-rich blood to every hepatocyte in liver tissue, by building on recent advances in high-resolution imaging and digital reconstruction of adult mice liver tissue. We find that the topology of the three-dimensional sinusoidal network reflects its two design requirements of a space-filling network that connects all hepatocytes, while using shortest transport routes: sinusoidal networks are sub-graphs of the Delaunay graph of their set of branching points, and also contain the corresponding minimum spanning tree, both to good approximation. To overcome the spatial limitations of experimental samples and generate arbitrarily-sized networks, we developed a network generation algorithm that reproduces the statistical features of 0.3-mm-sized samples of sinusoidal networks, using multi-objective optimization for node degree and edge length distribution. Nematic order in these simulated networks implies anisotropic transport properties, characterized by an empirical linear relation between a nematic order parameter and the anisotropy of the permeability tensor. Under the assumption that all sinusoid tubes have a constant and equal flow resistance, we predict that the distribution of currents in the network is very inhomogeneous, with a small number of edges carrying a substantial part of the flow—a feature known for hierarchical networks, but unexpected for plexus-like networks. We quantify network resilience in terms of a permeability-at-risk, i.e., permeability as function of the fraction of removed edges. We find that sinusoidal networks are resilient to random removal of edges, but vulnerable to the removal of high-current edges. Our findings suggest the existence of a mechanism counteracting flow inhomogeneity to balance metabolic load on the liver.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6f0FHErCdAA" width="1" />

<p>by A. Armean Wright, Ghassan N. Fayad, James F. Selgrade, Mette S. Olufsen</p>

Contraceptive drugs intended for family planning are used by the majority of married or in-union women in almost all regions of the world. The two most prevalent types of hormones associated with contraception are synthetic estrogens and progestins. Hormonal based contraceptives contain a dose of a synthetic progesterone (progestin) or a combination of a progestin and a synthetic estrogen. In this study we use mathematical modeling to understand better how these contraceptive paradigms prevent ovulation, special focus is on understanding how changes in dose impact hormonal cycling. To explain this phenomenon, we added two autocrine mechanisms essential to achieve contraception within our previous menstrual cycle models. This new model predicts mean daily blood concentrations of key hormones during a contraceptive state achieved by administering progestins, synthetic estrogens, or a combined treatment. Model outputs are compared with data from two clinical trials: one for a progestin only treatment and one for a combined hormonal treatment. Results show that contraception can be achieved with synthetic estrogen, with progestin, and by combining the two hormones. An advantage of the combined treatment is that a contraceptive state can be obtained at a lower dose of each hormone. The model studied here is qualitative in nature, but can be coupled with a pharmacokinetic/pharamacodynamic (PKPD) model providing the ability to fit exogenous inputs to specific bioavailability and affinity. A model of this type may allow insight into a specific drug’s effects, which has potential to be useful in the pre-clinical trial stage identifying the lowest dose required to achieve contraception.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/29_Xe7xXoGM" width="1" />

<p>by Stefanie Duvigneau, Robert Dürr, Tanja Laske, Mandy Bachmann, Melanie Dostert, Achim Kienle</p>

A large group of biopharmaceuticals is produced in cell lines. The yield of such products can be increased by genetic engineering of the corresponding cell lines. The prediction of promising genetic modifications by mathematical modeling is a valuable tool to facilitate experimental screening. Besides information on the intracellular kinetics and genetic modifications the mathematical model has to account for ubiquitous cell-to-cell variability. In this contribution, we establish a novel model-based methodology for influenza vaccine production in cell lines with overexpressed genes. The manipulation of the expression level of genes coding for host cell factors relevant for virus replication is achieved by lentiviral transduction. Since lentiviral transduction causes increased cell-to-cell variability due to different copy numbers and integration sites of the gene constructs we use a population balance modeling approach to account for this heterogeneity in terms of intracellular viral components and distributed kinetic parameters. The latter are estimated from experimental data of intracellular viral RNA levels and virus titers of infection experiments using cells overexpressing a single host cell gene. For experiments with cells overexpressing multiple host cell genes, only final virus titers were measured and thus, no direct estimation of the parameter distributions was possible. Instead, we evaluate four different computational strategies to infer these from single gene parameter sets. Finally, the best computational strategy is used to predict the most promising candidates for future modifications that show the highest potential for an increased virus yield in a combinatorial study. As expected, there is a trend to higher yields the more modifications are included.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PqCa9sFckj4" width="1" />

<p>by Qing Yu, Chunyue Teng, Bradley R. Postle</p>

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural codes for representing stimulus information held in different states of priority in working memory. Human participants (male and female) performed delayed recall for 2 oriented gratings that could appear in any of several locations. Priority status was manipulated by a retrocue, such that one became the prioritized memory item (PMI) and another the unprioritized memory item (UMI). Using inverted encoding models (IEMs), we found that, in early visual cortex, the orientation of the UMI was represented in a neural representation that was rotated relative to the PMI. In intraparietal sulcus (IPS), we observed the analogous effect for the representation of the location of the UMI. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a common remapping mechanism that may be responsible for representing stimulus identity and stimulus context with different levels of priority in working memory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tKP8cWRAlOc" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We have previously identified male sex, younger age, and the presence of spinal cord lesions as independent factors that increase the 5‐year risk for evolution from radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) to multiple sclerosis. Here, we investigate risk factors for the development of a clinical event using a 10‐year, multinational, retrospectively identified RIS dataset.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>RIS subjects were identified according to 2009 RIS criteria and followed longitudinally as part of a worldwide cohort study. We analyzed data from 21 individual databases from 5 different countries. Associations between clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics and the risk of developing a first clinical event were determined using multivariate Cox regression models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Additional follow‐up data were available in 277 of 451 RIS subjects (86% female). The mean age at RIS diagnosis was 37.2 years (range, 11–74 years), with a median clinical follow‐up of 6.7 years. The cumulative probability of a first clinical event at 10 years was 51.2%. Age, positive cerebrospinal fluid for oligoclonal bands, infratentorial lesions on MRI, and spinal cord lesions, were baseline independent predictors associated with a subsequent clinical event. The presence of gadolinium‐enhanced lesions during follow‐up was also associated with the risk of a seminal event. The reason for MRI and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions at baseline did not influence the risk of a subsequent clinical event.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximately half of all individuals with RIS experience a first clinical event within 10 years of the index MRI. The identification of independent predictors of risk for symptom onset may guide education and clinical management of individuals with RIS. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome, <i>CDKL5 </i>‐deficiency disorder, <i>FOXG1 </i> disorder, and <i>MECP2 </i> duplication disorder are developmental encephalopathies with shared and distinct features. Although they are historically linked, no direct comparison has been performed. The first head‐to‐head comparison of clinical features in these conditions is presented.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Comprehensive clinical information was collected from 793 individuals enrolled in the Rett and Rett‐Related Disorders Natural History Study. Clinical features including clinical severity, regression, and seizures were cross‐sectionally compared between diagnoses to test the hypothesis that these are 4 distinct disorders.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct patterns of clinical severity, seizure onset age, and regression were present. Individuals with <i>CDKL5 </i>‐deficency disorder were the most severely affected and had the youngest age at seizure onset (2 months), whereas children with <i>MECP2 </i> duplication syndrome had the oldest median age at seizure onset (64 months) and lowest severity scores. Rett syndrome and <i>FOGX1 </i> were intermediate in both features. Smaller head circumference correlates with increased severity in all disorders and earlier age at seizure onset in <i>MECP2 </i> duplication syndrome. Developmental regression occurred in all Rett syndrome participants (median = 18 months) but only 23 to 34% of the other disorders. Seizure incidence prior to the baseline visit was highest for <i>CDKL5 </i> deficiency disorder (96.2%) and lowest for Rett syndrome (47.5%). Other clinical features including seizure types and frequency differed among groups.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although these developmental encephalopathies share many clinical features, clear differences in severity, regression, and seizures warrant considering them as unique disorders. These results will aid in the development of disease‐specific severity scales, precise therapeutics, and future clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Neural oscillations represent a fundamental mechanism that enables coordinated action during normal brain functioning. Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are used to test the ability to generate gamma-range activity. Different non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have the potential to modulate neural activation patterns that are aberrant in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on how different methods of NIBS (transcranial altering current stimulation—tACS, transcranial direct current stimulation—tDCS, transcranial random noise stimulation—tRNS, paired associative stimulation—PAS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation—rTMS) affect the gamma-range ASSRs in both healthy and clinical populations. We show that the current research has been far from systematic and methodologically heterogeneous. Nevertheless, some brain stimulation techniques, especially tACS and rTMS show strong potential for further exploration. We outline the main findings and provide directions for further research into neuromodulation of ASSRs as a promising biomarker of different psychopathological conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism.</p>

Neurons display different levels of vulnerability to Alzheimer’s pathology. Roussarie et al. experimentally profile and computationally model several relevant neuron types. Using a mouse-human framework, they identify genes linking Aß, aging, and tau in vulnerable neurons. Finally, they show experimentally that PTB, a regulator of tau splicing, contributes to vulnerability.

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>Nectin‐2α, prominently expressed in the medial habenula (MHb), was localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb (clustered filled dots) in addition to the boundary between the adjacent somata of the clustered cholinergic neurons (edges of clustered open hexagons). This dendritic nectin‐2α formed puncta adherentia junctions cooperatively with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin and regulated synapse formation.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial habenula (MHb) receives afferents from the triangular septum and the medial septal complex, projects efferents to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in the midbrain to regulate dopamine and serotonin levels, and is implicated in stress, depression, memory, and nicotine withdrawal syndrome. We previously showed that the cell adhesion molecule nectin‐2α is localized at the boundary between adjacent somata of clustered cholinergic neurons and regulates the voltage‐gated A‐type K<sup>+</sup> channel Kv4.2 localization at membrane specializations in the MHb. This adhesion apparatus, named nectin‐2α spots, is not associated with the nectin‐binding protein afadin or any classic cadherins and their binding proteins p120‐catenin and β‐catenin. We showed here that nectin‐2α was additionally localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb. The genetic ablation of <i>nectin‐2 </i> reduced the number of synapses in the MHb without affecting their morphology. Nectin‐2α was associated with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin, forming puncta adherentia junctions (PAJs). Nectin‐2α was observed in the IPN, but not in the triangular septum or the medial septal complex. The genetic ablation of <i>nectin‐2 </i> did not affect synapse formation in the IPN. These results indicate that nectin‐2α forms two types of adhesion apparatus in the MHb, namely nectin‐2α spots at neighboring somata and PAJs at neighboring dendrites, and that dendritic PAJs regulate synapse formation in the MHb.</p>

<p>We examined the chronology of infarct and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7, and d28 post β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Combination of ischemia and β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity has been shown to simultaneously increase neuro‐inflammation, endogenous Aβ deposition, and neurodegeneration. However, studies on the evolution of infarct and panorama of cellular degeneration as a synergistic or overlapping mechanism between ischemia and Aβ toxicity are lacking. Here, we compared fluorojade B (FJB) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains primarily to examine the chronology of infarct, and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7, and d28 post Aβ toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats. We demonstrated a regional difference in cellular degeneration between cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus after cerebral injury. Glial cells in the cortex and corpus callosum underwent delayed FJB staining from d7 to d28, but neurons in cortex disappeared within the first week of cerebral injury. Striatal lesion core and globus pallidus of Aβ + ET1 rats showed extensive degeneration of neuronal cells compared with ET1 rats alone starting from d1. Differential and exacerbated expressions of cyclooxygenase‐2 might be the cause of excessive neuronal demise in the striatum of Aβ + ET1 rats. Such an investigation may improve our understanding to identify and manipulate a critical therapeutic window post comorbid injury.</p>

<p>We examined the visual response properties of genetically targeted neurons in retina, optic tectum, and torus longitudinalis of larval zebrafish. Functional characterization of dimming responsive neurons within these visual areas revealed responses with varied photosensitivity profiles, including (a) low‐sensitivity neurons that selectively respond to large light decrements, (b) high‐sensitivity neurons that selectively encode small decrements, and (c) broad sensitivity neurons that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Our data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing.

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vertebrate retinas contain circuits specialized to encode light level decrements. This information is transmitted to the brain by dimming‐sensitive OFF retinal ganglion cells (OFF‐RGCs) that respond to light decrements with increased firing. It is known that OFF‐RGCs with distinct photosensitivity profiles form parallel visual channels to the vertebrate brain, yet how these channels are processed by first‐ and higher order brain areas has not been well characterized in any species. To address this question in the larval zebrafish visual system, we examined the visual response properties of a genetically identified population of tectal neurons with a defined axonal projection to a second‐order visual area: <i>id2b </i>:<i>gal4‐ </i>positive torus longitudinalis projection neurons (TLPNs). TLPNs responded consistently to whole‐field dimming stimuli and exhibited the strongest responses when dimming was preceded by low light levels. Functional characterization of OFF‐RGC terminals in tectum revealed responses that varied in their photosensitivities: (a) low‐sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively respond to large light decrements, (b) high‐sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively encode small decrements, and (c) broad sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Diverse photosensitivity profiles were also observed using pan‐neuronal calcium imaging to identify dimming‐responsive neurons in both tectum and torus longitudinalis. Together, these data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing. Segregated OFF channels with different sensitivities may allow specific aspects of dimming‐evoked behaviors to be modulated by ambient light levels.</p>

<p>Long‐term in vitro culture of neural stem cells (NSCs) resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes. The induction of four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c‐Myc) could decrease expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes during the long‐term culture.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult stem cells age during long‐term in vitro culture, and neural stem cells (NSCs), which can self‐renew and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, also display reduced differentiation potential after repeated passaging. However, the mechanistic details underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we found that long‐term in vitro culture of NSCs resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes, including the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1β and IL6, the senescence‐associated enzyme matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), and the ER stress‐responsive transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). However, the cyclic and transient induction of four reprogramming factors (POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1, also known as octamer‐binding transcription factor 4; SRY [sex determining region Y]‐box 2; Kruppel‐like factor 4; and myelocytomatosis oncogene; collectively referred to as OSKM) can inhibit NSC aging, as indicated by the decreased expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes. We used ROSA‐4F NSCs, which express OSKM from only one allele, to minimize the potential for full reprogramming or tumor formation during NSC rejuvenation. We expect that this novel rejuvenation method will enhance the potential of NSCs as a clinical approach to the treatment of neurological diseases.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>Here, we show that the hemiellipsoid body of the true crab <i>Neohelice granulata </i> shares many of the insect mushroom body characters. In this brain center, which has previously been shown to reflect context‐dependent memory, we identified the presence of microglomeruli‐like complexes, input and output regions, aminergic innervation, adult neurogenesis, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. in vivo calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, stimuli of different nature can trigger divergent neuronal activity patterns in the output region. The study provides a series of data that is parsimonious with a shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hypothesis of a common origin for high‐order memory centers in bilateral animals presents the question of how different brain structures, such as the vertebrate hippocampus and the arthropod mushroom bodies, are both structurally and functionally comparable. Obtaining evidence to support the hypothesis that crustaceans possess structures equivalent to the mushroom bodies that play a role in associative memories has proved challenging. Structural evidence supports that the hemiellipsoid bodies of hermit crabs, crayfish and lobsters, spiny lobsters, and shrimps are homologous to insect mushroom bodies. Although a preliminary description and functional evidence supporting such homology in true crabs (Brachyura) has recently been shown, other authors consider the identification of a possible mushroom body homolog in Brachyura as problematic. Here we present morphological and immunohistochemical data in <i>Neohelice granulata </i> supporting that crabs possess well‐developed hemiellipsoid bodies that are resolved as mushroom bodies‐like structures. <i>Neohelice </i> exhibits a peduncle‐like tract, from which processes project into proximal and distal domains with different neuronal specializations. The proximal domains exhibit spines and <i>en passant </i>‐like processes and are proposed here as regions mainly receiving inputs. The distal domains exhibit a “trauben”‐like compartmentalized structure with bulky terminal specializations and are proposed here as output regions. In addition, we found microglomeruli‐like complexes, adult neurogenesis, aminergic innervation, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. Finally, in vivo calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, the output regions exhibit stimulus‐specific activity. Our results support the shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.</p>

Depletion of microglia during cortical critical period profoundly alters glutamatergic synapse developmental trajectory

Microglia is critical for visual cortex spine pruning, circuit refinement, intracortical connectivity, and critical period plasticity




</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia populate the early developing brain and mediate pruning of the central synapses. Yet, little is known on their functional significance in shaping the developing cortical circuits. We hypothesize that the developing cortical circuits require microglia for proper circuit maturation and connectivity, and as such, ablation of microglia during the cortical critical period may result in a long‐lasting circuit abnormality. We administered PLX3397, a colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, to mice starting at postnatal day 14 and through P28, which depletes &gt;75% of microglia in the visual cortex (VC). This treatment largely covers the critical period (P19‐32) of VC maturation and plasticity. Patch clamp recording in VC layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 neurons revealed increased mEPSC frequency and reduced amplitude, and decreased AMPA/NMDA current ratio, indicative of altered synapse maturation. Increased spine density was observed in these neurons, potentially reflecting impaired synapse pruning. In addition, VC intracortical circuit functional connectivity, assessed by laser scanning photostimulation combined with glutamate uncaging, was dramatically altered. Using two photon longitudinal dendritic spine imaging, we confirmed that spine elimination/pruning was diminished during VC critical period when microglia were depleted. Reduced spine pruning thus may account for increased spine density and disrupted connectivity of VC circuits. Lastly, using single‐unit recording combined with monocular deprivation, we found that ocular dominance plasticity in the VC was obliterated during the critical period as a result of microglia depletion. These data establish a critical role of microglia in developmental cortical synapse pruning, maturation, functional connectivity, and critical period plasticity.</p>

<p>Using both novel and traditional lesion methods in humans, the neural networks responsible for mind‐wandering were studied. Both lesion analyses demonstrated that reduced mind‐wandering was associated with damage to brain regions within the default mode network.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Functional neuroimaging research has consistently associated brain structures within the default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) with mind‐wandering. Targeted lesion research has documented impairments in mind‐wandering after damage to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal regions associated with the DMN. However, no lesion studies to date have applied lesion network mapping to identify common networks associated with deficits in mind‐wandering. In lesion network mapping, resting‐state functional connectivity data from healthy participants are used to infer which brain regions are functionally connected to each lesion location from a sample with brain injury. In the current study, we conducted a lesion network mapping analysis to test the hypothesis that lesions affecting the DMN and FPN would be associated with diminished mind‐wandering. We assessed mind‐wandering frequency on the Imaginal Processes Inventory (IPI) in participants with brain injury (<i>n </i> = 29) and healthy comparison participants without brain injury (<i>n </i> = 19). Lesion network mapping analyses showed the strongest association of reduced mind‐wandering with the left inferior parietal lobule within the DMN. In addition, traditional lesion symptom mapping results revealed that reduced mind‐wandering was associated with lesions of the dorsal, ventral, and anterior sectors of mPFC, parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus in the DMN (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.05 uncorrected). These findings provide novel lesion support for the role of the DMN in mind‐wandering and contribute to a burgeoning literature on the neural correlates of spontaneous cognition.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Leucine rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are synaptic adhesion molecules with roles in synapse formation and signaling. LRRTM4 transcripts were previously shown to be enriched in rod bipolar cells (BCs), secondary neurons of the retina that form synapses with rod photoreceptors. Using two different antibodies, LRRTM4 was found to reside primarily at rod BC dendritic tips, where it colocalized with the transduction channel protein, TRPM1. LRRTM4 was not detected at dendritic tips of ON‐cone BCs. Following somatic knockout of LRRTM4 in BCs by subretinal injection and electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9, LRRTM4 was abolished or reduced in the dendritic tips of transfected cells. Knockout cells had a normal complement of TRPM1 at their dendritic tips, while GPR179 accumulation was partially reduced. In experiments with heterologously expressed protein, the extracellular domain of LRRTM4 was found to engage in heparan‐sulfate dependent binding with pikachurin.

<p>Dark‐adapting the fiddler crab eye at night triggers great changes in rhabdom diameters and crystalline cone shape, increasing optical sensitivity and acceptance angles. However, during daytime the eye remains effectively light‐adapted in the dark. Surprisingly, screening pigments do not appear to migrate to help moderate fluctuations in brightness.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A great diversity of adaptations is found among animals with compound eyes and even closely related taxa can show large variation in their light‐adaptation strategies. A prime example of a visual system evolved to function in specific light environments is the fiddler crab, used widely as a model to research aspects of crustacean vision and neural pathways. However, questions remain regarding how their eyes respond to the changes in brightness spanning many orders of magnitude, associated with their habitat and ecology. The fiddler crab <i>Afruca tangeri </i> forages at low tide on tropical and semi‐tropical mudflats, under bright sunlight and on moonless nights, suggesting that their eyes undergo effective light adaptation. Using synchrotron X‐ray tomography, light and transmission electron microscopy and <i>in vivo </i> ophthalmoscopy<i>, </i> we describe the ultrastructural changes in the eye between day and night. Dark adaptation at dusk triggered extensive widening of the rhabdoms and crystalline cone tips. This doubled the ommatidial acceptance angles and increased microvillar surface area for light capture in the rhabdom, theoretically boosting optical sensitivity 7.4 times. During daytime, only partial dark‐adaptation was achieved and rhabdoms remained narrow, indicating strong circadian control on the process. Bright light did not evoke changes in screening pigment distributions, suggesting a structural inability to adapt rapidly to the light level fluctuations frequently experienced when entering their burrow to escape predators. This should enable fiddler crabs to shelter for several minutes without undergoing significant dark‐adaptation, their vision remaining effectively adapted for predator detection when surfacing again in bright light.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Afferent activity dynamically regulates neuronal properties and connectivity in the central nervous system. The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA‐binding protein that regulates cellular and synaptic properties in an activity‐dependent manner. Whether and how FMRP level and localization are regulated by afferent input remains sparsely examined and how such regulation is associated with neuronal response to changes in sensory input is unknown. We characterized changes in FMRP level and localization in the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a primary cochlear nucleus, following afferent deprivation by unilateral cochlea removal. We observed rapid (within 2 hr) aggregation of FMRP immunoreactivity into large granular structures in a subset of deafferented NM neurons. Neurons that exhibited persistent FMRP aggregation at 12–24 hr eventually lost cytoplasmic Nissl substance, indicating cell death. A week later, FMRP expression in surviving neurons regained its homeostasis, with a slightly reduced immunostaining intensity and enhanced heterogeneity. Correlation analyses under the homeostatic status (7–14 days) revealed that neurons expressing relatively more FMRP had a higher capability of maintaining cell body size and ribosomal activity, as well as a better ability to detach inactive presynaptic terminals. Additionally, the intensity of an inhibitory postsynaptic protein, gephyrin, was reduced following deafferentation and was positively correlated with FMRP intensity, implicating an involvement of FMRP in synaptic dynamics in response to reduced afferent inputs. Collectively, this study demonstrates that afferent input regulates FMRP expression and localization in ways associated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic rearrangements.</p>

<p>Comparative studies on canid cognition have revealed tantalizing evidence for some restructuring in the canine brain.

We demonstrate that this parameter is largely consistent across canid species although regional differences in gyrification exist.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the last 15 years, research on canid cognition has revealed that domestic dogs possess a surprising array of complex socio‐cognitive skills pointing to the possibility that the domestication process might have uniquely altered their brains; however, we know very little about how evolutionary processes (natural or artificial) might have modified underlying neural structure to support species‐specific behaviors. Evaluating the degree of cortical folding (i.e., gyrification) within canids may prove useful, as this parameter is linked to functional variation of the cerebral cortex. Using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the impact of domestication on the canine cortical surface, we compared the gyrification index (GI) in 19 carnivore species, including six wild canid and 13 domestic dog individuals. We also explored correlations between global and local GI with brain mass, cortical thickness, white and grey matter volume and surface area. Our results indicated that GI values for domestic dogs are largely consistent with what would be expected for a canid of their given brain mass, although more variable than that observed in wild canids. We also found that GI in canids is positively correlated with cortical surface area, cortical thickness and total cortical grey matter volumes. While we found no evidence of global differences in GI between domestic and wild canids, certain regional differences in gyrification were observed.</p>

We previously reported in young chicks bidirectional gene expression regulation of the <i>BMP2 </i>, <i>4 </i>, and <i>7 </i> in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) after visual manipulation, tied to the direction of induced eye growth changes. Here we report local (regional) differences in expression patterns that were also treatment specific. Both <i>BMP2 </i> and <i>BMP4 </i> genes showed the expected increased expression with imposed myopic defocus (+10 D lens) after 2 and 48 hr, albeit limited to central and mid‐peripheral RPE zones. In contrast, the expected decrease in <i>BMP2 </i> gene expression with imposed hyperopic defocus (−10 D lens) was evident across all three zones after both 2 and 48 hr, with similar patterns observed after 48 hr with FD. Similar but smaller changes were recorded for <i>BMP4 </i> and <i>BMP7 </i> gene expression with the latter myopia‐inducing treatments.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We previously reported bidirectional gene expression regulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (<i>BMP2 </i>, <i>4 </i>, and <i>7 </i>) in chick retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in response to imposed optical defocus and form‐deprivation (FD). This study investigated whether there are local (regional) differences in these effects. 19‐day old White‐Leghorn chicks wore monocular +10 or − 10 D lenses, or diffusers (FD) for 2 or 48 hr, after which RPE samples were collected from both eyes, from a central circular zone (3 mm radius), and 3 mm wide annular mid‐peripheral and peripheral zones in all cases. <i>BMP2 </i>, <i>4 </i>, and <i>7 </i> gene expression levels in RPE from treated and fellow control eyes were compared as well as differences across zones. With the +10 D lens, increased expression of both <i>BMP2 </i> and <i>BMP4 </i> genes was observed in central and mid‐peripheral zones but not the peripheral zone after 2 and 48 hr. In contrast, with the −10 D lens <i>BMP2 </i> gene expression was significantly decreased in all three zones after 2 and 48 hr. Similar patterns of <i>BMP2 </i> gene expression were observed in all three zones after 48 hr of FD. Smaller changes were recorded for <i>BMP4 </i> and <i>BMP7 </i> gene expression for both myopia‐inducing treatments. That optical defocus‐ and FD‐induced changes in <i>BMP </i> gene expression in chick RPE show treatment‐dependent local (regional) differences suggest important differences in the nature and contributions of local retinal and underlying RPE regions to eye growth regulation.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increased oxidative stress has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, but also with neurological diseases sharing pathophysiological pathways like epilepsy. Lipofuscin is a non‐degradable end‐product of oxidative stress; its cerebral presence reflects the cumulative amount of oxidative stress the brain has endured. In this study, we have observed prominent autofluorescent particles in the pial arterial wall and in neocortical parenchyma of young, drug‐resistant epilepsy patients (18‐28 years old) who underwent resective brain surgery (n=6), as well as in older control patients (n=3). With fluorescence spectroscopic imaging, brightfield microscopy, histochemistry and fluorescence lifetime imaging, these autofluorescent particles were identified as the <i>age pigment </i> lipofuscin. An evaluation of these lipofuscin particles using Imaris© software allowed robust quantification, while the 3D properties allowed visualization of the complex configuration. We elaborate on the usefulness of lipofuscin as a marker of cumulative oxidative stress in the brain. Furthermore, we speculate on the observed differences in particle size and density that we found between young patients and older controls, which could imply a role for lipofuscin in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and possibly other neurological diseases.</p>

<p>by Aleksey V. Zimin, Steven L. Salzberg</p>

The introduction of third-generation DNA sequencing technologies in recent years has allowed scientists to generate dramatically longer sequence reads, which when used in whole-genome sequencing projects have yielded better repeat resolution and far more contiguous genome assemblies. While the promise of better contiguity has held true, the relatively high error rate of long reads, averaging 8–15%, has made it challenging to generate a highly accurate final sequence. Current long-read sequencing technologies display a tendency toward systematic errors, in particular in homopolymer regions, which present additional challenges. A cost-effective strategy to generate highly contiguous assemblies with a very low overall error rate is to combine long reads with low-cost short-read data, which currently have an error rate below 0.5%. This hybrid strategy can be pursued either by incorporating the short-read data into the early phase of assembly, during the read correction step, or by using short reads to “polish” the consensus built from long reads. In this report, we present the assembly polishing tool POLCA (POLishing by Calling Alternatives) and compare its performance with two other popular polishing programs, Pilon and Racon. We show that on simulated data POLCA is more accurate than Pilon, and comparable in accuracy to Racon. On real data, all three programs show similar performance, but POLCA is consistently much faster than either of the other polishing programs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0aTjcPtJdwU" width="1" />

<p>by Fabian Konrath, Anna Mittermeier, Elena Cristiano, Jana Wolf, Alexander Loewer</p>

The transcription factors NF-κB and p53 are key regulators in the genotoxic stress response and are critical for tumor development. Although there is ample evidence for interactions between both networks, a comprehensive understanding of the crosstalk is lacking. Here, we developed a systematic approach to identify potential interactions between the pathways. We perturbed NF-κB signaling by inhibiting IKK2, a critical regulator of NF-κB activity, and monitored the altered response of p53 to genotoxic stress using single cell time lapse microscopy. Fitting subpopulation-specific computational p53 models to this time-resolved single cell data allowed to reproduce in a quantitative manner signaling dynamics and cellular heterogeneity for the unperturbed and perturbed conditions. The approach enabled us to untangle the integrated effects of IKK/ NF-κB perturbation on p53 dynamics and thereby derive potential interactions between both networks. Intriguingly, we find that a simultaneous perturbation of multiple processes is necessary to explain the observed changes in the p53 response. Specifically, we show interference with the activation and degradation of p53 as well as the degradation of Mdm2. Our results highlight the importance of the crosstalk and its potential implications in p53-dependent cellular functions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/M9AmjZVWCJo" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent studies carried on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients suggest that the disease may initiate in the motor cortex and spread to its targets along the corticofugal tracts. In this study, we aimed at experimentally testing the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p><i>Sod1 </i>
<sup>
   <i>G86R </i>
</sup> and <i>Fezf2 </i> knockout mouse lines were crossed to generate a model that ubiquitously expresses a mutant of the murine <i>Sod1 </i> gene, a condition sufficient to induce progressive motor symptoms and premature death, but genetically lacks corticospinal neurons and other subcerebral projection neurons, one of the main populations of corticofugal neurons. Disease onset and survival were recorded, and weight and motor behaviour were longitudinally followed. Hyperreflexia and spasticity were monitored using electromyographic recordings. Neurodegeneration and gliosis were further assessed by histological techniques.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Absence of subcerebral projection neurons delayed disease onset, reduced weight loss and motor impairment, and increased survival without modifying disease duration. Absence of corticospinal neurons also limited pre‐symptomatic hyperreflexia, a typical component of the upper motor neuron syndrome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Major corticofugal tracts are critical to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis onset and progression. In the context of the disease, subcerebral projection neurons may carry detrimental signals to their downstream targets. In its whole, this study provides the first experimental arguments in favour of the corticofugal hypothesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Impairment of glycinergic neurotransmission leads to complex movement and behavioral disorders. Patients harboring glycine receptor autoantibodies suffer from stiff‐person syndrome or its severe variant progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Enhanced receptor internalization was proposed as the common molecular mechanism upon autoantibody binding. Although functional impairment of glycine receptors following autoantibody binding has recently been investigated, it is still incompletely understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A cell‐based assay was used for positive sample evaluation. Glycine receptor function was assessed by electrophysiological recordings and radioligand binding assays. The <i>in vivo </i> passive transfer of patient autoantibodies was done using the zebrafish animal model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Glycine receptor function as assessed by glycine dose‐response curves showed significantly decreased glycine potency in the presence of patient sera. Upon binding of autoantibodies from two patients a decreased fraction of desensitized receptors was observed while closing of the ion channel remained fast. The glycine receptor N‐terminal residues <sup>29</sup>A to <sup>62</sup>G were mapped as a common epitope of glycine receptor autoantibodies. An <i>in vivo </i> transfer into the zebrafish animal model generated a phenotype with disturbed escape behavior accompanied by a reduced number of glycine receptor clusters in the spinal cord of affected animals.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Autoantibodies against the extracellular domain mediate alterations of glycine receptor physiology. Moreover, our <i>in vivo </i> data demonstrate that the autoantibodies are a direct cause of the disease, since the transfer of human glycine receptor autoantibodies to zebrafish larvae generated impaired escape behavior in the animal model compatible with abnormal startle response in SPS or PERM patients.</p>

<p>Electrical microstimulation can treat neurological disorders; however, the mechanisms defining therapeutic efficacy are poorly characterized. In the mouse cortex, increasing the stimulation waveform asymmetry differentially modulates the spatial distribution and level of sustained neuronal activation, depending on leading polarity, under mesoscale (top) and two‐photon (bottom) imaging.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Electrical stimulation has been critical in the development of an understanding of brain function and disease. Despite its widespread use and obvious clinical potential, the mechanisms governing stimulation in the cortex remain largely unexplored in the context of pulse parameters. Modeling studies have suggested that modulation of stimulation pulse waveform may be able to control the probability of neuronal activation to selectively stimulate either cell bodies or passing fibers depending on the leading polarity. Thus, asymmetric waveforms with equal charge per phase (i.e., increasing the leading phase duration and proportionately decreasing the amplitude) may be able to activate a more spatially localized or distributed population of neurons if the leading phase is cathodic or anodic, respectively. Here, we use two‐photon and mesoscale calcium imaging of GCaMP6s expressed in excitatory pyramidal neurons of male mice to investigate the role of pulse polarity and waveform asymmetry on the spatiotemporal properties of direct neuronal activation with 10‐Hz electrical stimulation. We demonstrate that increasing cathodic asymmetry effectively reduces neuronal activation and results in a more spatially localized subpopulation of activated neurons without sacrificing the density of activated neurons around the electrode. Conversely, increasing anodic asymmetry increases the spatial spread of activation and highly resembles spatiotemporal calcium activity induced by conventional symmetric cathodic stimulation. These results suggest that stimulation polarity and asymmetry can be used to modulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal activity thus increasing the effective parameter space of electrical stimulation to restore sensation and study circuit dynamics.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We have previously shown that repetitive induction of long‐term potentiation (LTP) by glutamate (100 μM, 3 min, three times at 24‐hr intervals) provoked long‐lasting synaptic enhancement accompanied by synaptogenesis in rat hippocampal slice cultures, a phenomenon termed RISE (repetitive LTP‐induced synaptic enhancement). Here, we examined the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐permeable (CP) AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the establishment of RISE. We first found a component sensitive to the Joro‐spider toxin (JSTX), a blocker of CP‐AMPARs, in a field EPSP recorded from CA3‐CA1 synapses at 2–3 days after stimulation, but this component was not found for 9–10 days. We also observed that rectification of AMPAR‐mediated current appeared only 2–3 days after stimulation, using a whole‐cell patch clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons. These findings indicate that CP‐AMPAR is transiently expressed in the developing phase of RISE. The blockade of CP‐AMPARs by JSTX for 24 hr at this developing phase inhibited RISE establishment, accompanied by the loss of small synapses at the ultrastructural level. These results suggest that transiently induced CP‐AMPARs play a critical role in synaptogenesis in the developing phase of long‐lasting hippocampal synaptic plasticity, RISE.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The encoding of information in spike phase relative to local field potential (LFP) oscillations offers several theoretical advantages over equivalent firing rate codes. One notable example is provided by place and grid cells in the rodent hippocampal formation, which exhibit phase precession—firing at progressively earlier phases of the 6–12 Hz movement‐related theta rhythm as their spatial firing fields are traversed. It is often assumed that such phase coding relies on a high amplitude baseline oscillation with relatively constant frequency. However, sustained oscillations with fixed frequency are generally absent in LFP and spike train recordings from the human brain. Hence, we examine phase coding relative to LFP signals with broadband low‐frequency (2–20 Hz) power but without regular rhythmicity. We simulate a population of grid cells that exhibit phase precession against a baseline oscillation recorded from depth electrodes in human hippocampus. We show that this allows grid cell firing patterns to multiplex information about location, running speed and movement direction, alongside an arbitrary fourth variable encoded in LFP frequency. This is of particular importance given recent demonstrations that movement direction, which is essential for path integration, cannot be recovered from head direction cell firing rates. In addition, we investigate how firing phase might reduce errors in decoded location, including those arising from differences in firing rate across grid fields. Finally, we describe analytical methods that can identify phase coding in the absence of high amplitude LFP oscillations with approximately constant frequency, as in single unit recordings from the human brain and consistent with recent data from the flying bat. We note that these methods could also be used to detect phase coding outside of the spatial domain, and that multi‐unit activity can substitute for the LFP signal. In summary, we demonstrate that the computational advantages offered by phase coding are not contingent on, and can be detected without, regular rhythmicity in neural activity.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>When faced with changing contingencies, animals can use memory to flexibly guide actions, engaging both frontal and temporal lobe brain structures. Damage to the hippocampus (HPC) impairs episodic memory, and damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) impairs cognitive flexibility, but the circuit mechanisms by which these areas support flexible memory processing remain unclear. The present study investigated these mechanisms by temporarily inactivating the medial PFC (mPFC), the dorsal HPC (dHPC), and the ventral HPC (vHPC), individually and in combination, as rats learned spatial discriminations and reversals in a plus maze. Bilateral inactivation of either the dHPC or vHPC profoundly impaired spatial learning and memory, whereas bilateral mPFC inactivation primarily impaired reversal versus discrimination learning. Inactivation of unilateral mPFC together with the contralateral dHPC or vHPC impaired spatial discrimination and reversal learning, whereas ipsilateral inactivation did not. Flexible spatial learning thus depends on both the dHPC and vHPC and their functional interactions with the mPFC.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The uncal apex is an anatomical landmark frequently used for segmenting the hippocampus into its anterior and posterior segments, a necessary step for computing many measurements of its long axis. It functions well, as it is both local to the hippocampus and easy to identify. However, in spite of widespread use and definition in the EADC‐ADNI Harmonized Hippocampal Protocol (HarP), how the uncal apex is influenced by gross hippocampal changes during normal aging has not been established, nor has the possible impact on measures of anterior hippocampus (aHPC) and posterior hippocampus (pHPC) volume. Here I drew upon three large data sets to describe and confirm these relationships, investigating them in one large data set and replicating my findings in the two others, evaluating a total of 4,434 hippocampi. I found the uncal apex fell in an increasingly more anterior position with increasing age. This age‐related retraction of the uncus began after age 36, with the sharpest effects arising after age 60. This phenomenon exaggerates age‐related aHPC volume decreases while simultaneously underestimating age‐related pHPC volume decreases, a pattern I confirmed by juxtaposing uncal apex and MNI space‐based landmarking. A hippocampally based reference frame was also rendered unstable by age‐related shifts in the posterior extent of the hippocampus. Both the uncal apex and hippocampal reference frame should therefore be used with caution in aging research, or in research involving other demographic or disease factors known to evoke gross changes in the hippocampus. Instead, MNI coordinate‐based heuristics may be appropriate for segmenting the hippocampus in study designs involving such factors. Apex‐based segmentation is still attractive, however, in study designs where advanced age and atrophy are not used as regressors, including investigations into long‐axis effects in healthy young adults. Progress toward localizing functional divisions within the hippocampus is needed to identify best practices for the field.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) is essential for the biosynthesis of many neuropeptides, including several of them in hippocampus. In mouse brain, lacking an enzymatically active PC2 (PC2‐null) causes accumulation of many neuropeptides in their precursor or intermediate forms. Little is known about how a PC2‐null state may affect the function of the hippocampus. In this study, adult PC2‐null mice and their wildtype (WT) littermates were subjected to three analyses to determine possible changes associated with PC2‐null at physiological, behavioral, and molecular levels, respectively, under normal and stressed conditions. Electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal slices were performed to measure evoked field‐excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP), long‐term potentiation (LTP), and paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF). Morris water maze (MWM) testing was conducted to examine behavioral changes that are indicative of hippocampal integrity. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis was used to determine changes in the hippocampal proteome in response to a focal cerebral ischemic insult. We found that there were no significant differences in the threshold of evoked EPSPs between PC2‐null and WT animals. However, an increase in LTP in both triggering rate and amplitude was observed in PC2‐null mice, suggesting that PC2 may be involved in regulating synaptic strength. The PPF, on the other hand, showed a decrease in PC2‐null mice, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism. Consistent with changes in LTP, PC2‐null mice displayed decreased latencies in finding the escape platform in the MWM test. Further, after distal focal cerebral ischemia, the hippocampal proteomes incurred changes in both WT and PC2‐null mice, with a prominent change in proteins associated with neurotransmission, exocytosis, and transport processes seen in the PC2‐null but not WT mice. Taken together, our results suggest that PC2 is involved in regulating hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory behaviors, as well as the hippocampal response to stresses originating in other regions of the brain.</p>

<p>It is well known that distributed learning (DL) leads to improved memory performance compared with massed learning (ML) (i.e., spacing effect). However, the extent to which the hippocampus is involved in the spacing effect at shorter and longer retention intervals remains unclear. To address this issue, two groups of participants were asked to encode face–scene pairs at 20‐min, 1‐day, and 1‐month intervals before they were scanned using fMRI during an associative recognition task. The pairs were repeated six times in either a massed (i.e., six times in 1 day) or a distributed (i.e., six times over 3 days, twice per day) manner. The results showed that compared with that in the ML group, the activation of the left hippocampus was stronger in the DL group when the participants retrieved old pairs correctly and rejected new pairs correctly at different retention intervals. In addition, the posterior hippocampus was more strongly activated when the new associations were rejected correctly after DL than ML, especially at the 1‐month interval. Hence, our results provide evidence that the hippocampus is involved in better memory performance after DL compared to ML at both shorter and longer retention intervals.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal mossy fibers have long been proposed to impose new patterns to learn onto CA3 neurons during new memory formation. However, inconsistent with this theory, we found in our previous study that mossy fiber stimulation induces only transient changes in CA3 spatial firing in a familiar environment. Here, we tested whether mossy fiber stimulation affects CA3 spatial firing differently between familiar and novel environments. We compared spatial firing of CA3 neurons before and after optogenetic stimulation of mossy fibers in freely behaving mice in a familiar and three sets of novel environments. We found that CA3 neurons are more responsive to mossy fiber stimulation in the novel than familiar environments. However, we failed to obtain evidence for long‐lasting effect of mossy fiber stimulation on spatial firing of CA3 neurons in both the familiar and novel environments. Our results provide further evidence against the view that mossy fibers carry teaching signals.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is evidence for a hippocampal long axis anterior–posterior (AP) differentiation in memory processing, which may have implications for the changes in episodic memory performance seen across development and aging. The hippocampus shows substantial structural changes with age, but the lifespan trajectories of hippocampal sub‐regions along the AP axis are not established. The aim of the present study was to test whether the micro‐ and macro‐structural age‐trajectories of the anterior (aHC) and posterior (pHC) hippocampus are different. In a single‐center longitudinal study, 1,790 cognitively healthy participants, 4.1–93.4 years of age, underwent a total of 3,367 MRI examinations and 3,033 memory tests sessions over 1–6 time points, spanning an interval up to 11.1 years. T1‐weighted scans were used to estimate the volume of aHC and pHC (macrostructure), and diffusion tensor imaging to measure mean diffusion (MD, microstructure) within each region. We found that the macro‐ and microstructural lifespan‐trajectories of aHC and pHC were clearly distinguishable, with partly common and partly unique variance shared with age. aHC showed a protracted period of microstructural development, while pHC microstructural development as indexed by MD was more or less completed in early childhood. In contrast, pHC showed larger unique aging‐related changes. An aHC–pHC difference was also observed for volume, with pHC changing relatively more with higher age. All regions showed age‐dependent relationships with episodic memory. aHC micro‐ and macrostructure was significantly related to verbal memory independently of age, but the relationships were still strongest among the older participants. We suggest that memory processes supported by each sub‐region improve or decline in concert with volumetric and microstructural changes in the same age‐period. Future research should disentangle the lifespan relationship between changes in these structural properties and different memory processes, encoding versus retrieval in particular, as well as other cognitive functions depending on the hippocampal long‐axis specialization.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the mammalian brain, newly acquired memories depend on the hippocampus (HPC) for maintenance and recall, but over time, the neocortex takes over these functions, rendering memories HPC‐independent. The process responsible for this transformation is called <i>systems memory consolidation </i>. Reactivation of a well‐consolidated memory can trigger a temporary return to a HPC‐dependent state, a phenomenon known as <i>systems memory reconsolidation </i>. The neural mechanisms underlying systems memory consolidation and reconsolidation are not well understood. Here, we propose a neural model based on well‐documented mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and stability and describe a computational implementation that demonstrates the model's ability to account for a range of findings from the systems consolidation and reconsolidation literature. We derive several predictions from the computational model and suggest experiments that may test its validity.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Compared to the upper limb, lower limb distal nerve transfer (DNT) outcomes are poor, likely due to the longer length of regeneration required. DNT surgery to treat foot drop entails rerouting a tibial nerve branch to the denervated common fibular nerve stump to reinnervate the tibialis anterior muscle for ankle dorsiflexion. Conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) prior to nerve repair surgery accelerates nerve regeneration and promotes sensorimotor recovery. We hypothesize that CES prior to DNT will promote nerve regeneration to restore ankle dorsiflexion.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One week following common fibular nerve crush, CES was delivered to the tibial nerve in half the animals, and at 2 weeks, all animals received a DNT. To investigate the effects of CES on nerve regeneration, a series of kinetic, kinematic, skilled locomotion, electrophysiologic, and immunohistochemical outcomes were assessed. The effects of CES on the nerve were investigated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CES‐treated animals had significantly accelerated nerve regeneration (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001), increased walking speed, and improved skilled locomotion. The injured limb had greater vertical peak forces, with improved duty factor, near‐complete recovery of braking, propulsive forces, and dorsiflexion (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.01). Reinnervation of the tibialis anterior muscle was confirmed with nerve conduction studies and immunohistochemical analysis of the neuromuscular junction. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that CES does not induce Wallerian degeneration, nor does it cause macrophage infiltration of the distal tibial nerve.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Tibial nerve CES prior to DNT significantly improved functional recovery of the common fibular nerve and its muscle targets without inducing injury to the donor nerve. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Myopic eyes grow too long so images are focused short of the retina. What controls this excessive growth? We know that across species, deprivation of detailed vision (form deprivation, FD) increases the rate of eye elongation and induces myopia. When the FD ceases, these myopic eyes then slow their growth and recover from their myopia. We show here that in young mammalian eyes, this bidirectional response still occurs after the optic nerve is cut, implicating local retinal control of eye growth. However, the FD eye grows excessively after optic nerve section showing that the fine‐tuning of eye growth requires an intact optic nerve.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myopia is induced when a growing eye wears a diffuser that deprives it of detailed spatial vision (form deprivation, FD). In chickens with optic nerve section (ONS), FD myopia still occurs, suggesting that the signals underlying myopia reside within the eye. As avian eyes differ from mammals, we asked whether local mechanisms also underlie FD myopia in a mammalian model. Young guinea pigs underwent either sham surgery followed by FD (SHAM + FD, <i>n </i> = 7); or ONS followed by FD (ONS + FD, <i>n </i> = 7); or ONS without FD (ONS, <i>n </i> = 9). FD was initiated 3 days after surgery with a diffuser that was worn on the surgically treated eye for 14 days. Animals with ONS + FD developed −8.9 D of relative myopia and elongated by 135 μm more than in their untreated eyes after 2 weeks of FD. These changes were significantly greater than those in SHAM + FD animals (−5.5 D and 40 μm of elongation after 14 days of FD), and reflected exaggerated elongation of the posterior vitreous chamber. The myopia reversed when FD was discontinued, despite ONS, but eyes did not recover back to normal (30 days after surgery, ONS + FD eyes still retained −3 D of relative myopia when SHAM+FD animals had returned to normal). No long‐term residual myopia was present after ONS alone, ruling out a surgical artifact. Although the gross mechanism signaling myopic ocular growth and its recovery in the young mammalian eye does not require an intact optic nerve, its fine‐tuning is disrupted by ONS.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub>) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and generation of the second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol‐1,4,5‐trisphosphate. PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub> can be generated by two families of kinases: type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases, encoded by PIP5K1A, PIP5K1B and PIP5K1C, and type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases, encoded by PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B, and PIP4K2C. While the roles of the type 1 enzymes in brain function have been extensively studied, the roles of the type 2 enzymes are poorly understood. Using selective antibodies validated by genetic deletion of pip4k2a or pip4k2b in mouse brain, we characterized the location of the enzymes, PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ, encoded by these genes. In mice, we demonstrate that PI5P4Kα is expressed in adulthood, whereas PI5P4Kβ is expressed early in development. PI5P4Kα localizes to white matter tracts, especially the corpus callosum, and at a low level in neurons, while PI5P4Kβ is expressed in neuronal populations, especially hippocampus and cortex. Dual labeling studies demonstrate that PI5P4Kα co‐localizes with the oligodendrocyte marker, Olig2, whereas PI5P4Kβ co‐localizes with the neuronal marker, NeuN. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that both kinases are contained in axon terminals and dendritic spines adjacent to the synaptic membrane, which support a potential role in synaptic transmission. Immunoperoxidase analysis of macaque and human brain tissue demonstrate a conserved pattern for PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ. These results highlight the diverse cell‐autonomous expression of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ and support further exploration into their role in synaptic function in the brain.</p>

<p>We review the neuroanatomical connections of the dorsal column nuclei complex (gracile, cuneate, external cuneate, X and Z nuclei) which highlight the connectivity to peripheral receptors as well as extensive direct connections to multiple sensorimotor brain regions. This connectivity highlights the role of the dorsal column nuclei complex in integrating and distributing somatosensory information serving discriminative touch, proprioception, and multimodal functional systems.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsal column nuclei complex (DCN‐complex) includes the dorsal column nuclei (DCN, referring to the gracile and cuneate nuclei collectively), external cuneate, X, and Z nuclei, and the median accessory nucleus. The DCN are organized by both somatotopy and modality, and have a diverse range of afferent inputs and projection targets. The functional organization and connectivity of the DCN implicate them in a variety of sensorimotor functions, beyond their commonly accepted role in processing and transmitting somatosensory information to the thalamus, yet this is largely underappreciated in the literature. To consolidate insights into their sensorimotor functions, this review examines the morphology, organization, and connectivity of the DCN and their associated nuclei. First, we briefly discuss the receptors, afferent fibers, and pathways involved in conveying tactile and proprioceptive information to the DCN. Next, we review the modality and somatotopic arrangements of the remaining constituents of the DCN‐complex. Finally, we examine and discuss the functional implications of the myriad of DCN‐complex projection targets throughout the diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain, in addition to their modulatory inputs from the cortex. The organization and connectivity of the DCN‐complex suggest that these nuclei should be considered a complex integration and distribution hub for sensorimotor information.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease 1 A (CMT1A) is caused by an intrachromosomal duplication of the gene encoding for <i>PMP22 </i> leading to peripheral nerve dysmyelination, axonal loss, and progressive muscle weakness. No therapy is available. PXT3003 is a low‐dose combination of baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol which has been shown to improve disease symptoms in <i>Pmp22 </i> transgenic rats, a bona fide model of CMT1A disease. However, the superiority of PXT3003 over its single components or dual combinations have not been tested. Here, we show that in a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co‐culture system derived from transgenic rats, PXT3003 induced myelination when compared to its single and dual components. Applying a clinically relevant (“translational”) study design in adult male CMT1A rats for 3 months, PXT3003, but not its dual components, resulted in improved performance in behavioral motor and sensory endpoints when compared to placebo. Unexpectedly, we observed only a marginally increased number of myelinated axons in nerves from PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats. However, in electrophysiology, motor latencies correlated with increased grip strength indicating a possible effect of PXT3003 on neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and muscle fiber pathology. Indeed, PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats displayed an increased perimeter of individual NMJs and a larger number of functional NMJs. Moreover, muscles of PXT3003 CMT1A rats displayed less neurogenic atrophy and a shift toward fast contracting muscle fibers. We suggest that ameliorated motor function in PXT3003‐treated CMT1A rats result from restored NMJ function and muscle innervation, independent from myelination.</p>

<p>Aim: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality/morbidity and is associated with chronic neuroinflammation. Melanocortin receptor agonists including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) ameliorate inflammation and provide a novel therapeutic approach. We examined the effect of long-acting cosyntropin (CoSyn), a synthetic ACTH analog, on the early inflammatory response and functional outcome following experimental TBI.</p><p>Methods: The controlled cortical impact model was used to induce TBI in mice. Mice were assigned to injury and treatment protocols resulting in four experimental groups including sham + saline, sham + CoSyn, TBI + saline, and TBI + CoSyn. Treatment was administered subcutaneously 3 h post-injury and daily injections were given for up to 7 days post-injury. The early inflammatory response was evaluated at 3 days post-injury through the evaluation of cytokine expression (IL1β and TNFα) and immune cell response. Quantification of immune cell response included cell counts of microglia/macrophages (Iba1+ cells) and neutrophils (MPO+ cells) in the cortex and hippocampus. Behavioral testing (n = 10–14 animals/group) included open field (OF) and novel object recognition (NOR) during the first week following injury and Morris water maze (MWM) at 10–15 days post-injury.</p><p>Results: Immune cell quantification showed decreased accumulation of Iba1+ cells in the perilesional cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus for CoSyn-treated TBI animals compared to saline-treated. Reduced numbers of MPO+ cells were also found in the perilesional cortex and hippocampus in CoSyn treated TBI mice compared to their saline-treated counterparts. Furthermore, CoSyn treatment reduced IL1β expression in the cortex of TBI mice. Behavioral testing showed a treatment effect of CoSyn for NOR with CoSyn increasing the discrimination ratio in both TBI and Sham groups, indicating increased memory performance. CoSyn also decreased latency to find platform during the early training period of the MWM when comparing CoSyn to saline-treated TBI mice suggesting moderate improvements in spatial memory following CoSyn treatment.</p><p>Conclusion: Reduced microglia/macrophage accumulation and neutrophil infiltration in conjunction with moderate improvements in spatial learning in our CoSyn treated TBI mice suggests a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of CoSyn following TBI.</p>

Objective<p>Asymmetry is a subtle but pervasive aspect of the human brain, which may be altered in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported that cerebral structural asymmetries are altered in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most of these studies were conducted at the region-of-interest level. At the functional level, there are few reports of resting-state functional asymmetries based on functional MRI. In this study, we investigated lateral differences in structural volumes and strengths of functional connectivity between individuals with AD and healthy controls (HCs) at the voxel level.</p>Methods<p>Forty-eight patients with AD and 32 matched HCs were assessed. An analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter volume was performed at the whole-brain level to explore anatomical cerebral asymmetries in AD. We then performed a seed-to-whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis to reveal FC asymmetries in AD. An asymmetry index (AI) was used to measure these changes, and the relationship between the structural and functional AIs and the clinical symptoms of AD was explored.</p>Results<p>A VBM analysis revealed a rightward and a leftward lateralization in the amygdala and the thalamus, respectively, in patients with AD. FC between the amygdala and the precuneus showed a rightward lateralization in AD, which was the opposite of the lateralization in the HCs. The asymmetric changes in structure and function were associated with disease severity and functional impairment in AD.</p>Conclusion<p>Our study highlights the value of considering asymmetries in the amygdala and the thalamus in clinical evaluations and their relevance to clinical measures.</p>

<p>Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key effector downstream of the Hippo signaling pathway and plays an important role in the development of the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS), especially regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of YAP in CNS diseases are still puzzling. Here, this review will systematically and comprehensively summarize the biological feature, pathological role, and underlying mechanisms of YAP in normal and pathologic CNS, which aims to provide insights into the potential molecular targets and new therapeutic strategies for CNS diseases.</p>

<p>The brainstem is a posterior region of the brain, composed of three parts, midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. It is critical in controlling heartbeat, blood pressure, and respiration, all of which are life-sustaining functions, and therefore, damages to or disorders of the brainstem can be lethal. Brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) recapitulate the course of human brain development and are expected to be useful for medical research on central nervous system disorders. However, existing organoid models are limited in the extent hPSCs recapitulate human brain development and hence are not able to fully elucidate the diseases affecting various components of the brain such as brainstem. Here, we developed a method to generate human brainstem organoids (hBSOs), containing midbrain/hindbrain progenitors, noradrenergic and cholinergic neurons, dopaminergic neurons, and neural crest lineage cells. Single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) analysis, together with evidence from proteomics and electrophysiology, revealed that the cellular population in these organoids was similar to that of the human brainstem, which raises the possibility of making use of hBSOs in investigating central nervous system disorders affecting brainstem and in efficient drug screenings.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00253">Neural Processing of Narratives: From Individual Processing to Viral Propagation</a></h4>

<p>Narratives, in the form of, e.g., written stories, mouth-to-mouth accounts, audiobooks, fiction movies, and media-feeds, powerfully shape the perception of reality and widely influence human decision-making. In this review, we describe findings from recent neuroimaging studies unraveling how narratives influence the human brain, thus shaping perception, cognition, emotions, and decision-making. It appears that narrative sense-making relies on default-mode network (DMN) structures of the brain, especially precuneus. Activity in precuneus further seems to differ for fictitious vs. real narratives. Notably, high inter-subject correlation (ISC) of brain activity during narrative processing seems to predict the efficacy of a narrative. Factors that enhance the ISC of brain activity during narratives include higher levels of attention, emotional arousal, and negative emotional valence. Higher levels of attentional suspense seem to co-vary with activity in the temporoparietal junction, emotional arousal with activity in dorsal attention network, and negative emotional valence with activity in DMN. Lingering after-effects of emotional narratives have been further described in DMN, amygdala, and sensory cortical areas. Finally, inter-individual differences in personality, and cultural-background related analytical and holistic thinking styles, shape ISC of brain activity during narrative perception. Together, these findings offer promising leads for future studies elucidating the effects of narratives on the human brain, and how such effects might predict the efficacy of narratives in modulating decision-making.</p>

<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with exercise training can enhance learning and retention of hand tasks; however, there have been few investigations of the effects of tDCS on leg skill improvements. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether tDCS paired with visuomotor step training can promote skill learning and retention. We hypothesized that pairing step training with anodal tDCS would improve skill learning and retention, evidenced by decreased step reaction times (RTs), both immediately (online skill gains) and 30 min after training (offline skill gains). Twenty healthy adults were randomly assigned to one of two groups, in which 20-min anodal or sham tDCS was applied to the lower limb motor cortex and paired with visuomotor step training. Step RTs were determined across three time points: (1) before brain stimulation (baseline); (2) immediately after brain stimulation (P0); and (3) 30 min after brain stimulation (P3). A continuous decline in RT was observed in the anodal tDCS group at both P0 and P3, with a significant decrease in RT at P3; whereas there were no improvements in RT at P0 and P3 in the sham group. These findings do not support our hypothesis that anodal tDCS enhances online learning, as RT was not decreased significantly immediately after stimulation. Nevertheless, the results indicate that anodal tDCS enhances offline learning, as RT was significantly decreased 30 min after stimulation, likely because of tDCS-induced neural modulation of cortical and subcortical excitability, synaptic efficacy, and spinal neuronal activity.</p>

<p>Effective central sensory integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive information is required to promote adaptability in response to changes in the environment during postural control. Patients with a lesion in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have an impaired ability to form an internal representation of body position, an important factor for postural control and adaptation. Suppression of PPC excitability has also been shown to decrease postural stability in some contexts. As of yet, it is unknown whether stimulation of the PPC may influence postural adaptation. This investigation aimed to identify whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the bilateral PPC could modulate postural adaptation in response to a bipedal incline postural adaptation task. Using young, healthy subjects, we delivered tDCS over bilateral PPC followed by bouts of inclined stance (incline-interventions). Analysis of postural after-effects identified differences between stimulation conditions for maximum lean after-effect (LAE; p = 0.005) as well as a significant interaction between condition and measurement period for the average position (p = 0.03). We identified impaired postural adaptability following both active stimulation conditions. Results reinforce the notion that the PPC is involved in motor adaptation and extend this line of research to the realm of standing posture. The results further highlight the role of the bilateral PPC in utilizing sensory feedback to update one’s internal representation of verticality and demonstrates the diffuse regions of the brain that are involved in postural control and adaptation. This information improves our understanding of the role of the cortex in postural control, highlighting the potential for the PPC as a target for sensorimotor rehabilitation.</p>

<p>The retrieval of autobiographical memories is an integral part of everyday social interactions. Prior laboratory research has revealed that older age is associated with a reduction in the retrieval of autobiographical episodic memories, and the ability to elaborate these memories with episodic details. However, how age-related reductions in episodic specificity unfold in everyday social contexts remains largely unknown. Also, constraints of the laboratory-based approach have limited our understanding of how autobiographical semantic memory is linked to older age. To address these gaps in knowledge, we used a smartphone application known as the Electronically Activated Recorder, or “EAR,” to unobtrusively capture real-world conversations over 4 days. In a sample of 102 cognitively normal older adults, we extracted instances where memories and future thoughts were shared by the participants, and we scored the shared episodic memories and future thoughts for their make-up of episodic and semantic detail. We found that older age was associated with a reduction in real-world sharing of autobiographical episodic and semantic memories. We also found that older age was linked to less episodically and semantically detailed descriptions of autobiographical episodic memories. Frequency and level of detail of shared future thoughts yielded weaker relationships with age, which may be related to the low frequency of future thoughts in general. Similar to laboratory research, there was no correlation between autobiographical episodic detail sharing and a standard episodic memory test. However, in contrast to laboratory studies, episodic detail production while sharing autobiographical episodic memories was weakly related to episodic detail production while describing future events, unrelated to working memory, and not different between men and women. Overall, our findings provide novel evidence of how older age relates to episodic specificity when autobiographical memories are assessed unobtrusively and objectively “in the wild.”</p>

Purpose<p>This study aimed to investigate the spectral and spatial signatures of neuromagnetic activity underlying the termination of absence seizures.</p>Methods<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded from 18 drug-naive patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Accumulated source imaging (ASI) was used to analyze MEG data at the source level in seven frequency ranges: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz), gamma (30–80 Hz), ripple (80–250 Hz), and fast ripple (250–500 Hz).</p>Result<p>In the 1–4, 4–8, and 8–12 Hz ranges, the magnetic source during seizure termination appeared to be consistent over the ictal period and was mainly localized in the frontal cortex (FC) and parieto-occipito-temporal junction (POT). In the 12–30 and 30–80 Hz ranges, a significant reduction in source activity was observed in the frontal lobe during seizure termination as well as a decrease in peak source strength. The ictal peak source strength in the 1–4 Hz range was negatively correlated with the ictal duration of the seizure, whereas in the 30–80 Hz range, it was positively correlated with the course of epilepsy.</p>Conclusion<p>The termination of absence seizures is associated with a dynamic neuromagnetic process. Frequency-dependent changes in the FC were observed during seizure termination, which may be involved in the process of neural network interaction. Neuromagnetic activity in different frequency bands may play different roles in the pathophysiological mechanism during absence seizures.</p>

<p>Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder in adults, and can often be medically refractory, requiring surgical intervention. MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a less invasive procedure that uses ultrasonic waves to induce lesions in the ventralis intermedius nucleus (VIM) to treat refractory ET. As with all procedures for treating ET, optimal targeting during MRgFUS is essential for efficacy and durability. Various studies have reported cases of tremor recurrence following MRgFUS and long-term outcome data is limited to 3–4 years. We present a tractography-based investigation on a case of DBS rescue for medically refractory ET that was treated with MRgFUS that was interrupted due to the development of dysarthria during the procedure. After initial improvement, her hand tremor started to recur within 6 months after treatment, and bilateral DBS was performed targeting the VIM 24 months after MRgFUS. DBS induced long-term tremor control with monopolar stimulation. Diffusion MRI tractography was used to reconstruct the dentatorubrothalamic (DRTT) and corticothalmic (CTT) tracts being modulated by the procedures to understand the variability in efficacy between MRgFUS and DBS in treating ET in our patient. By comparing the MRgFUS lesion and DBS volume of activated tissue (VAT), we found that the MRgFUS lesion was located ventromedially to the VAT, and was less than 10% of the size of the VAT. While the lesion encompassed the same proportion of DRTT streamlines, it encompassed fewer CTT streamlines than the VAT. Our findings indicate the need for further investigation of targeting the CTT when using neuromodulatory procedures to treat refractory ET for more permanent tremor relief.</p>

The proposed system was evaluated on simulated calcium imaging data, calcium imaging data with manual annotation, and calcium imaging data of the anterior lateral motor cortex. We found that the proposed system accurately detected neurons and extracted neural activities in real time without any requirement for expensive, cumbersome, or special-purpose computing hardware. We expect that the system will enable cost-effective, real-time calcium imaging-based neural decoding, leading to precise neuromodulation.</p>

<p>Neuron classification is an important component in analyzing network structure and quantifying the effect of neuron topology on signal processing. Current quantification and classification approaches rely on morphology projection onto lower-dimensional spaces. In this paper a 3D visualization and quantification tool is presented. The Density Visualization Pipeline (DVP) computes, visualizes and quantifies the density distribution, i.e., the “mass” of interneurons. We use the DVP to characterize and classify a set of GABAergic interneurons. Classification of GABAergic interneurons is of crucial importance to understand on the one hand their various functions and on the other hand their ubiquitous appearance in the neocortex. 3D density map visualization and projection to the one-dimensional x, y, z subspaces show a clear distinction between the studied cells, based on these metrics. The DVP can be coupled to computational studies of the behavior of neurons and networks, in which network topology information is derived from DVP information. The DVP reads common neuromorphological file formats, e.g., Neurolucida XML files, NeuroMorpho.orgSWC files and plain ASCII files. Full 3D visualization and projections of the density to 1D and 2D manifolds are supported by the DVP. All routines are embedded within the visual programming IDE VRL-Studio for Java which allows the definition and rapid modification of analysis workflows.</p>

<p>In the healthy brain, neuronal excitability and synaptic strength are homeostatically regulated to keep neuronal network activity within physiological boundaries. Epilepsy is characterized by episodes of highly synchronized firing across in widespread neuronal populations, due to a failure in regulation of network activity. Here we consider epilepsy as a failure of homeostatic plasticity or as a maladaptive response to perturbations in the activity. How homeostatic compensation is involved in epileptogenic processes or in the chronic phase of epilepsy, is still debated. Although several theories have been proposed, there is relatively little experimental evidence to evaluate them. In this perspective, we will discuss recent results that shed light on the potential role of homeostatic plasticity in epilepsy. First, we will present some recent insights on how homeostatic compensations are probably active before and during epileptogenesis and how their actions are temporally regulated and closely dependent on the progression of pathology. Then, we will consider the dual role of transcriptional regulation during epileptogenesis, and finally, we will underline the importance of homeostatic plasticity in the context of therapeutic interventions for epilepsy. While classic pharmacological interventions may be counteracted by the epileptic brain to maintain its potentially dysfunctional set point, novel therapeutic approaches may provide the neuronal network with the tools necessary to restore its physiological balance.</p>

<p>Neurons must establish and stabilize connections made with diverse targets, each with distinct demands and functional characteristics. At Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), synaptic strength remains stable in a manipulation that simultaneously induces hypo-innervation on one target and hyper-innervation on the other. However, the expression mechanisms that achieve this exquisite target-specific homeostatic control remain enigmatic. Here, we identify the distinct target-specific homeostatic expression mechanisms. On the hypo-innervated target, an increase in postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluR) abundance is sufficient to compensate for reduced innervation, without any apparent presynaptic adaptations. In contrast, a target-specific reduction in presynaptic neurotransmitter release probability is reflected by a decrease in active zone components restricted to terminals of hyper-innervated targets. Finally, loss of postsynaptic GluRs on one target induces a compartmentalized, homeostatic enhancement of presynaptic neurotransmitter release called presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) that can be precisely balanced with the adaptations required for both hypo- and hyper-innervation to maintain stable synaptic strength. Thus, distinct anterograde and retrograde signaling systems operate at pre- and post-synaptic compartments to enable target-specific, homeostatic control of neurotransmission.</p>

<p>Slit1 is a secreted axon guidance molecule, also involved in adult neurogenesis. In physiological conditions, Slit1 loss promotes ectopic dispersal of SVZ-derived neural precursors (SVZ-NPCs) into periventricular structures such as the corpus callosum. Demyelination of the corpus callosum triggers SVZ-NPC migration to ectopic locations and their recruitment by the lesion, suggesting a possible role for Slit1 in SVZ-NPCs ectopic dispersal regulation in pathological conditions. Here, we have investigated the function of Slit1 protein in the recruitment of SVZ-NPCs after CNS demyelination. We find that the dynamics of oligodendrogenesis and temporal profile of developmental myelination in Slit1<sup>–/–</sup> mice are similar to Slit1<sup>+/−</sup> controls. SVZ micro-dissection and RT-PCR from wild-type mice, show that Slits and Robos are physiologically regulated at the transcriptional level in response to corpus callosum demyelination suggesting their role in the process of SVZ-NPC ectopic migration in demyelinating conditions. Moreover, we find that the number of SVZ-NPCs recruited by the lesion increases in Sli1<sup>–/–</sup> mice compared to Slit1<sup>+/−</sup> mice, leading to higher numbers of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells within the lesion. Time-lapse video-microscopy of immuno-purified NPCs shows that Slit1-deficient cells migrate faster and make more frequent directional changes than control NPCs, supporting a cell-autonomous mechanism of action of Slit1 in NPC migration. In conclusion, while Slit1 does not affect the normal developmental process of oligodendrogenesis and myelination, it regulates adult SVZ-NPC ectopic migration in response to demyelination, and consequently oligodendrocyte renewal within the lesion.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of children with late diagnosed congenital hypothyroidism and cognitive alterations such as abnormal verbal memory processing suggest altered telencephalic commissural connections. The corpus callosum (CC) is the major inter-hemispheric commissure that contra-laterally connects neocortical areas. However, in late diagnosed neonates with congenital hypothyroidism, the possible effect of early transient and chronic postnatal hypothyroidism still remains unknown. We have studied the development of the anterior, middle and posterior CC, using in vivo MRI and electron microscopy in hypothyroid and control male rats. Four groups of methimazole (MMI) treated rats were studied. One group, as a model for early transient hypothyroidism, was MMI-treated from postnatal day (P) 0 to P21; some of these rats were also treated with L-thyroxine (T4) from P15 to 21. Another group modeling chronic hypothyroid, were treated with MMI from P0 to 150 and from embryonic day 10 to P170. The results obtained from these groups were compared with same age control rats. The normalized T2 signal obtained using MRI was higher in MMI-treated rats and correlated with a low number and percentage of myelinated axons. The number and density of myelinated axons decreased in transient and chronic hypothyroid rats at P150. The g-ratio (inner to outer diameter ratio) and the estimated conduction velocity of myelinated axons were similar between MMI-treated and controls, but the conduction delay decreased in the posterior CC of MMI-treated rats compared to controls. These data show that early postnatal transient and chronic hypothyroidism alters CC maturation in a way that may affect the callosal transfer of information. These alterations cannot be reversed after delayed T4-treatment. Our data support the findings of neurocognitive delay in late T4-treated children with congenital hypothyroidism.</p>

Alternative RNA splicing provides an important means to expand metazoan transcriptome diversity. Contrary to what was accepted previously, splicing is now thought to predominantly take place during transcription. Motivated by emerging data showing the physical proximity of the spliceosome to Pol II, we surveyed the effect of epigenetic context on co-transcriptional splicing. In particular, we observed that splicing factors were not necessarily enriched at exon junctions and that most epigenetic signatures had a distinctly asymmetric profile around known splice sites. Given this, we tried to build an interpretable model that mimics the physical layout of splicing regulation where the chromatin context progressively changes as the Pol II moves along the guide DNA. We used a recurrent-neural-network architecture to predict the inclusion of a spliced exon based on adjacent epigenetic signals, and we showed that distinct spatio-temporal features of these signals were key determinants of model outcome, in addition to the actual nucleotide sequence of the guide DNA strand. After the model had been trained and tested (with &gt;80% precision-recall curve metric), we explored the derived weights of the latent factors, finding they highlight the importance of the asymmetric time-direction of chromatin context during transcription.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TQRYXG8jUVE" width="1" />

Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is associated with cartilage degradation, ultimately leading to disability and decrease of quality of life. Two key mechanisms have been suggested to occur in PTOA: tissue inflammation and abnormal biomechanical loading. Both mechanisms have been suggested to result in loss of cartilage proteoglycans, the source of tissue fixed charge density (FCD). In order to predict the simultaneous effect of these degrading mechanisms on FCD content, a computational model has been developed. We simulated spatial and temporal changes of FCD content in injured cartilage using a novel finite element model that incorporates (1) diffusion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 into tissue, and (2) the effect of excessive levels of shear strain near chondral defects during physiologically relevant loading. Cytokine-induced biochemical cartilage explant degradation occurs near the sides, top, and lesion, consistent with the literature. In turn, biomechanically-driven FCD loss is predicted near the lesion, in accordance with experimental findings: regions near lesions showed significantly more FCD depletion compared to regions away from lesions (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01). Combined biochemical and biomechanical degradation is found near the free surfaces and especially near the lesion, and the corresponding bulk FCD loss agrees with experiments. We suggest that the presence of lesions plays a role in cytokine diffusion-driven degradation, and also predisposes cartilage for further biomechanical degradation. Models considering both these cartilage degradation pathways concomitantly are promising <i>in silico</i> tools for predicting disease progression, recognizing lesions at high risk, simulating treatments, and ultimately optimizing treatments to postpone the development of PTOA.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I4C0ko5UtRQ" width="1" />

Neuroimaging software methods are complex, making it a near certainty that some implementations will contain errors. Modern computational techniques (i.e., public code and data repositories, continuous integration, containerization) enable the reproducibility of the analyses and reduce coding errors, but they do not guarantee the scientific validity of the results. It is difficult, nay impossible, for researchers to check the accuracy of software by reading the source code; ground truth test datasets are needed. Computational reproducibility means providing software so that for the same input anyone obtains the same result, right or wrong. Computational validity means obtaining the right result for the ground-truth test data. We describe a framework for validating and sharing software implementations, and we illustrate its usage with an example application: population receptive field (pRF) methods for functional MRI data. The framework is composed of three main components implemented with containerization methods to guarantee computational reproducibility. In our example pRF application, those components are: (1) synthesis of fMRI time series from ground-truth pRF parameters, (2) implementation of four public pRF analysis tools and standardization of inputs and outputs, and (3) report creation to compare the results with the ground truth parameters. The framework was useful in identifying realistic conditions that lead to imperfect parameter recovery in all four pRF implementations, that would remain undetected using classic validation methods. We provide means to mitigate these problems in future experiments. A computational validation framework supports scientific rigor and creativity, as opposed to the oft-repeated suggestion that investigators rely upon a few agreed upon packages. We hope that the framework will be helpful to validate other critical neuroimaging algorithms, as having a validation framework helps (1) developers to build new software, (2) research scientists to verify the software’s accuracy, and (3) reviewers to evaluate the methods used in publications and grants.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b9TZVWhwLBs" width="1" />

<p>by Hadi Rahmaninejad, Tom Pace, Shashank Bhatt, Bin Sun, Peter Kekenes-Huskey</p>

Nucleotides comprise small molecules that perform critical signaling roles in biological systems. Adenosine-based nucleotides, including adenosine tri-, di-, and mono-phosphate, are controlled through their rapid degradation by diphosphohydrolases and ecto-nucleotidases (NDAs). The interplay between nucleotide signaling and degradation is especially important in synapses formed between cells, which create signaling ‘nanodomains’. Within these ‘nanodomains’, charged nucleotides interact with densely-packed membranes and biomolecules. While the contributions of electrostatic and steric interactions within such nanodomains are known to shape diffusion-limited reaction rates, less is understood about how these factors control the kinetics of nucleotidase activity. To quantify these factors, we utilized reaction-diffusion numerical simulations of 1) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis into adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and 2) AMP into adenosine (Ado) via two representative nucleotidases, CD39 and CD73. We evaluate these sequentially-coupled reactions in nanodomain geometries representative of extracellular synapses, within which we localize the nucleotidases. With this model, we find that 1) nucleotidase confinement reduces reaction rates relative to an open (bulk) system, 2) the rates of AMP and ADO formation are accelerated by restricting the diffusion of substrates away from the enzymes, and 3) nucleotidase co-localization and the presence of complementary (positive) charges to ATP enhance reaction rates, though the impact of these contributions on nucleotide pools depends on the degree to which the membrane competes for substrates. As a result, these contributions integratively control the relative concentrations and distributions of ATP and its metabolites within the junctional space. Altogether, our studies suggest that CD39 and CD73 nucleotidase activity within junctional spaces can exploit their confinement and favorable electrostatic interactions to finely control nucleotide signaling.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l36QJ9G5Tio" width="1" />

<p>by Chadi M. Saad-Roy, Nimalan Arinaminpathy, Ned S. Wingreen, Simon A. Levin, Joshua M. Akey, Bryan T. Grenfell</p>

Seasonal influenza A viruses of humans evolve rapidly due to strong selection pressures from host immune responses, principally on the hemagglutinin (HA) viral surface protein. Based on mouse transmission experiments, a proposed mechanism for immune evasion consists of increased avidity to host cellular receptors, mediated by electrostatic charge interactions with negatively charged cell surfaces. In support of this, the HA charge of the globally circulating H3N2 has increased over time since its pandemic. However, the same trend was not seen in H1N1 HA sequences. This is counter-intuitive, since immune escape due to increased avidity (due itself to an increase in charge) was determined experimentally. Here, we explore whether patterns of local charge of H1N1 HA can explain this discrepancy and thus further associate electrostatic charge with immune escape and viral evolutionary dynamics. Measures of site-wise functional selection and expected charge computed from deep mutational scan data on an early H1N1 HA yield a striking division of residues into three groups, separated by charge. We then explored evolutionary dynamics of these groups from 1918 to 2008. In particular, one group increases in net charge over time and consists of sites that are evolving the fastest, that are closest to the receptor binding site (RBS), and that are exposed to solvent (i.e., on the surface). By contrast, another group decreases in net charge and consists of sites that are further away from the RBS and evolving slower, but also exposed to solvent. The last group consists of those sites in the HA core, with no change in net charge and that evolve very slowly. Thus, there is a group of residues that follows the same trend as seen for the entire H3N2 HA. It is possible that the H1N1 HA is under other biophysical constraints that result in compensatory decreases in charge elsewhere on the protein. Our results implicate localized charge in HA interactions with host cells, and highlight how deep mutational scan data can inform evolutionary hypotheses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PtxpNxSaxPs" width="1" />

<p>by Jesús R. Requena</p>

The prion protein, PrP, can adopt at least 2 conformations, the overwhelmingly prevalent cellular conformation (PrP<sup>C</sup>) and the scrapie conformation (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). PrP<sup>C</sup> features a globular C-terminal domain containing 3 α-helices and a short β-sheet and a long flexible N-terminal tail whose exact conformation in vivo is not yet known and a metastable subdomain with β-strand propensity has been identified within it. The PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation is very rare and has the characteristics of an amyloid. Furthermore, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is a prion, i.e., it is infectious. This involves 2 steps: (1) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can template PrP<sup>C</sup> and coerce it to adopt the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation and (2) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can be transmitted between individuals, by oral, parenteral, and other routes and thus propagate as an infectious agent. However, this is a simplification: On the one hand, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is not a single conformation, but rather, a set of alternative similar but distinct conformations. Furthermore, other amyloid conformations of PrP exist with different biochemical and propagative properties. In this issue of <i>PLOS Biology</i>, Asante and colleagues describe the first murine model of familial human prion disease and demonstrate the emergence and propagation of 2 PrP amyloid conformers. Of these, one causes neurodegeneration, whereas the other does not. With its many conformers, PrP is a truly protean protein.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yKs_HtPxU78" width="1" />

Mitigating the threat of insecticide resistance in African malaria vector populations requires comprehensive information about where resistance occurs, to what degree, and how this has changed over time. Estimating these trends is complicated by the sparse, heterogeneous distribution of observations of resistance phenotypes in field populations. We use 6,423 observations of the prevalence of resistance to the most important vector control insecticides to inform a Bayesian geostatistical ensemble modelling approach, generating fine-scale predictive maps of resistance phenotypes in mosquitoes from the <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> complex across Africa. Our models are informed by a suite of 111 predictor variables describing potential drivers of selection for resistance. Our maps show alarming increases in the prevalence of resistance to pyrethroids and DDT across sub-Saharan Africa from 2005 to 2017, with mean mortality following insecticide exposure declining from almost 100% to less than 30% in some areas, as well as substantial spatial variation in resistance trends.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/9dyT9sprNO4" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) is required for maintaining peripheral sensory neuron survival and function; however, the underlying cellular mechanism remains unclear. The general view is that expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by the neuron itself is required for maintaining sensory neuron survival and myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Adopting a neuronal‐specific conditional knockout strategy, we demonstrate the partial depletion of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in neurons exerts little influence upon maintaining sensory neuron survival and peripheral nerve myelination in health and after demyelinating neuropathy. Our data show that the density and total number of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in 2‐month‐old mice is not affected following the deletion of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in large‐diameter myelinating neurons, as assessed by stereology. Adopting experimental autoimmune neuritis induced in adult male mice, an animal model of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, we identify that deleting p75<sup>NTR</sup> in myelinating neurons exerts no influence upon the disease progression, the total number of DRG neurons, and the extent of myelin damage in the sciatic nerve, indicating that the expression of neuronal p75<sup>NTR</sup> is not essential for maintaining peripheral neuron survival and myelination after a demyelinating insult <i>in vivo </i>. Together, results of this study suggest that the survival and myelination of peripheral sensory neurons is independent of p75<sup>NTR</sup> expressed by a subtype of neurons <i>in vivo </i>. Thus, our findings provide new insights into the mechanism underpinning p75<sup>NTR</sup>‐mediated neuronal survival in the PNS.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has long been observed to encode a representation of an animal's position in space. Recent evidence suggests that the nature of this representation is somewhat predictive and can be modeled by learning a successor representation (SR) between distinct positions in an environment. However, this discretization of space is subjective making it difficult to formulate predictions about how some environmental manipulations should impact the hippocampal representation. Here, we present a model of place and grid cell firing as a consequence of learning a SR from a basis set of known neurobiological features—boundary vector cells (BVCs). The model describes place cell firing as the successor features of the SR, with grid cells forming a low‐dimensional representation of these successor features. We show that the place and grid cells generated using the BVC‐SR model provide a good account of biological data for a variety of environmental manipulations, including dimensional stretches, barrier insertions, and the influence of environmental geometry on the hippocampal representation of space.</p>

<p>We examined the effects of zonisamide on transplanted human dopaminergic neurons in the rat striatum and found that zonisamide facilitates the survival of dopamine neurons, an effect that may be related to an increase in the expression of SLIT‐and NTRK‐like protein 6 in rat striatum.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The transplantation of dopaminergic (DA) progenitors derived from pluripotent stem cells improves the behavior of Parkinson's disease model animals. However, the survival of DA progenitors is low, and the final yield of DA neurons is only approximately 0.3%–2% the number of transplanted cells. Zonisamide (ZNS) increases the number of survived DA neurons upon the transplantation of mouse‐induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell‐derived DA progenitors in the rat striatum. In this study, we induced DA progenitors from human iPS cells and transplanted them into the striatum of female rats with daily administration of ZNS. The number of survived DA neurons was evaluated 1 and 4 months after transplantation by immunohistochemistry, which revealed that the number of survived DA neurons was significantly increased with the administration of ZNS. To assess the mechanism of action of ZNS, we performed a gene expression analysis to compare the gene expression profiles in striatum treated with or without ZNS. The analysis revealed that the expression of SLIT‐and NTRK‐like protein 6 (SLITRK6) was upregulated in rat striatum treated with ZNS. In conclusion, ZNS promotes the survival of DA neurons after the transplantation of human‐iPS cell‐derived DA progenitors in the rat striatum. SLITRK6 is suggested to be involved in this supportive effect of ZNS by modulating the environment of the host brain.</p>

<p>Glypican‐1 (GPC1) and ‐4 (GPC4) have previously been reported as markers of lineage‐specific neural stem cells. Here, their pheonotypical characteristics were further examined under neuronal differentiation conditions in the presence of brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and platelet‐derived growth factor‐B (PDGF‐B). GPC1 and GPC4 demonstrated differential localized expression during long‐term (40–60 days) neuronal differentiation, suggesting different functions within neural cells. Under BDNF conditions, higher GPC4 to GPC1 gene expression ratio correlated with increased heterogeneity, increased proliferation, and increased GABAergic marker expression. In contrast, PDGF conditions resulted in higher GPC1 to GPC4 gene expression ratio and resulting in decreased heterogeneity, increased spontaneous activity, and increased dopaminergic marker expression. Our results confirm GPC1 and GPC4 as human neural proteins providing a potential set of novel markers to characterize different neural cell populations in terms of maturity, heterogeneity, and subtype differentiation. </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Generating neurons from human stem cells has potential for brain damage therapy and neurogenesis modeling, but current efficacy is limited by culture heterogeneity and the lack of markers. We have previously reported the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) glypican‐1 (GPC1) and ‐4 (GPC4) as the markers of lineage‐specific human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and mediators of hNSC lineage potential. Here, we further examined phenotypical characteristics and GPC1 and GPC4 during neural differentiation of hNSCs in the presence of two neurogenic growth factors reported to bind to heparan sulfate: brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and platelet‐derived growth factor‐B (PDGF‐B). In hNSC neural cultures, GPC1 and GPC4 were expressed along neurites and cell bodies in long‐term (40–60 days) neural differentiation cultures demonstrating the areas of differential localization—suggesting potentially different functions. Neural differentiation cultures in the presence of BDNF or PDGF‐B generated phenotypically different neural cells with BDNF treatment associated with higher <i>GPC4 </i> versus <i>GPC1 </i> expression, increased heterogeneity, and differential neuron subtype marker expression to PDGF‐B cultures. PDGF‐B cultures exhibited higher levels of spontaneous activity and reduced heterogeneity over long‐term culture associated with decreased <i>GPC4 </i>. Untreated neural cultures were highly variable, supporting the use of neuroregulatory growth factors for guided differentiation. Targeted siRNA downregulation of GPC1/4 reduced neural differentiation markers and altered response to exogenous BDNF and PDGF‐B. This work confirms GPC1 and GPC4 as regulators of human neural differentiation and supports their use as novel markers of neural cell characterization.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hypoxic/ischemic insult, a leading cause of functional brain defects, has been extensively studied in both clinical and experimental animal research, including its etiology, neuropathogenesis, and pharmacological interventions. Transient sublethal hypoxia (TSH) is a common clinical occurrence in the perinatal period. However, its effect on early developing brains remains poorly understood. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of TSH on the dendrite and dendritic spine formation, neuronal and synaptic activity, and cognitive behavior of early postnatal Day 1 rat pups. While TSH showed no obvious effect on gross brain morphology, neuron cell density, or glial activation in the hippocampus, we found transient hypoxia did cause significant changes in neuronal structure and function. In brains exposed to TSH, hippocampal neurons developed shorter and thinner dendrites, with decreased dendritic spine density, and reduced strength in excitatory synaptic transmission. Moreover, TSH‐treated rats showed impaired cognitive performance in spatial learning and memory. Our findings demonstrate that TSH in newborn rats can cause significant impairments in synaptic formation and function, and long‐lasting brain functional deficits. Therefore, this study provides a useful animal model for the study of TSH on early developing brains and to explore potential pharmaceutical interventions for patients subjected to TSH insult.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent evidence implicates endogenous pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) in the aversive effect of nicotine. In the present study, we assessed if nicotine‐induced conditioned place preference (CPP) or affective signs of nicotine withdrawal would be altered in the absence of PACAP and if there were any sex‐related differences in these responses. Male and female mice lacking PACAP and their wild‐type controls were tested for baseline place preference on day 1, received conditioning with saline or nicotine (1 mg/kg) on alternate days for 6 days and were then tested for CPP the next day. Mice were then exposed to four additional conditioning and were tested again for nicotine‐induced CPP 24 hr later. Controls were conditioned with saline in both chambers and tested similarly. All mice were then, 96 hr later, challenged with mecamylamine (3 mg/kg), and tested for anxiety‐like behaviors 30 min later. Mice were then, 2 hr later, forced to swim for 15 min and then tested for depression‐like behaviors 24 hr later. Our results showed that male but not female mice lacking PACAP expressed a significant CPP that was comparable to their wild‐type controls. In contrast, male but not female mice lacking PACAP exhibited reduced anxiety‐ and depression‐like behaviors compared to their wild‐type controls following the mecamylamine challenge. These results suggest that endogenous PACAP is involved in affective signs of nicotine withdrawal, but there is a sex‐related difference in this response.</p>

<p>We compared post‐ictal hypoperfusion ASL MRI data in epilepsy patients to healthy controls to determine the location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ).

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI can provide seizure onset zone (SOZ) localizing information in up to 80% of patients. Clinical implementation of this technique is limited by the need to obtain two scans per patient: a postictal scan that is subtracted from an interictal scan. We aimed to determine whether it is possible to limit the number of ASL scans to one per patient by comparing patient postictal ASL scans to baseline scans of 100 healthy controls. Eighteen patients aged 20–55 years underwent ASL MRI &lt;90 min after a seizure and during the interictal period. Each postictal cerebral blood flow (CBF) map was statistically compared to average baseline CBF maps from 100 healthy controls (pvcASL; patient postictal CBF vs. control baseline CBF). The pvcASL maps were compared to subtraction ASL maps (sASL; patient baseline CBF minus patient postictal CBF). Postictal CBF reductions from pvcASL and sASL maps were seen in 17 of 18 (94.4%) and 14 of 18 (77.8%) patients, respectively. Maximal postictal hypoperfusion seen in pvcASL and sASL maps was concordant with the SOZ in 10 of 17 (59%) and 12 of 14 (86%) patients, respectively. In seven patients, both pvcASL and sASL maps showed similar results. In two patients, sASL showed no significant hypoperfusion, while pvcASL showed significant hypoperfusion concordant with the SOZ. We conclude that pvcASL is clinically useful and although it may have a lower overall concordance rate than sASL, pvcASL does provide localizing or lateralizing information for specific cases that would be otherwise missed through sASL.</p>

<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a complex sensorimotor disorder in which the role of the endogenous opioid system is not clear. This study suggests that the anemia of inflammation and loss of circadian variations in dopaminergic or serotonergic systems could underlie the pathogenesis of RLS.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an irresistible need to move the legs while sitting or lying at night with insomnia as a frequent consequence. Human RLS has been associated with abnormalities in the endogenous opioid system, the dopaminergic system, the iron regulatory system, anemia, and inflammatory and auto‐immune disorders. Our previous work indicates that mice lacking all three subtypes of opioid receptors have a phenotype similar to that of human RLS. To study the roles of each opioid receptor subtype in RLS, we first used mu opioid receptor knockout (MOR KO) mice based on our earlier studies using postmortem brain and cell culture. The KO mice showed decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells (RBCs), with an appearance of microcytic RBCs indicating anemia. Together with decreased serum iron and transferrin, but increased ferritin levels, the anemia is similar to that seen with chronic inflammation in humans. A decreased serum iron level was also observed in the wildtype mice treated with an MOR antagonist. Iron was increased in the liver and spleen of the KO mice. Normal circadian variations in the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems were absent in the KO mice. The KO mice showed hyperactivity and increased thermal sensitivity in wakefulness primarily during what would normally be the sleep phase similar to that seen in human RLS. Deficits in endogenous opioid system transmission could predispose to anemia of inflammation and loss of circadian variations in dopaminergic or serotonergic systems, thereby contributing to an RLS‐like phenotype.</p>

<p>Intersectional viral genetics allows for targeted expression in astrocytes. Olfactory bulb astrocyte calcium activity spatially matches neuronal activity patterns with odor stimulation. Manipulating astrocyte calcium activity alters neuronal activity and impacts olfactory behavior.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the central nervous system. They modulate synaptic function through a variety of mechanisms, and yet remain relatively understudied with respect to overall neuronal circuit function. Exploiting the tractability of the mouse olfactory system, we manipulated astrocyte activity and examined how astrocytes modulate olfactory bulb responses. Toward this, we genetically targeted both astrocytes and neurons for <i>in vivo </i> widefield imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to odor stimuli. We found that astrocytes exhibited odor response maps that overlap with excitatory neuronal activity. By manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes using chemical genetics we found that odor‐evoked neuronal activity was reciprocally affected, suggesting that astrocyte activation inhibits neuronal odor responses. Subsequently, behavioral experiments revealed that astrocyte manipulations affect both odor detection threshold and discrimination, suggesting that astrocytes play an active role in olfactory sensory processing circuits. Together, these studies show that astrocyte calcium signaling contributes to olfactory behavior through modulation of sensory circuits.</p>

<p>Golgi tendon organ pathways contribute to coordination of limb extensors during motor tasks including locomotion. Normally, these inhibitory force feedback pathways are flexibly weighted. We show that following spinal cord injury, force feedback is permanently reorganized. Balance is lost and biased inhibition emerges from toe flexors onto ankle extensors.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Inhibitory pathways from Golgi tendon organs project widely between muscles crossing different joints and axes of rotation. Evidence suggests that the strength and distribution of this intermuscular inhibition is dependent on motor task and corresponding signals from the brainstem. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether this sensory network is altered after spinal cord hemisection as a potential explanation for motor deficits observed after spinal cord injury (SCI). Force feedback was assessed between the long toe flexor and ankle plantarflexor (flexor hallucis longus), and the three major ankle extensors, (combined gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles) in the hind limbs of unanesthetized, decerebrate, female cats. Data were collected from animals with intact spinal cords (control) and lateral spinal hemisections (LSHs) including chronic LSH (4–20 weeks), subchronic LSH (2 weeks), and acute LSH. Muscles were stretched individually and in pairwise combinations to measure intermuscular feedback between the toe flexor and each of the ankle extensors. In control animals, three patterns were observed (balanced inhibition between toe flexor and ankle extensors, stronger inhibition from toe flexor to ankle extensor, and vice versa). Following spinal hemisection, only strong inhibition from toe flexors onto ankle extensors was observed independent of survival time. The results suggest immediate and permanent reorganization of force feedback in the injured spinal cord. The altered strength and distribution of force feedback after SCI may be an important future target for rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) signaling is mediated by two receptor types, CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub>. Herein, we demonstrate that genetic CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor deficiency (CRF<sub>2</sub>−/−) reduces sociability in female mice <i>but </i> increases it in male mice. Moreover, the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor‐preferring antagonist antalarmin reverses sociability in both female and male wild‐type (CRF<sub>2</sub>+/+) and CRF<sub>2</sub>−/− mice.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dysfunctional social behavior is a major clinical feature of mood, anxiety, autism spectrum, and substance‐related disorders, and may dramatically contribute to the poor outcome of these diseases. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying social behavior deficits are still largely unknown. The corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) system, a major coordinator of the stress response, has been hypothesized to modulate social behavior. CRF signaling is mediated by two receptor types, termed CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub>. Using the three‐chamber task for sociability (i.e., preference for an unfamiliar conspecific vs. an object), this study demonstrates that CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor null mutation (CRF<sub>2</sub>−/−) reduces sociability in female mice <i>but </i> increases it in male mice. Both female and male CRF<sub>2</sub>−/− mice display a preference for social odor cues over neutral cues, indicating that sex‐ and CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor‐dependent sociability is not due to altered olfaction or impaired social cues discrimination. Moreover, treatment with the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor‐preferring antagonist, antalarmin, consistently induces sociability in non‐social mice but disrupts it in social mice, independently of CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor deficiency. Sex, CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor deficiency, or antalarmin affect locomotor activity during the three‐chamber test. However, throughout the study CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor‐linked sociability is independent of locomotor activity. The present findings highlight major functions for the CRF system in the regulation of social behavior. Moreover, they provide initial evidence of sex‐linked roles for the CRF<sub>1</sub> and the CRF<sub>2</sub> receptor, emphasizing the importance of sex as a major biological variable to be taken into consideration in preclinical and clinical studies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epidemiological data from the last decades point to an exponential growth in the number of obese people. Different behavioral factors, mainly associated with food consumption, appear to contribute significantly to its development. Concomitant with increased obesity rates, an increase in the consumption of fructose has been observed; therefore, fructose consumption has been implicated as an important obesogenic factor. However, changes in brain activity due to fructose consumption are possible, especially in relation to hypothalamic satiety mechanisms. In addition, the obese state may provide an environment of chronic inflammation and further contribute to the discontinuation of satiety mechanisms in the hypothalamus. We briefly review the intrinsic alterations to the increased adipose tissue, its connections with the hypothalamus in the control of energy signaling mechanisms and, consequently, the participation of fructose as a co‐adjuvant or trigger. Presenting the current context with clinical trials involving human and animal studies, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of the role of fructose in the progression of obesity.</p>

<p>Alcohol‐dependent individuals present a differential pattern of resting‐state EEG‐MEG connectivity, as well as local communication alterations in brain network. Results point toward difficulties in information flow efficiency and cost, and a possible compensatory effort.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is supporting evidence of alcohol negative effects on the brain: neuroimaging and psychophysiological studies finding anatomical and functional connectivity (FC) changes associated with the dependence process. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate brain FC and network characteristics of alcohol‐dependent individuals in resting state. For this study, we included males diagnosed with alcohol dependence (<i>N </i> = 25) and a group of healthy individuals (<i>N </i> = 23). Simultaneous EEG‐MEG (electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic) activity was recorded in 5 min of eyes‐closed resting state. EEG‐MEG activity was preprocessed and FC was computed through the leakage‐corrected version of phase locking value (ciPLV). Additionally, local (degree, efficiency, clustering) and global (efficiency, characteristic path length) network parameters were computed. Connectivity analysis showed an increase in phase‐lagged synchronization, mainly between frontal and frontotemporal regions, in high beta band, and a decrease in interhemispheric gamma, for alcohol‐dependent individuals. Network analysis revealed intergroup differences at the local level for high beta, indicating higher degree, clustering, and efficiency, mostly at frontal nodes, together with a decrease in these measures at more posterior sites for patients’ group. The hyper‐synchronization in beta, next to the hypo‐synchronization in gamma, could indicate an alteration in communication between hemispheres, but also a possible functional compensation mechanism in neural circuits. This could be also supported by network characteristic data, where local alterations in communication are observed.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>CGRP pathway inhibitors are emerging treatments for migraine. CGRP‐mediated vasodilation is, however, a critical rescue mechanism in ischemia. We, therefore, investigated whether gepants, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, worsen cerebral ischemia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Middle cerebral artery was occluded for 12–60 minutes in mice. We compared infarct risk and volumes, collateral flow and neurological deficits after pretreatment with olcegepant (single or 10 daily doses of 0.1–1 mg/kg) or rimegepant (single doses of 10–100 mg/kg) versus vehicle. We also determined their potency on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse and human vessels, <i>in vitro </i>.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Olcegepant (1 mg/kg, single dose) increased infarct risk after 12‐ to 20‐minute occlusions mimicking transient ischemic attacks (14/19 versus 6/18 with vehicle, relative risk 2.21, p &lt; 0.022), and doubled infarct volumes (p &lt; 0.001) and worsened neurological deficits (median score 9 versus 5 with vehicle, p = 0.008) after 60‐minute occlusion. Ten daily doses of 0.1‐1 mg/kg olcegepant yielded similar results. Rimegepant 10 mg/kg increased infarct volumes by 60% after 20‐minute ischemia (p = 0.03); 100 mg/kg caused 75% mortality after 60‐minute occlusion. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mice, olcegepant 1 mg/kg increased infarct size after 30‐minute occlusion (1.6‐fold, p = 0.017). Both gepants consistently diminished collateral flow and reduced reperfusion success. Olcegepant was 10‐fold more potent than rimegepant on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse aorta.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Gepants worsened ischemic stroke in mice via collateral dysfunction. CGRP pathway blockers might thus aggravate coincidental cerebral ischemic events. The cerebrovascular safety of these agents must therefore be better delineated, especially in patients at increased risk of ischemic events or on prophylactic CGRP inhibition.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To demonstrate that antibodies from patients with anti‐N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis alter the levels of dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) and dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) and cause psychotic‐like features in mice.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis or controls, and the effects on clusters of D1R and D2R were quantified. <i>In vivo </i> studies included 71 C57BL/6J mice that were chronically infused with patients' or controls' CSF through ventricular catheters connected to subcutaneous osmotic pumps. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startling reflex (PPI; a marker of psychotic‐like behavior), memory, locomotor activity, and density of cell‐surface and synaptic D1R, D2R, and NMDAR clusters were examined at different time points using reported techniques.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In cultured neurons, patients' CSF, but not controls' CSF, caused a significant decrease of cell‐surface D1R and an increase of D2R clusters. In mice, patients' CSF caused a significant decrease of synaptic and total cell‐surface D1R clusters and an increase of D2R clusters associated with a decrease of PPI. These effects were accompanied by memory impairment and a reduction of surface NMDARs, as reported in this model. The psychotic‐like features, memory impairment, and changes in levels of D1R, D2R, and NMDAR progressively improved several days after the infusion of patients' CSF stopped.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In addition to memory deficits and reduction of NMDARs, CSF antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis cause reversible psychotic‐like features accompanied by changes (D1R decrease, D2R increase) in cell‐surface dopamine receptor clusters.</p>

<p>Reducing the extent of secondary degeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) is necessary to preserve function, but treatment options have thus far been limited. A combination of the ion channel inhibitors Lomerizine (Lom), YM872 and oxATP, to inhibit voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable AMPA receptors, and purinergic P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors respectively, effectively limits secondary consequences of injury in in vitro and in vivo models of CNS injury. Here, we investigated the efficacy of these inhibitors in a clinically relevant model of SCI. Fischer (F344) rats were subjected to a moderate (150 kD) contusive SCI at thoracic level T10 and assessed at 2 weeks or 10 weeks post-injury. Lom was delivered orally twice daily and YM872 and oxATP were delivered via osmotic mini-pump implanted at the time of SCI until 2 weeks following injury. Open field locomotion analysis revealed that treatment with the three inhibitors in combination improved the rate of functional recovery of the hind limb (compared to controls) as early as 1-day post-injury, with beneficial effects persisting to 14 days post-injury, while all three inhibitors were present. At 2 weeks following combinatorial treatment, the functional improvement was associated with significantly decreased cyst size, increased immunoreactivity of β-III tubulin<sup>+ve</sup> axons, myelin basic protein, and reduced lipid peroxidation by-products, and increased CC1<sup>+ve</sup> oligodendrocytes and NG2<sup>+ve</sup>/PDGFα<sup>+ve</sup> oligodendrocyte progenitor cell densities, compared to vehicle-treated SCI animals. The combination of Lom, oxATP, and YM872 shows preclinical promise for control of secondary degeneration following SCI, and further investigation of long-term sustained treatment is warranted.</p>

<p>This study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism of stroke and to explore the effect of miR-224-5p in hypoxic cortical neurons. Firstly, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model with Sprague–Dawley rats. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed the brain infarction of an MCAO rat. Longa scores of rats were significantly increased in 12th, 24th, and 48th hours after MCAO. Then, we found that miR-224-5p was increased after MCAO in rats by qRT-PCR. In order to investigate the effect of miR-224-5p in hypoxic neurons, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model with cortical neurons. MiR-224-5p was also upregulated in neurons after OGD by qRT-PCR. After transfection of the miR-224-5p inhibitor, the number of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01) in comparison to the anti-NC group. Furthermore, Tuj1<sup>+</sup> (neuronal marker) staining and TUNEL assay (to detect apoptotic cells) were performed in neurons. The survival of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group was significantly improved (P &lt; 0.01), while the apoptosis of neurons in the anti-miR-224-5p group was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01), when compared with that of the anti-NC group. In addition, we predicted that potential target genes of miR-224-5p were nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), and ring finger protein 38 (RNF38) with bioinformatics databases, such as TargetScan, miRDB, miRmap, and miRanda. The result of qRT-PCR confirmed that NR4A1 was significantly decreased after hypoxic injury (P &lt; 0.01). Meanwhile, luciferase reporter’s assay indicated that NR4A1 was the direct target of miR-224-5p. Compared with the anti-miR-224-5p + siNC group, the number of cortical neurons and the length of the neuron axon in the anti-miR-224-5p + si-NR4A1 group were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01), and the number of neuronal apoptosis in the anti-miR-224-5p + si-NR4A1 group was increased (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, miR-224-5p played a crucial role in hypoxic neuron injury through NR4A1, which might be an important regulatory mechanism in OGD injury of neurons.</p>

<p>The disruption of neuronal iron homeostasis and oxidative stress are related to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring enzyme cofactor with antioxidant and iron chelator properties and has many known effects. ALA has neuroprotective effects on PD. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we established PD models induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to explore the neuroprotective ability of ALA and its underlying mechanism in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that ALA could provide significant protection from 6-OHDA-induced cell damage in vitro by decreasing the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and iron. ALA significantly promoted the survival of the dopaminergic neuron in the 6-OHDA-induced PD rat model and remarkably ameliorated motor deficits by dramatically inhibiting the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase expression and superoxide dismutase activity in the substantia nigra. Interestingly, ALA attenuated 6-OHDA-induced iron accumulation both in vivo and in vitro by antagonizing the 6-OHDA-induced upregulation of iron regulatory protein 2 and divalent metal transporter 1. These results indicated that the neuroprotective mechanism of ALA against neurological injury induced by 6-OHDA may be related to the regulation of iron homeostasis and reduced oxidative stress levels. Therefore, ALA may provide neuroprotective therapy for PD and other diseases related to iron metabolism disorder.</p>

We measured the motor cortical excitability changes and intracortical inhibition.</p>Results<p>A dose of 1,800 pulses of aiTBS per day is tolerable. The iTBS1800 led to a reduced cortical excitability; whereas iTBS600 × 3<sup>∗</sup>10 and iTBS600 × 3<sup>∗</sup>30 enhanced cortical excitability to a differential extent.

<p>Objective: To reveal clinical characteristics of suboptimal responses to deep brain stimulation (DBS) in a multi-country DYT1 dystonia cohort.</p><p>Methods: In this multi-country multi-center retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical data of DYT1 patients who experienced suboptimal responses to DBS defined as &lt;30% improvement in dystonia scales at the last follow-up compared with baseline. We used a literature-driven historical cohort of 112 DYT1 patients for comparison.</p><p>Results: Approximately 8% of our study cohort (11 out of 132) experienced suboptimal responses to DBS. Compared with the historical cohort, the multi-country cohort with suboptimal responses had a significantly younger age at onset (mean, 7.0 vs. 8.4 years; p = 0.025) and younger age at DBS (mean, 12.0 vs. 18.6 years; p = 0.019). Additionally, cranial involvement was more common in the multi-country cohort (before DBS, 64% vs. 45%, p = 0.074; before or after DBS, 91% vs. 47%, p = 0.001). Mean motor improvement at the last follow-up from baseline were 0% and 66% for the multi-country and historical cohorts, respectively. All 11 patients of the multi-country cohort had generalization of dystonia within 2.5 years after disease onset. All patients experienced dystonia improvement of &gt;30% postoperatively; however, secondary worsening of dystonia commenced between 6 months and 3 years following DBS. The improvement at the last follow-up was less than 30% despite optimally-placed leads, a trial of multiple programming settings, and additional DBS surgeries in all patients. The on-/off-stimulation comparison at the long-term follow-up demonstrated beneficial effects of DBS despite missing the threshold of 30% improvement over baseline.</p><p>Conclusion: Approximately 8% of patients represent a more aggressive phenotype of DYT1 dystonia characterized by younger age at onset, faster disease progression, and cranial involvement, which seems to be associated with long-term suboptimal responses to DBS (e.g., secondary worsening). This information could be useful for both clinicians and patients in clinical decision making and patient counseling before and following DBS implantations. Patients with this phenotype may have different neuroplasticity, neurogenetics, or possibly distinct neurophysiology.</p>

<p>Studies investigating the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on fatigue and muscle activity have elicited measurable improvements using stimulation intensities ≤2 mA and submaximal effort tasks. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 2 mA and 4 mA anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) on performance fatigability and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the leg muscles during a maximal isokinetic task in healthy young adults. A double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover study design was applied. Twenty-seven active young adults completed four sessions, each spaced by 5–8 days. During session 1, dominance was verified with isokinetic strength testing, and subjects were familiarized with the fatigue task (FT). The FT protocol included 40 continuous maximum isokinetic contractions of the knee extensors and flexors (120°/s, concentric/concentric). During Sessions 2–4, tDCS was applied for 20 min with one of three randomly assigned intensities (sham, 2 mA or 4 mA) and the FT was repeated. The anode and cathode of the tDCS device were placed over C3 and the contralateral supraorbital area, respectively. A wireless EMG system collected muscle activity during the FT. The 2 mA tDCS condition had significantly less torque (65.9 ± 32.7 Nm) during the FT than both the sham (68.4 ± 33.9 Nm, p &lt; 0.001) and 4 mA conditions (68.4 ± 33.9 Nm, p = 0.001). Furthermore, the 2 mA condition (33.8 ± 11.7%) had significantly less EMG activity during the FT than both the sham (39.7 ± 10.6%, p &lt; 0.001) and 4 mA conditions (40.5 ± 13.4%, p = 0.001). Contrary to previous submaximal isometric fatigue investigations, the 2 mA tDCS condition significantly reduced torque production and EMG activity of the leg extensors during a maximal isokinetic FT compared with the sham and 4 mA conditions. Also, torque production and EMG activity in the 4 mA condition were not significantly different from sham. Thus, the effects of tDCS, and the underlying mechanisms, might not be the same for different tasks and warrants more investigation.</p>

<p>Past empirical studies have suggested that older adults preferentially use gaze-based mood regulation to lessen their negative experiences while watching an emotional scene. This preference for a low cognitively demanding regulatory strategy leaves open the question of whether the effortful processing of a more cognitively demanding reappraisal task is really spared from the general age-related decline. Because it does not allow perceptual attention to be redirected away from the emotional source, music provides an ideal way to address this question. The goal of our study was to examine the affective, behavioral, physiological, and cognitive outcomes of positive and detached reappraisal in response to negative musical emotion in younger and older adults. Participants first simply listened to a series of threatening musical excerpts and were then instructed to either positively reappraise or to detach themselves from the emotion elicited by music. Findings showed that, when instructed to simply listen to threatening music, older adults reported a more positive feeling associated with a smaller SCL in comparison with their younger counterparts. When implementing positive and detached reappraisal, participants showed more positive and more aroused emotional experiences, whatever the age group. We also found that the instruction to intentionally reappraise negative emotions results in a lesser cognitive cost for older adults in comparison with younger adults. Taken together, these data suggest that, compared to younger adults, older adults engage in spontaneous downregulation of negative affect and successfully implement downregulation instructions. This extends previous findings and brings compelling evidence that, even when auditory attention cannot be redirected away from the emotional source, older adults are still more effective at regulating emotions. Taking into account the age-associated decline in executive functioning, our results suggest that the working memory task could have distracted older adults from the reminiscences of the threat-evoking music, thus resulting in an emotional downregulation. Hence, even if they were instructed to implement reappraisal strategies, older adults might prefer distraction over engagement in reappraisal. This is congruent with the idea that, although getting older, people are more likely to be distracted from a negative source of emotion to maintain their well-being.</p>

<p>Neural synchronization patterns are involved in several complex cognitive functions and constitute a growing trend in neuroscience research. While synchrony patterns in working memory have been extensively discussed, a complete understanding of their role in cognitive control and inhibition is still elusive. Here, we provide an up-to-date review on synchronization patterns underlying behavioral inhibition, extrapolating common grounds, and dissociating features with other inhibitory functions. Moreover, we suggest a schematic conceptual framework and highlight existing gaps in the literature, current methodological challenges, and compelling research questions for future studies.</p>

<p>Although physical exercise has been demonstrated to augment recovery of the post-stroke brain, the question of what level of exercise intensity optimizes neurological outcomes of post-stroke rehabilitation remains unsettled. In this study, we aim to clarify the mechanisms underlying the intensity-dependent effect of exercise on neurologic function, and thereby to help direct the clinical application of exercise-based neurorehabilitation. To do this, we used a well-established rat model of ischemic stroke consisting of cerebral ischemia induction through middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Ischemic rats were subsequently assigned either to a control group entailing post-stroke rest or to one of two exercise groups distinguished by the intensity of their accompanying treadmill regimens. After 24 h of reperfusion, exercise was initiated. Infarct volume, apoptotic cell death, and neurological defects were quantified in all groups at 3 days, and motor and cognitive functions were tracked up to day-28. Additionally, Western blotting was used to assess the influence of our interventions on several proteins related to synaptogenesis and neuroplasticity (growth-associated protein 43, a microtubule-associated protein, postsynaptic density-95, synapsin I, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, tyrosine kinase B, and cAMP response element-binding protein). Our results were in equal parts encouraging and surprising. Both mild and intense exercise significantly decreased infarct volume, cell death, and neurological deficits. Motor and cognitive function, as determined using an array of tests such as beam balance, forelimb placing, and the Morris water maze, were also significantly improved by both exercise protocols. Interestingly, while an obvious enhancement of neuroplasticity proteins was shown in both exercise groups, mild exercise rats demonstrated a stronger effect on the expressions of Tau (p &lt; 0.01), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (p &lt; 0.01), and tyrosine kinase B (p &lt; 0.05). These findings contribute to the growing body of literature regarding the positive effects of both mild and intense long-term treadmill exercise on brain injury, functional outcome, and neuroplasticity. Additionally, the results may provide a base for our future study regarding the regulation of HIF-1α on the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway in the biochemical processes underlying post-stroke synaptic plasticity.</p>

<p>Photoreceptor cell death and inflammation are known to occur progressively in retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological processes are largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are essential mediators of cell-to-cell communication with emerging roles in the modulation of immune responses. EVs, including exosomes, encapsulate and transfer microRNA (miRNA) to recipient cells and in this way can modulate the environment of recipient cells. Dysregulation of EVs however is correlated to a loss of cellular homeostasis and increased inflammation. In this work we investigated the role of isolated retinal small-medium sized EV (s-mEV) which includes exosomes in both the healthy and degenerating retina. Isolated s-mEV from normal retinas were characterized using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and western blotting, and quantified across 5 days of photo-oxidative damage-induced degeneration using nanotracking analysis. Small RNAseq was used to characterize the miRNA cargo of retinal s-mEV isolated from healthy and damaged retinas. Finally, the effect of exosome inhibition on cell-to-cell miRNA transfer and immune modulation was conducted using systemic daily administration of exosome inhibitor GW4869 and in situ hybridization of s-mEV-abundant miRNA, miR-124-3p. Electroretinography and immunohistochemistry was performed to assess functional and morphological changes to the retina as a result of GW4869-induced exosome depletion. Results demonstrated an inverse correlation between s-mEV concentration and photoreceptor survivability, with a decrease in s-mEV numbers following degeneration. Small RNAseq revealed that s-mEVs contained uniquely enriched miRNAs in comparison to in whole retinal tissue, however, there was no differential change in the s-mEV miRNAnome following photo-oxidative damage. Exosome inhibition via the use of GW4869 was also found to exacerbate retinal degeneration, with reduced retinal function and increased levels of inflammation and cell death demonstrated following photo-oxidative damage in exosome-inhibited mice. Further, GW4869-treated mice displayed impaired translocation of photoreceptor-derived miR-124-3p to the inner retina during damage. Taken together, we propose that retinal s-mEV and their miRNA cargo play an essential role in maintaining retinal homeostasis through immune-modulation, and have the potential to be used in targeted gene therapy for retinal degenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein are central to Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for these events are not fully understood. Post-translational modifications of α-synuclein regulate several of its properties, including degradation, interaction with proteins and membranes, aggregation and toxicity. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification involved in various nuclear and extranuclear processes, such as subcellular protein targeting, mitochondrial fission and synaptic plasticity. Protein SUMOylation increases in response to several stressful situations, from viral infections to trauma. In this framework, an increasing amount of evidence has implicated SUMOylation in several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. This review will discuss recent findings in the role of SUMOylation as a regulator of α-synuclein accumulation, aggregation and toxicity, and its possible implication in neurodegeneration that underlies PD.</p>

Monitoring outcome is critical for acquiring skilled movements. Levy et al. describe activity in subpopulations of layer 2–3 motor cortex pyramidal neurons that distinctly report outcomes of previous successes and failures independent of kinematics and reward. These signals may serve as reinforcement learning processes involved in maintaining or learning skilled movements.

<p>by Seha Kim, Johannes Burge</p>

Visual systems estimate the three-dimensional (3D) structure of scenes from information in two-dimensional (2D) retinal images. Visual systems use multiple sources of information to improve the accuracy of these estimates, including statistical knowledge of the probable spatial arrangements of natural scenes. Here, we examine how 3D surface tilts are spatially related in real-world scenes, and show that humans pool information across space when estimating surface tilt in accordance with these spatial relationships. We develop a hierarchical model of surface tilt estimation that is grounded in the statistics of tilt in natural scenes and images. The model computes a global tilt estimate by pooling local tilt estimates within an adaptive spatial neighborhood. The spatial neighborhood in which local estimates are pooled changes according to the value of the local estimate at a target location. The hierarchical model provides more accurate estimates of groundtruth tilt in natural scenes and provides a better account of human performance than the local model. Taken together, the results imply that the human visual system pools information about surface tilt across space in accordance with natural scene statistics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vvVMYJ-9G20" width="1" />

<p>by Emili Balaguer-Ballester, Ramon Nogueira, Juan M. Abofalia, Ruben Moreno-Bote, Maria V. Sanchez-Vives</p>

Shared neuronal variability has been shown to modulate cognitive processing. However, the relationship between shared variability and behavioral performance is heterogeneous and complex in frontal areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Mounting evidence shows that single-units in OFC encode a detailed cognitive map of task-space events, but the existence of a robust neuronal ensemble coding for the predictability of choice outcome is less established. Here, we hypothesize that the coding of foreseeable outcomes is potentially unclear from the analysis of units activity and their pairwise correlations. However, this code might be established more conclusively when higher-order neuronal interactions are mapped to the choice outcome. As a case study, we investigated the trial-to-trial shared variability of neuronal ensemble activity during a two-choice interval-discrimination task in rodent OFC, specifically designed such that a lose-switch strategy is optimal by repeating the rewarded stimulus in the upcoming trial. Results show that correlations among triplets are higher during correct choices with respect to incorrect ones, and that this is sustained during the entire trial. This effect is not observed for pairwise nor for higher than third-order correlations. This scenario is compatible with constellations of up to three interacting units assembled during trials in which the task is performed correctly. More interestingly, a state-space spanned by such constellations shows that only correct outcome states that can be successfully predicted are robust over 100 trials of the task, and thus they can be accurately decoded. However, both incorrect and unpredictable outcome representations were unstable and thus non-decodeable, due to spurious negative correlations. Our results suggest that predictability of successful outcomes, and hence the optimal behavioral strategy, can be mapped out in OFC ensemble states reliable over trials of the task, and revealed by sufficiency complex neuronal interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PGyrJ6PKf94" width="1" />

During embryogenesis, morphogens form a concentration gradient in responsive tissue, which is then translated into a spatial cellular pattern. The mechanisms by which morphogens spread through a tissue to establish such a morphogenetic field remain elusive. Here, we investigate by mutually complementary simulations and <i>in vivo</i> experiments how Wnt morphogen transport by cytonemes differs from typically assumed diffusion-based transport for patterning of highly dynamic tissue such as the neural plate in zebrafish. Stochasticity strongly influences fate acquisition at the single cell level and results in fluctuating boundaries between pattern regions. Stable patterning can be achieved by sorting through concentration dependent cell migration and apoptosis, independent of the morphogen transport mechanism. We show that Wnt transport by cytonemes achieves distinct Wnt thresholds for the brain primordia earlier compared with diffusion-based transport. We conclude that a cytoneme-mediated morphogen transport together with directed cell sorting is a potentially favored mechanism to establish morphogen gradients in rapidly expanding developmental systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lDRf_GSbN80" width="1" />

<p>Using TAT‐Cre‐mediated transduction of tdTomato in tanycytes, this study morphologically describes peculiar protrusions along tanycyte processes. Combining tdTomato filling, fluorescence immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, the authors show in 3D reconstructions the diverse tanycyte partners as well as the subcellular organelles and transporters present in tanycyte protrusions. 3V, third ventricle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MVB, multivesicular bodies.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tanycytes are highly specialized ependymal cells that line the bottom and the lateral walls of the third ventricle. In contact with the cerebrospinal fluid through their cell bodies, they send processes into the arcuate nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus, and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. In the present work, we combined transgenic and immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical associations between tanycytes and neural cells present in the hypothalamic parenchyma, in particular in the arcuate nucleus. The specific expression of tdTomato in tanycytes first allowed the observation of peculiar subcellular protrusions along tanycyte processes and at their endfeet such as spines, swelling, en passant boutons, boutons, or claws. Interestingly, these protrusions contact different neural cells in the brain parenchyma including blood vessels and neurons, and in particular NPY and POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Using both fluorescent and electron microscopy, we finally observed that these tanycyte protrusions contain ribosomes, mitochondria, diverse vesicles, and transporters, suggesting dense tanycyte/neuron and tanycyte/blood vessel communications. Altogether, our results lay the neuroanatomical basis for tanycyte/neural cell interactions, which will be useful to further understand cell‐to‐cell communications involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>An in‐depth understanding of the genetics and evolution of brain function and behavior requires a detailed mapping of gene expression in functional brain circuits across major vertebrate clades. Here we present the <b>Z </b>ebra finch <b>E </b>xpression <b>Br </b>ain <b>A </b>tlas (<b>ZEBrA </b>; <a href="http://www.zebrafinchatlas.org" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">www.zebrafinchatlas.org</a>, RRID: SCR_012988), a web‐based resource that maps the expression of genes linked to a broad range of functions onto the brain of zebra finches. ZEBrA is a first of its kind gene expression brain atlas for a bird species and a first for any sauropsid. ZEBrA's &gt;3,200 high‐resolution digital images of <i>in situ </i> hybridized sections for ~650 genes (as of June 2019) are presented in alignment with an annotated histological atlas and can be browsed down to cellular resolution. An extensive relational database connects expression patterns to information about gene function, mouse expression patterns and phenotypes, and gene involvement in human diseases and communication disorders. By enabling brain‐wide gene expression assessments in a bird, ZEBrA provides important substrates for comparative neuroanatomy and molecular brain evolution studies. ZEBrA also provides unique opportunities for linking genetic pathways to vocal learning and motor control circuits, as well as for novel insights into the molecular basis of sex steroids actions, brain dimorphisms, reproductive and social behaviors, sleep function, and adult neurogenesis, among many fundamental themes.</p>

<p>Using a high‐resolution data set of electron microscopy images of a fruit fly brain, we traced the axons of two major subgroups of auditory sensory neurons, Johnston's organ (JO)‐A and JO‐B, and major downstream neurons, antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC)‐B1 and giant fiber (GF), in the song‐relay and escape pathways, respectively. JO‐A and JO‐B neurons have abundant presynapses and postsynapses along their axons. Specific types of JO‐A and JO‐B neurons feed into the AMMC‐B1 and/or GF pathways.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many animals rely on acoustic cues to decide what action to take next. Unraveling the wiring patterns of the auditory neural pathways is prerequisite for understanding such information processing. Here, we reconstructed the first step of the auditory neural pathway in the fruit fly brain, from primary to secondary auditory neurons, at the resolution of transmission electron microscopy. By tracing axons of two major subgroups of auditory sensory neurons in fruit flies, low‐frequency tuned Johnston's organ (JO)‐B neurons and high‐frequency tuned JO‐A neurons, we observed extensive connections from JO‐B neurons to the main second‐order neurons in both the song‐relay and escape pathways. In contrast, JO‐A neurons connected strongly to a neuron in the escape pathway. Our findings suggest that heterogeneous JO neuronal populations could be recruited to modify escape behavior whereas only specific JO neurons contribute to courtship behavior. We also found that all JO neurons have postsynaptic sites at their axons. Presynaptic modulation at the output sites of JO neurons could affect information processing of the auditory neural pathway in flies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Melanopsin ganglion cells have defied convention since their discovery almost 20 years ago. In the years following, many types of these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) have emerged. In the mouse retina, there are currently six known types (M1–M6) of melanopsin ganglion cells, each with unique morphology, mosaics, connections, physiology, projections, and functions. While melanopsin‐expressing cells are usually associated with behaviors like circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex, the characterization of multiple types has demonstrated a reach that may extend far beyond non‐image‐forming vision. In fact, studies have shown that individual types of melanopsin ganglion cells have the potential to impact image‐forming functions like contrast sensitivity and color opponency. Thus, the goal of this review is to summarize the morphological and functional aspects of the six known types of melanopsin ganglion cells in the mouse retina and to highlight their respective roles in non‐image‐forming and image‐forming vision. Although many melanopsin ganglion cell types do project to image‐forming brain targets, it is important to note that this is only the first step in determining their influence on image‐forming vision. Even so, the visual system has canonically been divided into these two functional realms and melanopsin ganglion cells have begun to challenge the boundary between them, providing an overlap of visual information that is complementary rather than redundant. Further studies on these ganglion cell photoreceptors will no doubt continue to illustrate an ever‐expanding role for melanopsin ganglion cells in image‐forming vision.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Connections from intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs), to ascending motor and interneurons have been described in guinea pig colon. These mono‐ and polysynaptic circuits may underlie polarized motor reflexes evoked by local gut stimulation. There is a need to translate findings in guinea pig to mouse, a species increasingly used in enteric neuroscience. Here, mouse distal colon was immunolabeled for CGRP, a marker of putative IPANs. This revealed a combination of large, intensely immunofluorescent axons in myenteric plexus and circular muscle, and thinner varicose axons with less immunofluorescence. The latter formed dense, basket‐like varicosity clusters (CGRP+ baskets) that enveloped myenteric nerve cell bodies. Immunolabeling after 4–5 days in organ culture caused loss of large CGRP+ axons, but not varicose CGRP+ fibers and CGRP+ baskets. Baskets were characterized further by triple labeling with CGRP, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and calretinin (CALR) antibodies. Approximately half (48%) of nerve cell bodies inside CGRP+ baskets lacked both NOS and CALR, while two overlapping populations containing NOS and/or CALR comprised the remainder. Quantitative analysis revealed CGRP+ varicosities were most abundant in baskets, followed by CALR+ varicosities, with a high degree of colocalization between the two markers. Few NOS+ varicosities occurred in baskets. Significantly higher proportions of CALR+ and CGRP+ varicosities colocalized in baskets than in circular muscle. In conclusion, CGRP+ baskets in mouse colon are formed by intrinsic enteric neurons with a neurochemical profile consistent with IPANs and have direct connections to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</p>

<p>In the study, we identified two subsets of Lyve‐1 positive cells in the cervical dura of rats. The first subset was lymphatic VEGFR3 positive endothelial cells, while the second subset were nonlymphatic VEGFR3 negative, but CD68 or CD169 positive macrophage. Interestingly, there were no dual VEGFR3‐Lyve‐1 positive cells in the spinal dura, but were CD169 positive macrophages. The endothelial Lyve‐1 positive cells were aligned with collagen fibers in the meningeal connective tissue. Moreover, some of the Lyve‐1 positive macrophages contained intracellular collagen. The role of these Lyve‐1 positive macrophages in meninges is yet unknown.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Meningeal immunity along with its associated lymphatic vasculatures is widely discussed recently. Lymphatic vessels in meninges drain interstitial fluid into the deep‐cervical lymph nodes. The vessels are composed of cells that express the cardinal marker for lymphatic endothelium—the lymphatic vessel hyaluronan receptor‐1 (Lyve‐1). However, studies also show the presence of nonendothelial Lyve‐1 expressing cells in certain tissues. Therefore, we were curious if nonendothelial Lyve‐1+ cells are also present in dura mater of meninges. We show that Lyve‐1+ endothelial cells are distributed adjacent to the blood vessels in the brain dura mater of rats. We did not observe any lymphatic vessels in spinal dura mater. Interestingly, we also observed isolated population of nonlymphatic Lyve‐1+ cells in both brain and spinal dura mater. Morphologically, the Lyve‐1+ cells were extensively pleomorphic, sometimes elongated or round. Surprisingly, the thoracolumbal meningeal Lyve‐1+ cells were predominantly round in morphology. Using endothelial specific marker VEGFR3 and macrophage markers CD68 and CD169, we observed that the isolated Lyve‐1+ cells lacked endothelial cell signature, but were either CD68+ or CD169+ macrophages. Moreover, we observed that the Lyve‐1+ cells colocalized with collagen fibers in the meninges, and some of Lyve‐1+ cells had intracellular collagen. The study for the first time demonstrates the presence of Lyve‐1 positive macrophages in the lymphatic and nonlymphatic regions in the meninges of rats.</p>

<p>ATP‐activated P2X7 (P2RX7) and adenosine receptors are involved in the progression of the majority of retinopathies leading to blindness. Purinergic signaling regulates progenitor proliferative activity in regeneration, growth, and development as well as proliferative retinopathies. We found that BzATP—a potent agonist of P2RX7—<i>in vivo </i> treatment provoked photoreceptor death and regeneration via multipotent progenitor mitotic activation. Furthermore, extracellular ATP via P2RX7 and adenosine via A<sub>2A</sub>R are key signals regulating retina regeneration with neuroprotective activity following photoreceptor injury.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Injured retinas in mammals do not regenerate and heal with loss of function. The adult retina of zebrafish self‐repairs after damage by activating cell‐intrinsic mechanisms, which are regulated by extrinsic signal interactions. Among relevant regulatory extrinsic systems, purinergic signaling regulates progenitor proliferation during retinogenesis and regeneration and glia proliferation in proliferative retinopathies. ATP‐activated P2X7 (P2RX7) and adenosine (P1R) receptors are involved in the progression of almost all retinopathies leading to blindness. Here, we examined P2RX7 and P1R participation in the retina regenerative response induced by photoreceptor damage caused by a specific dose of CoCl<sub>2</sub>. First, we found that treatment of uninjured retinas with a potent agonist of P2RX7 (BzATP) provoked photoreceptor damage and mitotic activation of multipotent progenitors. In CoCl<sub>2</sub>‐injured retinas, blockade of endogenous extracellular ATP activity on P2RX7 caused further neurodegeneration, Müller cell gliosis, progenitor proliferation, and microglia reactivity. P2RX7 inhibition in injured retinas also increased the expression of <i>lin28a </i> and <i>tnfα </i> genes, which are related to multipotent progenitor proliferation. Levels of <i>hif1α </i>, <i>vegf3r </i>, and <i>vegfaa </i> mRNA were enhanced by blockade of P2RX7 immediately after injury, indicating hypoxic like damage and endothelial cell growth and proliferation. Complete depletion of extracellular nucleotides with an apyrase treatment strongly potentiated cell death and progenitor proliferation induced with CoCl<sub>2</sub>. Blockade of adenosine P1 and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors (A<sub>2A</sub>R) had deleterious effects and deregulated normal timing for progenitor and precursor cell proliferation following photoreceptor damage. ATP via P2RX7 and adenosine via A<sub>2A</sub>R are survival extracellular signals key for retina regeneration in zebrafish.</p>

<p>Representative fluorescence in situ hybridization micrographs revealing the expression of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) mRNA in adult mouse brain. Generally speaking, CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA is widely expressed in the whole brain with sexually dimorphic distribution in the orbital cortex, insular cortex, cingulate cortex, piriform cortex, visual cortex, striatum, ventral hippocampal CA1, fornix, and dorsal hypothalamic area.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) is the most abundant G protein‐coupled receptor in the brain and plays crucial roles in emotion and behavior by modulating or mediating synaptic transmission and plasticity. Differences in CB<sub>1</sub>R density between male and female rodents may be associated with distinct behavioral phenotypes. In the rat brain, CB<sub>1</sub>R expression is significantly lower in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of estrus females than in males. However, differences in CB<sub>1</sub>R distribution due to sex over the whole mouse brain are still largely unknown. Here, we systemically investigated the expression of CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA in the brains of both male and female adult C57BL/6J mice using fluorescence in situ hybridization. There were significantly more CB<sub>1</sub>R positive cells in males than in females in the orbital cortex, insular cortex, cingulate cortex, piriform cortex, secondary visual cortex, caudate putamen (striatum), and ventral hippocampal CA1. There were significantly more CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA cells in females than males in the fornix and dorsal hypothalamus. However, in some regions, strong hybridization signals without sex differences were detected, such as in the motor cortex, septum, medial habenular nucleus, and inferior colliculus. Moreover, female mice displayed different CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA expression patterns in the medial amygdala, basolateral amygdala, and parabrachial nucleus during different phases of the estrous cycle. These findings provide a basis for understanding sexual dimorphism in physiological and pathological brain functions related to CB<sub>1</sub>R.</p>
