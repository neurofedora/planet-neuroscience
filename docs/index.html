                arXiv:2410.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) model various physical phenomena, such as electromagnetic fields and fluid mechanics. Methods like Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and PDE-Net 2.0 have been developed to identify and model PDEs based on data using sparse optimization and deep neural networks, respectively. While PDE models are less commonly applied to fMRI data, they hold the potential for uncovering hidden connections and essential components in brain activity. Using the ADHD200 dataset, we applied Canonical Independent Component Analysis (CanICA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction of fMRI data. We then used Sparse Ridge Regression to identify PDEs from the reduced data, achieving high accuracy in classifying attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study demonstrates a novel approach to extracting meaningful features from fMRI data for neurological disorder analysis to understand the role of oxygen transport (delivery $\&$ consumption) in the brain during neural activity relevant for studying intracranial pathologies.

                arXiv:2410.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives information flow between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph $C^*$-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger algebra, which captures the diversity of potential information pathways. Coupled with the gauge action, this graph algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of information flow within the network. Specifically, we show that the KMS states of this system yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions, with computational illustrations based on the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network.

                arXiv:2410.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidence estimates are often "detection-like" - driven by positive evidence in favour of a decision. This empirical observation has been interpreted as showing human metacognition is limited by biases or heuristics. Here we show that Bayesian confidence estimates also exhibit heightened sensitivity to decision-congruent evidence in higher-dimensional signal detection theoretic spaces, leading to detection-like confidence criteria. This effect is due to a nonlinearity induced by normalisation of confidence by a large number of unchosen alternatives. Our analysis suggests that detection-like confidence is rational when computing confidence in a higher-dimensional evidence space than that assumed by the experimenter.

                arXiv:2211.15963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present the Digital Brain (DB), a platform for simulating spiking neuronal networks at the large neuron scale of the human brain based on personalized magnetic-resonance-imaging data and biological constraints. The DB aims to reproduce both the resting state and certain aspects of the action of the human brain. An architecture with up to 86 billion neurons and 14,012 GPUs, including a two-level routing scheme between GPUs to accelerate spike transmission up to 47.8 trillion neuronal synapses, was implemented as part of the simulations. We show that the DB can reproduce blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals of the resting-state of the human brain with a high correlation coefficient, as well as interact with its perceptual input, as demonstrated in a visual task. These results indicate the feasibility of implementing a digital representation of the human brain, which can open the door to a broad range of potential applications.

                arXiv:2410.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge of multimodal optimization problems is identifying multiple peaks with high accuracy in multidimensional search spaces with irregular landscapes. This work proposes the Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch algorithm, which addresses the challenge of multimodal optimization problems by introducing a specialized mechanism for each operator. Inspired by the evolution of the universe, Multiple Global Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch groups the best individuals of the population into cluster-based centers of mass and then expands them with a progressively lower disturbance to guarantee convergence. During this process, it (i) applies a distance-based filtering to remove unnecessary elites such that the ones on smaller peaks are not lost, (ii) promotes isolated individuals based on their niche count after clustering, and (iii) balances exploration and exploitation during offspring generation to target specific accuracy levels. Experimental results on twenty multimodal benchmark test functions show that Multiple Gloal Peaks Big Bang-Big Crunch generally performs better or competitively with respect to other state-of-the-art multimodal optimization algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18580">Spatial-Temporal Search for Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs achieve competitive performances on benchmark tasks like image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not optimal for SNNs. In this work, we apply Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find suitable architectures for SNNs. Previous NAS methods for SNNs focus primarily on the spatial dimension, with a notable lack of consideration for the temporal dynamics that are of critical importance for SNNs. Drawing inspiration from the heterogeneity of biological neural networks, we propose a differentiable approach to optimize SNN on both spatial and temporal dimensions. At spatial level, we have developed a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based operation is optimized on both the cell and the layer level under computational constraints. We further propose a differentiable surrogate gradient search (DGS) method to evolve local SG functions independently during training. At temporal level, we explore an optimal configuration of diverse temporal dynamics on different types of spiking neurons by evolving their time constants, based on which we further develop hybrid networks combining SNN and ANN, balancing both accuracy and efficiency. Our methods achieve comparable classification performance of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracies of 96.43%, 78.96%, and 70.21%, respectively. On event-based deep stereo, our methods find optimal layer variation and surpass the accuracy of specially designed ANNs with 26$\times$ lower computational cost ($6.7\mathrm{mJ}$), demonstrating the potential of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18900">Comparative Analysis of Indicators for Multiobjective Diversity Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indicator-based (multiobjective) diversity optimization aims at finding a set of near (Pareto-)optimal solutions that maximizes a diversity indicator, where diversity is typically interpreted as the number of essentially different solutions. Whereas, in the first diversity-oriented evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm, the NOAH algorithm by Ulrich and Thiele, the Solow Polasky Diversity (also related to Magnitude) served as a metric, other diversity indicators might be considered, such as the parameter-free Max-Min Diversity, and the Riesz s-Energy, which features uniformly distributed solution sets. In this paper, focusing on multiobjective diversity optimization, we discuss different diversity indicators from the perspective of indicator-based evolutionary algorithms (IBEA) with multiple objectives. We examine theoretical, computational, and practical properties of these indicators, such as monotonicity in species, twinning, monotonicity in distance, strict monotonicity in distance, uniformity of maximizing point sets, computational effort for a set of size~n, single-point contributions, subset selection, and submodularity. We present new theorems -- including a proof of the NP-hardness of the Riesz s-Energy Subset Selection Problem -- and consolidate existing results from the literature. In the second part, we apply these indicators in the NOAH algorithm and analyze search dynamics through an example. We examine how optimizing with one indicator affects the performance of others and propose NOAH adaptations specific to the Max-Min indicator.

Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on digital platforms has underscored the need for robust and scalable detection mechanisms. Traditional methods often fall short in handling large and diverse datasets due to limitations in scalability and accuracy. In this paper, we propose NexusIndex, a novel framework and model that enhances fake news detection by integrating advanced language models, an innovative FAISSNexusIndex layer, and attention mechanisms. Our approach leverages multi-model embeddings to capture rich contextual and semantic nuances, significantly improving text interpretation and classification accuracy. By transforming articles into high-dimensional embeddings and indexing them efficiently, NexusIndex facilitates rapid similarity searches across extensive collections of news articles. The FAISSNexusIndex layer further optimizes this process, enabling real-time detection and enhancing the system's scalability and performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that NexusIndex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and accuracy across diverse datasets.

                arXiv:2410.16677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid detection of gas concentration is important in different domains like gas leakage monitoring, pollution control, and so on, for the prevention of health hazards. Out of different types of gas sensors, Metal oxide (MOx) sensors are extensively used in such applications because of their portability, low cost, and high sensitivity for specific gases. However, how to effectively sample the MOx data for the real-time detection of gas and its concentration level remains an open question. Here we introduce a simple analog front-end for one MOx sensor that encodes the gas concentration in the time difference between pulses of two separate pathways. This front-end design is inspired by the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. We show that for a gas pulse injected in a constant airflow, the time difference between pulses decreases with increasing gas concentration, similar to the spike time difference between the two principal output neurons in the olfactory bulb. The circuit design is further extended to a MOx sensor array and this sensor array front-end was tested in the same environment for gas identification and concentration estimation. Encoding of gas stimulus features in analog spikes at the sensor level itself may result in data and power-efficient real-time gas sensing systems in the future that can ultimately be used in uncontrolled and turbulent environments for longer periods without data explosion.

	<p>Background: Revised El Escorial (rEEC) and Awaji criteria are currently used for diagnosing and categorizing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, they are complex; their sensitivity is still not optimal for research purposes, and they present high inter-rater variability in clinical practice. To address these points, in 2019, a new set of diagnostic criteria was proposed, namely the Gold Coast criteria (GCC), characterized by a dichotomous diagnostic categorization, i.e., ALS or not ALS. Methods:&amp;amp;nbsp;In order to investigate the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical usefulness of GCC in a practical clinical setting, we retrospectively evaluated 131 patients diagnosed with ALS and 104 control subjects. ALSFRS-R score, electrophysiological tests, neuroradiological investigations, and CSF analysis were obtained. rEEC, Awaji, and GCC were applied at the first and last evaluations. Results: The sensitivity of GCC (93.1%; 96.1%) was greater than rEEC (71.8%; 87%) and Awaji criteria (77.8%; 89.3%) both at the first visit and last follow-up. The GCC&amp;amp;rsquo;s specificity (28.8%) is lower than that of the other two criteria (rEEC 45.2%; Awaji 43.3%). Conclusions: Our study suggests that in a real-world setting, the GCC are more sensitive and have substantially lower risk of false negative diagnoses than rEEC and Awaji criteria. Although rEEC had the highest specificity, they may delay the diagnosis. Systematically using the GCC could help to achieve an earlier diagnosis and quickly refer patients to the correct management. The low specificity of GCC is likely to not significantly impact patient recruitment in clinical trials; therefore, its use might allow a faster and earlier enrollment.</p>

                Background Underwater gliders are widely used in marine applications for monitoring purposes. These gliders must withstand hydrodynamic forces and maintain its body stability. The underwater environments are highly unpredictable, and small changes in the environment can lead to significant instability in underwater vehicles. Methods This study uses different numerical techniques to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a torpedo-shaped glider. A symmetric torpedo-shaped glider model was created and analyzed using a licensed version of ANSYS 20.1 Fluent tool. The behavior of the torpedo glider under various flow conditions was examined such as variation of grid test, change of turbulent models, the variation in the inflow boundary conditions involves varying the velocity from 10.16 m/s to 15.16 m/s in 1m/s increment and from 10.16 m/s to 7.66 m/s in 0.5 m/s, also six different models were analyzed. Results Research was also attempted with different turbulent models and the Spalart-Allmara model was producing least validation error of 1.28 % with a primary focus on nose optimization. By varying the nose length, the study aimed to identify the best-suited nose geometry to minimize drag force. The nose lengths were varied to 0.205 m and 0.19m, resulting in validation errors of 2.81% and 1.16%, respectively, the results are clearly explained in the sub sequent sections of this article. Conclusion In conclusion, this study has evaluated various modifications and their impact on drag force reduction. The application of Spallart-Allmara model resulted in an improvement of 1.28%. Decrease in velocity lead to a significant reduction in the drag force, with an improvement of 37.3%. The nose optimization also contributed to drag force; a nose length of 0.205m yielded a 3.37% improvement. While a 0.19m nose length resulted in a 1.67% reduction. This study helps researchers in hydrodynamics by optimizing geometry for drag reduction.

                Background Exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) is a cause for heart disease and lung cancer among non- smokers. This cluster randomized control trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a tobacco smoke free home intervention in reducing exposure to second hand smoke. Protocol The intervention will be conducted among 30 clusters in urban and peri-urban areas of Kochi, India. The sample size is 300 per arm and 15 clusters to detect a minimal difference of 0.03ng/ml in cotinine levels between groups, at 80% power with a two-sided alfa of 0.05 considering variable cluster size. A baseline survey will be undertaken to identify smokers. Data related to smoking, indoor smoking, nicotine dependence, blood pressure (BP) of smokers, morbidity experienced, and lung volume Fev1/Fev6 of smokers will be measured. Urine cotinine, morbidity, BP of spouse and child will be assessed. Air quality monitors measuring PM2.5 will be placed in homes. Trained self-help group women and frontline health workers will implement the intervention. The intervention will consist of monthly home visits to educate the smoker on the harms of second-hand smoke using 3 A’s. The circle of influencers around the smoking men will also be contacted by the members of self-help group to provide support to stop smoking within homes and to quit. They will then organize two-three meetings of community leaders and heads of women’s groups, present data on harms of SHS, and explain the rationale for establishing smoke free homes in their community for a duration of six months. After the intervention a post assessment will be conducted and this will be repeated after six months. Ethics and dissemination The trial protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences. Results will be submitted to open access peer reviewed journals and shared with other stakeholders. Trial registration CTRI/2021/06/034478

                Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained significant importance in dentistry, particularly in the field of cariology. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive bibliometric and altimetric analysis of research on the application of AI in cariology. Methods The Web of Science database was selected for the search conducted in February 2024, and selection and data extraction were performed independently by two researchers. Collaborative networks were generated using VOSviewer software, while altimetric data were analysed using Dimensions. The relationship between the bibliometric and altimetric data was examined using Spearman correlation. Results The search yielded 355 articles, of which 175 were included, published between 2008 and 2024. The most cited article reached 324 citations. Proof of concept was the most common study design (n=135), and the majority of studies used AI to detect and diagnose dental caries (n=122), with radiography being the most commonly used diagnostic method (n=99). The author with the highest number of articles was Schwendicke F (n=15), and the leading institution was Charite University, Berlin (n=13). China was the leading country in terms of research output (n=28) and Asia was the leading continent (n=54). The use of AI in cariology has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary interventions and optimise patient outcomes. Research interest in AI for cariology has increased significantly over the past five years, particularly in Asia. Conclusion These findings suggest significant clinical benefits and highlight the need for further research, particularly clinical trials, to validate these applications in practice.

                Background Triple-negative breast cancers are defined as tumors that lack the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It exhibits unique clinical and pathological features, is highly aggressive, and has a relatively poor prognosis and poor clinical outcome. Objective To identify a novel drug target protein against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and potential phytochemical lead molecules against novel drug targets. Methods In this study, we retrieved TNBC samples from NGS and microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database and employed a combination of differential gene expression studies, protein-protein interaction analysis, and network topology investigation to identify the target protein. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, followed by Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born Surface Area solvation, a potential lead molecule was identified. Result The androgen receptor (AR) was found to be the target protein, and 2-hydroxynaringenin was discovered to be a possible phytochemical lead molecule to combat TNBC. Upregulated genes with LogFC > 1.25 and P-value < 0.05 from the TNBC gene expression dataset were given to STRING tool to investigate the network topology, and androgen receptor (AR) was found to be an appropriate hub gene in the protein-protein interaction network. Phytochemicals that inhibit breast cancer were retrieved from the PubChem database and virtual screening was performed using PyRx against the AR protein. Based on Lipinski’s rule and ADMET properties, molecular interaction studies were analyzed using induced fit docking, wherein significant binding interactions were displayed by 2-hydroxynaringenin. Molecular dynamics studies and MM-GBSA of AR and the 2-hydroxynaringenin complex revealed strong and stable interactions. Conclusion AR was identified as a hub protein that is highly expressed in breast cancer and 2-hydroxynaringenin efficacy of counter TNBC needs to be investigated further in vitro and in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1269/v1?src=rss">Prevalence and risk factors of Acinetobacter baumannii infection in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Thammasat University Hospital [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Acinetobacter baumannii infection (ABI) is a concerning worldwide public health matter with high levels of morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill patients. This study aims to assess the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of ABI in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting. Methods A retrospective review was performed on pediatric patients admitted to the PICU over an 8-year period. Demographic characteristics, infection risk factors, and clinical outcomes were compared and analyzed between patients with ABI, determined to be the case group, and patients without ABI, determined to be the control group. The study also assessed the prevalence of ABI and its antimicrobial resistance profile. Results Between June 2014 and May 2022, a total of 82 cases of ABI were identified, resulting in an overall prevalence of 5.02%. After applying the exclusion criteria, 12 cases were excluded. Consequently, 70 ABI cases in total and 140 cases in a control group were included in the study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis identified chronic respiratory disease, mechanical ventilation lasting 3 days or more, and the use of piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks as independent risk factors associated with ABI. The rate of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) was notably high at 93.22%. Cases of ABI were associated with higher mortality rates and prolonged hospitalization compared to non-ABI cases. Conclusion ABI remains a critical pathogen in the PICU. The presence of chronic respiratory disease, use of mechanical ventilation for at least three days, and a history of receiving piperacillin/tazobactam within the last 2 weeks are significant risk factors for ABI. The high level of antibiotic resistance, especially to carbapenems, highlights the emphasis for more stringent infection control practices and the creation of novel antimicrobial therapies.

Natural eye movements have primarily been studied for over-learned activities such as tea-making, sandwich-making, and hand-washing, which have a fixed sequence of associated actions. These studies demonstrate a sequential activation of low-level cognitive schemas facilitating task completion. However, whether these action schemas are activated in the same pattern when a task is novel and a sequence of actions must be planned in the moment is unclear. Here, we recorded gaze and body movements in a naturalistic task to study action-oriented gaze behavior. In a virtual environment, subjects moved objects on a life-size shelf to achieve a given order. To compel cognitive planning, we added complexity to the sorting tasks. Fixations aligned with the action onset showed gaze as tightly coupled with the action sequence, and task complexity moderately affected the proportion of fixations on the task-relevant regions. Our analysis revealed that gaze fixations were allocated to action-relevant targets just in time. Planning behavior predominantly corresponded to a greater visual search for task-relevant objects before the action onset. The results support the idea that natural behavior relies on the frugal use of working memory, and humans refrain from encoding objects in the environment to plan long-term actions. Instead, they prefer just-in-time planning by searching for action-relevant items at the moment, directing their body and hand to it, monitoring the action until it is terminated, and moving on to the following action.

                <p>by Pablo Capilla-Lasheras, Nina Bircher, Antony M. Brown, Xavier Harrison, Thomas Reed, Jennifer E. York, Dominic L. Cram, Christian Rutz, Lindsay Walker, Marc Naguib, Andrew J. Young</p>

Explaining the evolution of sex differences in cooperation remains a major challenge. Comparative studies highlight that offspring of the more philopatric sex tend to be more cooperative within their family groups than those of the more dispersive sex but we do not understand why. The leading “Philopatry hypothesis” proposes that the more philopatric sex cooperates more because their higher likelihood of natal breeding increases the direct fitness benefits of natal cooperation. However, the “Dispersal trade-off hypothesis” proposes that the more dispersive sex cooperates less because preparations for dispersal, such as extra-territorial prospecting, trade-off against natal cooperation. Here, we test both hypotheses in cooperatively breeding white-browed sparrow weavers (<i>Plocepasser mahali</i>), using a novel high-resolution automated radio-tracking method. First, we show that males are the more dispersive sex (a rare reversal of the typical avian sex difference in dispersal) and that, consistent with the predictions of both hypotheses, females contribute substantially more than males to cooperative care while within the natal group. However, the Philopatry hypothesis cannot readily explain this female-biased cooperation, as females are not more likely than males to breed within their natal group. Instead, our radio-tracking findings support the Dispersal trade-off hypothesis: males conduct pre-dispersal extra-territorial prospecting forays at higher rates than females and prospecting appears to trade-off against natal cooperation. Our findings thus highlight that the evolution of sex differences in cooperation could be widely attributable to trade-offs between cooperation and dispersal; a potentially general explanation that does not demand that cooperation yields direct fitness benefits.

Reynolds, Nicolas Torquet, Stefania Tolu, Sarah Mondoloni, Claire Nguyen, Amy Siriphanh, Robin Justo, Steve Didienne, Nicolas Debray, Cécile Viollet, Louis Raynaud, Yasmine Layadi, Coralie Fouquet, Bernadette Hannesse, Ana-Marta Capaz, Thomas Topilko, Nicolas Renier, Alexandre Mourot, Fabio Marti, Philippe Faure</p>

Individual animals differ in their traits and preferences, which shape their social interactions, survival, and susceptibility to disease, including addiction. Nicotine use is highly heterogenous and has been linked to the expression of personality traits. Although these relationships are well documented, we have limited understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that give rise to distinct behavioral profiles and their connection to nicotine susceptibility. To address this question, we conducted a study using a semi-natural and social environment called “Souris-City” to observe the long-term behavior of individual male mice. Souris-City provided both a communal living area and a separate test area where mice engaged in a reward-seeking task isolated from their peers. Mice developed individualistic reward-seeking strategies when choosing between water and sucrose in the test compartment, which, in turn, predicted how they adapted to the introduction of nicotine as a reinforcer. Moreover, the profiles mice developed while isolated in the test area correlated with their behavior within the social environment, linking decision-making strategies to the expression of behavioral traits. Neurophysiological markers of adaptability within the dopamine system were apparent upon nicotine challenge and were associated with specific profiles. Our findings suggest that environmental adaptations influence behavioral traits and sensitivity to nicotine by acting on dopaminergic reactivity in the face of nicotine exposure, potentially contributing to addiction susceptibility. These results further emphasize the importance of understanding interindividual variability in behavior to gain insight into the mechanisms of decision-making and addiction.

                Abstract Background Large research consortia can generate tremendous amounts of biological information, including high-resolution soil, vegetation, and climate data. While this knowledge stock holds invaluable potential for answering evolutionary and ecological questions, making these data exploitable for modelling remains a daunting task due to the many processing steps required for synthesis. This might result in many researchers to fall back to a handful of ready-to-use data sets, potentially at the expense of statistical power and scientific rigour. In a push for a more stringent approach, we introduce BEpipeR, an R pipeline that allows for the streamlined synthesis of plot-based Biodiversity Exploratories data. Methods BEpipeR was designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind. For instance, users simply choose between aggregating forest or grassland data, or a combination thereof, effectively allowing them to process any experimental plot data of this research consortium. Additionally, instead of coding, they parse most processing information in a user-friendly way through parameter sheets. Processing includes, among others, the creation of a spatially explicit plot-ID template, data wrangling, quality control, plot-wise aggregations, the calculation of derived metrics, data joining to a large composite data set, and metadata compilation. Results With BEpipeR, we provide a feature-rich pipeline that allows users to process Biodiversity Exploratories data in a flexible and reproducible way. This pipeline might serve as a starting point for aggregating the numerous data sets of this and potentially similar research consortia. In this way, it might be a primer for the construction of consortia-wide composite data sets that take full advantage of the consortia’s rich information stocks, ultimately boosting the visibility and participation of individual research projects. Conclusions The BEpipeR pipeline permits the user-friendly processing and plot-wise aggregation of Biodiversity Exploratories data. With modifications, this framework may be easily adopted by other research consortia.

                <p>Biallelic variants in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class G (<i>PIGG</i>) cause hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, and cerebellar features. We present 8 patients from 6 families with a childhood-onset motor neuropathy and neurophysiology demonstrating variable motor conduction block and temporal dispersion. All individuals had a childhood onset tremor, 5 of 8 had cerebellar involvement, and 6 of 8 had childhood febrile seizures. All individuals have biallelic <i>PIGG</i> variants, including the previously reported pathogenic variant Trp505*, plus 6 novel variants. Null enzyme activity is demonstrated via <i>PIGO</i>/<i>PIGG</i> double knockout system for Val339Gly and Gly19Glu, and residual activity for Trp505* due to read-through. Emm negative blood group status was confirmed in 1 family. <i>PIGG</i> should be considered in unsolved motor neuropathy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                The rise of large, publicly shared functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets in human neuroscience has focused on acquiring either a few hours of data on many individuals (‘wide’ fMRI) or many hours of data on a few individuals (‘deep’ fMRI). In this opinion article, we highlight an emerging approach within deep fMRI, which we refer to as ‘intensive’ fMRI: one that strives for extensive sampling of cognitive phenomena to support computational modeling and detailed investigation of brain function at the single voxel level. We discuss the fundamental principles, trade-offs, and practical considerations of intensive fMRI. We also emphasize that intensive fMRI does not simply mean collecting more data: it requires careful design of experiments to enable a rich hypothesis space, optimizing data quality, and strategically curating public resources to maximize community impact.

                Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the brain’s gateway for vision, and their degeneration underlies several blinding diseases. RGCs interact with other neuronal cell types, microglia, and astrocytes in the retina and in the brain. Much knowledge has been gained about RGCs and glia from mice and other model organisms, often with the assumption that certain aspects of their biology may be conserved in humans. However, RGCs vary considerably between species, which could affect how they interact with their neuronal and glial partners. This review details which RGC and glial features are conserved between mice, humans, and primates, and which differ. We also discuss experimental approaches for studying human and primate RGCs. These strategies will help to bridge the gap between rodent and human RGC studies and increase study translatability to guide future therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90893">Increasing adult-born neurons protects mice from epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, an area that contains neurons which are vulnerable to insults and injury, such as severe seizures. Previous studies showed that increasing adult neurogenesis reduced neuronal damage after these seizures. Because the damage typically is followed by chronic life-long seizures (epilepsy), we asked if increasing adult-born neurons would prevent epilepsy. Adult-born neurons were selectively increased by deleting the pro-apoptotic gene <i>Bax</i> from Nestin-expressing progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks of age to conditionally delete <i>Bax</i> in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><i>Bax</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Six weeks after tamoxifen administration, severe seizures (status epilepticus; SE) were induced by injection of the convulsant pilocarpine. After mice developed epilepsy, seizure frequency was quantified for 3 weeks. Mice with increased adult-born neurons exhibited fewer chronic seizures. Postictal depression was reduced also. These results were primarily in female mice, possibly because they were more affected by <i>Bax</i> deletion than males, consistent with sex differences in <i>Bax</i>. The female mice with enhanced adult-born neurons also showed less neuronal loss of hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin-expressing neurons than wild-type females or males, which is notable because loss of these two hilar cell types is implicated in epileptogenesis. The results suggest that selective <i>Bax</i> deletion to increase adult-born neurons can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference. The results are surprising in light of past studies showing that suppressing adult-born neurons can also reduce chronic seizures.

">Dendritome Mapping Unveils Spatial Organization of Striatal D1/D2-Neuron Morphology</a></h4>

              
                Morphology is a cardinal feature of a neuron that mediates its functions, but profiling neuronal morphologies at scale remains a formidable challenge. Here we describe a generalizable pipeline for large-scale brainwide study of dendritic morphology of genetically-defined single neurons in the mouse brain. We generated a dataset of 3,762 3D-reconstructed and reference-atlas mapped striatal D1- and D2- medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Integrative morphometric analyses reveal distinct impacts of anatomical locations and D1/D2 genetic types on MSN morphologies. To analyze striatal regional features of MSN dendrites without prior anatomical constraints, we assigned MSNs to a lattice of cubic boxes in the reference brain atlas, and summarized morphometric representation ("eigen-morph") for each box and clustered boxes with shared morphometry. This analysis reveals 6 modules with characteristic dendritic features and spanning contiguous striatal territories, each receiving distinct corticostriatal inputs. Finally, we found aging confers robust dendritic length and branching defects in MSNs, while Huntington's disease (HD) mice exhibit selective length-related defects. Together, our study demonstrates a systems-biology approach to profile dendritic morphology of genetically-defined single-neurons; and defines novel striatal D1/D2-MSN morphological territories and aging- or HD-associated pathologies.

">Sex differences in deep brain shape and asymmetry persist across schizophrenia and healthy individuals: A meta-analysis from the ENIGMA-Schizophrenia Working Group</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is characterized by a disconnect from reality that manifests as various clinical and cognitive symptoms, and persistent neurobiological abnormalities. Sex-related differences in clinical presentation imply separate brain substrates. The present study characterized deep brain morphology using shape features to understand the independent effects of diagnosis and sex on the brain, and to determine whether the neurobiology of schizophrenia varies as a function of sex. Methods: This study analyzed multi-site archival data from 1,871 male (M) and 955 female (F) participants with SCZ, and 2,158 male and 1,877 female healthy controls (CON) from twenty-three cross-sectional samples from the ENIGMA Schizophrenia Workgroup. Harmonized shape analysis protocols were applied to each site's data for seven deep brain regions obtained from T1-weighted structural MRI scans. Effect sizes were calculated for the following main contrasts: 1) Sex effects; 2) Diagnosis-by-Sex interaction; 3) within sex tests of diagnosis; 4) within diagnosis tests of sex differences. Meta-regression models between brain structure and clinical variables were also computed separately in men and women with schizophrenia. Results: Mass univariate meta-analyses revealed more concave-than-convex shape differences in all regions for women relative to men, across diagnostic groups (d = -0.35 to 0.20, SE = 0.02 to 0.07); there were no significant diagnosis-by-sex interaction effects. Within men and women separately, we identified more-concave-than-convex shape differences for the hippocampus, amygdala, accumbens, and thalamus, with more-convex-than-concave differences in the putamen and pallidum in SCZ (d = -0.30 to 0.30, SE = 0.03 to 0.10). Within CON and SZ separately, we found more-concave-than-convex shape differences in the thalamus, pallidum, putamen, and amygdala among females compared to males, with mixed findings in the hippocampus and caudate (d = -0.30 to 0.20, SE = 0.03 to 0.09). Meta-regression models revealed similarly small, but significant relationships, with medication and positive symptoms in both SCZ-M and SCZ-F. Conclusions: Sex-specific variation is an overriding feature of deep brain shape regardless of disease status, underscoring persistent patterns of sex differences observed both within and across diagnostic categories, and highlighting the importance of including it as a critical variable in studies of neurobiology. Future work should continue to explore these dimensions independently to determine whether these patterns of brain morphology extend to other aspects of neurobiology in schizophrenia, potentially uncovering broader implications for diagnosis and treatment.

">Synaptic input architecture of visual cortical neurons revealed by large-scale synapse imaging without backpropagating action potentials</a></h4>

              
                How neurons integrate thousands of synaptic inputs to compute sharply tuned outputs is a critical question in sensory information processing. To answer this question, it is essential to record the location and activity of synaptic inputs in vivo. However, back-propagating action potential (BAP) calcium signals invade dendrites and spines, making accurate recording of spine responses difficult. In this study, we first developed a new method to record spine calcium responses without BAP signals. Using this method, we performed large-scale imaging of visually evoked spine activity from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and revealed three patterns of dendritic functional architectures of synaptic inputs: dendrites with clusters of spines of similar responses, dendrites with spines of diverse responses, and dendrites with spines where the majority of them show no visual response. Our model suggests that only a small fraction of spines on dendrites of clustered architectures are sufficient to generate sharply tuned output.

                Dysfunction of the sodium-activated potassium channel KNa1.1 (encoded by KCNT1) is associated with a severe condition characterized by frequent seizures (up to hundreds per day) and is often fatal by age three years. We defined the early developmental onset of KNa1.1 channels in prenatal and neonatal brain tissue, establishing a timeline for pathophysiology and a window for therapeutic intervention. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we observed age-dependent increases in KNa1.1 K+ conductance. In neurons derived from a child with a gain-of-function KCNT1 pathogenic variant (p.R474H), we detected abnormal excitability and action potential afterhyperpolarization kinetics. In a clinical trial, two individuals with the p.R474H variant showed dramatic reductions in seizure occurrence and severity with a first-in-human antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) RNA therapy. ASO-treated p.R474H neurons in vitro exhibited normalized spiking and burst properties. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of ASO knockdown of KNa1.1 in mid-gestation human neurons, suggesting potential for early therapeutic intervention before the onset of epileptic encephalopathy.

">Cortical norepinephrine-astrocyte signaling critically mediates learned behavior</a></h4>

              
                Updating behavior based on feedback from the environment is a crucial means by which organisms learn and develop optimal behavioral strategies. Norepinephrine (NE) release from the locus coeruleus (LC) has been shown to mediate learned behaviors such that in a task with graded stimulus uncertainty and performance, a high level of NE released after an unexpected outcome causes improvement in subsequent behavior. Yet, how the transient activity of LC-NE neurons, lasting tens of milliseconds, influences behavior several seconds later, is unclear. Here, we show that NE acts directly on cortical astrocytes via Adra1a adrenergic receptors to elicit sustained increases in intracellular calcium. Chemogenetic blockade of astrocytic calcium elevation prevents the improvement in behavioral performance. NE-activated calcium invokes purinergic pathways in cortical astrocytes that signal to neurons; pathway-specific astrocyte gene expression is altered in mice trained on the task, and blocking neuronal adenosine-sensitive A1 receptors also prevents post-reinforcement behavioral gain. Finally, blocking either astrocyte calcium dynamics or A1 receptors alters encoding of the task in prefrontal cortex neurons, preventing the post-reinforcement change in discriminability of rewarded and unrewarded stimuli underlying behavioral improvement. Together, these data demonstrate that astrocytes, rather than indirectly reflecting neuronal drive, play a direct, instrumental role in representing task-relevant information and signaling to neurons to mediate a fundamental component of learning in the brain.

">GABAergic neurons can facilitate the propagation of cortical spreading depolarization: experiments in mouse neocortical slices and a novel neural field computational model</a></h4>

              
                Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a wave of depolarization with local onset and extended propagation implicated in several pathological conditions. Its mechanisms have been extensively investigated, including our recent studies showing with experimental and computational approaches that the hyperactivity of GABAergic neurons can initiate migraine-related CSD because of spiking-generated extracellular potassium (K+) build-up. However, less is known about the role played by GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation. Here we studied mechanisms of CSD propagation, focusing on the role of GABAergic neurons, with experiments performed in mouse brain slices and with a new spatially extended neural field computational model. Experimentally, we induced CSD by applying brief puffs of potassium chloride (KCl) in somatosensory cortex slices from wild type and VGAT-ChR2-tdtomato mice, which specifically express the excitatory opsin channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in GABAergic neurons. We evaluated the role of GABAergic neurons in CSD propagation by modulating their activity with optogenetic illumination and their synaptic connections with pharmacological tools. We have developed the computational model to obtain realistic simulations of both initiation and propagation of CSD. It includes large populations of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the effect of extracellular ion concentrations on their features. We found that the decrease of the synaptic activity of GABAergic neurons can enhance CSD propagation, because of the reduction of the inhibitory synaptic weight, whereas their spiking activity can enhance CSD propagation because of extracellular K+ upload. However, differently from for CSD initiation, the latter effect is normally hidden by the action of GABAergic synaptic transmission. A reduction of GABAergic synaptic transmission, which can be observed in pathological states, can reveal the potentiating effect of the K+ upload induced by GABAergic activation. The neural field model that we implemented can generate accurate simulations of CSD, providing testable hypotheses on mechanisms, and can also be used for modeling other (patho)-physiological activities of neuronal networks.

">Impulsive adolescents exhibit inefficient processing and a low decision threshold when decoding facial expressions of emotions</a></h4>

              
                Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating psychiatric illness whose symptoms frequently emerge during adolescence. Initial studies in adults suggest that the interpersonal difficulties common in BPD may emerge from disrupted processing of social and emotional stimuli. Less is known about these processes in adolescents with BPD symptoms, despite substantial changes in socioemotional processing during this developmental period. Methods: 86 adolescents and young adults with and without BPD symptoms completed an emotional interference task involving the identification of a facial emotion expression in the presence of a conflict or congruent emotion word. We used hierarchical drift diffusion modeling to index speed of processing and decision boundary. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we characterized age-related differences in facial emotion processing. We then examined whether BPD symptom dimensions were associated with facial emotion processing on this task. To determine the specificity of our effects, we analyzed behavioral data from a corresponding nonemotional interference task. Results: Impulsivity, but not negative affectivity or interpersonal dysfunction, predicted inefficient processing when presented with conflicting negative emotional stimuli. Across both tasks, impulsivity in adolescents was further associated with a lower decision boundary. Impulsive adolescents were especially likely to make fast, but inaccurate decisions about another person's emotional state. Conclusion: Impulsive adolescents with BPD symptoms are prone to making errors when appraising facial expressions of emotions, which may potentiate or worsen interpersonal conflicts. Our findings highlight the role of lower-level social cognitive processes in interpersonal difficulties among vulnerable youth during a sensitive developmental window.

">Enriched environment requires remodeling of hippocampal perineuronal nets to trigger memory improvement in Alzheimer's mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities is believed to reduce cognitive decline by establishing a cognitive reserve, though the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we explore the role of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons (PV) and their associated perineuronal nets (PNN) in cognitive deficits observed in AD. Using the Tg2576 mouse model, we demonstrate that 10 days of exposure to an enriched environment (EE) significantly restores spatial and social memory, accompanied by an increase in PV and PV/PNN cell populations in the hippocampus. Notably, preventing PV/PNN remodeling in the CA1 region during EE abolishes the spatial memory improvements, whereas localized neuregulin-1 (NRG1) injections induce PV/PNN remodeling and restore memory function. These findings suggest that hippocampal PV/PNN remodeling is essential for the cognitive benefits of EE in AD, highlighting this neuronal population as a critical substrate for cognitive reserve. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which environmental factors may mitigate cognitive decline in AD, offering potential avenues for therapeutic interventions.

">Equivalence between representational similarity analysis, centered kernel alignment, and canonical correlations analysis</a></h4>

              
                Centered kernel alignment (CKA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA) of dissimilarity matrices are two popular methods for comparing neural systems in terms of representational geometry. Although they follow a conceptually similar approach, typical implementations of CKA and RSA tend to result in numerically different outcomes. Here, I show that these two approaches are largely equivalent once one incorporates a mean-centering step into RSA. This equivalence holds for both linear and nonlinear variants of these methods. These connections are simple to derive, but appear to have been thus far overlooked in the context of comparing neural representations. By unifying these measures, this paper hopes to simplify a complex and fragmented literature on this subject.

">Variable Presence of an Evolutionarily New Brain Structure is Related to Trait Impulsivity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct reflecting poor constraint over one's behaviors. Clinical psychology research identifies separable impulsivity dimensions that are each unique transdiagnostic indicators for psychopathology. Yet, despite this apparent clinical importance, the shared and unique neuroanatomical correlates of these factors remain largely unknown. Concomitantly, neuroimaging research identifies variably present human brain structures implicated in cognition and disorder: the folds (sulci) of the cerebral cortex located in the latest developing and most evolutionarily expanded hominoid-specific association cortices. Methods: We tethered these two fields to test whether variability in one such structure in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the paracingulate sulcus (PCGS), was related to individual differences in trait impulsivity. 120 adult participants with internalizing or externalizing psychopathology completed a magnetic resonance imaging scan and the Three-Factor Impulsivity Index. Using precision imaging techniques, we manually identified the PCGS, when present, and acquired quantitative folding metrics (PCGS length and ACC local gyrification index). Results: Neuroanatomical-behavioral analyses revealed that participants with leftward or symmetrical PCGS patterns had greater severity of Lack of Follow Through (LFT), which captures inattention and lack of perseverance, than those with rightward asymmetry. Neuroanatomical-functional analyses identified that the PCGS co-localized with a focal locus found in a neuroimaging meta-analysis on a feature underlying LFT. Both quantitative folding metrics did not relate to any impulsivity dimension. Conclusions: This study advances understanding of the neuroanatomical correlates of impulsivity and establishes the notion that the topographical organization of distinct, hominoid-specific cortical expanses underlie separable impulsivity dimensions with robust, transdiagnostic implications for psychopathology.

">The language network ages well: Preserved selectivity, lateralization, and within-network functional synchronization in older brains</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging is associated with structural and functional brain changes. However, cognitive abilities differ from one another in how they change with age: whereas executive functions, like working memory, show age-related decline, aspects of linguistic processing remain relatively preserved (Hartshorne et al., 2015). This heterogeneity of the cognitive-behavioral landscape in aging predicts differences among brain networks in whether and how they should change with age. To evaluate this prediction, we used individual-subject fMRI analyses ('precision fMRI') to examine the language-selective network (Fedorenko et al., 2024) and the Multiple Demand (MD) network, which supports executive functions (Duncan et al., 2020), in older adults (n=77) relative to young controls (n=470). In line with past claims, relative to young adults, the MD network of older adults shows weaker and less spatially extensive activations during an executive function task and reduced within-network functional synchronization. However, in stark contrast to the MD network, we find remarkable preservation of the language network in older adults. Their language network responds to language as strongly and selectively as in younger adults, and is similarly lateralized and internally synchronized. In other words, the language network of older adults looks indistinguishable from that of younger adults. Our findings align with behavioral preservation of language skills in aging and suggest that some networks remain young-like, at least on standard measures of function and connectivity.

">Psilocybin Reduces Grooming in the SAPAP3 Knockout Mouse Model of Compulsive Behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic compound which shows promise for treating compulsive behaviours. This is particularly pertinent as compulsive disorders require research into new pharmacological treatment options as the current frontline treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, require chronic administration, have significant side effects, and leave almost half of the clinical population refractory to treatment. In this study, we investigated psilocybin administration in male and female SAPAP3 knockout (KO) mice, a well-validated mouse model of obsessive compulsive and related disorders. We assessed the effects of acute psilocybin (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) administration on head twitch and locomotor behaviour as well as anxiety- and compulsive-like behaviours at multiple time-points (1-, 3- and 8-days post-injection). While psilocybin did not have any effect on anxiety-like behaviours, we revealed for the first time that acute psilocybin administration led to enduring reductions in compulsive behaviour in male SAPAP3 KO mice and reduced grooming behaviour in female WT and SAPAP3 KO mice. We also found that psilocybin increased locomotion in wild-type littermates but not in SAPAP3 KO mice, suggesting in vivo serotonergic dysfunctions in KO animals. On the other hand, the typical head-twitch response following acute psilocybin (confirming its hallucinogenic-like effect at this dose) was observed in both genotypes. Our novel findings suggest that acute psilocybin may have potential to reduce compulsive-like behaviours (up to 1 week after a single injection). Our study can inform future research directions as well as supporting the utility of psilocybin as a novel treatment option for compulsive disorders.

                -Synuclein (-syn) strains can serve as discriminators between Parkinson's disease (PD) from other -synucleinopathies. The relationship between -syn strain dynamics and clinical performance as patients transition from normal cognition (NC) to cognitive impairment (CI) is not known. Here, we show that the biophysical properties and neurotoxicity of -syn strains change as PD cognitive status transitions from NC to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PD-D). Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses reveal distinct -syn strains in PD patients correlating to their level of cognitive impairment. This study presents evidence that individuals with PD have different -syn strains that change in accordance with their cognitive status and highlights the potential of -syn strain dynamics to guide future diagnosis, management, and stratification of PD patients.

">The computational bottleneck of basal ganglia output (and what to do about it)</a></h4>

              
                What the basal ganglia do is an oft-asked question; answers range from the selection of actions to the specification of movement to the estimation of time. Here I argue that how the basal ganglia do what they do is a less-asked but equally important question. I show that the output regions of the basal ganglia create a stringent computational bottleneck, both structurally, because they have far fewer neurons than do their target regions, and dynamically, because of their tonic, inhibitory output. My proposed solution to this bottleneck is that the activity of an output neuron is setting the weight of a basis function, a function defined by that neuron's synaptic contacts. I illustrate how this may work in practice, allowing basal ganglia output to shift cortical dynamics and control eye movements via the superior colliculus. This solution can account for troubling issues in our understanding of the basal ganglia: why we see output neurons increasing their activity during behaviour, rather than only decreasing as predicted by theories based on disinhibition, and why the output of the basal ganglia seems to have so many codes squashed into such a tiny region of the brain.

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia worldwide, profoundly impacts health and quality of life. While cognitive impairments&amp;amp;mdash;such as memory loss, attention deficits, and disorientation&amp;amp;mdash;predominate in AD, motor symptoms, though common, remain underexplored. These motor symptoms, including gait disturbances, reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle weakness, sarcopenia, and impaired balance, are often associated with advanced stages of AD and contribute to increased mortality. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that motor symptoms may be present in earlier stages and can serve as predictive markers for AD in older adults. Despite a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these motor symptoms, several key pathways have been identified, offering avenues for further investigation. This review provides an in-depth analysis of motor symptoms in AD, discussing its progression, potential mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Addressing motor symptoms alongside cognitive decline may enhance patient functionality, improve quality of life, and support more comprehensive disease management strategies.</p>

	<p>Background. This study aims to determine if Riluzole usage can change the function and excitability of motor neurons. Methods. The clinical data and indices of motor neuron excitability were assessed using high-density surface EMG parameters from 80 ALS participants. The persistent inward current was assessed using the discharge rate from paired motor units obtained from the tibialis anterior muscle. This enabled the discharge rate at recruitment, peak discharge rates and the hysteresis of the recruitment&amp;amp;ndash;derecruitment frequencies (also known as delta F) to be calculated. Limbs were classified according to their strength. Results. No differences in these motor neuron discharge properties were found according to whether Riluzole was used. Conclusions. The possible interpretations of this finding are discussed.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with several coexisting diseases or comorbidities, including inflammatory and metabolic disorders. In fact, ASD symptoms may be associated with immune system dysfunction. However, studies investigating the peripheral blood levels of immune cells are lacking and have provided mixed findings. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the intensity level of ASD symptoms and the inflammatory and metabolic profiles in 154 children and adolescents (2&amp;amp;ndash;17 years). Methods: Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine the relationship between their symptom intensities and inflammatory/metabolic profiles. Results: Heavier children had higher values for triglyceride and insulin levels. Children with a level 3 of ASD intensity had higher free fatty acids levels. However, when adjusting for ASD intensity, gender, medication use, or weight status, older children appeared to have higher values of triglycerides, insulin levels, and free fatty acids. Conclusions: We concluded that as Brazilian children with ASD became older, they had a higher risk for insulin resistance.</p>

                <p>Injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) can cause severe neurological deficits. Axonal regrowth is a fundamental process for the reconstruction of compensatory neuronal networks after injury; however, it is extremely limited in the adult mammalian CNS. In this study, we conducted a loss-of-function genetic screen in cortical neurons, combined with a Web resource-based phenotypic screen, and identified synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4) as a novel regulator of axon elongation. Silencing Syt4 in primary cultured cortical neurons inhibits neurite elongation, with changes in gene expression involved in signaling pathways related to neuronal development. In a spinal cord injury model, inhibition of Syt4 expression in cortical neurons prevented axonal sprouting of the corticospinal tract, as well as neurological recovery after injury. These results provide a novel therapeutic approach to CNS injury by modulating Syt4 function.</p>

                <p>Neuregulin1 (Nrg1) signaling is critical for neuronal development and function from fate specification to synaptic plasticity. Type III Nrg1 is a synaptic protein which engages in bidirectional signaling with its receptor ErbB4. Forward signaling engages ErbB4 phosphorylation, whereas back signaling engages two known mechanisms: (1) local axonal PI3K-AKT signaling and (2) cleavage by -secretase resulting in cytosolic release of the intracellular domain (ICD), which can traffic to the nucleus (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Bao et al., 2003</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">Hancock et al., 2008</cross-ref>). To dissect the contribution of these alternate signaling strategies to neuronal development, we generated a transgenic mouse with a missense mutation (V<SUB>321</SUB>L) in the Nrg1 transmembrane domain that disrupts nuclear back signaling with minimal effects on forward signaling or local back signaling and was previously found to be associated with psychosis (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Walss-Bass et al., 2006</cross-ref>). We combined RNA sequencing, retroviral fate mapping of neural stem cells, behavioral analyses, and various network analyses of transcriptomic data to investigate the effect of disrupting Nrg1 nuclear back signaling in the dentate gyrus (DG) of male and female mice. The V<SUB>321</SUB>L mutation impairs nuclear translocation of the Nrg1 ICD and alters gene expression in the DG. V<SUB>321</SUB>L mice show reduced stem cell proliferation, altered cell cycle dynamics, fate specification defects, and dendritic dysmorphogenesis. Orthologs of known schizophrenia (SCZ)-susceptibility genes were dysregulated in the V<SUB>321</SUB>L DG. These genes coordinated a larger network with other dysregulated genes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis and protein interaction network analyses revealed striking similarity between DG transcriptomes of V<SUB>321</SUB>L mouse and humans with SCZ.</p>

                <p>Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have associated intronic variants in <I>PDE4B</I>, encoding cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B), with increased risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as schizophrenia and substance use disorders that are often comorbid with it. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of genetic risk involving PDE4B are poorly understood. To examine the effects of PDE4B variation on phenotypes with translational relevance to psychiatric disorders, we focused on PDE4B missense variant M220T, which is present in the human genome as rare coding variant rs775201287. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, PDE4B1-M220T exhibited an attenuated response to a forskolin-elicited increase in the intracellular cAMP concentration. In behavioral tests, homozygous <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> male mice with a C57BL/6JJcl background exhibited increased reactivity to novel environments, startle hyperreactivity, prepulse inhibition deficits, altered cued fear conditioning, and enhanced spatial memory, accompanied by an increase in cAMP signaling pathway-regulated expression of BDNF in the hippocampus. In response to a traumatic event (10 tone&ndash;shock pairings), neuronal activity was decreased in the cortex but enhanced in the amygdala and hippocampus of <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice. At 24&nbsp;h post-trauma, <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice exhibited increased startle hyperreactivity and decreased plasma corticosterone levels, similar to phenotypes exhibited by PTSD patients. Trauma-exposed <I>Pde4b</I><sup>M220T</sup> mice also exhibited a slower decay in freezing at 15 and 30&nbsp;d post-trauma, demonstrating enhanced persistence of traumatic memories, similar to that exhibited by PTSD patients. These findings provide substantive mouse model evidence linking PDE4B variation to PTSD-relevant phenotypes and thus highlight how genetic variation of PDE4B may contribute to PTSD risk.</p>

                <p>Neural decoding is a tool for understanding how activities from a population of neurons inside the brain relate to the outside world and for engineering applications such as brain&ndash;machine interfaces. However, neural decoding studies mainly focused on different decoding algorithms rather than different neuron types which could use different coding strategies. In this study, we used two-photon calcium imaging to assess three auditory spatial decoders (space map, opponent channel, and population pattern) in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the dorsal inferior colliculus of male and female mice. Our findings revealed a clustering of excitatory neurons that prefer similar interaural level difference (ILD), the primary spatial cues in mice, while inhibitory neurons showed random local ILD organization. We found that inhibitory neurons displayed lower decoding variability under the opponent channel decoder, while excitatory neurons achieved higher decoding accuracy under the space map and population pattern decoders. Further analysis revealed that the inhibitory neurons&rsquo; preference for ILD off the midline and the excitatory neurons&rsquo; heterogeneous ILD tuning account for their decoding differences. Additionally, we discovered a sharper ILD tuning in the inhibitory neurons. Our computational model, linking this to increased presynaptic inhibitory inputs, was corroborated using monaural and binaural stimuli. Overall, this study provides experimental and computational insight into how excitatory and inhibitory neurons uniquely contribute to the coding of sound locations.</p>

                <p>Neural circuits supporting innate behaviors, such as feeding, exploration, and social interaction, intermingle in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Although previous studies have shown that individual LH neurons change their firing relative to the baseline during one or more behaviors, the firing rate dynamics of LH populations within behavioral episodes and the coordination of behavior-related LH populations remain largely unknown. Here, using unsupervised graph-based clustering of LH neurons firing rate dynamics in freely behaving male mice, we identified distinct populations of cells whose activity corresponds to feeding, specific times during feeding bouts, or other innate behaviors&mdash;social interaction and novel object exploration. Feeding-related cells fired together with a higher probability during slow and fast gamma oscillations (30&ndash;60 and 60&ndash;90&nbsp;Hz) than during nonrhythmic epochs. In contrast, the cofiring of neurons signaling other behaviors than feeding was overall similar between slow gamma and nonrhythmic epochs but increased during fast gamma oscillations. These results reveal a neural organization of ethological hierarchies in the LH and point to behavior-specific motivational systems, the dysfunction of which may contribute to mental disorders.</p>

                <p>Sleep is known to drive the consolidation of motor memories. During nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the close temporal proximity between slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles ("nesting" of SO-spindles) is known to be essential for consolidation, likely because it is closely associated with the reactivation of awake task activity. Interestingly, recent work has found that spindles can occur in temporal clusters or "trains." However, it remains unclear how spindle trains are related to the nesting phenomenon. Here, we hypothesized that spindle trains are more likely when SOs co-occur in the prefrontal and motor cortex. We conducted simultaneous neural recordings in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) of male rats training on the reach-to-grasp motor task. We found that intracortically recorded M1 spindles are organized into distinct temporal clusters. Notably, the occurrence of temporally precise SOs between mPFC and M1 was a strong predictor of spindle trains. Moreover, reactivation of awake task patterns is much more persistent during spindle trains in comparison with that during isolated spindles. Together, our work suggests that the precise coupling of SOs across mPFC and M1 may be a potential driver of spindle trains and persistent reactivation of motor memory during NREM sleep.</p>

                <p>We used virus-mediated anterograde and retrograde tracing, optogenetic modulation, immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and patch-clamp recordings in acute brain slices to study the release mechanism and &mu;-opioid modulation of the dual glutamatergic/GABAergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area and supramammillary nucleus to the granule cells of the dorsal hippocampus of male and female mice. In keeping with previous reports showing that the two transmitters are released by separate active zones within the same terminals, we found that the short-term plasticity and pharmacological modulation of the glutamatergic and GABAergic currents are indistinguishable. We further found that glutamate and GABA release at these synapses are both virtually completely mediated by N- and P/Q-type calcium channels. We then investigated &mu;-opioid modulation of these synapses and found that activation of &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs) strongly inhibits the glutamate and GABA release, mostly through inhibition of presynaptic N-type channels. However, the modulation by MORs of these dual synapses is complex, as it likely includes also a disinhibition due to downmodulation of local GABAergic interneurons which make direct axo-axonic contacts with the dual glutamatergic/GABAergic terminals. We discuss how this opioid modulation may enhance LTP at the perforant path inputs, potentially contributing to reinforce memories of drug-associated contexts.</p>

                <p>The brain's extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates neuronal plasticity and animal behavior. ECM staining shows a net-like structure around a subset of neurons, a ring-like structure at the nodes of Ranvier, and diffuse staining in the interstitial matrix. However, understanding the structural features of ECM deposition across various neuronal types and subcellular compartments remains limited. To visualize the organization pattern and assembly process of the hyaluronan-scaffolded ECM in the brain, we fused a HaloTag to hyaluronan proteoglycan link protein 1, which links hyaluronan and proteoglycans. Expression or application of the probe in primary rat neuronal cultures enables us to identify spatial and temporal regulation of ECM deposition and heterogeneity in ECM aggregation among neuronal populations. Dual-color birthdating shows the ECM assembly process in culture and in vivo. Sparse expression in mouse brains of either sex reveals detailed ECM architectures around excitatory neurons and developmentally regulated dendritic ECM. Our study uncovers extensive structural features of the brain's ECM, suggesting diverse roles in regulating neuronal plasticity.</p>

                <p>Perivascular mural cells including vascular smooth cells (VSMCs) and pericytes are integral components of the vascular system. In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are also indispensable for the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB), blood&ndash;spinal cord barrier, and blood&ndash;retinal barrier and play key roles in maintaining cerebrovascular and neuronal functions. However, the functional specifications of pericytes between CNS and peripheral organs have not been resolved at the genetic and molecular levels. Hence, the generation of reliable CNS pericyte-specific models and genetic tools remains very challenging. Here, we report a new CNS pericyte marker in mice. This putative cation-transporting ATPase 13A5 (<I>Atp13a5</I>) marker was identified through single-cell transcriptomics, based on its specificity to brain pericytes. We further generated a knock-in model with both tdTomato reporter and Cre recombinase. Using this model to trace the distribution of <I>Atp13a5-</I>positive pericytes in mice, we found that the tdTomato reporter reliably labels the CNS pericytes, including the ones in spinal cord and retina but not peripheral organs. Interestingly, brain pericytes are likely shaped by the developing neural environment, as <I>Atp13a5-</I>positive pericytes start to appear around murine embryonic day 15 (E15) and expand along the cerebrovasculature. Thus, <I>Atp13a5</I> is a specific marker of CNS pericyte lineage, and this <I>Atp13a5-</I>based model is a reliable tool to explore the heterogeneity of pericytes and BBB functions in health and diseases.</p>

                <p>Thalamocortical pathways from the rodent ventral posterior (VP) thalamic complex to the somatosensory cerebral cortex areas are a key model in modern neuroscience. However, beyond the intensively studied projection from medial VP (VPM) to the primary somatosensory area (S1), the wiring of these pathways remains poorly characterized. We combined micropopulation tract-tracing and single-cell transfection experiments to map the pathways arising from different portions of the VP complex in male mice. We found that pathways originating from different VP regions show differences in area/lamina arborization pattern and axonal varicosity size. Neurons from the rostral VPM subnucleus innervate trigeminal S1 in point-to-point fashion. In contrast, a caudal VPM subnucleus innervates heavily and topographically second somatosensory area (S2), but not S1. Neurons in a third, intermediate VPM subnucleus innervate through branched axons both S1 and S2, with markedly different laminar patterns in each area. A small anterodorsal subnucleus selectively innervates dysgranular S1. The parvicellular VPM subnucleus selectively targets the insular cortex and adjacent portions of S1 and S2. Neurons in the rostral part of the lateral VP nucleus (VPL) innervate spinal S1, while caudal VPL neurons simultaneously target S1 and S2. Rostral and caudal VP nuclei show complementary patterns of calcium-binding protein expression. In addition to the cortex, neurons in caudal VP subnuclei target the sensorimotor striatum. Our finding of a massive projection from VP to S2 separate from the VP projections to S1 adds critical anatomical evidence to the notion that different somatosensory submodalities are processed in parallel in S1 and S2.</p>

                <p>Estrogens act through nuclear and membrane-initiated signaling. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) is critical for reproduction, but the relative contribution of its nuclear and membrane signaling to the central regulation of reproduction is unclear. To address this question, two complementary approaches were used: estetrol (E<SUB>4</SUB>) a natural estrogen acting as an agonist of nuclear ERs, but as an antagonist of their membrane fraction, and the C451A-ER&alpha; mouse lacking mER&alpha;. E<SUB>4</SUB> dose- dependently blocks ovulation in female rats, but the central mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. To determine whether E<SUB>4</SUB> acts centrally to control ovulation, its effect was tested on the positive feedback of estradiol (E<SUB>2</SUB>) on neural circuits underlying luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. In ovariectomized females chronically exposed to a low dose of E<SUB>2</SUB>, estradiol benzoate (EB) alone or combined with progesterone (P) induced an increase in the number of kisspeptin (Kp) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons coexpressing Fos, a marker of neuronal activation. E<SUB>4</SUB> blocked these effects of EB, but not when combined to P. These results indicate that E<SUB>4</SUB> blocked the central induction of the positive feedback in the absence of P, suggesting an antagonistic effect of E<SUB>4</SUB> on mER&alpha; in the brain as shown in peripheral tissues. In parallel, as opposed to wild-type females, C451A-ER&alpha; females did not show the activation of Kp and GnRH neurons in response to EB unless they are treated with P. Together these effects support a role for membrane-initiated estrogen signaling in the activation of the circuit mediating the LH surge.</p>

                Introduction Mitochondria are cell organelles that function as the cell’s main power plant, producing ATP, the main energy molecule in cells. Mitochondria play an important role in the context of neuroprotection, and mitochondrial function has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent research in the field of neuroprotection has focused on the development of therapies that target mitochondria. Natural ingredients have long been used in traditional medicine and show potential as neuroprotective agents. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords natural agents, herb*, neuroprotective, and mitochondria. The data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, A factorial map illustrating the leading contributors of papers, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, qualitative analysis, and word cloud. Conclusions Natural Agent Neurotropik is a natural substance that influences the brain’s nervous system and peripheral nervous system, enhancing cognition, mood, and brain function. Derived from herbs, spices, and herbal products, it has advantages over other natural agents in energy production, brain biogenesis, and neuroprotection. Natural agents’ compositional heterogeneity affects reproductive results. Proper characterization and standardized extraction techniques are crucial for establishing plant extracts’ chemical profile. Dosage consistency is essential for standardized results. Long-term safety and potential toxicity should be evaluated. Comparing natural medicines with synthetic pharmaceuticals can enhance therapy efficacy and reduce drug resistance. Further research is needed to assess neuroprotection and mitochondrial function.

                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in the Third World. Identification of the pathogen that causes diarrhea is vital for measures to prevent and control this disease. There are also very few reports of diarrhea in Sudan. Our study aimed to determine the Prevalence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum., and Giardia spp) in children in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among children under five years of age hospitalized with acute diarrhea between April and December 2014. Diarrheal stool samples were collected, and E. histolytica, C. parvum, and Giardia spp were examined using multiplex real-time PCR. Results Four hundred and thirty-seven children with acute diarrhea were included in this study; the higher prevalence of diarrhea was in the age ≤ 2 years old (403, 92.2%), >2–≤4 years (32, 7.3%), and >4–<5 years (2, 0.5%). The male-to-female ratio in this study was 1:1.7. Infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was detected in 16 (3.7%) cases. Giardia spp (18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8%) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.9). The parasite infection rate was highest and lowest in the under 2-year-old group 143 (35.5%) and the 2–4-year-old group 12 (37.5%). The infection rate was higher in boys 104 (37.7%) than in girls 51 (31.7%). The number of positive cases was higher in the rainy season (August to December) 143 (37.4%), corresponding with that in the dry Season (April to June) 12 (21.8%). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of Giardia spp and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in the Khartoum region and the usefulness of the multiplex real-time method in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                Objective To analyze the effectiveness of various techniques available for printing, finishing and polishing of 3D printed prosthesis. Methods The articles were selected from electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus. Recently, lot of advancements have been observed in the field of 3D printing in dentistry. Results Numerous studies were found explaining the factors affecting the surface roughness such as printing speed, direction, layer thickness, post curing, etc., and the significance in achieving a smooth surface finish of a 3D printed prosthesis. The methods employed to achieve this range, similar to conventional and chairside polishing, are to use advanced coating materials such as light cured glazes to nanoparticles. Conclusion 3D printing is being used in day-to-day practice and the prosthesis must be aesthetic looking to satisfy the patients’ expectations. There is a lack of data supporting any one polishing method for the prosthesis. There is a need for further research on the existing techniques and newer advancements yielding aesthetic prostheses with an optimal surface finish.

Public gene expression databases are a rapidly expanding resource of organism responses to diverse perturbations, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge for bioinformatics workflows to extract actionable knowledge of transcription regulatory network function. Here, we introduce a five-step computational pipeline, called iModulonMiner, to compile, process, curate, analyze, and characterize the totality of RNA-seq data for a given organism or cell type. This workflow is centered around the data-driven computation of co-regulated gene sets using Independent Component Analysis, called iModulons, which have been shown to have broad applications. As a demonstration, we applied this workflow to generate the iModulon structure of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> using all high-quality, publicly-available RNA-seq data. Using this structure, we predicted regulatory interactions for multiple transcription factors, identified groups of co-expressed genes that are putatively regulated by undiscovered transcription factors, and predicted properties of a recently discovered single-subunit phage RNA polymerase. We also present a Python package, PyModulon, with functions to characterize, visualize, and explore computed iModulons. The pipeline, available at https://github.com/SBRG/iModulonMiner, can be readily applied to diverse organisms to gain a rapid understanding of their transcriptional regulatory network structure and condition-specific activity.

The rapid development of vaccines to combat the spread of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a great scientific achievement. Before the development of the COVID-19 vaccines, most studies capitalized on the available data that did not include pharmaceutical measures. Such studies focused on the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures such as social distancing, sanitation, use of face masks, and lockdowns to study the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we used the SIDARTHE-V model, an extension of the SIDARTHE model, which includes vaccination rollouts. We studied the impact of vaccination on the severity of the virus, specifically focusing on death rates, in African countries. The SIRDATHE-V model parameters were extracted by simultaneously fitting the COVID-19 cumulative data of deaths, recoveries, active cases, and full vaccinations reported by the governments of Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Togo, and Zambia. Using South Africa as a case study, our analysis showed that the cumulative death rates declined drastically with the increased extent of vaccination drives. Whilst the infection rates sometimes increased with the arrival of new coronavirus variants, the death rates did not increase as they did before vaccination.

ATAC-seq has emerged as a rich epigenome profiling technique, and is commonly used to identify Transcription Factors (TFs) underlying given phenomena. A number of methods can be used to identify differentially-active TFs through the accessibility of their DNA-binding motif, however little is known on the best approaches for doing so. Here we benchmark several such methods using a combination of curated datasets with various forms of short-term perturbations on known TFs, as well as semi-simulations. We include both methods specifically designed for this type of data as well as some that can be repurposed for it. We also investigate variations to these methods, and identify three particularly promising approaches (a chromVAR-limma workflow with critical adjustments, monaLisa and a combination of GC smooth quantile normalization and multivariate modeling). We further investigate the specific use of nucleosome-free fragments, the combination of top methods, and the impact of technical variation. Finally, we illustrate the use of the top methods on a novel dataset to characterize the impact on DNA accessibility of TRAnscription Factor TArgeting Chimeras (TRAFTAC), which can deplete TFs—in our case NFkB—at the protein level.

                Background Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is predominant cultured species in aquaculture. However, there is a scarcity of literature regarding relationship between guava and star gooseberry leaf extract and the condition factor. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of guava and star gooseberry leaf extract-supplemented diets on the specific growth rate, length-weight relationship, and condition factor of Nile tilapia. Methods Six hundred and thirty Nile tilapia (8.7±0.4 g) were randomly distributed among twenty-one tanks (30 fish per tank) within a recirculation system. Over a 60-day period, the fish were fed diets supplemented with 5g/Kg and 10g/Kg of guava leaf extract (GLE-5, GLE-10), star gooseberry leaf extract (SGLE-5, SGLE-10), and a mixture of both (MxLE-5, MXLE-10). Subsequently, specific growth rate, length-weight relationship, and condition factor were determined. Results After 60 days, the specific growth rate was significantly higher in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups compared to the control group. The final lengths and weights differed significantly both in the control group and all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. The analysis of the regression equation indicated a positive correlation (r = 0.970, 0.977, 0.976, 0.974, 0.974, 0.974, and 0.969) between the length and weight of Nile tilapia in the control group and in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. The regression exponent “b” values in all the GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups were >3, indicating a positive allometric growth pattern in Nile tilapia compared to the control (b=2.866), which exhibited a negative allometry. The final condition factor values did not differ significantly in either the control group or any of the plant extract groups. Conclusions Nile tilapia exhibited positive allometric growth patterns and maintained good health when fed with GLE, SGLE, and MxLE groups. Therefore, these plant extracts demonstrate suitability for commercial Nile tilapia production.

                <p>Cryptogenic new-onset refractory status epilepticus (cNORSE) is a devastating condition with unclear pathogenesis. Here, we analyzed the genetic underprints of 31 cNORSE patients from an autoimmune encephalitis observational cohort through whole-genome sequencing. Compared to their controls, cNORSE patients exhibited elevated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for traits associated with autoimmune diseases. The individual PRS against these diseases were correlated with specific clinical phenotypes of cNORSE. The variants were enriched in genes expressed in the central nervous system and lymphocytes. These results suggest a shared genetic framework between cNORSE and other autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, and its involvement in the disease pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<p>We investigated the immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity-related molecular markers such as Aldoc, PLCB3, and PLCB4 in the cerebellar cortex and related nuclei of rhesus macaque monkeys. We then compared these findings with those of previous studies on such markers in rodents. The current study shed light on the molecular basis underlying differences in cerebellar function between primates and rodents.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cerebellar molecular signatures in primates remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity-related molecular markers, including aldolase C (Aldoc), phospholipase C beta 3 (PLCB3), and phospholipase C beta 4 (PLCB4) in the cerebellar cortex and associated nuclei of rhesus macaque monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>). Our main findings are as follows: First, the cerebellar vermis in macaques exhibited striped compartmentalization for all markers, with the striped expression boundary of PLCB3 being less distinct than those of Aldoc and PLCB4. Second, the striped pattern was less pronounced in the cerebellar hemisphere compared to the vermis, with signals in the hemisphere being predominantly intense throughout. Third, distinct zonal patterns and elevated signals for Aldoc and PLCB3 were observed in the cerebellar deep nuclei. Specifically, the fastigial nucleus displayed intense Aldoc signals in both caudal and rostral regions, while the dentate nucleus displayed strong Aldoc signals in both ventral and dorsal regions. Compared to previous rodent studies, the macaque cerebellum demonstrated a higher proportion of intense signal areas and distinct compartmentalization patterns in both cortical and deep nuclei. These findings offer crucial insights into the unique molecular organization of the primate cerebellum, enhancing our understanding of the advanced neuroplasticity, cognitive, and motor capabilities in primates.</p>

                People often underperform their abilities in high-value situations, a mysterious phenomenon known as “choking under pressure.” In this issue of Neuron, Smoulder et al. report that target-selective signals in the motor cortex of non-human primates collapse in the face of high-value opportunities.

                In this issue of Neuron, Wu et al. show that nuclear speckle proteins are sequestered by both nuclear RNA foci and cytoplasmic dipeptide repeat aggregates in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD. Consequently, dysregulation of splicing induces widespread splicing alterations and contributes to neurodegeneration.

                In this issue of Neuron, Yang et al. report MFDM-like phenotypes in mice with deletion of Eftud2 in their Purkinje cells (PCs), namely cerebellar atrophy alongside motor and social deficits, similar to phenotypes observed in MFDM patients. The absence of Eftud2 caused mis-splicing of Atf4, reduced Scd1 and Gch1, and promoted ferroptosis-regulated PC death.

                The rates of appearance of new mutations play a central role in evolution. However, mutational processes in natural environments and their relationship with growth rates are largely unknown, particular in tropical ecosystems with high biodiversity. Here, we examined the somatic mutation landscapes of two tropical trees, <i>Shorea laevis</i> (slow-growing) and <i>S. leprosula</i> (fast-growing), in central Borneo, Indonesia. Using newly constructed genomes, we identified a greater number of somatic mutations in tropical trees than in temperate trees. In both species, we observed a linear increase in the number of somatic mutations with physical distance between branches. However, we found that the rate of somatic mutation accumulation per meter of growth was 3.7-fold higher in <i>S. laevis</i> than in <i>S. leprosula</i>. This difference in the somatic mutation rate was scaled with the slower growth rate of <i>S. laevis</i> compared to <i>S. leprosula,</i> resulting in a constant somatic mutation rate per year between the two species. We also found that somatic mutations are neutral within an individual, but those mutations transmitted to the next generation are subject to purifying selection. These findings suggest that somatic mutations accumulate with absolute time and older trees have a greater contribution towards generating genetic variation.

                Membranes undergo various patterns of deformation during vesicle fusion, but how this membrane deformation is regulated and contributes to fusion remains unknown. In this study, we developed a new method of observing the fusion of individual late endosomes and lysosomes by using mouse yolk sac visceral endoderm cells that have huge endocytic vesicles. We found that there were two distinct fusion modes that were differently regulated. In homotypic fusion, two late endosomes fused quickly, whereas in heterotypic fusion they fused to lysosomes slowly. Mathematical modeling showed that vesicle size is a critical determinant of these fusion types and that membrane fluctuation forces can overcome the vesicle size effects. We found that actin filaments were bound to late endosomes and forces derived from dynamic actin remodeling were necessary for quick fusion during homotypic fusion. Furthermore, cofilin played a role in endocytic fusion by regulating actin turnover. These data suggest that actin promotes vesicle fusion for efficient membrane trafficking in visceral endoderm cells.

">Spontaneous alpha-band lateralization extends persistence of visual information in iconic memory by modulating cortical excitability.</a></h4>

              
                Pre-stimulus alpha oscillations in the visual cortex modulate neuronal excitability, influencing sensory processing and decision-making. While this relationship has been demonstrated mostly in detection tasks with low-visibility stimuli, interpretations of such effects can be ambiguous due to biases, making it difficult to clearly distinguish between perception-related and decision-related effects. In this study, we investigated how spontaneous fluctuations in pre-stimulus alpha power affect iconic memory, a high-capacity, ultra-short visual memory store. Data from 49 healthy adults (34 female and 15 male) was analyzed. We employed a partial report task, where a brief display of six stimuli was followed by a report cue indicating the target stimulus. In this paradigm, accuracy at short stimulus-cue onset asynchronies (SOAs) is typically high, reflecting the initial availability of sensory information, but it rapidly declines at intermediate SOAs due to the decay of the iconic memory trace, stabilizing at a low asymptote at long SOAs, representing the limited capacity of short-term memory. Crucially, performance in this task is constrained by the temporal persistence of sensory information, not by low visibility or response bias. We found that strong pre-stimulus alpha power enhanced performance by amplifying initial stimulus availability without affecting the speed of iconic decay. This effect was driven predominantly by stronger pre-stimulus alpha power in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the to-be-reported target, likely suppressing neuronal excitability of neurons coding irrelevant stimuli. Our findings underscore the role of alpha oscillations in modulating neuronal excitability and visual perception, independent of decision-making strategies implicated in prior studies.

">The Neural Oscillatory Basis of Perspective-Taking in Autistic and Non-Autistic Adolescents using MEG</a></h4>

              
                Taking another's perspective is a high-level mental skill underlying many aspects of social cognition. Perspective-taking is usually an embodied egocentric process whereby people mentally rotate themselves away from their physical location into the other's orientation. This is accompanied by increased theta-band (3-7Hz) brain oscillations within a widespread fronto-parietal cortical network including the temporoparietal junction. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been reported to experience challenges with high-level perspective-taking, particularly when adopting embodied strategies. To investigate the potential neurophysiological basis of these autism-related individual differences, we used magnetoencephalography in combination with a well-replicated perspective-taking paradigm in a group of 18 autistic and 17 age-matched non-autistic adolescents. Findings revealed that increasing the angle between self and other perspective resulted in prolonged reaction times for the autistic group during perspective-taking. This was accompanied by reduced theta power across a wide network of regions typically active during social cognitive tasks. On the other hand, the autistic group showed greater alpha power decreases in visual cortex compared with the non-autistic group across all perspective-taking conditions. These divergent theta and alpha power effects, coupled with steeper response time slopes, suggest that autistic individuals may rely more on alternative cognitive strategies, such as mental object rotation, rather than an egocentric embodied approach. Finally, no group differences were found when participants were asked to track, rather than take, another's viewpoint, suggesting that autism-related individual differences are specific to high-level perspective-taking.

">Neural Correlates of Psychedelic, Sleep, and Sedated States Support Global Theories of Consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neural mechanisms of consciousness remains a challenging question in neuroscience. A central debate in the field concerns whether consciousness arises from global interactions that involve multiple brain regions or focal neural activity, such as in sensory cortex. Additionally, global theories diverge between the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) hypothesis, which emphasizes frontal and parietal areas, and the Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which focuses on information integration within posterior cortical regions. To disentangle the global vs. local and frontoparietal vs. posterior dilemmas, we measured global functional connectivity and local neural synchrony with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data across a spectrum of conscious states in humans induced by psychedelics, sleep, and deep sedation. We found that psychedelic states are associated with increased global functional connectivity and decreased local neural synchrony. In contrast, non-REM sleep and deep sedation displayed the opposite pattern, suggesting that consciousness arises from global brain network interactions rather than localized activity. This mirror-image pattern between enhanced and diminished states was observed in both anterior-posterior (A-P) and posterior-posterior (P-P) brain regions but not within the anterior part of the brain alone. Moreover, anterior transmodal regions played a key role in A-P connectivity, while both posterior transmodal and posterior unimodal regions were critical for P-P connectivity. Overall, these findings provide empirical evidence supporting global theories of consciousness in relation to varying states of consciousness. They also bridge the gap between two prominent theories, GNW and IIT, by demonstrating how different theories can converge on shared neuronal mechanisms.

">Endogenous neuronal DNA double-strand breaks are not sufficient to drive brain aging and neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Loss of genomic information due to the accumulation of somatic DNA damage has been implicated in aging and neurodegeneration. Somatic mutations in human neurons increase with age, but it is unclear whether this is a cause or a consequence of brain aging. Here, we clarify the role of endogenous, neuronal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in brain aging and neurodegeneration by generating mice with post-developmental inactivation of the classical non-homologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) core factor Xrcc4 in forebrain neurons. Xrcc4 is critical for the ligation step of C-NHEJ and has no known function outside of DSB repair. We find that, unlike their wild-type counterparts, C-NHEJ-deficient neurons accumulate high levels of DSB foci with age, indicating that neurons undergo frequent DSBs that are typically efficiently repaired by C-NHEJ across their lifespan. Genome-wide mapping reveals that endogenous neuronal DSBs preferentially occur in promoter regions and other genic features. Analysis of 3-D genome organization shows intra-chromosomal clustering and loop extrusion of neuronal DSB regions. Strikingly, however, DSB accumulation caused by loss of C-NHEJ induces only minor epigenetic alterations and does not significantly affect gene expression, 3-D genome organization, or mutational outcomes at neuronal DSBs. Despite extensive aging-associated accumulation of neuronal DSBs, mice with neuronal Xrcc4 inactivation do not show neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, reduced lifespan, or impaired memory and learning behavior. We conclude that the formation of spontaneous neuronal DSBs caused by normal cellular processes is insufficient to cause brain aging and neurodegeneration, even in the absence of C-NHEJ, the principal neuronal DSB repair pathway.

">Enhanced Fear Extinction Through Infralimbic Perineuronal Net Digestion: The Modulatory Role of Adolescent Alcohol Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized components of the extracellular matrix that play a critical role in learning and memory. In a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, degradation of PNNs affects the formation and storage of fear memories. This study examined the impact of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure by vapor inhalation on the expression of PNNs in the adult rat prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IfL) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex. Results indicated that following AIE, the total number of PNN positive cells in the PrL cortex increased in layer II/III but did not change in layer V. Conversely, in the IfL cortex, the number of PNN positive cells decreased in layer V, with no change in layer II/III. In addition, the intensity of PNN staining was significantly altered by AIE exposure, which narrowed the distribution of signal intensity, reducing the number of high and low intensity PNNs. Given these changes in PNNs, the next experiment assessed the effects of AIE and PNN digestion on extinction of a conditioned fear memory. In Air control rats, digestion of PNNs by bilateral infusion of Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) into the IfL cortex enhanced fear extinction and reduced contextual fear renewal. In contrast, both fear extinction learning and contextual fear renewal remained unchanged following PNN digestion in AIE exposed rats. These results highlight the sensitivity of prefrontal PNNs to adolescent alcohol exposure and suggest that ChABC-induced plasticity is reduced in the IfL cortex following AIE exposure.

">Frequency-specific hemispheric bias in phase entrainment of neural oscillations in unilateral spatial neglect</a></h4>

              
                Left unilateral spatial neglect (USN), typically caused by a right hemisphere lesion, impairs left-side stimulus perception. Attention influences perception via cortical oscillations, shown as phase shifts and power changes in electroencephalography (EEG). Given this relationship, USN may stem from hemispheric imbalance in synchronizing cortical oscillations internally and externally. We studied this using steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) from flickering stimuli of various frequencies. Our study included USN and non-USN patients with a right hemisphere lesion, but no hemianopsia, as well as healthy controls. Importantly, we confirmed that the affected hemisphere's visual cortex in both patient groups responded to all flickering frequencies, ensuring a valid comparison. Comparing SSVEP power between the intact and affected hemispheres revealed no differences in non-USN patients. In USN patients, both hemispheres responded equally to most frequencies; however, SSVEP power was enhanced in the intact visual cortex with 9-Hz stimulation, resulting in a significant hemispheric bias. This bias was not caused by deficiencies in generating oscillations (we observed no significant differences in spontaneous pre-stimulus alpha oscillations) but rather by abnormal alpha-band synchronization with external inputs. Further analyses revealed increased phase-amplitude coupling between alpha phase and gamma amplitude in the intact hemisphere and elevated transfer entropy from the right visual cortex to the left frontal cortex in USN patients. These results reveal that USN involves complex alterations in neural synchronization stemming from imbalanced entrainment of oscillators to alpha-frequency stimuli, beyond merely local damage. This alpha-specific effect provides insights into frequency-specific synchronization in spatial attention, potentially guiding targeted therapies.

">Preemptive minocycline decreases allodynia and depressive-like behaviors in a peripheral neuropathy rat model: a preliminary study</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objective: The neuroimmune system plays a critical role at all phases of chronic pain including at its onset. We therefore hypothesized that preemptive immunomodulation could decrease susceptibility and/or offer protection to pain. Materials and Methods: Six days before the spared nerve injury (SNI), Wistar Han rats were treated with either the immunomodulator minocycline (MIN) or vehicle (VEH). After that, half of the animals from each group switch treatments for additional 7 days, resulting in 4 groups: continuous treatment (MIN/MIN), pretreatment (MIN/VEH), early treatment (VEH/MIN) and the control (VEH/VEH). Mechanical allodynia was recorded using Von Frey test until 4 weeks after SNI where depressive-like behaviors of the animals were also assessed using sucrose preference test. Results: The continuous treatment provided sustained protection against mechanical allodynia, with rats in this group showing a significantly higher threshold to pain sensitivity compared to those in VEH/VEH. In contrast, pain relief effects were not observed with MIN/VEH and VEH/MIN. Additionally, animals in MIN/MIN, and VEH/MIN exhibited decreased anhedonic-like behavior at 30 days after SNI, relative to the control. Conclusions: The exposure to an anti-inflammatory drug circa the installation of a neuropathic lesion had a positive impact on allodynia and on anhedonic behavior for a relatively long period after treatment cessation. The results support the assertions that pain trajectories can be altered at pain early stages by targeting the neuroimmune system. This proof-of-concept has the potential to be broadened to other drugs and/or therapeutical schemes

">Decoding the transcriptomic signatures of psychological trauma in human cortex and amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Psychological trauma has profound effects on brain function and precipitates psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals, however, the molecular mechanisms linking trauma with psychiatric risk remain incompletely understood. Using RNA-seq data postmortem brain tissue of a cohort of 304 donors (N=136 with trauma exposure), we investigated transcriptional signatures of trauma exposures in two cortical regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and two amygdala regions (medial amygdala and basolateral amygdala) associated with stress processing and regulation. We focused on dissecting heterogeneity of traumatic experiences in these transcriptional signatures by investigating exposure to several trauma types (childhood, adulthood, complex, single acute, combat, and interpersonal traumas) and interactions with sex. Overall, amygdala regions were more vulnerable to childhood traumas, whereas cortical regions were more vulnerable to adulthood trauma (regardless of childhood experience). Using cell-type-specific expression imputation, we identified a strong transcriptional response of medial amygdala excitatory neurons to childhood trauma, which coincided with dysregulation observed in a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons exposed to hydrocortisone. We resolved multiscale coexpression networks for each brain region and identified modules enriched in trauma signatures and whose connectivity was altered with trauma. Trauma-associated coexpression modules provide insight into coordinated functional dysregulation with different traumas and point to potential gene targets for further dissection. Together, these data provide a characterization of the long-lasting human encoding of traumatic experiences in corticolimbic regions of human brain.

">Distinct optimization of motor control and learning: Self-paced motor learning achieves different motor patterns from overtrained</a></h4>

              
                Self-paced movement, resulting from extensive training and optimization, serves as an ideal model for investigating internal objectives without external constraints within the sensorimotor system. Previous studies have shown that the self-paced movement is consistent within individuals but inconsistent across individuals, highlighting a robust, unique optimization in motor control. Although motor learning is similarly an optimization process, it is unknown whether the internal objectives are shared with motor control and learning, i.e., whether it replicates the motor patterns identified by self-paced motor control. As the optimality principles typically address redundancy, a human behavioral experiment was designed to equate movement distance for motor control and learning, comparing redundant motion parameters, movement velocity, and duration, through detailed analysis that accommodates their nonlinear interaction and significant inter-individual baseline differences. Participants, instructed to use their preferred velocities and duration, exhibited minimal intra-individual variability in motion parameters. Notably, visuomotor shift perturbations exclusively affected velocity, while changes in target distances affected both velocity and duration. These findings suggest that the sensorimotor system employs distinct optimization mechanisms for motor control and learning to resolve redundancy.

">ALS-associated RNA binding proteins converge on UNC13A transcription through regulation of REST</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. Although multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified, a unified molecular basis for ALS has remained elusive. The ALS-associated RNA binding protein (RBP) TDP-43 has previously been shown to stabilize UNC13A mRNA by preventing cryptic exon inclusion. We here show that three ALS-associated RBPs, MATR3, FUS, and hnRNPA1 regulate UNC13A expression by targeting the silencing transcription factor REST. These three RBPs bind to and downregulate REST mRNA and thereby promote UNC13A transcription. REST overexpression was detected not only in response to the loss of each of these three RBPs in cultured cells but also in motor neurons of individuals with familial or sporadic ALS. The functional convergence of four RBPs on the regulation of UNC13A, a gene essential for synaptic transmission, highlights a pivotal contribution of these proteins to maitainance of synaptic integrity. Our findings thus provide key insight into ALS pathogenesis and a basis for the development of new therapeutic agents.

">The role of dopaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic networks in hyposmia in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Olfactory impairment is frequently observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) before motor symptom onset. Patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) are at risk to develop PD and present olfactory dysfunction. Subcortical neuromodulatory nuclei including the substantia nigra, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and the locus coeruleus, may all contribute to olfactory dysfunction. Objective: The objective of this study was to understand the network alterations underlying olfactory dysfunction in PD and in the early prodromal iRBD patients using multimodal MRI. Methods: PD (n = 107), iRBD patients (n = 35) and healthy controls (HC, n = 39) were recruited from the ICEBERG cohort for a cross-sectional study. We separated subjects in Healthy Controls, iRBD patients, and PD patients with or without RBD and with or without anosmia. Olfactory, motor, and cognitive scores were assessed and combined with multimodal imaging. Results: We found that olfaction positively correlated with (i) striatal DaT signal in PD patients; (ii) neuromelanin contrast in the locus coeruleus and (iii) Nucleus Basalis of Meynert grey matter (GM) volume in all patients. These signals were uncorrelated with motor and cognitive scores. Functional connectivity was reduced in regions of the cholinergic olfactory network in anosmic patients. Functional connectivity was also reduced in the noradrenergic network of patients with RBD. Discussion: Our results indicate the implication of the cholinergic network in PD patients with anosmia and a contribution of the noradrenergic network to olfactory dysfunction, only in patients with RBD.

">Over supplementation of folic acid reduces survival 24 hours after hypoxia in male and female Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia is a major component of ischemic stroke. Nutrition has been established as a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke. Over-supplementation of folic acid (FA) has become an increasing problem in the U.S and other countries as more people are consuming at or above the recommended daily amount of FA. The impact of over-supplementation of FA on hypoxia is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate how FA over-supplementation impacts hypoxia outcomes using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Adult w1118 Drosophila melanogaster were placed on control and 100 micromolar folic acid supplemented diets (FASD). Progeny 5 to 6 days old were exposed to hypoxia for two hours prior to returning to normoxic conditions to model reperfusion. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, elevated FA levels were observed in FASD flies. Escape behavior was also demonstrated in hypoxia larvae, and increased hypoxia-induced mortality was exacerbated in FASD flies; however, diet did not influence hypoxia-medicated reductions in climbing motivation and ability. Data obtained suggests that hypoxia has a negative effect on survival and climbing behavior in the flies, and that FA over-supplementation has selected negative health outcomes after hypoxia.

">Effector selection precedes movement specification: evidence from repetition effects in motor planning</a></h4>

              
                Motor performance is influenced by movements that were performed shortly prior. For example, reaction times (RTs) for successive movements are reduced when executed with the same effector, even if the specifics of the consecutive movements differ. These findings have been taken to support the notion that repetition effects in motor planning reflect the involvement of effector-specific motor plans. However, previous studies have confounded motor and visual aspects of repetition: movements have typically been instructed via visual cues, and movement repetition, therefore, implied repeating also the visual cue, so that the latter may be (at least partly) responsible for the observed RT effects. In the present study, participants performed two movements in succession, a prime and a probe action, either with their left or right hand and in one of two directions, inward or outward relative to the body midline. We used different cues for prime and probe actions, so that movement repetitions did not involve repetition of the visual cue. Participants initiated successive same-limb movements faster than different-limb movements, but this RT advantage was smaller than observed in previous work. Moreover, repeating movement direction also led to a decrease in RT, though only in combination with hand repetition. Whereas these findings imply that visual cue repetition can contribute to accelerated RTs in movement repetition, they confirm that the recent motor history affects motor planning. Furthermore, they support the idea of a hierarchical framework of motor planning in which effector selection precedes specification of motor parameters.

">A GABA-A receptor response to CBD following status epilepticus in the medial entorhinal cortex of the rat</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol is a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid that has been implicated as a potential therapeutic in numerous neurological diseases. Perhaps the most widespread therapeutic use of CBD has been in the form of Epidiolex, which is used to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Whilst the effectiveness of CBD in seizure reduction is clear, its mechanism of action is complex, and reflects the wide range of pharmacodynamic targets that includes receptors, ion channels and enzymes. This study investigated the effects of action of cannabidiol (CBD) on GABAergic transmission in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex in animals that had previously undergone a period of status epilepticus (SE). Spontaneous post-synaptic currents were recorded from medial entorhinal cortex layer II pyramidal cells in animals 1-7 after SE and in age matched controls as well as in tissue resected from children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). CBD enhanced GABAAR-mediated inhibition by increasing decay times and inhibitory charge transfer across the postsynaptic membrane in status epilepticus (SE) but did not alter GABAergic transmission in age-matched control rats. The SE-induced effects of CBD were blocked by ligands acting as inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAAR receptor and the effects of CBD were additive to low-doses of benzodiazepine and barbiturate agonists, consistent with allosteric actions on the GABAAR. Similar effects were observed in both SE rat and human layer II neurons. Overall, these data suggest CBD may act as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) at postsynaptic GABAARs and this action appears to develop following SE.

">Topography of putative bidirectional interaction between hippocampal sharp wave ripples and neocortical slow oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation relies on coordination between hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) and neocortical UP/DOWN states during sleep. However, whether this coupling exists across neocortex and the mechanisms enabling it remain unknown. By combining electrophysiology in mouse hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) with widefield imaging of dorsal neocortex, we found spatially and temporally precise bidirectional hippocampo-neocortical interaction. HPC multi-unit activity and SWR probability were correlated with UP/DOWN states in mouse default mode network (DMN), with highest modulation by RSC in deep sleep. Further, some SWRs were preceded by the high rebound excitation accompanying DMN DOWN[-&gt;]UP transitions, while large-amplitude SWRs were often followed by DOWN states originating in RSC. We explain these electrophysiological results with a model in which HPC and RSC are weakly coupled excitable systems capable of bi-directional perturbation and suggest RSC may act as a gateway through which SWRs can perturb downstream cortical regions via cortico-cortical propagation of DOWN states.

">Convergent olfactory circuits for courtship in Drosophila revealed by ds-Tango</a></h4>

              
                Animals exhibit sex-specific behaviors that are governed by sexually dimorphic circuits. One such behavior in male Drosophila melanogaster, courtship, is regulated by various sensory modalities, including olfaction. Here, we reveal how sexually dimorphic olfactory pathways in male flies converge at the third-order, onto lateral horn output neurons, to regulate courtship. To achieve this, we developed ds-Tango, a modified version of the monosynaptic tracing and manipulation tool trans-Tango. In ds-Tango, two distinct configurations of trans-Tango are positioned in series, thus providing selective genetic access not only to the monosynaptic partners of starter neurons but also to their disynaptic connections. Using ds-Tango, we identified a node of convergence for three sexually dimorphic olfactory pathways. Silencing this node results in deficits in sex recognition of potential partners. Our results identify lateral horn output neurons required for proper courtship behavior in male flies and establish ds-Tango as a tool for disynaptic circuit tracing.

	<p>Emerging research into the human microbiome, an intricate ecosystem of microorganisms residing in and on our bodies, reveals that it plays a pivotal role in maintaining our health, highlighting the potential for microbiome-based interventions to prevent, diagnose, treat, and manage a myriad of diseases. The objective of this review is to highlight the importance of microbiome studies in enhancing our understanding of rare genetic epilepsy and related neurological disorders. Studies suggest that the gut microbiome, acting through the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis, impacts the development and severity of epileptic conditions in children. Disruptions in microbial composition can affect neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory responses, and immune regulation, which are all critical factors in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. This growing body of evidence points to the potential of microbiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics or dietary modifications, as innovative approaches to managing epilepsy. By harnessing the power of the microbiome, we stand to develop more effective and personalized treatment strategies for children affected by this disease and other rare neurological diseases.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Sensorimotor dysfunction is often reported in individuals experiencing neck pain, irrespective of severity and chronicity. The treatment of neck dysfunction has been found to positively impact sensorimotor integration (SMI), thereby improving sensorimotor function. However, no patient-reported outcome measure has been validated for discrimination between healthy individuals and neck pain patients with disordered SMI, nor has there been documentation of positive change in SMI following neck pain treatment.The purpose of this study was to administer the Sensory-Motor Dysfunction Questionnaire (SMD-Q), for the purposes of: (1) known-group validity between individuals without and with chronic neck pain (CNP) or subclinical neck pain (SCNP); (2) assess the questionnaire&amp;amp;rsquo;s capacity to quantify changes in altered SMI following a tailored treatment plan. Methods: Part 1&amp;amp;mdash;Known Group Validity: The SMD-Q was administered to 30 neck pain (13 with CNP, and 17 with SCNP), and 30 healthy participants. Part 2&amp;amp;mdash;Sensitivity to Change: The SMD-Q was re-administered to neck pain participants following their tailored treatment plans (SCNP&amp;amp;mdash;8-weeks and CNP&amp;amp;mdash;12 weeks). Results: The SMD-Q can discriminate between healthy and neck pain participants (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001), and may be sensitive to showing treatment effects (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.162; large effect size (ES)), but the sample size was too small to determine if it can discriminate treatment effects between groups (&amp;amp;eta;p2 = 0.070; medium ES). Conclusions: Differing degrees of disordered SMI can be discriminated by the SMD-Q, but further research is needed to determine its sensitivity to treatment.</p>

	<p>The inexorable progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, is closely related to irreversible brain decline. Accurately characterizing pathophysiological features and identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and optimized treatment are critical. Hindered by the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), obtaining sensitive monitoring indicators for disease progression and achieving efficient drug delivery remain significant challenges. Exosomes, endogenous nanoscale vesicles that carry key bioactive substances, reflect the intracellular environment and play an important role in cell signaling. They have shown promise in traversing the BBB, serving dual roles as potential biomarkers for NDs and vehicles for targeted drug delivery. However, the specific mechanisms by which exosome influence NDs are not fully understood, necessitating further investigation into their attributes and functionalities in the context of NDs. This review explores how exosomes mediate multifaceted interactions, particularly in exacerbating pathogenic processes such as oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and apoptosis integral to NDs. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the profound impact of exosomes under stress and disease states, assessing their prospective utility as biomarkers and drug delivery vectors, offering new perspectives for tackling these challenging diseases.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Hypnosis shows great potential for managing patients suffering from fibromyalgia and chronic pain. Several studies have highlighted its efficacy in improving pain, quality of life, and reducing psychological distress. Despite its known feasibility and efficacy, the mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Building on these insights, this innovative study aims to assess neural activity during hypnosis in fibromyalgia patients using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and self-reported measures. Methods: Thirteen participants with fibromyalgia were included in this study. EEG recordings were done during resting state and hypnosis conditions. After both conditions, levels of pain, comfort, absorption, and dissociation were assessed using a numerical rating scale. Time perception was collected via an open-ended question. The study was prospectively registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov public registry (NCT04263324). Results: Neural oscillations showed increased theta power during hypnosis in the left parietal and occipital electrodes, increased beta power in the frontal and left temporal electrodes, and increased slow-gamma power in the frontal and left parietal electrodes. Functional connectivity using pairwise-phase consistency measures showed decreased connectivity in the frontal electrodes during hypnosis. Graph-based measures, the node strength, and the cluster coefficient were lower in frontal electrodes in the slow-gamma bands during hypnosis compared to resting state. Key findings indicate significant changes in neural oscillations and brain functional connectivity, suggesting potential electrophysiological markers of hypnosis in this patient population.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Vulnerability to sound distraction is commonly reported in older adults with dementia and tends to be associated with adverse impacts on daily activity. However, study outcome heterogeneity is increasingly evident, with preserved resistance to distraction also evident. Contributory factors may include individual differences in distractibility in older adulthood per se, and failure to consider the influence of how difficult a person found the test. Methods: We therefore measured distractibility in a group of older adults by comparing the performance of a primary visual task (Swansea Test of Attentional Control), which includes an adaptive algorithm to take into account how difficult a person finds the test under both no-sound and sound conditions. Results: Analysis revealed no significant difference in group mean performance between no-sound versus sound conditions [t (33) = 0.181, p = 0.858; Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size d = &amp;amp;minus;0.028], but individual differences in performance both within and between sound and no-sound conditions were evident, indicating that for older adults, distracting sounds can be neutral, detrimental, or advantageous with respect to visual task performance. It was not possible to determine individual thresholds for whether sound versus no-sound conditions affected a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s actual behaviour. Conclusions: Nevertheless, our findings indicate how variable such effects may be in older adults, which in turn may help to explain outcome heterogeneity in studies including people living with dementia. Furthermore, such within-group heterogeneity highlights the importance of considering a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s individual performance in order to better understand their behaviour and initiate interventions as required.</p>

	<p>Rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare syndrome presenting in early childhood associated with a high risk of mortality between 50 and 60%. It is characterised by rapid, early onset of obesity between 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;7 years, along with central hypoventilation and hypothalamic dysfunction, such as central hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, disorders of sodium and water balance, growth hormone deficiency, adrenocortical insufficiency, or disorders of puberty and features of autonomic dysregulation. Up to half of cases have neural crest tumours, most commonly ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas. The incidence of ROHHAD syndrome in any population is unknown. Currently, there is no specific diagnostic or genetic biomarker for ROHHAD, and diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, which is often challenging, and consequently may be delayed or unrecognised. Early diagnosis is important, as without intervention, ROHHAD is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Aetiology remains unclear; an autoimmune origin has been postulated, with immunosuppressive agents being used with variable benefit. With no cure, multidisciplinary management is largely supportive. Therefore, there are many unanswered questions in ROHHAD syndrome. In this review article, we outline the challenges posed by ROHHAD syndrome, including aetiology, genetics, diagnosis, screening, management, and prognosis. We present research priorities to tackle these issues to improve outcomes.</p>

                <p>The formation and precise positioning of axons and dendrites are crucial for the development of neural circuits. Although juxtacrine signaling via cell&ndash;cell contact is known to influence these processes, the specific structures and mechanisms regulating neuronal process positioning within the central nervous system (CNS) remain to be fully identified. Our study investigates motoneuron 24 (MN24) in the <I>Drosophila</I> embryonic CNS, which is characterized by a complex yet stereotyped axon projection pattern, known as "axonal routing." In this motoneuron, the primary dendritic branches project laterally toward the midline, specifically emerging at the sites where axons turn. We observed that Scp2-positive neurons contribute to the lateral fascicle structure in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) near MN24 dendrites. Notably, the knockout of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (<I>Dscam1</I>) results in the loss of dendrites and disruption of proper axonal routing in MN24, while not affecting the formation of the fascicle structure. Through cell-type specific knockdown and rescue experiments of Dscam1, we have determined that the interaction between MN24 and Scp2-positive fascicle, mediated by Dscam1, promotes the development of both dendrites and axonal routing. Our findings demonstrate that the holistic configuration of neuronal structures, such as axons and dendrites, within single motoneurons can be governed by local contact with the adjacent neuron fascicle, a novel reference structure for neural circuitry wiring.</p>

                <p>Confirmation bias (CB) is a cognitive bias that allows us to fool ourselves by selectively filtering data and distorting analyses to support favored beliefs or hypotheses. In this article, I will briefly review some classic experiments from cognitive psychology that illustrate what a powerful, pernicious, and insidious force CB is. I will then discuss how to recognize CB in our own thinking and behavior and describe specific elements of good experimental design that can mitigate its effects. These elements&mdash;such as randomization and blinding&mdash;are conceptually straightforward but often difficult in practice and therefore not as widely implemented as they should be.</p>

                Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor clinical outcomes. Hence cost-effective drugs with fewer side effects as a standard supportive therapy might yield substantial advantages in efficacy and safety. Kadukkai maathirai (KM) is being used as a supplement in hepatocellular carcinoma. We evaluated whether KM has any preventive action on cancer progression in diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) - induced HCC in rats. Methods DEN was injected to produce HCC in rats, which was confirmed after 16 weeks. All the rats were orally administered KM for 4 weeks. Hepatoprotective potential (serum AST, ALT, ALP, Bilirubin) and anticancer efficacy (body weight, nodule count, tumor progression by histopathology, expression of GSTM1 by Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and In-silico analysis of phytoconstituents against β catenin and LRP analysis were evaluated. Results KM prevented cancer progression against DEN-induced HCC by an increase in GSTM1, a phase II detoxifying enzyme. It significantly reversed altered nodule count, relative liver weight, body weight, and histopathological features of HCC. In silico analysis of phytoconstituents of KM showed that they modulate the intracellular transcription process by inhibiting the armadillo repeat region of β catenin. Conclusions Our results elucidate the potential of KM as a supplement in HCC by reducing nodule count, protecting the liver from further damage, GSTM1 expression, and inhibiting armadillo repeat region of β catenin.

                Introduction Gastroparesis, a global condition causing bile salt accumulation, is prevalent globally. Diagnosis techniques like bile salt titration and nitric oxide sulfate can improve patient care. However, simptomatic control is needed to reduce inflammation and control potential diseases. Neurological techniques like gyroscope stimulation and endoscopy can diagnose refractive gastroparesis. Interdisciplinary collaboration and bibliometric research are crucial for finding effective treatments. Gastroparesis, a motility issue affecting 0.9-1.3% of diabetics, can be improved by new diagnostic methods like osmotic pressure and gastric emptying, enhancing patient treatment. Methods This study uses a literature review methodology to gather data from the Scopus database on neuroaid, analyzing it using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software. The focus is on dietary adjustments, glucose regulation, and transcutaneous stimulation’s role in gastroparesis treatment, using quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most relevant sources, factorial map of the most cited documents, factorial map of The documents with the highest contributes, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, documents by affiliation, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, topic dendogram, and country collaboration map. According to our analysis, transcutaneous stimulation holds great promise for treating gastroparesis. We also found the necessity of multidisciplinary collaboration in the management of this illness. Conclusions The study on gastroparesis highlights key themes like diet modification, glucose control, medication therapy, Cajal’s role in smooth muscle concentration, common causes, transcutaneous stimulation, motorcycle themes, vagus nerve, and emerging devices and electronics. Basic themes include gastrointestinal disorders, neuromodulation, patients, diabetes, and gastric electrical stimulation. The management of gastroparesis involves multidisciplinary approaches, lifestyle changes, medication therapy, and bedtime interventions, with further investigation into transcutaneous stimulation being warranted.

                Background Several studies have shown that the retrieval of positive memories may play a role in emotional regulation. However, it is unclear whether the effects of neutral and positive autobiographical memories differ. It is necessary to confirm whether genuinely neutral autobiographical memories can be retrieved without bias when prompted to recall neutral memories. Methods In this pilot study, using “home” and “study” as cue words, we investigated whether participants were able to retrieve appropriate autobiographical memories when asked to recall a limited number of neutral or positive memories. Results Although participants were asked to recall neutral autobiographical memories, they tended to recall positive memories. Conclusions Our results support the concept of positive memory bias and suggest that future work should consider combining neutral and positive autobiographical memories by asking participants to recall neutral–positive memories.

                Background This study delves into the intricate interplay among paradoxical leadership (PL), employees’ proactive work behaviour (PAB), and perceived psychological contract fulfilment (PPCF). PL, characterized by its simultaneous emphasis on apparently contradictory behaviours, has garnered attention due to its potential to foster innovation, adaptability, and creativity. The study’s main objective is to thoroughly explore the complexities of PL, its influence on PAB, and whether the PPCF serves as a mediator. Methods A survey was distributed to 338 hotel and travel agency employees to gather data. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling through a SmartPLS program. Results The results reveal a positive correlation between PL and PAB. Additionally, PPCF partially mediates this relationship, indicating its vital role in exploring the positive impact of PL on boosting proactive behaviours. Conclusions This research brings forth meaningful contributions to both theoretical and practical dimensions. Theoretically, it enhances our comprehension of how PL manifests in the distinctive landscape of the hospitality and tourism domain, substantiating its potential to drive proactive behaviours among employees. The mediation of PPCF enriches our grasp of the underlying mechanisms, accentuating the significance of maintaining harmonized and consistent leadership practices. From a practical vantage point, these findings offer valuable insights for hospitality and tourism establishments aspiring to optimize their leadership strategies for cultivating proactive work behaviour among their workforces.

                Purpose There is no evidence comparing the treatment results of hemoglobin spray and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in chronic wounds. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and role of hemoglobin spray in the treatment of chronic wounds. The probabilities of being the best treatment option were estimated and ranked between hemoglobin spray and HBOT. Methods A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and PROSPERO number: CRD42020161396. Results A total of 934 studies were identified from PUBMED and SCOPUS databases, and 112 articles were deleted. Among the 24 studies, 16 RCTs and eight cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. In direct meta-analysis, HBOT had higher proportion of wound healing rate than control with pooled risk ratios (RRs) of 1.67 (95%CI: 1.10, 2.52). Hemoglobin spray had a higher wound healing rate than the control, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.92 (95%CI: 1.35, 2.73). In the network meta-analysis, the probability of being the best treatment was hemoglobin spray, followed by hyperbaric, with surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRAs) of 67.9, and 32.1, respectively. Conclusions Our evidence suggests that the proportion of wound healing in the hemoglobin spray and HBOT groups was higher than that in the control group. A network meta-analysis demonstrated that hemoglobin spray had the highest chance of treatment success. There is a need for further studies using well-designed RCTs and updated meta-analyses to provide enough evidence to compare the effectiveness of hemoglobin spray and HBOT in clinical practice.

                Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered a global health crisis. It results in injury to the brain from an external impact leading to severe disability, with higher incidence statistics recently observed in young adults and elderly individuals. Purpose The review aims to analyze current research findings explaining the prevalence, incidence, and demographics of such injuries stressing the need for enhanced prevention and management techniques. The pathophysiology involves a complex cascade of biochemical and cellular events, which results in necrotic-apoptotic neuronal cell death. Method The review synthesizes current research on TBI, highlighting epidemiological data, advanced diagnostics, and effective rehabilitation strategies like physical and cognitive therapy. Findings Traumatic Brain Injury is an important public health issue with high morbidity and mortality rates causing extreme damage to a person, such as comas, catatonic states for various years, or lifelong injury or demolition. Early diagnostic imaging techniques include CT, MRI, advanced neuroimaging methods, and blood-based biomarkers. In the acute setting, initial management is directed toward stabilizing and preventing secondary injuries and early mobilization. The goals of rehabilitation are to promote the highest level of functional independence and physical function, cognitive functions, and social integration. Conclusion This review highlights that the use of new rehabilitation technologies, such as VR-based and robot-assisted therapies, might lead to improved recovery. Long-term supportive care combined with community integration is mandatory for enhancing quality of life. A systematic multidisciplinary team approach and family support are needed for traumatic brain injury survivors.

                The finite-volume theory has shown to be numerically efficient and stable for topology optimization of continuum elastic structures. The significant features of this numerical technique are the local satisfaction of equilibrium equations and the employment of compatibility conditions along edges in a surface-averaged sense. These are essential properties to adequately mitigate some numerical instabilities in the gradient version of topology optimization algorithms, such as checkerboard, mesh dependence, and local minima issues. Several computational tools have been proposed for topology optimization employing analysis domains discretized with essential features for finite-element approaches. However, this is the first contribution to offer a platform to generate optimized topologies by employing a Matlab code based on the finite-volume theory for compliance minimization problems. The Top2DFVT provides a platform to perform 2D topology optimization of structures in Matlab, from domain initialization for structured meshes to data post-processing. This contribution represents a significant advancement over earlier publications on topology optimization based on the finite-volume theory, which needed more efficient computational tools. Moreover, the Top2DFVT algorithm incorporates SIMP and RAMP material interpolation schemes alongside sensitivity and density filtering techniques, culminating in a notably enhanced optimization tool. The application of this algorithm to various illustrative cases confirms its efficacy and underscores its potential for advancing the field of structural optimization.

                Introduction Numerous studies have concluded that the functional ingredients benefit human health. Similarly, present times have seen exponential growth in functional food in bakery product segments like breads and biscuits. However, there is a lack of information on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional bakery products. This bibliometric study addresses this gap by identifying the current research trends in functional ingredients. Objective To investigate current research trends on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional biscuits. Method The study followed the “Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews” standards for retrieving literature. The study went through three major stages, “assembling”, “arranging”, and “assessing” to retrieve 612 articles from the Scopus database from 2013 to 2023. Through further filtering, 395 articles were selected. Result The analysis was conducted using R Studio and VOS viewer. The performance analysis and science mapping tools were used to evaluate the articles. The results showed a 5.76% annual growth in publication trends. The most researched functional ingredients were antioxidants, bioactive compounds, and dietary fiber. The review summarized the most studied foods used to develop functional biscuits and highlighted the most experimented technological advancements. Conclusion The study revealed the need for future research studies on functional ingredients with a focus on studying the implications of technical implications of technical advancements in extracting functional ingredients from foods. The study highlights the significance of future studies based on the acceptance of functional biscuits and their sensory properties focusing on the mass population. The study derives the knowledge on possible applicability of functional ingredients in developing new formulations from publications and their usefulness in developing new formulations. This insight on the applicability of functional ingredients provides an opportunity for biscuit/cookie manufacturing to boost consumption among the population to a new ascending graph.

                Background Prosthetic joint infection is a serious complication that can arise after total joint replacement surgery. When bacteria colonise an orthopaedic implant, they form biofilms that protect them from their environment, making them difficult to remove. Treatment is further complicated by a global rise of antimicrobial resistance. These protective mechanisms make treatment of prosthetic joint infection increasingly complex. Non-contact induction heating is an upcoming technology that uses heat to eradicate bacteria that are present on the surface of metallic implants. This study aims to provide insight into the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating on metallic implants that are in direct contact with other biomaterials, such as coatings composed of hydroxyapatite and bone cement composed of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Methods Characterisation of hydroxyapatite coatings and adhesion strength tests were conducted according to standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 13779-2). The fixation strength of acrylic bone cement was tested according to an adapted method from ISO. Results It was found that non-contact induction heating did not significantly affect the adhesion strength of hydroxyapatite coatings. In contrast to hydroxyapatite coatings, acrylic bone cement softened temporarily as the temperature exceeded the glass transition temperature (83.38 ± 10.88°C). However, the induction heating temperature had no significant effect on the fixation strength after the cement was allowed to cool down. Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating up to 80°C when bone cement or ceramic coatings are present in contact with infected metallic implants.

The translated protein undergoes a specific modification process, which involves the formation of covalent bonds on lysine residues and the attachment of small chemical moieties. The protein’s fundamental physicochemical properties undergo a significant alteration. The change significantly alters the proteins’ 3D structure and activity, enabling them to modulate key physiological processes. The modulation encompasses inhibiting cancer cell growth, delaying ovarian aging, regulating metabolic diseases, and ameliorating depression. Consequently, the identification and comprehension of post-translational lysine modifications hold substantial value in the realms of biological research and drug development. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) at lysine (K) sites are among the most common protein modifications. However, research on K-PTMs has been largely centered on identifying individual modification types, with a relative scarcity of balanced data analysis techniques. In this study, a classification system is developed for the prediction of concurrent multiple modifications at a single lysine residue. Initially, a well-established multi-label position-specific triad amino acid propensity algorithm is utilized for feature encoding. Subsequently, PreMLS: a novel ClusterCentroids undersampling algorithm based on MiniBatchKmeans was introduced to eliminate redundant or similar major class samples, thereby mitigating the issue of class imbalance. A convolutional neural network architecture was specifically constructed for the analysis of biological sequences to predict multiple lysine modification sites. The model, evaluated through five-fold cross-validation and independent testing, was found to significantly outperform existing models such as iMul-kSite and predML-Site. The results presented here aid in prioritizing potential lysine modification sites, facilitating subsequent biological assays and advancing pharmaceutical research. To enhance accessibility, an open-access predictive script has been crafted for the multi-label predictive model developed in this study.

We hypothesize that sample species abundance, sequencing depth, and taxonomic relatedness influence the recovery of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). To test this hypothesis, we assessed MAG recovery in three in silico microbial communities composed of 42 species with the same richness but different sample species abundance, sequencing depth, and taxonomic distribution profiles using three different pipelines for MAG recovery. The pipeline developed by Parks and colleagues (8K) generated the highest number of MAGs and the lowest number of true positives per community profile. The pipeline by Karst and colleagues (DT) showed the most accurate results (~ 92%), outperforming the 8K and Multi-Metagenome pipeline (MM) developed by Albertsen and collaborators. Sequencing depth influenced the accurate recovery of genomes when using the 8K and MM, even with contrasting patterns: the MM pipeline recovered more MAGs found in the original communities when employing sequencing depths up to 60 million reads, while the 8K recovered more true positives in communities sequenced above 60 million reads. DT showed the best species recovery from the same genus, even though close-related species have a low recovery rate in all pipelines. Our results highlight that more bins do not translate to the actual community composition and that sequencing depth plays a role in MAG recovery and increased community resolution. Even low MAG recovery error rates can significantly impact biological inferences. Our data indicates that the scientific community should curate their findings from MAG recovery, especially when asserting novel species or metabolic traits.

                <p>by Carrisa V. Cocuzza, Ruben Sanchez-Romero, Takuya Ito, Ravi D. Mill, Brian P. Keane, Michael W. Cole</p>

A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how function-relevant brain activations are generated. Here we test the hypothesis that function-relevant brain activations are generated primarily by distributed network flows. We focused on visual processing in human cortex, given the long-standing literature supporting the functional relevance of brain activations in visual cortex regions exhibiting visual category selectivity. We began by using fMRI data from N = 352 human participants to identify category-specific responses in visual cortex for images of faces, places, body parts, and tools. We then systematically tested the hypothesis that distributed network flows can generate these localized visual category selective responses. This was accomplished using a recently developed approach for simulating – in a highly empirically constrained manner – the generation of task-evoked brain activations by modeling activity flowing over intrinsic brain connections. We next tested refinements to our hypothesis, focusing on how stimulus-driven network interactions initialized in V1 generate downstream visual category selectivity. We found evidence that network flows directly from V1 were sufficient for generating visual category selectivity, but that additional, globally distributed (whole-cortex) network flows increased category selectivity further. Using null network architectures we also found that each region’s unique intrinsic “connectivity fingerprint” was key to the generation of category selectivity. These results generalized across regions associated with all four visual categories tested (bodies, faces, places, and tools), and provide evidence that the human brain’s intrinsic network organization plays a prominent role in the generation of functionally relevant, localized responses.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011948">Computational joint action: Dynamical models to understand the development of joint coordination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cecilia De Vicariis, Vinil T. Chackochan, Laura Bandini, Eleonora Ravaschio, Vittorio Sanguineti</p>

Coordinating with others is part of our everyday experience. Previous studies using sensorimotor coordination games suggest that human dyads develop coordination strategies that can be interpreted as Nash equilibria. However, if the players are uncertain about what their partner is doing, they develop coordination strategies which are robust to the actual partner’s actions. This has suggested that humans select their actions based on an explicit prediction of what the partner will be doing—a partner model—which is probabilistic by nature. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of a joint coordination over repeated trials remain unknown. Very much like sensorimotor adaptation of individuals to external perturbations (eg force fields or visual rotations), dynamical models may help to understand how joint coordination develops over repeated trials. Here we present a general computational model—based on game theory and Bayesian estimation—designed to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of a joint coordination over repeated trials. Joint tasks are modeled as quadratic games, where each participant’s task is expressed as a quadratic cost function. Each participant predicts their partner’s next move (partner model) by optimally combining predictions and sensory observations, and selects their actions through a stochastic optimization of its expected cost, given the partner model. The model parameters include perceptual uncertainty (sensory noise), partner representation (retention rate and internale noise), uncertainty in action selection and its rate of decay (which can be interpreted as the action’s learning rate). The model can be used in two ways: (i) to simulate interactive behaviors, thus helping to make specific predictions in the context of a given joint action scenario; and (ii) to analyze the action time series in actual experiments, thus providing quantitative metrics that describe individual behaviors during an actual joint action. We demonstrate the model in a variety of joint action scenarios. In a sensorimotor version of the Stag Hunt game, the model predicts that different representations of the partner lead to different Nash equilibria. In a joint two via-point (2-VP) reaching task, in which the actions consist of complex trajectories, the model captures well the observed temporal evolution of performance. For this task we also estimated the model parameters from experimental observations, which provided a comprehensive characterization of individual dyad participants. Computational models of joint action may help identifying the factors preventing or facilitating the development of coordination. They can be used in clinical settings, to interpret the observed behaviors in individuals with impaired interaction capabilities. They may also provide a theoretical basis to devise artificial agents that establish forms of coordination that facilitate neuromotor recovery.

Hepatic lipid metabolism is regulated by the autonomic nervous system of the liver, with the sympathetic innervation being extensively studied, while the parasympathetic efferent innervation is less understood despite its potential importance. In this study, we investigate the consequences of disrupted brain–liver communication on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice exposed to obesogenic conditions. We found that a subset of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes are innervated by parasympathetic nerve terminals originating from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The elimination of the brain–liver axis by deleting parasympathetic cholinergic neurons innervating the liver prevents hepatic steatosis and promotes browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT). The loss of liver-innervating cholinergic neurons increases hepatic <i>Cyp7b1</i> expression and fasting serum bile acid levels. Furthermore, knockdown of the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 gene in ingWAT reverses the beneficial effects of the loss of liver-innervating cholinergic neurons, leading to the reappearance of hepatic steatosis. Deleting liver-innervating cholinergic neurons has a small but significant effect on body weight, which is accompanied by an increase in energy expenditure. Taken together, these data suggest that targeting the parasympathetic cholinergic innervation of the liver is a potential therapeutic approach for enhancing hepatic lipid metabolism in obesity and diabetes.

tRNAs are evolutionarily ancient molecular decoders essential for protein translation. In eukaryotes, tRNAs and other short, noncoding RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) III, an enzyme that promotes ageing in yeast, worms, and flies. Here, we show that a partial reduction in Pol III activity specifically disrupts tRNA levels. This effect is conserved across worms, flies, and mice, where computational models indicate that it impacts mRNA decoding. In all 3 species, reduced Pol III activity increases proteostatic resilience. In worms, it activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and direct disruption of tRNA metabolism is sufficient to recapitulate this. In flies, decreasing Pol III’s transcriptional initiation on tRNA genes by a loss-of-function in the TFIIIC transcription factor robustly extends lifespan, improves proteostatic resilience and recapitulates the broad-spectrum benefits to late-life health seen following partial Pol III inhibition. We provide evidence that a partial reduction in Pol III activity impacts translation, quantitatively or qualitatively, in both worms and flies, indicating a potential mode of action. Our work demonstrates a conserved and previously unappreciated role of tRNAs in animal ageing.

                <p>by Meiyu Ruan, Fan Xu, Na Li, Jing Yu, Fukang Teng, Jiawei Tang, Cheng Huang, Huanhu Zhu</p>

Postembryonic development of animals has long been considered an internally predetermined program, while macronutrients were believed to be essential solely for providing biomatters and energy to support this process. However, in this study, by using a nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (abbreviated as <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> hereafter) model, we surprisingly discovered that dietary supplementation of palmitic acid alone, rather than other abundant essential nutrients such as glucose or amino acid mixture, was sufficient to initiate early postembryonic development even under complete macronutrient deprivation. Such a development was evidenced by changes in morphology, cellular markers in multiple tissues, behaviors, and the global transcription pattern and it occurred earlier than the well-known early L1 nutrient checkpoint. Mechanistically, palmitic acid did not function as a biomatter/energy provider, but rather as a ligand to activate the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49/80, leading to the production of an unknown peroxisome-derived secretive hormone in the intestine. This hormonal signal was received by chemosensory neurons in the head, regulating the insulin-like neuropeptide secretion and its downstream nuclear receptor to orchestrate global development. Additionally, the nutrient-sensing hub mTORC1 played a negative role in this process. In conclusion, our data indicate that free fatty acids act as a primary nutrient signal to launch the early development in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, which suggests that specific nutrients, rather than the internal genetic program, serve as the first impetus for postembryonic development.

Pre-babbling infants can track nonadjacent dependencies (NADs) in the auditory domain. While this forms a crucial prerequisite for language acquisition, the neurodevelopmental origins of this ability remain unknown. We applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy in neonates and 6- to 7-month-old infants to investigate the neural substrate supporting NAD learning and detection using tone sequences in an artificial grammar learning paradigm. Detection of NADs was indicated by left prefrontal activation in neonates while by left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), and inferior frontal gyrus activation in 6- to 7-month-olds. Functional connectivity analyses further indicated that the neonate activation pattern during the test phase benefited from a brain network consisting of prefrontal regions, left SMG and STG during the rest and learning phases. These findings suggest a left-hemispheric learning-related functional brain network may emerge at birth and serve as the foundation for the later engagement of these regions for NAD detection, thus, providing a neural basis for language acquisition.
