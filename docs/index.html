              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Motor Plans under Uncertainty Reflect a Trade-Off between Maximizing Reward and Success</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>When faced with multiple potential movement options, individuals either reach directly to one of the options, or initiate a reach intermediate between the options. It remains unclear why people generate these two types of behaviors. Using the go-before-you-know task (commonly used to study behavior under choice uncertainty) in humans, we examined two key questions. First, do these two types of responses actually reflect distinct movement strategies? If so, the relative desirability (i.e., weighing the success likelihood vs the attainable reward) of the two target options would not need to be computed identically for direct and intermediate reaches. We showed that indeed, when reward and success likelihood differed between the two options, reach direction was preferentially biased toward different directions for direct versus intermediate reaches. Importantly, this suggests that the computation of subjective values depends on the choice of movement strategy. Second, what drives individual differences in how people respond under uncertainty? We found that risk/reward-seeking individuals tended to generate more intermediate reaches and were more responsive to changes in reward, suggesting these movements may reflect a strategy to maximize reward versus success. Together, these findings suggest that when faced with choice uncertainty, individuals adopt movement strategies consistent with their risk/reward attitude, preferentially biasing behavior toward exogenous rewards or endogenous success and consequently modulating the relative desirability of the available options.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Opioid and Sucrose Craving Are Accompanied by Unique Behavioral and Affective Profiles after Extended Abstinence in Male and Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Incubation of craving refers to the intensification of drug-seeking behavior in response to reward-paired cues over the course of abstinence. In rodents, craving and drug-seeking behaviors have been measured by an increase in lever pressing in the absence of reinforcer availability in response to cue presentations. However, craving in rodents is difficult to define and little is known about the behavioral signatures that accompany increased drug-seeking behavior measured by lever pressing. The affective components of relapse are also important, but understudied in rodents. Hormonal fluctuations influence craving for psychostimulants, but little is known about the impact of the estrous cycle on opioid-seeking behavior. This study sought to delineate the behavioral and affective signatures associated with craving, and to examine the influence of the female estrous cycle on craving. Male and female rats underwent 10 d of intravenous opioid self-administration. Separate cohorts of control rats self-administered oral sucrose, a natural nondrug reward. Cue-induced seeking tests were conducted after 1 or 30d of forced abstinence. These sessions were recorded and scored for overall locomotion, instances of sniffing, grooming, or hyperactivity. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were also recorded to determine affective profiles that accompany opioid seeking. Although active lever presses and overall locomotion increased unanimously over extended abstinence from heroin and sucrose, a sex- and reinforcer-specific behavioral and affective signature of craving emerged. Furthermore, although the female estrous cycle did not affect taking or seeking, it appears to influence more granular behaviors.</p>

                Tanigawa et al. show that dynamically changing neural oscillation patterns of specific frequencies in the macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC) carry mutually distinct information about the same color of memory-recalled target and perceived object. This suggests that the prefrontal oscillations distinguish between perceptual experiences driven by internal memory and external perception.

                By comparing resting-state networks in humans, macaques, marmosets, and mouse lemurs, Garin et al. identify two networks in non-hominoid primates that include homolog areas of the human default mode network. The mPFC and PCC are tightly connected in the human DMN but poorly connected to each other across non-hominoid primates.

                The body temperature rhythm (BTR) is vital for maintaining homeostasis. Drosophila exhibit a daily temperature preference rhythm (TPR), which generates BTR. Chen et al. show that dorsal clock neurons in the brain form a time-dependent network and govern TPR by regulating a rhythmic pattern and a temperature setpoint.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A Zika virus mutation enhances transmission potential and confers escape from protective dengue virus immunity</a></h4>

              
                Regla-Nava et al. find that serial passaging of ZIKV strain in vitro/in vivo produces a single mutation that is sufficient to enhance ZIKV virulence and escape the protective effects of pre-existing DENV immunity. NS2B I39V/I39T mutation significantly increases infectivity in human fetal NPCs and mosquitoes and enhanced pathogenicity in mice.

                Martin-Martin et al. describe the function of an Aedes aegypti salivary peptide, sialokinin. It modulates macrophages, alters endothelial permeability, promotes leukocyte recruitment, induces nitric oxide release, and interferes with hemostasis via NK1R signaling. Sialokinin promotes blood perfusion and ensures short probing time. These findings demonstrate its antihemostatic and immunomodulator role.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The Arabidopsis F-box protein FBW2 targets AGO1 for degradation to prevent spurious loading of illegitimate small RNA</a></h4>

              
                Argonaute proteins, main effectors of RNA silencing, remain stable only when they are loaded with small RNA. Hacquard et al. show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase component FBW2 triggers empty AGO1 degradation in Arabidopsis. Interfering with this mechanism leads to AGO1 spurious loading of illegitimate small RNA and off-target cleavage.

                RNAa is a mechanism of transcriptional activation mediated by small RNAs. Ohno et al. identify the positive transcription elongation factors CDK9 and DDX21, which form a complex with nuclear AGO and TNRC6A, as transcriptional activators of RNAa. The findings reveal a connection between RNAa and release of paused Pol II.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Interrogation of cancer gene dependencies reveals paralog interactions of autosome and sex chromosome-encoded genes</a></h4>

              
                Köferle et al. present a resource of cancer-relevant genetic interactions between paralog genes. They highlight RPP25 and RPP25L as subunits of RNase P/MRP in tRNA processing. They validate redundancies between chrX- and chrY-encoded paralogs (ZFX-ZFY, DDX3X-DDX3Y, and EIF1AX-EIF1AY), identifying chrX paralogs as therapeutic targets for tumors with loss of chrY.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Repurposing antiparasitic antimonials to noncovalently rescue temperature-sensitive p53 mutations</a></h4>

              
                Tang et al. reported that the antiparasitic PAT noncovalently reactivated 65 temperature-sensitive p53 mutants. PAT met the three go-to criteria evaluating a targeted compound and effectively rescued mutant p53 in patient-derived cancer cells at the clinical dose and thus has practical repurposing potential.

                Decano et al. characterize valvular interstitial cells (VICs) that are CD44highCD29+CD59+CD73+CD45low within human calcific valve disease (CAVD) as a disease-driver population (DDP) capable of osteogenic and procalcific differentiation. Phenotype-guided single-cell, multi-omic analysis identifies potential CAVD key regulators, such as MAOA and CTHRC1, validated through in vitro loss of function and histology.

                While health effects of conventional tobacco are well defined, data on vaping devices, including one of the most popular e-cigarettes which have high nicotine levels, are less established. Prior acute e-cigarette studies have demonstrated inflammatory and cardiopulmonary physiology changes while chronic studies have demonstrated extra-pulmonary effects, including neurotransmitter alterations in reward pathways. In this study we investigated the impact of inhalation of aerosols produced from pod-based, flavored e-cigarettes (JUUL) aerosols three times daily for 3 months on inflammatory markers in the brain, lung, heart, and colon. JUUL aerosol exposure induced upregulation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression and increased HMGB1 and RAGE in the nucleus accumbens in the central nervous system. Inflammatory gene expression increased in the colon, while gene expression was more broadly altered by e-cigarette aerosol inhalation in the lung. Cardiopulmonary inflammatory responses to acute lung injury with lipopolysaccharide were exacerbated in the heart. Flavor-specific findings were detected across these studies. Our findings suggest that daily e-cigarette use may cause neuroinflammation, which may contribute to behavioral changes and mood disorders. In addition, e-cigarette use may cause gut inflammation, which has been tied to poor systemic health, and cardiac inflammation, which leads to cardiovascular disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Condensation of Ede1 promotes the initiation of endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is initiated by a network of weakly interacting proteins through a poorly understood mechanism. Ede1, the yeast homologue of mammalian Eps15, is an early-arriving endocytic protein and a key initiation factor. In the absence of Ede1, most other early endocytic proteins lose their punctate localization and endocytic uptake is decreased. We show that in yeast cells, cytosolic concentration of Ede1 is buffered at a critical level. Excess amounts of Ede1 form large condensates which recruit other endocytic proteins and exhibit properties of phase-separated liquid droplets. We demonstrate that the central region of Ede1, containing a coiled-coil and a prion-like region, is essential for both the condensate formation and the function of Ede1 in endocytosis. The functionality of Ede1 mutants lacking the central region can be partially rescued by an insertion of heterologous prion-like domains. Conversely, fusion of a heterologous lipid-binding domain with the central region of Ede1 can promote clustering into stable plasma membrane domains. We propose that the ability of Ede1 to form condensed networks supports the clustering of early endocytic proteins and promotes the initiation of endocytosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A conditional gene-based association framework integrating isoform-level eQTL data reveals new susceptibility genes for schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Linkage disequilibrium and disease-associated variants in the non-coding regions make it difficult to distinguish the truly associated genes from the redundantly associated genes for complex diseases. In this study, we proposed a new conditional gene-based framework called eDESE that leveraged an improved effective chi-squared statistic to control the type I error rates and remove the redundant associations. eDESE initially performed the association analysis by mapping variants to genes according to their physical distance. We further demonstrated that the isoform-level eQTLs could be more powerful than the gene-level eQTLs in the association analysis using a simulation study. Then the eQTL-guided strategies, that is, mapping variants to genes according to their gene/isoform-level variant-gene <i>cis</i>-eQTLs associations, were also integrated with eDESE. We then applied eDESE to predict the potential susceptibility genes of schizophrenia and found that the potential susceptibility genes were enriched with many neuronal or synaptic signaling-related terms in the Gene Ontology knowledgebase and antipsychotics-gene interaction terms in the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb). More importantly, seven potential susceptibility genes identified by eDESE were the target genes of multiple antipsychotics in DrugBank. Comparing the potential susceptibility genes identified by eDESE and other benchmark approaches (i.e., MAGMA and S-PrediXcan) implied that strategy based on the isoform-level eQTLs could be an important supplement for the other two strategies (physical distance and gene-level eQTLs). We have implemented eDESE in our integrative platform KGGSEE (<a href="http://pmglab.top/kggsee/">http://pmglab.top/kggsee/</a>#/) and hope that eDESE can facilitate the prediction of candidate susceptibility genes and isoforms for complex diseases in a multi-tissue context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling tactile pleasantness across skin types at the individual level reveals a reliable and stable basic function</a></h4>

              
                Touch is perceived most pleasant when delivered at velocities known to optimally activate C Tactile afferents. At the group level, pleasantness ratings of touch delivered at velocities in the range 0.3-30 cm/s follows an inverted-U shape curve, with maximum pleasantness between 1 and 10 cm/s. However, the prevalence, reliability, and stability of this function at the individual level and across skin types remains unknown. Here, we tested a range of seven velocities delivered with a soft brush, on both hairy and non-hairy skin in 123 participants. We showed that the relationship between pleasantness and velocity of touch is significantly best described by a negative quadratic model at the individual level in the majority of participants both on hairy (67.1%) and non-hairy skin (62.6%). Higher interoceptive accuracy and self-reported depression were related to a better fit of the quadratic model and to the steepness of the curve, respectively. The prevalence of the quadratic model was stable across body sites (62.6%), across two experimental sessions (73-78%,), and regardless of the number of trials. Thus, the individual perception of tactile pleasantness follows a characteristic velocity-dependent function across skin types and shows trait characteristics, making it a possible biomarker for mental health disorders.

                The double-floxed inverted orientation (DIO) system with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector provides a beneficial approach to express transgenes in specific cell populations having Cre recombinase. A significant issue with this system is the protection against non-specific expression of transgenes in tissues after vector injection. We here show that Cre-independent recombination in AAV genome carrying the DIO sequence occurs during the production of viral vectors in packaging cells, which results in transgene expression in off-target populations. Introduction of a relatively longer nucleotide sequence between two recognition sites at the unilateral side of the transgene cassette, termed a unilateral spacer sequence (USS), is useful to suppress recombination during the vector production, leading to the protection of non-specific transgene expression with enhanced gene expression selectivity. Our DIO/USS system offers a powerful strategy for highly specific Cre-dependent transgene expression, aiming at various applications for structural and functional analyses of target cell populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A deep learning-based automated closed-loop optogenetic system for neuromodulation during seizures</a></h4>

              
                Closed-loop electrical brain stimulation is becoming a popular technique proposed for use as a treatment alternative to surgical resection of brain tissue for drug-resistant seizures in epilepsy patients. Closed-loop optogenetic stimulation is an experimental alternative to electrical stimulation since it can stimulate or inhibit neurons. The closed-loop part contains an online seizure detection algorithm, which, based on the design, can detect the onset of a seizure or evaluate a running window for seizure membership. Conventional configurations of closed-loop optogenetics have several limitations, ranging from the adaptability of hardware-based implementation to inadequate, customized feature selection of seizures, among others. Here we provide a detailed description of our closed-loop components. We used a sequential, fully convolutional neural network regressor for complex feature selection of seizures against the controls from local field potential recordings. Our modular design kept the local field potential-recording headset and optical probe separate. The seizure detection and execution of light delivery are fast and can be precisely timed. This automated system is robust to noise, modular in design, flexible in use, and simple execution. When applied in vivo, the proposed work shows efficacy over the state of the arts in terms of improved seizure detection and reduction in false positives.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Causal contributions of the domain-general (Multiple Demand) and the language-selective brain networks to perceptual and semantic challenges in speech comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Listening to spoken language engages domain-general Multiple Demand (MD, fronto-parietal) regions of the human brain, in addition to domain-selective (fronto-temporal) language regions, particularly when comprehension is challenging. However, there is limited evidence that the MD network makes a functional contribution to core aspects of comprehension. In a behavioural study of volunteers (n=19) with chronic brain lesions, but without aphasia, we assessed the causal role of these networks in perceiving, comprehending and adapting to challenging spoken sentences. A first task measured word report for acoustically degraded (noise-vocoded) sentences before and after training. Participants with greater damage to MD but not language regions required more vocoder channels to achieve 50% word report indicating impaired perception. Perception improved following training, reflecting adaptation to acoustic degradation, but perceptual learning was unrelated to lesion location or extent. A second task used sentence coherence judgements to measure the speed and accuracy of comprehension of spoken sentences using lower-frequency meanings of semantically ambiguous words. Comprehension accuracy was high and unaffected by lesion location or extent. The availability of the lower-frequency meaning, as measured in a subsequent word association task, increased following comprehension (word-meaning priming). Word-meaning priming was reduced for participants with greater damage to language but not MD regions. We conclude that language and MD networks make dissociable contributions to challenging speech comprehension: using recent experience to update word meaning preferences depends on language specialised regions, whereas the domain-general MD network plays a causal role in reporting words from degraded speech.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Causal Role of Human Laryngeal Motor Cortex in Speech Lexical Tone and Voicing Perception</a></h4>

              
                To achieve categorical speech perception, listeners can actively reconstruct motor gestures of the upcoming speech. This is supported by sensorimotor integration function of the dorsal pathway where the "internal models" of articulations implement top-down constraints on auditory speech analyses in the ventral pathway. Moreover, the motor engagement in speech perception is effector-specific, resembling the motor somatotopy during speech production. However, whether and how the laryngeal motor cortex (LMC), which controls the laryngeal muscles that regulate pitch contours and speech voicing, is also involved in speech perception remains largely unknown. To address this question, this study applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) upon the left or right LMC when participants performed categorical perception tasks on Mandarin lexical tone (pitch contour contrast) or consonant (voice onset time contrast) presented with or without noise. Results showed that, inhibitory stimulation (repetitive TMS or continuous theta-burst stimulation) on the LMC impaired both tone and consonant perception. Furthermore, TMS effects were especially evident when syllables were masked by noise. These results reveal a causal role of the LMC in speech perception that (1) it mirrors its distinctive functions in controlling pitch and voicing during production and (2) it is upregulated and shifts from a left-lateralized to a bilateral engagement in adverse listening conditions as a means of compensation. This study thus provides new evidence to support the motor theory of speech perception, and more generally, active perception and embodied cognition.

                Theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus have been hypothesized to play a role in the encoding and retrieval of memories. Recently, it was shown that an intrinsic fast gamma mechanism in medial entorhinal cortex can be recruited by optogenetic stimulation at theta frequencies, which can persist with fast excitatory synaptic transmission blocked, suggesting a contribution of interneuronal network gamma (ING). We calibrated the passive and active properties of a 100-neuron model network to capture the range of passive properties and frequency/current relationships of experimentally recorded PV+ neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). The strength and probabilities of chemical and electrical synapses were also calibrated using paired recordings, as were the kinetics and short-term depression (STD) of the chemical synapses. Gap junctions that contribute a noticeable fraction of the input resistance were required for synchrony with hyperpolarizing inhibition; these networks exhibited theta-nested high frequencies (~200 Hz) similar to the putative ING observed experimentally in the optogenetically-driven PV-ChR2 mice. With STD included in the model, fast oscillations were only observed before the peak of the theta drive, whereas without STD, they were observed symmetrically before and after the peak. Because hyperpolarizing synapses provide a synchronizing drive that contributes to robustness in the presence of heterogeneity, synchronization decreases as the hyperpolarizing inhibition becomes weaker. In contrast, networks with shunting inhibition required non-physiological levels of gap junctions to synchronize using conduction delays within the measured range; synaptic depression of shunting synapses facilitated fast oscillations, suggesting that shunting inhibition in mEC is desynchronizing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Typical hippocampal transcriptional response across estrous is dysregulated by Cnih3 gene deletion</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a critical brain region for coordinating learning, memory, and behavior. In females, the estrous cycle alters these functions through steroid hormone activity, with well-characterized effects on cellular physiology and behavior. However, the molecular basis of these outcomes has not been systematically explored. Therefore, we profiled the transcriptome of dorsal hippocampi from female mice in each estrous cycle stage, and contrasted it with that of males. We identify only subtle sex differences in gene expression between the sexes on average, yet comparing males to individual estrous stages reveals up to thousands of genes deviating from male expression patterns at specific estrous stages. These estrous-responsive genes are especially enriched in gene markers of oligodendrocytes and the dentate gyrus, and in functional gene sets relating to estrogen response, potassium channels, and synaptic gene splicing. Next we profiled Cnih3 knockouts across estrous to provide insight into their previously reported estrous-dependent phenotypes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, composition, and learning and memory behaviors. Surprisingly, Cnih3 knockouts showed far broader transcriptomic differences between estrous cycle stages and males. Moreover, Cnih3 knockout drove subtle but extensive expression changes accenting sex differential expresssion at diestrus and estrus. Altogether, our profiling constitutes both a resource characterizing estrous-specific gene expression patterns in the adult hippocampus, which can provide insights into mechanisms of sex differential neuropsychiatric functions and dysfunctions, while also highlighting roles of Cnih3 as a buffer against transcriptional effects of estrous and providing insights into the molecular mechanisms that may underlie estrous-dependent phenotypes with its loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Olfactory receptor neurons generate multiple response motifs, increasing coding space dimensionality</a></h4>

              
                Odorants binding to olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) trigger bursts of action potentials, providing the brain with its only experience of the olfactory environment. Our recordings made in vivo from locust ORNs showed odor-elicited firing patterns comprise four distinct response motifs, each defined by a reliable temporal profile. Different odorants could elicit different response motifs from a given ORN, a property we term motif switching. Further, each motif undergoes its own form of sensory adaptation when activated by repeated plume-like odor pulses. A computational model constrained by our recordings revealed that organizing responses into multiple motifs provides substantial benefits for classifying odors and processing complex odor plumes: each motif contributes uniquely to encode the plumes composition and structure. Multiple motifs and motif switching further improve odor classification by expanding coding dimensionality. Our model demonstrated these response features could provide benefits for olfactory navigation, including determining the distance to an odor source.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological normative responses to emotional, neutral, and cigarette-related images.</a></h4>

              
                To create reproducible emotional probes, affective scientists rely on sets of standardized pictures that are normed using subjective ratings of valence and emotional arousal. Yet, to investigate psychophysiological emotional responses, it might be more appropriate to select pictures using normative neurophysiological responses rather than normative subjective ratings. Here, we provide electrophysiological normative responses for 323 emotional pictures (215 from the IAPS) covering a wide range of categories (erotica, romantic, appetizing foods, landscapes, people engaged in mundane activities, household objects, disgusting objects, accidents, sad people, violence, mutilations, and cigarette-related contents). Event-related potentials (ERPs) and subjective ratings of pleasure and emotional arousal were collected from 763 individuals (52% females, 41% white) aged between 18 and 65 (mean = 43). For each image, the mean amplitude of the late positive potential (LPP, an electrophysiological index of motivational relevance) and the mean subjective ratings of valence and arousal were calculated. We validated our procedure by showing that the subjective ratings of valence and arousal from this sample were highly correlated to the IAPS' published norms (Pearson r=.97 for pleasure and r=.82 for emotional arousal). LPP responses and subjective ratings of emotional arousal also were correlated (Pearson r = .61), but some categories that participants reported being significantly more arousing than neutral (i.e., food, landscapes, and unpleasant objects) did not evoke LPPs significantly different from those evoked by neutral pictures. Researchers interested in probing the brain's affective systems can use these electrophysiological normative responses to create emotional probes that evoke reliable neuroaffective responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-specific differences in rotarod performance and type 1 cannabinoid receptor levels in a rat model of traumatic brain injury treated with {triangleup}9-tetrahydrocannabinol</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) remain one of the leading causes of death and disability world-wide. One emerging area of TBI research is the involvement of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in response to TBI. Endogenous cannabinoids modulate inflammation, pain, anxiety, and neurotransmitter release through the activation of the cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R. CB1R and CB2R are activated by exogenous cannabinoids such as {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) found in Cannabis sativa. As public perceptions change in the wake of Cannabis legalization, research into the potential harmful and therapeutic effects of THC following TBI deserve exploration. In this preliminary study, we investigated sex differences in behavioral effects, CB1R abundance, and cytokine profiles in a rat model of moderate TBI treated with 1 mg/kg THC (i.p.). Neither TBI nor THC treatment altered catalepsy, body temperature, nociception, or spontaneous alternation as measured in the y-maze. TBI reduced male rotarod performance in both vehicle and THC-treated groups, and THC treatment decreased performance in Sham-TBI rats when compared to vehicle controls. Female rats that received a TBI and THC exhibited lower relative CB1R density when compared to the Sham-TBI+THC group. TBI was associated with reduced interleukin-4 in males; THC increased interleukin-6 in TBI males compared to Sham-TBI. These preliminary results highlight fundamental sex differences in the response of the ECS following TBI. Our results indicate the need for further investigation of the ECS and phytocannabinoids post-TBI in both acute and chronic phases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for shared resources in visuospatial attention: Endogenous attention misleads the decoding of exogenous attention in alpha rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Prevailing accounts of visuospatial attention differentiate exogenous orienting, which corresponds to involuntary shifts of attention, from endogenous orienting, which reflects the voluntary control of attention. While these different forms of attention are functionally separable, evidence shows that they can nevertheless interact with each other. These dynamics have been at the center of ongoing debates for more than two decades. One hypothesis regarding these interactions is that, while both forms of attention orienting map onto independent functional systems, they are capable of mutual interference. This viewpoint implies that exogenous attention, a ballistic and stimulus-driven process, is not impervious to the influence of endogenous attention. Evidence in support of this view remains sparse and the central factors that underlie these interactions remain largely unknown. The present study tackles these questions by examining whether endogenous attention influences the neural processes of exogenous attention by applying multivariate pattern classification to electroencephalography (EEG). We contrasted the cue-related and target-related effects of exogenous attention across two experimental conditions: Single cueing where exogenous attention is engaged alone, and double cueing where exogenous attention is concurrently engaged with endogenous attention. Our results show that the simultaneous engagement of endogenous attention alters the emergence of exogenous attention across cue-related and target-related processes. Therefore, exogenous attention is not impervious to the influence of endogenous attention. Importantly, we observed that classifiers trained to decode exogenous attention from alpha band activity during single cueing condition were misled by the direction of endogenous attention when tested in the context of double cueing. Our research therefore provides evidence of overlap between exogenous and endogenous attention and emphasizes that limited neural resources play a central role in the dynamics between both forms of attention orienting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Temporal Dynamics of Willed Attention in Vision</a></h4>

              
                Most models of attention distinguish between voluntary and involuntary attention, the latter being driven in a bottom-up fashion by salient sensory signals. Studies of voluntary visual-spatial attention have used informational or instructional cues, such as arrows, to induce or instruct observers to direct selective attention to relevant locations in visual space in order to detect or discriminate subsequent target stimuli. In everyday vision, however, voluntary attention is influenced by a host of factors, most of which are quite different from the laboratory paradigms that utilize attention-directing cues. These factors include priming, experience, reward, meaning, motivations, and high-level behavioral goals. Attention that is endogenously directed in the absence of external cues has been referred to as self-initiated attention, or in our prior work as "willed attention". Such studies typically replace attention-directing cues with a "prompt" that signals the subject when to choose where they will attend in preparation for the upcoming target stimulus. We used a novel paradigm that was designed to minimize external influences (i.e., cues or prompts) as to where, as well as when, spatial attention would be shifted and focused. Participants were asked to view bilateral dynamic dot motion displays, and to shift their covert spatial attention to either the left or right visual field patch at a time of their own choosing, thus allowing the participants to control both when and where they attended on each trial. The task was to discriminate and respond to a pattern in the attended dot motion patch. Our goal was to identify patterns of neural activity in the scalp-recorded EEG that revealed when and where attention was focused. Using machine learning methods to decode attention-related EEG alpha band activity, we were able to identify the onset of voluntary (willed) shifts of visual-spatial attention, and to determine where attention was focused. This work contributes to our understanding of the neural antecedents of voluntary attention, opening the door for improved models of attentional control, and providing steps toward development of brain-computer interfaces using non-invasive electrical recordings of brain activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypervoxels: A Multidimensional Framework For The Representation And Analysis Of Neuroimaging Data</a></h4>

              
                Most neuroimaging modalities use regular grids of voxels to represent the three-dimensional space occupied by the brain. However, the topological uniformity of the 3D voxel grid does not realistically reflect relevant properties of the brain's anatomy such as its heterogeneity and the complexity of its structural connectivity. In contrast, tractography reconstructions based on diffusion MRI can provide compelling characterisation of the brain's structural connectivity that reflects the local and global organisation of the neuronal fibres. In this work we introduce hypervoxels as a new analysis framework that combine the anatomical and connectivity information provided by tractography streamlines with the spatial encoding capabilities of multidimensional voxels. We provide a detailed description and implementation of the framework and demonstrate its benefits by carrying out comparative voxel and hypervoxel analyses on neuroimaging data acquired to investigate the neuroanatomical substrate of motor neurone disease (MND). The hypervoxel analyses outperformed the corresponding voxel analyses in their ability to detect effects of interest in brain regions known to be affected in MND, as demonstrated by the widespread number of significant results, their statistical significance and their anatomical specificity. We conclude that the anatomical and topological information provided by the hypervoxel framework can greatly improve the sensitivity and anatomical specificity of neuroimaging analyses through its application to any method or imaging modality based on traditional voxels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two-photon microscopy in vivo reveals brain vessel type-specific loss of glycocalyx caused by apoM/S1P signaling impairment.</a></h4>

              
                Increases in adsorptive mediated transcytosis (AMT) at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are linked to many brain disorders. In a healthy brain, AMT is suppressed by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling. Low levels of S1P lead to a rise in AMT, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we explored whether the rises in AMT are caused by the loss of the endothelial glycocalyx (gcx). We used two-photon microscopy in mice with low S1P plasma levels (Apom-/-) and developed a novel photobleaching approach to measure gcx in vivo at distinct classes of cerebral microvessels, i.e., arterioles, capillaries, and venules. We show that S1P signaling impairment reduced gcx in arterioles but not in other vessel segments. The location of gcx loss corresponded to the vascular topology of AMT increases. The S1PR1 agonist SEW2871 restores low levels of AMT in Apom-/- mice but did not restore the gcx within the same time window. We propose that while the gcx loss may contribute to AMT increase, restoring gcx is not necessary for AMT to return to normal. These data establish a new imaging method to study gcx in the living mouse brain, demonstrate zonation of gcx in cerebral microvessels, and suggest differences in vascular susceptibility to gcx loss in disease states.

	<p>The rehabilitation of cognitive deficits in individuals with traumatic brain injury is essential for promoting patients&amp;amp;rsquo; recovery and autonomy. Virtual reality (VR) training is a powerful tool for reaching this target, although the effectiveness of this intervention could be interfered with by several factors. In this study, we evaluated if demographical and clinical variables could be related to the recovery of cognitive function in TBI patients after a well-validated VR training. One hundred patients with TBI were enrolled in this study and equally randomized into the Traditional Cognitive Rehabilitation Group (TCRG: n = 50) or Virtual Reality Training Group (VRTG: n = 50). The VRTG underwent a VRT with BTs-N, whereas the TCRG received standard cognitive treatment. All the patients were evaluated by a complete neuropsychological battery before (T0) and after the end of the training (T1). We found that the VR-related improvement in mood, as well as cognitive flexibility, and selective attention were influenced by gender. Indeed, females who underwent VR training were those showing better cognitive recovery. This study highlights the importance of evaluating gender effects in planning cognitive rehabilitation programs. The inclusion of different repetitions and modalities of VR training should be considered for TBI male patients.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) has strong effects on neurogenesis and axon pathfinding in the prenatal brain. Endocannabinoids that activate CB1R are abundant in the early postnatal brain and in mother&rsquo;s milk, but few studies have investigated their function in newborns. We examined postnatal CB1R expression in the major striatonigral circuit from striosomes of the striatum to the dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra. CB1R enrichment was first detectable between postnatal day (P)5 and P7, and this timing coincided with the formation of "striosome-dendron bouquets," the elaborate anatomic structures by which striosomal neurons control dopaminergic cell activity through inhibitory synapses. In <I>Cnr1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> knock-out mice lacking CB1R expression, striosome-dendron bouquets were markedly disorganized by P11 and at adulthood, suggesting a postnatal pathfinding connectivity function for CB1R in connecting striosomal axons and dopaminergic neurons analogous to CB1R&rsquo;s prenatal function in other brain regions. Our finding that CB1R plays a major role in postnatal wiring of the striatonigral dopamine-control system, with lasting consequences at least in mice, points to a crucial need to determine whether lactating mothers&rsquo; use of CB1R agonists (e.g., in marijuana) or antagonists (e.g., type 2 diabetes therapies) can disrupt brain development in nursing offspring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Investigation of Neural Substrates of Erroneous Behavior in a Delayed-Response Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Motor cortical neurons exhibit persistent selective activities (selectivity) during motor planning. Experimental perturbation of selectivity results in the failure of short-term memory retention and consequent behavioral biases, demonstrating selectivity as a neural characteristic of encoding previous sensory input or future action. However, even without experimental manipulation, animals occasionally fail to maintain short-term memory leading to erroneous choice. Here, we investigated neural substrates that lead to the incorrect formation of selectivity during short-term memory. We analyzed neuronal activities in anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) of mice, a region known to be engaged in motor planning while mice performed the tactile delayed-response task. We found that highly selective neurons lost their selectivity while originally nonselective neurons showed selectivity during the error trials where mice licked toward incorrect direction. We assumed that those alternations would reflect changes in intrinsic properties of population activity. Thus, we estimated an intrinsic manifold shared by neuronal population (shared space), using factor analysis (FA) and measured the association of individual neurons with the shared space by communality, the variance of neuronal activity accounted for by the shared space. We found a positive correlation between selectivity and communality over ALM neurons, which disappeared in erroneous behavior. Notably, neurons showing selectivity alternations between correct and incorrect licking also underwent proportional changes in communality. Our results demonstrated that the extent to which an ALM neuron is associated with the intrinsic manifolds of population activity may elucidate its selectivity and that disruption of this association may alter selectivity, likely leading to erroneous behavior.</p>

Understanding of the pairing statistics in solutions populated by a large number of distinct solute species with mutual interactions is a challenging topic, relevant in modeling the complexity of real biological systems. Here we describe, both experimentally and theoretically, the formation of duplexes in a solution of random-sequence DNA (rsDNA) oligomers of length <i>L</i> = 8, 12, 20 nucleotides. rsDNA solutions are formed by 4<sup>L</sup> distinct molecular species, leading to a variety of pairing motifs that depend on sequence complementarity and range from strongly bound, fully paired defectless helices to weakly interacting mismatched duplexes. Experiments and theory coherently combine revealing a hybridization statistics characterized by a prevalence of partially defected duplexes, with a distribution of type and number of pairing errors that depends on temperature. We find that despite the enormous multitude of inter-strand interactions, defectless duplexes are formed, involving a fraction up to 15% of the rsDNA chains at the lowest temperatures. Experiments and theory are limited here to equilibrium conditions.

Scientific research is shedding light on the interaction of the gut microbiome with the human host and on its role in human health. Existing machine learning methods have shown great potential in discriminating healthy from diseased microbiome states. Most of them leverage shotgun metagenomic sequencing to extract gut microbial species-relative abundances or strain-level markers. Each of these gut microbial profiling modalities showed diagnostic potential when tested separately; however, no existing approach combines them in a single predictive framework. Here, we propose the Multimodal Variational Information Bottleneck (MVIB), a novel deep learning model capable of learning a joint representation of multiple heterogeneous data modalities. MVIB achieves competitive classification performance while being faster than existing methods. Additionally, MVIB offers interpretable results. Our model adopts an information theoretic interpretation of deep neural networks and computes a joint stochastic encoding of different input data modalities. We use MVIB to predict whether human hosts are affected by a certain disease by jointly analysing gut microbial species-relative abundances and strain-level markers. MVIB is evaluated on human gut metagenomic samples from 11 publicly available disease cohorts covering 6 different diseases. We achieve high performance (0.80 < ROC AUC < 0.95) on 5 cohorts and at least medium performance on the remaining ones. We adopt a saliency technique to interpret the output of MVIB and identify the most relevant microbial species and strain-level markers to the model’s predictions. We also perform cross-study generalisation experiments, where we train and test MVIB on different cohorts of the same disease, and overall we achieve comparable results to the baseline approach, i.e. the Random Forest. Further, we evaluate our model by adding metabolomic data derived from mass spectrometry as a third input modality. Our method is scalable with respect to input data modalities and has an average training time of < 1.4 seconds. The source code and the datasets used in this work are publicly available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RNA folding using quantum computers</a></h4>

The 3-dimensional fold of an RNA molecule is largely determined by patterns of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between bases. Predicting the base pairing network from the sequence, also referred to as RNA secondary structure prediction or RNA folding, is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-complete computational problem. The structure of the molecule is strongly predictive of its functions and biochemical properties, and therefore the ability to accurately predict the structure is a crucial tool for biochemists. Many methods have been proposed to efficiently sample possible secondary structure patterns. Classic approaches employ dynamic programming, and recent studies have explored approaches inspired by evolutionary and machine learning algorithms. This work demonstrates leveraging quantum computing hardware to predict the secondary structure of RNA. A Hamiltonian written in the form of a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) is derived to drive the system toward maximizing the number of consecutive base pairs while jointly maximizing the average length of the stems. A Quantum Annealer (QA) is compared to a Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm programmed with the same objective function, with the QA being shown to be highly competitive at rapidly identifying low energy solutions. The method proposed in this study was compared to three algorithms from literature and, despite its simplicity, was found to be competitive on a test set containing known structures with pseudoknots.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 reveals plasma membrane cholesterol depletion as key factor of antiviral drug activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Szilvia Barsi, Henrietta Papp, Alberto Valdeolivas, Dániel J. Tóth, Anett Kuczmog, Mónika Madai, László Hunyady, Péter Várnai, Julio Saez-Rodriguez, Ferenc Jakab, Bence Szalai</p>

Comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced gene expression signatures to drug treatment-induced gene expression signatures is a promising bioinformatic tool to repurpose existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The general hypothesis of signature-based drug repurposing is that drugs with inverse similarity to a disease signature can reverse disease phenotype and thus be effective against it. However, in the case of viral infection diseases, like SARS-CoV-2, infected cells also activate adaptive, antiviral pathways, so that the relationship between effective drug and disease signature can be more ambiguous. To address this question, we analysed gene expression data from <i>in vitro</i> SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines, and gene expression signatures of drugs showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our extensive functional genomic analysis showed that both infection and treatment with <i>in vitro</i> effective drugs leads to activation of antiviral pathways like NFkB and JAK-STAT. Based on the similarity—and not inverse similarity—between drug and infection-induced gene expression signatures, we were able to predict the <i>in vitro</i> antiviral activity of drugs. We also identified SREBF1/2, key regulators of lipid metabolising enzymes, as the most activated transcription factors by several <i>in vitro</i> effective antiviral drugs. Using a fluorescently labeled cholesterol sensor, we showed that these drugs decrease the cholesterol levels of plasma-membrane. Supplementing drug-treated cells with cholesterol reversed the <i>in vitro</i> antiviral effect, suggesting the depleting plasma-membrane cholesterol plays a key role in virus inhibitory mechanism. Our results can help to more effectively repurpose approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and also highlights key mechanisms behind their antiviral effect.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Are transient protein-protein interactions more dispensable?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohamed Ali Ghadie, Yu Xia</p>

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are key drivers of cell function and evolution. While it is widely assumed that most permanent PPIs are important for cellular function, it remains unclear whether transient PPIs are equally important. Here, we estimate and compare dispensable content among transient PPIs and permanent PPIs in human. Starting with a human reference interactome mapped by experiments, we construct a human structural interactome by building three-dimensional structural models for PPIs, and then distinguish transient PPIs from permanent PPIs using several structural and biophysical properties. We map common mutations from healthy individuals and disease-causing mutations onto the structural interactome, and perform structure-based calculations of the probabilities for common mutations (assumed to be neutral) and disease mutations (assumed to be mildly deleterious) to disrupt transient PPIs and permanent PPIs. Using Bayes’ theorem we estimate that a similarly small fraction (<~20%) of both transient and permanent PPIs are completely dispensable, i.e., effectively neutral upon disruption. Hence, transient and permanent interactions are subject to similarly strong selective constraints in the human interactome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fundamental limits on inferring epidemic resurgence in real time using effective reproduction numbers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kris V. Parag, Christl A. Donnelly</p>

We find that epidemic resurgence, defined as an upswing in the effective reproduction number (<i>R</i>) of the contagion from subcritical to supercritical values, is fundamentally difficult to detect in real time. Inherent latencies in pathogen transmission, coupled with smaller and intrinsically noisier case incidence across periods of subcritical spread, mean that resurgence cannot be reliably detected without significant delays of the order of the generation time of the disease, even when case reporting is perfect. In contrast, epidemic suppression (where <i>R</i> falls from supercritical to subcritical values) may be ascertained 5–10 times faster due to the naturally larger incidence at which control actions are generally applied. We prove that these innate limits on detecting resurgence only worsen when spatial or demographic heterogeneities are incorporated. Consequently, we argue that resurgence is more effectively handled proactively, potentially at the expense of false alarms. Timely responses to recrudescent infections or emerging variants of concern are more likely to be possible when policy is informed by a greater quality and diversity of surveillance data than by further optimisation of the statistical models used to process routine outbreak data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Validation-based model selection for 13C metabolic flux analysis with uncertain measurement errors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolas Sundqvist, Nina Grankvist, Jeramie Watrous, Jain Mohit, Roland Nilsson, Gunnar Cedersund</p>

Accurate measurements of metabolic fluxes in living cells are central to metabolism research and metabolic engineering. The gold standard method is model-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA), where fluxes are estimated indirectly from mass isotopomer data with the use of a mathematical model of the metabolic network. A critical step in MFA is model selection: choosing what compartments, metabolites, and reactions to include in the metabolic network model. Model selection is often done informally during the modelling process, based on the same data that is used for model fitting (estimation data). This can lead to either overly complex models (overfitting) or too simple ones (underfitting), in both cases resulting in poor flux estimates. Here, we propose a method for model selection based on independent validation data. We demonstrate in simulation studies that this method consistently chooses the correct model in a way that is independent on errors in measurement uncertainty. This independence is beneficial, since estimating the true magnitude of these errors can be difficult. In contrast, commonly used model selection methods based on the <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>-test choose different model structures depending on the believed measurement uncertainty; this can lead to errors in flux estimates, especially when the magnitude of the error is substantially off. We present a new approach for quantification of prediction uncertainty of mass isotopomer distributions in other labelling experiments, to check for problems with too much or too little novelty in the validation data. Finally, in an isotope tracing study on human mammary epithelial cells, the validation-based model selection method identified pyruvate carboxylase as a key model component. Our results argue that validation-based model selection should be an integral part of MFA model development.

The spread of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a worldwide problem with devastating consequences. Here, we implement a comprehensive contact tracing and network analysis to find an optimized quarantine protocol to dismantle the chain of transmission of coronavirus with minimal disruptions to society. We track billions of anonymized GPS human mobility datapoints to monitor the evolution of the contact network of disease transmission before and after mass quarantines. As a consequence of the lockdowns, people’s mobility decreases by 53%, which results in a drastic disintegration of the transmission network by 90%. However, this disintegration did not halt the spreading of the disease. Our analysis indicates that superspreading k-core structures persist in the transmission network to prolong the pandemic. Once the k-cores are identified, an optimized strategy to break the chain of transmission is to quarantine a minimal number of ‘weak links’ with high betweenness centrality connecting the large k-cores.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Construction of disease-specific cytokine profiles by associating disease genes with immune responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tianyun Liu, Shiyin Wang, Michael Wornow, Russ B. Altman</p>

The pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases is a coordinated process involving metabolic dysfunctions and immune response—usually modulated by the production of cytokines and associated inflammatory molecules. In this work, we seek to understand how genes involved in pathogenesis which are often not associated with the immune system in an obvious way communicate with the immune system. We have embedded a network of human protein-protein interactions (PPI) from the STRING database with 14,707 human genes using feature learning that captures high confidence edges. We have found that our predicted Association Scores derived from the features extracted from STRING’s high confidence edges are useful for predicting novel connections between genes, thus enabling the construction of a full map of predicted associations for all possible pairs between 14,707 human genes. In particular, we analyzed the pattern of associations for 126 cytokines and found that the six patterns of cytokine interaction with human genes are consistent with their functional classifications. To define the disease-specific roles of cytokines we have collected gene sets for 11,944 diseases from DisGeNET. We used these gene sets to predict disease-specific gene associations with cytokines by calculating the normalized average Association Scores between disease-associated gene sets and the 126 cytokines; this creates a unique profile of inflammatory genes (both known and predicted) for each disease. We validated our predicted cytokine associations by comparing them to known associations for 171 diseases. The predicted cytokine profiles correlate (p-value<0.0003) with the known ones in 95 diseases. We further characterized the profiles of each disease by calculating an “Inflammation Score” that summarizes different modes of immune responses. Finally, by analyzing subnetworks formed between disease-specific pathogenesis genes, hormones, receptors, and cytokines, we identified the key genes responsible for interactions between pathogenesis and inflammatory responses. These genes and the corresponding cytokines used by different immune disorders suggest unique targets for drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DGCyTOF: Deep learning with graphic cluster visualization to predict cell types of single cell mass cytometry data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lijun Cheng, Pratik Karkhanis, Birkan Gokbag, Yueze Liu, Lang Li</p>

Single-cell mass cytometry, also known as cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) is a powerful high-throughput technology that allows analysis of up to 50 protein markers per cell for the quantification and classification of single cells. Traditional manual gating utilized to identify new cell populations has been inadequate, inefficient, unreliable, and difficult to use, and no algorithms to identify both calibration and new cell populations has been well established. A deep learning with graphic cluster (DGCyTOF) visualization is developed as a new integrated embedding visualization approach in identifying canonical and new cell types. The DGCyTOF combines deep-learning classification and hierarchical stable-clustering methods to sequentially build a tri-layer construct for known cell types and the identification of new cell types. First, deep classification learning is constructed to distinguish calibration cell populations from all cells by <i>softmax</i> classification assignment under a probability threshold, and graph embedding clustering is then used to identify new cell populations sequentially. In the middle of two-layer, cell labels are automatically adjusted between new and unknown cell populations via a feedback loop using an iteration calibration system to reduce the rate of error in the identification of cell types, and a 3-dimensional (3D) visualization platform is finally developed to display the cell clusters with all cell-population types annotated. Utilizing two benchmark CyTOF databases comprising up to 43 million cells, we compared accuracy and speed in the identification of cell types among DGCyTOF, DeepCyTOF, and other technologies including dimension reduction with clustering, including Principal Component Analysis (<i>PCA</i>), Factor Analysis (<i>FA</i>), Independent Component Analysis (<i>ICA</i>), Isometric Feature Mapping (<i>Isomap</i>), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (<i>t-SNE</i>), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (<i>UMAP</i>) with <i>k</i>-means clustering and Gaussian mixture clustering. We observed the DGCyTOF represents a robust complete learning system with high accuracy, speed and visualization by eight measurement criteria. The DGCyTOF displayed <i>F-scores</i> of 0.9921 for CyTOF1 and 0.9992 for CyTOF2 datasets, whereas those scores were only 0.507 and 0.529 for the <i>t-SNE</i>+<i>k-means</i>; 0.565 and 0.59, for <i>UMAP</i>+ <i>k-means</i>. Comparison of DGCyTOF with <i>t-SNE</i> and <i>UMAP</i> visualization in accuracy demonstrated its approximately 35% superiority in predicting cell types. In addition, observation of cell-population distribution was more intuitive in the 3D visualization in DGCyTOF than <i>t-SNE</i> and <i>UMAP</i> visualization. The DGCyTOF model can automatically assign known labels to single cells with high accuracy using deep-learning classification assembling with traditional graph-clustering and dimension-reduction strategies. Guided by a calibration system, the model seeks optimal accuracy balance among calibration cell populations and unknown cell types, yielding a complete and robust learning system that is highly accurate in the identification of cell populations compared to results using other methods in the analysis of single-cell CyTOF data. Application of the DGCyTOF method to identify cell populations could be extended to the analysis of single-cell RNASeq data and other omics data.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Retinal receptive-field substructure: scaffolding for coding and computation</a></h4>

              
                The center-surround receptive field of retinal ganglion cells represents a fundamental concept for how the retina processes and encodes visual information. Yet, traditional approaches of using the receptive field as a linear filter to integrate light intensity over space often do not capture the responses of a ganglion cell to complex visual stimuli. Thus, models with local nonlinearities in subunits of the receptive field or with local temporal dynamics are emerging to better reflect relevant aspects of retinal circuitry and capture stimulus encoding.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Overcoming addiction stigma: Epigenetic contributions to substance use disorders and opportunities for intervention</a></h4>

              
                Substance use disorders (SUDs) are frequently stigmatized by society. However, overcoming stigmas to effectively treat SUDs requires acknowledging the developmental path of neural vulnerability. These vulnerabilities begin long before adulthood, providing opportunities to change the trajectory before the disorder becomes entrenched. This article raises attention to reversible epigenetic underpinnings of this vulnerability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Competition for fluctuating resources reproduces statistics of species abundance over time across wide-ranging microbiotas</a></h4>

              
                Across diverse microbiotas, species abundances vary in time with distinctive statistical behaviors that appear to generalize across hosts, but the origins and implications of these patterns remain unclear. Here, we show that many of these macroecological patterns can be quantitatively recapitulated by a simple class of consumer-resource models, in which the metabolic capabilities of different species are randomly drawn from a common statistical distribution. Our model parametrizes the consumer-resource properties of a community using only a small number of global parameters, including the total number of resources, typical resource fluctuations over time, and the average overlap in resource-consumption profiles across species. We show that variation in these macroscopic parameters strongly affects the time series statistics generated by the model, and we identify specific sets of global parameters that can recapitulate macroecological patterns across wide-ranging microbiotas, including the human gut, saliva, and vagina, as well as mouse gut and rice, without needing to specify microscopic details of resource consumption. These findings suggest that resource competition may be a dominant driver of community dynamics. Our work unifies numerous time series patterns under a simple model, and provides an accessible framework to infer macroscopic parameters of effective resource competition from longitudinal studies of microbial communities.

                Absence is a notion that is usually captured by language-related concepts like zero or negation. Whether nonlinguistic creatures encode similar thoughts is an open question, as everyday behavior marked by absence (of food, of social partners) can be explained solely by expecting presence somewhere else. We investigated 8-day-old chicks’ looking behavior in response to events violating expectations about the presence or absence of an object. We found different behavioral responses to violations of presence and absence, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Importantly, chicks displayed an avian signature of novelty detection to violations of absence, namely a sex-dependent left-eye-bias. Follow-up experiments excluded accounts that would explain this bias by perceptual mismatch or by representing the object at different locations. These results suggest that the ability to spontaneously form representations about the absence of objects likely belongs to the initial cognitive repertoire of vertebrate species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Humans actively sample evidence to support prior beliefs</a></h4>

              
                No one likes to be wrong. Previous research has shown that participants may underweight information incompatible with previous choices, a phenomenon called confirmation bias. In this paper we argue that a similar bias exists in the way information is actively sought. We investigate how choice influences information gathering using a perceptual choice task and find that participants sample more information from a previously chosen alternative. Furthermore, the higher the confidence in the initial choice, the more biased information sampling becomes. As a consequence, when faced with the possibility of revising an earlier decision, participants are more likely to stick with their original choice, even when incorrect. Critically, we show that agency controls this phenomenon. The effect disappears in a fixed sampling condition where presentation of evidence is controlled by the experimenter, suggesting that the way in which confirmatory evidence is acquired critically impacts the decision process. These results suggest active information acquisition plays a critical role in the propagation of strongly held beliefs over time.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of binding preferences among whole-genome duplicated transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                Throughout evolution, new transcription factors (TFs) emerge by gene duplication, promoting growth and rewiring of transcriptional networks. How TF duplicates diverge was studied in a few cases only. To provide a genome-scale view, we considered the set of budding yeast TFs classified as whole-genome duplication (WGD)-retained paralogs (~35% of all specific TFs). Using high-resolution profiling, we find that ~60% of paralogs evolved differential binding preferences. We show that this divergence results primarily from variations outside the DNA-binding domains (DBDs), while DBD preferences remain largely conserved. Analysis of non-WGD orthologs revealed uneven splitting of ancestral preferences between duplicates, and the preferential acquiring of new targets by the least conserved paralog (biased neo/sub-functionalization). Interactions between paralogs were rare, and, when present, occurred through weak competition for DNA-binding or dependency between dimer-forming paralogs. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolutionary design of transcriptional networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of convergent thickening, a major convergence force producing morphogenic movement in amphibians</a></h4>

              
                The morphogenic process of convergent thickening (CT) was originally described as the mediolateral convergence and radial thickening of the explanted ventral involuting marginal zone (IMZ) of <i>Xenopus</i> gastrulae (Keller and Danilchik 1988). Here we show that CT is expressed in <i>all</i> sectors of the <i>pre-involution</i> IMZ, which transitions to expressing convergent extension (CE) <i>after</i> involution. CT occurs without CE and drives symmetric blastopore closure in ventralized embryos. Assays of tissue affinity and tissue surface tension measurements suggest CT is driven by increased interfacial tension between the deep IMZ and the overlying epithelium. The resulting minimization of deep IMZ surface area drives a tendency to shorten the mediolateral (circumblastoporal) aspect of the IMZ, thereby generating tensile force contributing to blastopore closure (Shook et al. 2018). These results establish CT as an independent force-generating process of evolutionary significance and provide the first clear example of an oriented, tensile force generated by an isotropic, Holtfreterian/Steinbergian tissue affinity change.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contingency and selection in mitochondrial genome dynamics</a></h4>

              
                High frequencies of mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in human cells lead to cellular defects that are associated with aging and disease. Yet much remains to be understood about the dynamics of the generation of mutant mtDNAs and their relative replicative fitness that informs their fate within cells and tissues. To address this, we utilize long-read single-molecule sequencing to track mutational trajectories of mtDNA in the model organism <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. This model has numerous advantages over mammalian systems due to its much larger mtDNA and ease of artificially competing mutant and wild-type mtDNA copies in cells. We show a previously unseen pattern that constrains subsequent excision events in mtDNA fragmentation in yeast. We also provide evidence for the generation of rare and contentious non-periodic mtDNA structures that lead to persistent diversity within individual cells. Finally, we show that measurements of relative fitness of mtDNA fit a phenomenological model that highlights important biophysical parameters governing mtDNA fitness. Altogether, our study provides techniques and insights into the dynamics of large structural changes in genomes that we show are applicable to more complex organisms like humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis for the absence of low-energy chlorophylls in a photosystem I trimer from Gloeobacter violaceus</a></h4>

              
                Photosystem I (PSI) is a multi-subunit pigment-protein complex that functions in light-harvesting and photochemical charge-separation reactions, followed by reduction of NADP to NADPH required for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in photosynthetic organisms. PSI from different photosynthetic organisms has a variety of chlorophylls (Chls), some of which are at lower-energy levels than its reaction center P700, a special pair of Chls, and are called low-energy Chls. However, the sites of low-energy Chls are still under debate. Here, we solved a 2.04-Å resolution structure of a PSI trimer by cryo-electron microscopy from a primordial cyanobacterium <i>Gloeobacter violaceus</i> PCC 7421, which has no low-energy Chls. The structure shows the absence of some subunits commonly found in other cyanobacteria, confirming the primordial nature of this cyanobacterium. Comparison with the known structures of PSI from other cyanobacteria and eukaryotic organisms reveals that one dimeric and one trimeric Chls are lacking in the <i>Gloeobacter</i> PSI. The dimeric and trimeric Chls are named Low1 and Low2, respectively. Low2 is missing in some cyanobacterial and eukaryotic PSIs, whereas Low1 is absent only in <i>Gloeobacter</i>. These findings provide insights into not only the identity of low-energy Chls in PSI, but also the evolutionary changes of low-energy Chls in oxyphototrophs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A B cell actomyosin arc network couples integrin co-stimulation to mechanical force-dependent immune synapse formation</a></h4>

              
                B-cell activation and immune synapse (IS) formation with membrane-bound antigens are actin-dependent processes that scale positively with the strength of antigen-induced signals. Importantly, ligating the B-cell integrin, LFA-1, with ICAM-1 promotes IS formation when antigen is limiting. Whether the actin cytoskeleton plays a specific role in integrin-dependent IS formation is unknown. Here we show using super-resolution imaging of mouse primary B cells that LFA-1: ICAM-1 interactions promote the formation of an actomyosin network that dominates the B-cell IS. This network is created by the formin mDia1, organized into concentric, contractile arcs by myosin 2A, and flows inward at the same rate as B-cell receptor (BCR): antigen clusters. Consistently, individual BCR microclusters are swept inward by individual actomyosin arcs. Under conditions where integrin is required for synapse formation, inhibiting myosin impairs synapse formation, as evidenced by reduced antigen centralization, diminished BCR signaling, and defective signaling protein distribution at the synapse. Together, these results argue that a contractile actomyosin arc network plays a key role in the mechanism by which LFA-1 co-stimulation promotes B-cell activation and IS formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell-state transitions and collective cell movement generate an endoderm-like region in gastruloids</a></h4>

              
                Shaping the animal body plan is a complex process that involves the spatial organization and patterning of the different germ layers. Recent advances in live imaging have started to unravel the cellular choreography underlying this process in mammals, however, the sequence of events transforming an unpatterned cell ensemble into structured territories is largely unknown. Here, using gastruloids -3D aggregates of mouse embryonic stem cells- we study the formation of one of the three germ layers, the endoderm. We show that the endoderm is generated from an epiblast-like homogeneous state by a three-step mechanism: (i) a loss of E-cadherin mediated contacts in parts of the aggregate leading to the appearance of islands of E-cadherin expressing cells surrounded by cells devoid of E-cadherin, (ii) a separation of these two populations with islands of E-cadherin expressing cells flowing toward the aggregate tip, and (iii) their differentiation into an endoderm population. During the flow, the islands of E-cadherin expressing cells are surrounded by cells expressing T-Brachyury, reminiscent of the process occurring at the primitive streak. Consistent with recent in vivo observations, the endoderm formation in the gastruloids does not require an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, but rather a maintenance of an epithelial state for a subset of cells coupled with fragmentation of E-cadherin contacts in the vicinity, and a sorting process. Our data emphasize the role of signaling and tissue flows in the establishment of the body plan.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The peroxisomal exportomer directly inhibits phosphoactivation of the pexophagy receptor Atg36 to suppress pexophagy in yeast</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy receptor (or adaptor) proteins facilitate lysosomal destruction of various organelles in response to cellular stress, including nutrient deprivation. To what extent membrane-resident autophagy receptors also respond to organelle-restricted cues to induce selective autophagy remains poorly understood. We find that latent activation of the yeast pexophagy receptor Atg36 by the casein kinase Hrr25 in rich media is repressed by the ATPase activity of Pex1/6, the catalytic subunits of the exportomer AAA+ transmembrane complex enabling protein import into peroxisomes. Quantitative proteomics of purified Pex3, an obligate Atg36 coreceptor, support a model in which the exportomer tail anchored to the peroxisome membrane represses Atg36 phosphorylation on Pex3 without assistance from additional membrane factors. Indeed, we reconstitute inhibition of Atg36 phosphorylation <i>in vitro</i> using soluble Pex1/6 and define an N-terminal unstructured region of Atg36 that enables regulation by binding to Pex1. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which a compartment-specific AAA+ complex mediating organelle biogenesis and protein quality control staves off induction of selective autophagy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Automated, high-dimensional evaluation of physiological aging and resilience in outbred mice</a></h4>

              
                Behavior and physiology are essential readouts in many studies but have not benefited from the high-dimensional data revolution that has transformed molecular and cellular phenotyping. To address this, we developed an approach that combines commercially available automated phenotyping hardware with a systems biology analysis pipeline to generate a high-dimensional readout of mouse behavior/physiology, as well as intuitive and health-relevant summary statistics (resilience and biological age). We used this platform to longitudinally evaluate aging in hundreds of outbred mice across an age range from 3 months to 3.4 years. In contrast to the assumption that aging can only be measured at the limits of animal ability via challenge-based tasks, we observed widespread physiological and behavioral aging starting in early life. Using network connectivity analysis, we found that organism-level resilience exhibited an accelerating decline with age that was distinct from the trajectory of individual phenotypes. We developed a method, Combined Aging and Survival Prediction of Aging Rate (CASPAR), for jointly predicting chronological age and survival time and showed that the resulting model is able to predict both variables simultaneously, a behavior that is not captured by separate age and mortality prediction models. This study provides a uniquely high-resolution view of physiological aging in mice and demonstrates that systems-level analysis of physiology provides insights not captured by individual phenotypes. The approach described here allows aging, and other processes that affect behavior and physiology, to be studied with improved throughput, resolution, and phenotypic scope.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A population of gray matter oligodendrocytes directly associates with the vasculature</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocyte lineage cells interact with the vasculature in the gray matter. Physical and functional interactions between blood vessels and oligodendrocyte precursor cells play an essential role in both the developing and adult brain. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells have been shown to migrate along the vasculature and subsequently detach from it during their differentiation to oligodendrocytes. However, the association of mature oligodendrocytes with blood vessels has been noted since the discovery of this glial cell type almost a century ago and this interaction remains poorly explored. Here, we systematically investigated the extent of mature oligodendrocyte interaction with the vasculature in mouse. We found that ~17% of oligodendrocytes were in contact with blood vessels in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Contacts were made mainly with capillaries and sparsely with larger arterioles or venules. By combining light and serial electron microscopy, we demonstrated that oligodendrocytes are in direct contact with the vascular basement membrane, raising the possibility of direct signaling pathways and metabolite exchange with endothelial cells. During experimental remyelination in the adult, oligodendrocytes were regenerated and associated with blood vessels in the same proportion compared to control cortex, suggesting a homeostatic regulation of the vasculature-associated oligodendrocyte population. Based on the frequent and close association with blood vessels, we propose that vasculature-associated oligodendrocytes should be considered as an integral part of the vasculature microenvironment. This particular location could underlie specific functions of vasculature-associated oligodendrocytes, while contributing to the vulnerability of mature oligodendrocytes in neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Elp1 is required for development of visceral sensory peripheral and central circuitry</a></h4>

              
                Cardiovascular instability and a blunted respiratory drive in hypoxic conditions, are hallmark features of the genetic sensory and autonomic neuropathy, familial dysautonomia (FD). FD results from a mutation in the gene ELP1, whose encoded protein is a scaffolding subunit of the six subunit Elongator complex. In mice, we and others have shown that Elp1 is essential for the normal development of neural crest derived-dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Whether Elp1 is also required for development of ectodermal placode-derived visceral sensory receptors which are required for normal baroreception and chemosensory responses, has not been investigated. Using mouse models for FD, our data indicate that in fact the entire circuitry underlying baroreception and chemoreception is impaired due to a requirement for Elp1 not only in the visceral sensory neuron ganglia, but also for normal peripheral target innervation, and in their CNS synaptic partners in the medulla. Thus Elp1 is required in both placode- and neural crest-derived sensory neurons and its reduction aborts the normal development of neuronal circuitry essential for autonomic homeostasis and interoception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Every individual makes a difference: A trinity derived from linking individual brain morphometry, connectivity and mentalising ability</a></h4>

              
                Mentalising ability, indexed as the ability to understand others' beliefs, feelings, intentions, thoughts, and traits, is a pivotal and fundamental component of human social cognition. However, considering the multifaceted nature of mentalising ability, little research has focused on characterising individual differences in different mentalising components. And even less research has been devoted to investigating how the variance in the structural and functional patterns of the amygdala and hippocampus, two vital subcortical regions of the 'social brain', are related to inter-individual variability in mentalising ability. Here, as a first step toward filling these gaps, we exploited inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA) to assess relationships between amygdala and hippocampal morphometry (surface-based multivariate morphometry statistics, MMS), connectivity (resting-state functional connectivity, rs-FC) and mentalising ability (interactive mentalisation questionnaire (IMQ) scores) across the participants (N = 24). In IS-RSA, we proposed a novel pipeline, i.e., computing patching and pooling operations-based surface distance (CPP-SD), to obtain a decent representation for high-dimensional MMS data. On this basis, We found significant correlations (i.e., second-order isomorphisms) between these three distinct modalities, indicating that a trinity existed in idiosyncratic patterns of brain morphometry, connectivity and mentalising ability. Notably, a region-related mentalising specificity emerged from these associations: self-self and self-other mentalisation are more related to the hippocampus, while other-self mentalisation shows a closer link with the amygdala. Furthermore, by utilising the dyadic regression analysis, we observed significant interactions such that subject pairs with similar morphometry had even greater mentalising similarity if they were also similar in rs-FC. Altogether, we demonstrated the feasibility and illustrated the promise in using IS-RSA to study individual differences, deepening our understanding of how individual brains give rise to their mentalising abilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal activity regulates Matrin 3 levels and function in a calcium-dependent manner through calpain cleavage and calmodulin binding</a></h4>

              
                RNA-binding protein (RBP) dysfunction is a fundamental hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related neuromuscular disorders. Abnormal neuronal excitability is also a conserved feature in ALS patients and disease models, yet little is known about how activity-dependent processes regulate RBP levels and functions. Mutations in the gene encoding the RBP Matrin 3 (MATR3) cause familial disease, and MATR3 pathology has also been observed in sporadic ALS, suggesting a key role for MATR3 in disease pathogenesis. Here, we show that glutamatergic activity drives MATR3 degradation in a NMDAR-, Ca2+-, and calpain-dependent mechanism. The most common pathogenic MATR3 mutation renders it resistant to calpain degradation, suggesting a link between activity-dependent MATR3 regulation and disease. We also demonstrate that Ca2+ regulates MATR3 through a non-degradative process involving the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) to MATR3 and inhibition of its RNA-binding ability. These findings indicate that neuronal activity impacts both the abundance and function of MATR3, and provide a foundation for further study of Ca2+-coupled regulation of RBPs implicated in ALS and related neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural mass modelling for the masses: Democratising access to whole-brain biophysical modelling with FastDMF</a></h4>

              
                Different whole-brain models constrained by neuroimaging data have been developed during the last years to investigate causal hypotheses related to brain mechanisms. Among these, the Dynamic Mean Field (DMF) model is a particularly attractive model, combining a biophysically realistic single-neuron model that is scaled up via a mean-field approach and multimodal imaging data. Despite these favourable features, an important barrier for a widespread usage of the DMF model is that current implementations are computationally expensive - to the extent that the model often becomes unfeasible when no high-performance computing infrastructure is available. Furthermore, even when such computing structure is available, current implementations can only support simulations on brain parcellations that consider less than 100 brain regions. To remove these barriers, here we introduce a user-friendly and computationally-efficient implementation of the DMF model, which we call FastDMF, with the goal of making biophysical whole-brain modelling accessible to neuroscientists worldwide. By leveraging a suit of analytical and numerical advances -including a novel estimation of the feedback inhibition control parameter, and a Bayesian optimisation algorithm -the FastDMF circumvents various computational bottlenecks of previous implementations. An evaluation of the performance of the FastDMF showed that it can attain a significantly faster performance than previous implementations while reducing the memory consumption by several orders of magnitude. Thanks to these computational advances, FastDMF makes it possible to increase the number of simulated regions by one order of magnitude: we found good agreement between empirical and simulated functional MRI data parcellated at two different spatial scales (N=90 and N=1000 brain regions). These advances open the way to the widespread use of biophysically grounded whole-brain models for understanding the interplay among anatomy, function and brain dynamics in health and disease, and to provide mechanistic explanations of recent results obtained from empirical fine-grained neuroimaging data sets, such as turbulence or connectome harmonics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Neurodynamic Model of Inter-Brain Coupling in the Gamma Band</a></h4>

              
                The use of EEG to simultaneously record multiple brains (i.e., hyperscanning) during social interactions has led to the discovery of inter-brain coupling (IBC). IBC is defined as the neural synchronization between people and is considered to be a marker of social interaction. IBC has previously been observed across different frequency bands, including Theta [4-7 Hz]. Given the proximity of this frequency range with behavioral rhythms, models have been able to combine IBC in Theta with sensorimotor coordination patterns. Interestingly, empirical EEG-hyperscanning results also report the emergence of IBC in the Gamma range [>30 Hz]. Gamma oscillations fast and transient nature makes a direct link between Gamma-IBC and other (much slower) interpersonal dynamics difficult, leaving Gamma-IBC without a plausible model. However, at the intra-brain level, Gamma activity is coupled with the dynamics of lower frequencies through cross-frequency coupling (CFC). This paper provides a biophysical explanation for the emergence of Gamma inter-brain coupling using a Kuramoto model of four oscillators divided into two separate (brain) units. By modulating both the degree of inter-brain coupling in the Theta band (i.e., between-units coupling) and CFC (i.e., intra-unit Theta-Gamma coupling), we provide a theoretical explanation of the observed Gamma-IBC phenomenon in the EEG-hyperscanning literature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expansive Linguistic Representations to Predict Interpretable Odor Mixture Discriminability</a></h4>

              
                Language is often thought as being poorly adapted to precisely describe or quantify smell and olfactory attributes. In this work, we show that semantic descriptors of odors can be implemented in a model to successfully predict odor mixture discriminability, an olfactory attribute. We achieved this by taking advantage of the structure-to-percept model we previously developed for monomolecular odorants, using chemical descriptors to predict pleasantness, intensity and 19 semantic descriptors such as  fish,  cold,  burnt,  garlic,  grass and  sweet for odor mixtures, followed by a metric learning to obtain odor mixture discriminability. Through this expansion of the representation of olfactory mixtures, our Semantic model outperforms state of the art methods by taking advantage of the intermediary semantic representations learned from human perception data to enhance and generalize the odor discriminability/similarity predictions. As 10 of the semantic descriptors were selected to predict discriminability/similarity, our approach meets the need of rapidly obtaining interpretable attributes of odor mixtures as illustrated by the difficulty of finding olfactory metamers. More fundamentally, it also shows that language can be used to establish a metric of discriminability in the everyday olfactory space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Between-area communication through the lens of within-area neuronal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Cognition arises through the interaction of distributed, but connected, brain regions. Each region can exhibit neuronal dynamics ranging from asynchronous spiking to richly patterned spatio-temporal activity, where coordinated trial-to-trial fluctuations within the population can be described by a small number of shared latent variables. Even though recent technological advances have allowed simultaneous recordings from multiple brain areas, it is still unknown how diverse and complex within-area neuronal dynamics affect between-area interactions. Using a spiking network model exhibiting a wide range of neuronal dynamics, we show that communication efficacy, as assessed by linear measures, depends on the origin of low-dimensional shared variability. More specifically, a mismatch in within-area dimensionality or a misalignment of shared variability between upstream and downstream areas compromise communication. However, even in scenarios with seemingly weak linear communication, the downstream area is effectively driven by the upstream activity. These results expose the limitations of linear measures when analyzing between-area communication in circuits with diverse neuronal dynamics.

                Experimental evidence in animals demonstrates cortical neurons innervate subcortex bilaterally to tune brainstem auditory coding. Yet, the role of the descending (corticofugal) auditory system in modulating earlier sound processing in humans during speech perception remains unclear. Here, we measured EEG activity as listeners performed speech identification tasks in different backgrounds aiming to tax perceptual and attentional processing. Brainstem speech coding might be tied to attention and arousal states (indexed by cortical  power) that actively modulate the interplay of brainstem-cortical signal processing. When speech-evoked brainstem frequency-following responses (FFRs) were categorized according to their  states, low  FFRs in noise were found to be weaker, correlated positively with behavioral response times, more "decodable" via classifiers, and associated indirectly with other signal-in-noise perceptual performance. Our data provide evidence for online corticofugal interplay in humans and establish that brainstem sensory representations are continuously yoked to the ebb and flow of cortical states to dynamically update perceptual processing.

                The lack of reproducibility of research results is a serious problem - known as "the reproducibility crisis". The German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) initiative implemented by the German Research Foundation (DFG) aims to help overcoming this crisis by developing sustainable solutions for research data management (RDM). NFDI comprises domain specific consortia across all science disciplines. In the field of neuroscience, NFDI Neuroscience (NFDI-Neuro) contributes to the strengthening of systematic and standardized RDM in its research communities. NFDI-Neuro conducted a comprehensive survey amongst the neuroscience community to determine the current needs, challenges, and opinions with respect to RDM. The outcomes of this survey are presented here. The German neuroscience community perceives barriers with respect to RDM and data sharing mainly linked to (1) lack of data and metadata standards, (2) lack of community adopted provenance tracking methods, 3) lack of a privacy preserving research infrastructure for sensitive data (4) lack of RDM literacy and (5) lack of required time and resources for proper RDM. NFDI-Neuro aims to systematically address these barriers by leading and contributing to the development of standards, tools, and infrastructure and by providing training, education and support, as well as additional resources to its research community. The RDM work of NFDI-Neuro is conducted in close collaboration with its partner EBRAINS AISBL, the coordinating entity of the EU Flagship Human Brain Project, and its Research Infrastructure (RI) EBRAINS with more than 4500 registered users and developers from more than 30 countries. While NFDI-Neuro aims to address the national needs, it closely aligns with the international community and the topics of the Digital Europe Program and EU Data Spaces.

                There has been an immense research focus on the topic of cortical reorganization in human evolution, but much less is known regarding the reorganization of subcortical circuits which are intimate working partners of the cortex. Here, by combining advanced image analysis techniques with comparative neuroimaging data, we systematically map organizational differences in striatal, pallidal and thalamic anatomy between humans and chimpanzees. We relate interspecies differences, a proxy for evolutionary changes, to genetics and behavioral correlates. We show that highly heritable morphological measures are significantly expanded across species, in contrast to previous findings in the cortex. The identified morphological-cognitive latent variables were associated with striatal expansion, and affective latent variables were associated with more evolutionarily-conserved areas in the thalamus and globus pallidus. These findings provide new insight into the architecture of these subcortical hubs and can provide greater information on the role of these structures in health and illness.

                A widely accepted view in memory research is that recently stored information can be reactivated during sleep, leading to memory strengthening, often measured as reduced forgetting of the reactivated information after a delay. On the other hand, some participants in two recent studies (Goldi & Rasch, 2019; Whitmore et al., 2022) showed a reversed effect, with weakening of reactivated memories. Generally poor sleep in those individuals could be indirectly responsible, but another possible explanation specifically attributes the reversal to disturbed sleep during reactivation. To test whether weakening of reactivated memories can result directly from sleep disruption, in this experiment we varied the intensity of memory reactivation cues, such that some produced sleep arousals. Prior to sleep, participants learned the locations of 75 objects, each accompanied by a sound naturally related to that object. Location recall was tested before and after sleep, and a subset of the sounds were presented during sleep. Reactivation with arousal weakened memories, unlike the improvement typically found. We conclude that reactivated memories can be selectively weakened during sleep, and that memory reactivation may operate either to enhance or reduce memory storage depending on additional factors such as concurrent sleep disruption.

                Competing theories of consciousness disagree on the role of frontoparietal networks. Here we recorded neural activity from 727 intracerebral contacts in 13 epileptic patients, while they detected near-threshold targets preceded by supra-threshold exogenous cues. Trajectory k-means clustering revealed three patterns: (1) Validly cued seen targets elicit sustained activity in right-hemisphere fronto-temporal regions, connected by superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) II/III, and late accumulation activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in right-hemisphere orbitofrontal cortex (SLF I/III). (2) Invalidly cued seen targets elicit early, sustained activity in the right-hemisphere reorienting network (SLF III). (3) Seen targets elicit late sustained left dorsolateral prefrontal activity. Task modeling with recurrent neural networks supported the causal contribution of these networks to conscious perception, and elucidated their interplay through excitatory-inhibitory mechanisms. We provide new, compelling evidence on the role of hemisphere-asymmetric frontoparietal networks associated with attentional enhancement and reorienting in conscious perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Larger and more dentated hippocampal structure is associated with better memory in the oldest-old.</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory is widely recognized as a critically important aspect of cognition that is often impacted by cognitive and brain aging. Prior work has shown that episodic memory is related to the presence of teeth-like folds on the dentate gyrus, called dentation. We hypothesized that episodic memory performance relates to overall hippocampal structure (i.e. dentation and volume) in an oldest-old cohort. We used data from the McKnight Brain Aging Registry, which consisted of cognitively healthy 85+-year-old adults. We conducted a canonical correlation analysis on 111 participants between a set of episodic memory tests and a set of characterizations of hippocampal structure. The analysis yielded a strong canonical correlation between episodic memory and hippocampal structure (r = 0.491, p = <0.001). The results suggest there is a connection between hippocampal morphology and function in the oldest-old. Our findings suggest that dentation may play an important role in relation to the individual differences observed in episodic memory performance among the oldest old and that hippocampal structure supports healthy cognitive aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning-related contraction of grey matter in rodent sensorimotor cortex is associated with adaptive myelination</a></h4>

              
                From observations in rodents, it has been suggested that the cellular basis of learning-dependent changes, detected using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be increased dendritic spine density, alterations in astrocyte volume, and adaptations within intracortical myelin. Myelin plasticity is crucial for neurological function and active myelination is required for learning and memory. However, the dynamics of myelin plasticity and how it relates to morphometric-based measurements of structural plasticity remains unknown. We used a motor skill learning paradigm to evaluate experience-dependent brain plasticity by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in longitudinal MRI, combined with a cross-sectional immunohistochemical investigation. Whole brain VBM revealed non-linear decreases in grey matter (GM) juxtaposed to non-linear increases in white matter (WM) that were best modelled by an asymptotic time course. Using an atlas-based cortical mask, we found non-linear changes with learning in primary and secondary motor areas and in somatosensory cortex. Analysis of cross-sectional myelin immunoreactivity in forelimb somatosensory cortex confirmed an increase in myelin immunoreactivity followed by a return towards baseline levels. The absence of significant histological changes in cortical thickness further suggests that non-linear morphometric changes are likely due to changes in intracortical myelin for which morphometric WM volume (WMV) data significantly correlated with myelin immunoreactivity. Together, these observations indicate a non-linear increase of intracortical myelin during learning and support the hypothesis that myelin is a component of structural changes observed by VBM during learning.

	<p>The participation of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been reported in many studies. However, the role of the expression and function of SIRT1 in the hypothalamus in ALS remains unknown. In the current study, we performed western blot, co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses to determine the expression and in-depth mechanism of SIRT1 in the hypothalamus in SOD1G93A transgenic mice. We found that SIRT1 was overexpressed in the hypothalamus after motor symptom onset. In addition, SIRT1 interacted with prepro-orexin, a molecule involved in energy balance and the sleep/wake cycle, in both preclinical and clinical ALS regardless of whether SIRT1 levels were elevated. These findings indicate that SIRT1 might participate in sleep and metabolic changes in ALS, suggesting that SIRT1 is a new target for ALS treatment.</p>

	<p>It is generally believed that eye movements are completely spared in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although a series of eye movement abnormalities has been recognized in recent years, the findings are highly controversial, and bulbar disabilities should be considered in relation to eye movement abnormalities. The present study aimed to determine whether eye movement abnormalities are present in ALS and, if so, to investigate their characteristics and their association with bulbar disability in ALS patients. A total of 60 patients and 30 controls were recruited and underwent the standardized evaluations of the oculomotor system using videonystagmography. Square-wave jerks (OR: 16.20, 95% CI: 3.50&amp;amp;ndash;74.95, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and abnormal cogwheeling during smooth pursuit (OR: 14.04, 95% CI: 3.00&amp;amp;ndash;65.75, p = 0.001) were more frequently observed in ALS patients than in the control subjects. In subgroup analyses, square-wave jerks (OR: 26.51, 95% CI: 2.83&amp;amp;ndash;248.05, p = 0.004) and abnormal cogwheeling during smooth pursuit (OR: 6.56, 95% CI: 1.19&amp;amp;ndash;36.16, p = 0.031) were found to be more common in ALS patients with bulbar involvement (n = 44) than in those without bulbar involvement (n = 16). There were no significant differences in the investigated eye movement parameters between bulbar-onset (n = 12) and spinal-onset patients (n = 48). ALS patients showed a range of eye movement abnormalities, affecting mainly the ocular fixation and smooth pursuit systems. Our pioneering study indicates that the region of involvement could better indicate the pathophysiological essence of the abnormalities than the type of onset pattern in ALS. Eye movement abnormalities may be potential clinical markers for objectively evaluating upper brainstem or supratentorial cerebral lesion neurodegeneration in ALS.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have reported a relationship between stress and brain activity, and stress has been quantitatively evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In the present study, we examined whether a relationship exists between salivary amylase levels and brain activity during the trail-making test (TMT) using mobile NIRS. This study aimed to assess stress levels by using mobile NIRS. Salivary amylase was measured with a salivary amylase monitor, and hemoglobin concentration was measured using Neu&amp;amp;rsquo;s HOT-2000. Measurements were taken four times for each subject, and the values at each measurement were evaluated. Changes in the values at the first&amp;amp;ndash;second, second&amp;amp;ndash;third, and third&amp;amp;ndash;fourth measurements were also analyzed. Results showed that the value of the fluctuations has a higher correlation than the comparison of point values. These results suggest that the accuracy of stress assessment by NIRS can be improved by using variability and time-series data compared with stress assessment using NIRS at a single time point.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic vesicle-bound molecular bridges organize sequential vesicle states along parallel pathways</a></h4>

              
                Multiple complexes and biochemical pathways are involved in priming synaptic vesicles and subsequent neurotransmitter release. While atomic models of reconstituted complexes, interaction data and physiological experiments were essential for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission, they lack the combination of the native preservation, comprehensive view and a high level of detail to resolve how the actions of individual complexes integrate to give rise to cellular function. We employed cryo-electron tomography to simultaneously image multiple presynaptic complexes at a single nanometer resolution in their native composition, conformation and environment, and to determine their spatial organization. Our results show that Munc13- and SNAP25-dependent tethers localize vesicles with a single nanometer precision, thus defining sequential vesicle states that immediately precede neurotransmitter release. The transition between the states involves two parallel biochemical pathways and is associated with a conversion to SNARE complex-dependent tethers and a loss of protein connectors that interlink vesicles. These results provide an example of a cellular function performed by a large molecular assembly comprising multiple, spatially separated complexes and provides a framework for further exploration of such assemblies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual Mode Switching: Improved General Compensation to Environmental Color Change Requires Only One Exposure Per Day</a></h4>

              
                When the visual environment changes, vision adapts in order to maintain accurate perception. For repeatedly encountered environmental changes, the visual system may learn to adjust immediately, a process called visual mode switching. For example, following experience with red glasses, participants report the redness of glasses fades instantly when they put the glasses on. Here we tested: 1) whether once-daily experience suffices for learning to switch visual modes, and 2) whether effects of mode-switching apply to most stimuli affected by the environmental change. In Experiment 1, twelve participants wore bright red glasses for a single 5-hr period each day, for 5 days; and we tested for changes in the perception of unique yellow, which contains neither red nor green. In Experiment 2, we tested how mode switching affects larger parts of the color space. Thirteen participants donned and removed the glasses multiple times a day, for 5 days; and we used a dissimilarity rating task to measure and track perception of many different colors. Across days, immediately upon donning the glasses, the world appeared less and less reddish (Experiment 1), and colors across the whole color space appeared more and more normal (Experiment 2). These results indicate that mode switching can be learned from a once-daily experience, and it applies to most stimuli in a given environment. These findings may help to predict when and how mode switching occurs outside the laboratory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unexpected proteinopathies in hippocampal PDE11A4 promote age-related cognitive decline of social associative memories</a></h4>

              
                In humans, associative memories are more susceptible to age-related cognitive decline (ARCD; a.k.a. age-related cognitive impairment) than are recognition memories. Reduced cAMP/cGMP signaling in the hippocampus may contribute to ARCD. Here, we found that both aging and traumatic brain injury (TBI)-associated dementia increased expression of the cAMP/cGMP-degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A) in the human hippocampus. Further, age-related increases in hippocampal PDE11A4 mRNA and protein were conserved in mice, as was the increased vulnerability of associative versus recognition memories to ARCD. Interestingly, mouse PDE11A4 protein in the aged ventral hippocampus (VHIPP) ectopically accumulated in the membrane fraction and filamentous structures we term ghost axons. These age-related increases in expression were driven by reduced exoribonuclease-mediated degradation of PDE11A mRNA and increased PDE11A4-pS117/pS124, the latter of which also drove the punctate accumulation of PDE11A4 in HT-22, COS-1, and HEK293T cells. In contrast, PDE11A4-pS162 caused dispersal. Importantly, preventing age-related increases in PDE11 expression via genetic deletion protected mice from ARCD of short-term and remote long-term associative memory (aLTM) in the social transmission of food preference assay (STFP), albeit at the expense of recent aLTM. Further, mimicking age-related overexpression of PDE11A4 in CA1 of old KO mice caused aging-like impairments in CREB function and remote social, but not non-social, LTMs. RNA sequencing and phosphoproteomic analyses of VHIPP identified cGMP-PKG, as opposed to cAMP-PKA, as well as circadian entrainment, glutamatergic/cholinergic synapses, calcium signaling, oxytocin, and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling as mechanisms by which PDE11A deletion protects against ARCD. Together, these data suggest that PDE11A4 proteinopathies (a.k.a., proteopathies) acutely impair signaling in the aged brain thereby contributing to ARCD of social memories and identify the PDE11A4 N-terminus as a region of interest for therapeutic targeting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">K2P channel TWK-40 Regulates a Rhythmic Behavior in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Background: potassium (K+) leak currents, conducted by two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels, are critical for the stabilization of the membrane potential. The effect of K2P channels on motor rhythm remains enigmatic. We show here a K2P TWK-40 regulates the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Disrupting TWK-40 suppresses the expulsion defects of nlp-40 and aex-2 mutants. By contrast, a gain-of-function (gf) mutant of twk-40 significantly reduces the expulsion frequency per DMP cycle. In situ whole-cell patch clamping demonstrates that TWK-40 forms an outward currents that hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential of DVB neuron. In addition, TWK-40 substantially contributes to the rhythmic activity of the DVB. Specifically, DVB Ca2+ oscillations exhibit obvious defects in twk-40 mutants. Expression of TWK-40(gf) in DVB recapitulates the expulsion deficiency of the twk-40(gf) mutant, and inhibits DVB Ca2+ oscillations in both wild-type and twk-40(lf) animals. Moreover, DVB innervated enteric muscles also exhibit rhythmic Ca2+ defects. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the TWK-40 is an essential inhibitor of DMP, thus revealing a cellular mechanism by funtional K2P channel of rhythmic motor activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Spiking Neural Network Model for the Control of Oscillatory Phase Differences Between Multiple Brain Areas</a></h4>

              
                The causal mechanisms which underlie rapid, transient, and dynamic coordination of large-scale functional brain networks remain unknown. Neuronal oscillations have been hypothesized to play a critical role influencing long-range communication between brain areas, with oscillatory phase differences influencing the effective connectivity between areas (Fries 2005). However, it remains unclear how networks of spiking neurons could causally and mechanistically control the relative phase difference between cortical regions. Here we describe a simple model of spiking neurons that can dynamically control the relative phase differences between multiple brain areas. The model applies to any inhibition-based rhythm, and has four essential elements: a) tonic excitation of local recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory cells produces oscillations (Borgers et al, 2012); b) winner-take-all (WTA) dynamics permit only a small fraction of cells to fire on any given cycle (De almeida et al, 2009); c) di-synaptic feed-forward inhibition leads to oscillatory phase resetting in a target area (Traub et al, 1996); and d) the range of conduction delays for inter-regional axonal projections span the duration of one oscillatory cycle (Swadlow 1998). The key assumption of our model is to link WTA dynamics to conduction delays, such that only axons with a narrow range of delays are active at one time and are selected via local activity. Phase resetting in the target area converts this conduction delay into a specific phase difference. Thus, the model converts local differences in cellular excitation into inter-areal phase differences via WTA dynamics and feed-forward inhibition, where excitatory cells act as phase difference effectors or detectors. Including several WTA modules within a given area allows it to serve as a coordinating hub, controlling the relative phase differences of multiple distributed brain regions. Finally, we show how this model can help explains recent empirical results showing that individual neurons are sensitive to the relative phase difference between areas (Canolty et al, 2010).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assessing TMS-evoked cognitive network responses depending on neurocognitive and oscillatory brain state: A simultaneous TMS-EEG-fMRI project</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition arises from information exchange within and between functionally connected brain networks. Alterations in such signal propagation across networks are linked to numerous disorders. Brain-wide signal propagation can be experimentally studied with simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where TMS pulses introduce a signal at a certain network node and fMRI charts its propagation through the network. Yet, this approach ignores the fact that the (network) impact of a TMS pulse depends on brain state, where brain state fluctuates spontaneously from moment to moment (e.g. oscillatory state) as well as depending on what a participant does (neurocognitive state). Here, we assessed TMS-evoked fMRI activations as a function of neurocognitive state (eyes open versus eyes closed in complete darkness) and oscillatory state (low versus high pre-TMS alpha power, as measured with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)). We applied supra- versus sub-threshold triple-pulse TMS to the right posterior parietal cortex in eight participants, while simultaneously recording EEG and fMRI during two different ocular states. In this first application of the multimodal TMS-EEG-fMRI paradigm to a cognitive network hub, we did not find evidence for a brain state modulation of TMS-induced signal propagation. Instead, we found state-independent TMS-evoked fMRI responses mostly in sensory areas such as the insula, superior temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus, but also in the frontal eye fields. Interestingly, neurocognitive state did seem to modulate the fMRI response to indirect TMS effects such as sensory stimulation. These results lead to several important insights for future cognitive multimodal TMS experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A distributed and efficient population code of mixed selectivity neurons for flexible navigation decisions</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making requires flexibility to rapidly switch sensorimotor associations depending on behavioral goals stored in memory. We identified cortical areas and neural activity patterns that mediate this flexibility during virtual-navigation, where mice switched navigation toward or away from a visual cue depending on its match to a remembered cue. An optogenetics screen identified V1, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) as necessary for accurate decisions. Calcium imaging revealed neurons that can mediate rapid sensorimotor switching by encoding a conjunction of a current and remembered visual cue that predicted the mouse's navigational choice from trial-to-trial. Their activity formed efficient population codes before correct, but not incorrect, choices. These neurons were distributed across posterior cortex, even V1, but were densest in RSC and sparsest in PPC. We propose the flexibility of navigation decisions arises from neurons that mix visual and memory information within a visual-parietal-retrosplenial network, centered in RSC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phosphorylation of the novel mTOR substrate Unkempt regulates cellular morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that integrates multiple inputs to regulate anabolic cellular processes. mTOR has key functions in nervous system development and mis-regulation of mTOR signalling causes aberrant neurodevelopment and results in neurological disease. Very little is understood about the signalling components that act downstream of mTOR to regulate neuronal development and morphogenesis. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein Unkempt, which is primarily expressed in the nervous system, is a novel substrate of mTOR complex I (mTORC1). Unkempt phosphorylation is regulated by nutrient levels and growth factors via mTORC1. Unkempt physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 through binding to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, Raptor. Phosphorylation of Unkempt during nervous system development is mTORC1-dependent, suggesting that Unkempt is a key mTORC1 substrate in the developing brain. Unkempt phosphorylation by mTORC1 occurs largely within a highly serine-rich intrinsically disordered region. Mutation analysis of key serine/threonine residues in the serine-rich region indicates that phosphorylation inhibits the ability of Unkempt to induce early bipolar neuronal-like morphology. Phosphorylation within this serine-rich region thus profoundly affects the ability of Unkempt to regulate cellular morphogenesis. Our findings reveal a molecular link between mTOR signalling and cellular morphogenesis and shed new light on this critical aspect of nervous system development.

Significance StatementMechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling regulates a variety of key cellular processes, but we understand little about the cell and tissue specificity of this pathway at the molecular level. mTOR signalling is particularly important in nerve cells, regulating their development. We have identified a novel substrate of mTOR complex I (mTORC1) in nerve cells, called Unkempt. Unkempt physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 in cultured nerve cells and during nervous system development. We show that phosphorylation dramatically alters the ability of Unkempt to regulate cell shape. Unkempt provides a new entry point to understand mTOR signalling in the nervous system at the molecular level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanistic Neural Mass Modeling: from physiology to pathophysiological brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Brain rhythms emerge from the mean-field activity of networks of neurons. There have been many efforts to build mathematical and computational embodiments in the form of discrete cell group activities termed neural masses to understand particular the origins of evoked potentials, intrinsic patterns of activities such as theta, regulation of sleep, Parkinsons disease related dynamics, and instabilities such as seizure dynamics. As originally utilized, standard neural masses convert input through a sigmoidal function to a firing rate, and firing rate through a synaptic alpha function to other masses. Here we define a process to build almost from first principles (i.e. Hodgkin Huxley type models) mean field models of different neuron types that duplicate the stability, firing rate, and associated bifurcations as function of relevant slow variables - such as extracellular potassium - and synaptic current; and whose output is both firing rate and impact on the slow variables - such as transmembrane potassium flux. Small networks composed of just excitatory and inhibitory masses demonstrate expected dynamical states including stable firing, runaway excitation and depolarization block, and these transitions change in biologically observed ways with changes in extracellular potassium and excitatory-inhibitory balance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells evade temporal filtering to encode environmental light intensity</a></h4>

              
                The retina encodes environmental light intensity to drive innate physiological responses. The synaptic basis of such coding remains obscure. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are the only retinal output neurons stably encoding intensity. They do so even without their melanopsin photopigment, so specializations in their synaptic drive from bipolar cells (BCs) must also contribute. Here, we shed new light on mechanisms responsible for this unique intensity-coding drive. By ultrastructural reconstruction, we show that specific BC types and unusual ribbon synapses carry photoreceptor signals to ipRGCs. By glutamate imaging and electrophysiology, we show that their light responses are unusually persistent. Still, we find that virtually all BCs encode intensity. Intensity coding becomes restricted to ipRGCs primarily because other RGCs filter out steady-state intensity signals postsynaptically. Thus, neural 'pinholes' in global, persistent neural 'masking' allow intensity signals to be encoded by ipRGCs and sent to specific centers of the visual brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Polymer physics-based classification of neurons</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing that diverse morphologies of neurons are reminiscent of structures of branched polymers, we put forward a principled and systematic way of classifying neurons that employs the ideas of polymer physics. In particular, we use 3D coordinates of individual neurons to calculate the form factor, F(q), a Fourier transform of density-density correlation of particles comprising an object of interest. For a polymer-like object consisting of n monomers, F(q) scales with the wavenumber q as F(q)~ q-D at an intermediate range of q, where D is the fractal dimension or the inverse scaling exponent (D={nu}-1) characterizing the geometrical feature (r~ n{nu}) of the object over a length scale r(= 2{pi}/q). F(q) can be used to describe a neuron morphology in terms of its size (Rn) and the extent of branching quantified by D. By assessing the similarity between F(q)s calculated for a set of neurons, we tackle the neuron classification problem. Our F(q)-based classification, applied to publicly available neuron datasets from three different organisms, not only complements other classification methods but also offers a physical picture of how the dendritic and axonal branches of an individual neuron fill the space of dense neural networks inside the brain.

                Recent studies, both clinical and experimental, indicate that many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease (AD) often display coexisting metabolic dysfunctions, which may exacerbate neurological symptoms. The hypothalamus is a brain region highly involved in maintaining metabolic and other homeostatic processes and is known to be involved in the etiology of AD, although the role of hypothalamic dysfunction in the onset, progression, and severity of AD is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that our new model of genetic diversity in AD, the AD-BXDs, exhibits non-cognitive symptoms consistent with hypothalamic dysfunction and examined hypothalamic bulk RNA sequencing data in the AD-BXD panel to investigate how the AD transgene impacts gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus. Mostly notably, we identified strong neuroinflammatory signatures from the hypothalamus in the AD-BXDs as early as six months of age. A functionally unknown WGCNA module showed correlation to female body weight and contextual fear acquisition. Eigengene expression of microglial/macrophagic modules and their hub gene expressions were correlated to cognitive phenotypes. From these analyses, we nominated Plek and Laptm5 as new targets to attenuate neuroinflammation in AD.

                Excitatory and inhibitory neurons in diverse cortical regions are likely to contribute differentially to the transformation of sensory information into goal-directed motor plans. Here, we investigate the relative changes across mouse sensorimotor cortex in the activity of putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons - categorized as regular or fast spiking according to their action potential waveform - comparing before and after learning of a whisker detection task with delayed licking as perceptual report. Surprisingly, we found that the whisker-evoked activity of regular versus fast spiking neurons changed in opposite directions after learning in primary and secondary whisker motor cortices, while it changed similarly in primary and secondary orofacial motor cortices. Our results suggest that changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition in local circuits concurrent with changes in the long-range synaptic inputs in distinct cortical regions might contribute to performance of delayed sensory-to-motor transformation.

                Social dominance is an important feature of social life. Dominance has been proposed to be one of two trait dimensions underpinning social judgments of human faces. Yet, the neural bases of the ability to identify different dominance levels in others based on facial features remains poorly understood. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to determine the temporal dynamics of facial dominance evaluation based on facial features signaling physical strength/weakness in humans. Twenty-seven participants performed a dominance perception task where they passively viewed faces with different dominance levels. Dominance levels did not modulate an early component of face processing, known as the N170 component, but did modulate the Late Positive Potential (LPP) component. These findings indicate that participants inferred dominance levels at a late stage of face evaluation. Furthermore, the highest level of dominant faces and the lowest level of submissive faces both elicited higher LPP amplitudes than faces with a neutral dominance level. Taken together, the present study provides new insights regarding the dynamics of the neurocognitive processes underlying facial dominance evaluation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functionally and structurally distinct fusiform face area(s) in over 1000 participants</a></h4>

              
                The Fusiform Face Area (FFA) is a widely studied region causally involved in face perception. Even though cognitive neuroscientists have been studying the FFA for over two decades, answers to foundational questions regarding the structure, function, and connectivity of the FFA from a large (N>1000) group of participants are still lacking. To fill this gap, we quantified structural, functional, and connectivity features of fusiform face-selective regions in 1080 participants in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). After manually defining over 4,000 fusiform face-selective regions, we report five main findings. First, 68.94% of hemispheres have two cortically separate regions (pFus-faces/FFA-1 and mFus-faces/FFA-2). Second, in 26.48% of hemispheres, pFus-faces/FFA-1 and mFus-faces/FFA-2 are spatially contiguous, yet functionally and structurally distinct. Third, pFus-faces/FFA-1 is more face-selective than mFus-faces/FFA-2, and the two regions have distinct functional connectivity fingerprints. Fourth, pFus-faces/FFA-1 is cortically thinner and more heavily myelinated than mFus-faces/FFA-2. Fifth, face-selective patterns and functional connectivity fingerprints of each region were more similar in monozygotic than dizygotic twins and more so than structural gradients. As we share our areal definitions with the field, future studies can explore how structural and functional features of these regions will inform theories regarding how visual categories are represented in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cannabinoid 1/2 Receptor Activation Induces Strain-Dependent Behavioral and Neurochemical Changes in GAERS and NEC rats</a></h4>

              
                Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is characterized by absence seizures which are episodes of lack of consciousness accompanied by electrographic spike-wave discharges. About 60% of children and adolescents with ASs are affected by major neuropsychological comorbidities, including anxiety. Endocannabinoids and monoamines are likely involved in the pathophysiology of these CAE psychiatric comorbidities. Here, we show that the synthetic cannabinoid receptor type 1/2 (CB1/2R) agonist WIN 55,212-2 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) has a strain-dependent effect on anxiety-like and motor behavior and cerebral monoaminergic levels in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and their non-epileptic control (NEC) rat strain. Using quantitative and Temporal-Pattern analysis, we found that WIN 55,212-2 did not affect the emotional status of GAERS but it was anxiolytic in NEC. Conversely, WIN 55,212-2 had a sedative effect in GAERS but was ineffective in NEC. Moreover, vehicle-treated GAERS are more motivated to explore by implementing more complex and articulated strategies. These behavioral changes correlate with the reduction of 5-HT in the hippocampus and substantia nigra (SN) and noradrenaline (NA) in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) in vehicle-treated GAERS compared to NEC rats which could contribute to their low anxiety status and hypermotility, respectively. On the other hand, the increased level of NA in the EPN and 5-HT in the SN is consistent with an activation of the basal ganglia output-mediated motor suppression observed in WIN 55,212-2-treated GAERS rats. These data support the view of a strain-dependent alteration of the endocannabinoid system by adding evidence of lower emotional responsiveness and a basal ganglia hypersensitivity to cannabinoids in GAERS compared to NEC rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuro-cognitive models of single-trial EEG measures describe latent effects of spatial attention during perceptual decision making</a></h4>

              
                Visual perceptual decision-making involves multiple components including visual encoding, attention, accumulation of evidence, and motor execution. Recent research suggests that EEG oscillations can identify the time of encoding and the onset of evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making. Although scientists show that spatial attention improves participant performance in decision making, little is known about how spatial attention influences the individual cognitive components that give rise to that improvement in performance. We found evidence in this work that both visual encoding time (VET) before evidence accumulation and other non-decision time processes after or during evidence accumulation are influenced by spatial top-down attention, but not evidence accumulation itself. Specifically, we used an open-source data set in which participants were informed about the location of a target stimulus in the visual field on some trials during a face-car perceptual decision-making task. Fitting neural drift-diffusion models to response time, accuracy, and single-trial N200 latencies (~ 125 to 225 ms post-stimulus) of EEG allowed us to separate the processes of visual encoding and the decision process from other non-decision time processes such as motor execution. These models were fit in a single step in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Model selection criteria and comparison to model simulations show that spatial attention manipulates both VET and other non-decision time processes. We discuss why spatial attention may affect other non-evidence accumulation processes, such as motor execution time (MET), and why this may seem unexpected given the literature. We make recommendations for future work on this topic.

                Human learning is an active and complex process. However, the brain mechanisms underlying human skill learning and the effect of learning on the communication between brain regions, at different frequency bands, are still largely unknown. Here, we tracked changes in large-scale electrophysiological networks over a 6-week training period during which participants practiced a series of visuomotor sequences during 30 home training sessions. Our findings showed that brain networks become more flexible with learning in all the frequency bands from theta to gamma ranges. We found consistent increase of flexibility in the prefrontal and limbic regions in the theta and alpha band, and over sensorimotor and visual areas in the alpha band. Specific to the beta rhythm, we revealed that higher flexibility of prefrontal regions during the early stage of learning strongly correlated with better performance measured during home training sessions. Our findings provide novel evidence that prolonged visuomotor practice results in higher, frequency-specific, temporal variability in brain network structure.

                Soma and Neurite Density Image (SANDI) is an advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) signal model devised to probe in vivo microstructural information from both grey and white matter. However, this model requires multi-shell acquisitions that include b- values that are at least 6 times higher than those used in clinical practice. Here we present a 10-minute acquisition protocol that enables to acquire the necessary images for SANDI modelling on a clinical 3T scanner. We demonstrate the feasibility and assess the repeatability and reproducibility of our approach by computing microstructural metrics of SANDI and other state-of-the-art models on five healthy subjects and we present its potential clinical impact on five subjects affected by multiple sclerosis with relapsing-remitting course. Our results suggest that SANDI is a repeatable, reproducible, feasible, and practical method to characterize both white and grey matter tissues in both the healthy brain and in neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms of human dynamic object recognition revealed by sequential deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Humans recognize objects in a dynamically changing world integrating evidence across a vast variety of timescales. This ability is showcased by performance on rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks in which observers succeed at recognizing objects in rapid sequences of natural scenes, at up to 13 ms/image. To date, the computational mechanisms governing such dynamic object recognition remain poorly understood. Here, we developed deep learning models for dynamic recognition and compared different computational mechanisms, contrasting feedforward and recurrent, single and sequential image processing as well as different forms of adaptation. We found that only models that integrate images sequentially via lateral recurrence mirrored human performance (N=36) across different image durations (13-80 ms/image). Augmenting this model with a power-law adaptation mechanism was essential for predicting human trial-by-trial reports across image durations. These findings shed new insights into the mechanisms rendering object recognition so fast and effective in a dynamic visual world.

                We present a normative computational theory of how neural circuitry in the Dorsal Visual Stream (DVS) and the Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) support visually guided goal-directed actions in a dynamical environment through flexible goal-encoding intentions. It builds on Active Inference, in which perception and motor control signals are inferred through dynamic minimization of generalized prediction errors. The PPC is proposed to maintain a belief over bodily state and relevant objects on the scene, and by manipulating these states, it is involved along with visual, frontal, and motor areas in dynamically generating goal-directed actions including motor planning and movement control. Specifically, the PPC is viewed as a dynamic system computing flexible motor intentions and directing belief over the latent body state towards dynamic future goals, while the DVS is viewed as a generative model translating beliefs into visual sensory predictions in order to infer targets and posture. An intention-driven Active Inference agent that embodied an actuated upper limb with visual and proprioceptive sensors was able to perceive and reach visual targets, behaving correctly under various conditions, including static and dynamic targets, different sensory feedback, sensory precisions, intention gains, and movement policies. The theory is of general interest because it provides a normative basis for a variety of neurophysiological investigations of flexible goal-directed behavior and sensorimotor processes in end-to-end settings and further advances Artificial Intelligence methods for sensorimotor control.

                The nucleus incertus (NI), an understudied hindbrain structure implicated in the stress response, arousal, and memory, is a major site for production of the neuropeptide relaxin-3. On the basis of goosecoid homeobox 2 (gsc2) expression, we identified a neuronal cluster that lies adjacent to relaxin 3a (rln3a) neurons in the zebrafish analogue of the NI. To delineate properties of the gsc2 and rln3a neurons, we used CRISPR/Cas9 targeted integration to drive gene expression in each group, and showed that they differ in afferent input, efferent connections and functional properties. gsc2 and rln3a NI neurons innervate distinct subregions of the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), but only gsc2 neurons receive reciprocal innervation from the IPN. Whereas gsc2 neurons are activated by electric shock, rln3a neurons exhibit spontaneous fluctuations in calcium signaling and regulate locomotor activity. Our findings define heterogeneous neurons in the NI and provide new tools to probe its diverse functions.

                How are visuomotor mismatch responses in visual cortex embedded into cortical processing? We here argue that mismatch responses are best understood as the result of a cooperation of motor and visual areas to jointly explain optic flow. This cooperation ensures that optic flow is not explained redundantly by both areas, which in the language of causal inference is termed explaining away. This improves the efficiency of the resulting neural code, and allows the animal to easily detect movements that are independent of its own locomotion. We demonstrate the emergence of mismatch responses from explaining away in simulations, where spiking neurons learn to encode optic flow stimuli and locomotion. We furthermore lay out arguments against the prevailing idea that mismatch signals are the result of a dedicated error computation in a hierarchical model. These results provide a new perspective on several recent experiments of cross-modal neural interactions in cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal hypothyroidism in mice promotes glial cell activation and spatial memory deficits.</a></h4>

              
                Adult-onset hypothyroidism is associated with learning and cognitive dysfunctions, which may be related to alterations in synaptic plasticity. Local reduced levels of thyroid hormones (THs) may impair glia morphology and activity, and promote the increase of proinflammatory cytokine levels mainly in the hippocampus. Given that neuroinflammation induces memory impairments, hypothyroidism-related glia dysfunction may participate in brain disorders. Thus, we investigated the mechanisms linking hypothyroidism, neuroinflammation and spatial memory, from a protective prospective. We induced hypothyroidism in adult C57BL/6J and wild-derived WSB/EiJ male mice by a seven-week propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment. We previously showed that WSB/EiJ mice were resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, showing no neuroinflammatory response through adaptive abilities, unlike C57BL/6J. As PTU and HFD treatments are known to induce comparable inflammatory responses, we hypothesized WSB/EiJ mice might also be protected against hypothyroidism induced neuroinflammation. We showed that hypothyroid WSB/EiJ mice depicted no hippocampal neuroinflammatory response and were able to maintain their hippocampal thyroid signalling despite low circulating TH levels. In contrast, C57BL/6J mice exhibited disturbed hippocampal TH signalling, accompanied by neuroinflammation and memory impairment. Our results reinforce the preponderance of local TH levels over circulating levels and the major role of hippocampal glia reactivity in the establishment of memory deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unmasking hidden changes in intrinsic properties in neurons that coordinate oscillatory networks</a></h4>

              
                Neurons utilize gain control to efficiently encode shifting inputs with maximum sensitivity. While gain control is present in a multitude of neurons, research on the underlying mechanisms is still sparse. We focused on one coordinating neuron (ASCE) in the crayfish swimmeret system that is both necessary and sufficient to coordinate distributed motor circuits. This neuron encodes properties of the motor activity in its home ganglion and sends the information as burst of spikes to its anterior target ganglia. Previous research has shown that ASCE encodes the strength of the motor activity by its spike number, and that the range of the number of spikes per burst adapts to the average motor activity. In turn, the motor activity can be activated and modulated via cholinergic pathways. We explored ASCE's response to changing levels of motor system excitation, which was induced with cholinergic agonists, both when the neuron was part of the full swimmeret system's circuit and when it was isolated from the network. The cholinergic agonist carbachol directly depolarized ASCE's membrane potential via nicotinic receptors when the neuron was isolated. In the intact circuit, ASCE's membrane potential did not change but its input resistance decreased. This indicated an additional indirect action of carbachol, presumably via presynaptic central pattern generating neurons at the core of each motor circuit. The balance of direct and indirect effects could allow ASCE to match its spiking range to the system's excitation level.

                Study design and experimental tools are crucial for good quality science, and an important part of it is the choice of control groups to best test the hypothesis. Two of the most common control groups in research are needle prickling without substance injection (Sham) and/or vehicle injection (Saline). Very few studies investigated the behavioral effects of a single intraperitoneal (i.p) Sham and/or single i.p. Saline administration in mice, mostly using adult males. In this study, we investigated if a single i.p. Sham and/or i.p. Saline administration affects female and male prepubertal (4-weeks-old) mice behavior. After Sham or Saline injection, we examined exploratory/motor behavior (open field test; OFT), anxiety-like behavior (elevated plus-maze; EPM), and behavioral despair/depressive-like behavior (forced swimming test; FST). We observed that both Sham prepubertal females and males showed minor behavioral alterations in OFT and EPM, and Saline males showed behavioral alterations in OFT and FST. On the other hand, prepubertal Saline females showed an increase in exploratory behavior, risk assessment/anxiety-like behavior, and behavioral despair/depressive-like behavior. Thus, we observed that the experimental procedures used as control have mild (but not insignificant) consequences in prepubescent mice behavior. However, the consequences of control protocols in prepubescent females are stronger than in males. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the consequences of Sham and Saline protocols in prepubertal mice. This study highlights how important is to include Naive animals (Negative control) together with Sham and/or Vehicle for a better and more honest interpretation of the data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On demand nanoliter sampling probe for collection of brain fluid</a></h4>

              
                Continuous fluidic sampling systems allow collection of brain biomarkers in vivo. Here, we propose a new sampling paradigm, Droplet on Demand (DoD), implemented in a microfabricated neural probe. It allows sampling droplets loaded with molecules from the brain extracellular fluid punctually, without the long transient equilibration periods typical of continuous methods. It uses an accurate fluidic sequence and correct operation is verified by the embedded electrodes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the application of this novel approach in vitro and in vivo, to collect glucose in the brain of mice, with a temporal resolution of 1-2 minutes and without transient regime. Absolute quantification of the glucose level in the samples was performed by direct infusion nanoelectrospray ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (nanoESI-FTMS). By adjusting the diffusion time and the perfusion volume of DoD, the fraction of molecules recovered in the samples can be tuned to mirror the tissue concentration at accurate points in time. This makes quantification of biomarkers in the brain possible within acute experiments of only 20 to 120 minutes. DoD provides a complementary tool to continuous microdialysis and push-pull sampling probes. The advances allowed by DoD will benefit quantitative molecular studies in the brain, namely for molecules involved in volume transmission or for protein aggregates that form in neurodegenerative diseases over long periods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide sensory aberrations in a Parkinson's Disease mouse model revealed by functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with irreparable damage to dopaminergic neurons in brain areas involved in movement. Frequently, a very early symptom of PD involves an impaired sense of smell, while other studies suggest a broader impairment of other sensory modalities. Still, the associated brain-wide mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we harness in vivo functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) at 9.4T to investigate how the olfactory and visual systems are affected in an -Synuclein (Syn) mouse model of PD. We find significant aberrations in fMRI responses along both sensory pathways including decreases in activation extent and in activation amplitude. Deficits in the olfactory system were larger than in the visual pathway, but nevertheless both sensory systems were clearly impacted, suggesting a more overarching mechanism may be involved. To further ensure that the aberrations observed in the fMRI signals were not driven solely by putative vascular deficiency, we quantified c-FOS expression in the olfactory system and found statistically significant decreases in the PD group when compared to age-matched controls. Hence, our findings indicate a neural origin for the observed fMRI aberrations. Our findings thus demonstrate a more global deficiency in sensory systems in the (Syn) mouse model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recalibrating vision-for-action requires years after sight restoration from congenital blindness</a></h4>

              
                Being able to perform goal-directed actions requires predictive, feed-forward control, including a mapping between the visually estimated target locations and the motor commands reaching for them. When the mapping is perturbed, e.g., due to muscle fatigue or optical distortions, we are quickly able to recalibrate the sensorimotor system to update this mapping. Here we investigated whether early visual and visuomotor experience is essential for developing the ability to recalibrate. To this end, we assessed young individuals deprived from vision due to dense congenital bilateral cataracts, who were surgically treated for sight restoration only years after birth. We compared their recalibration performance to such distortion to that of age-matched sighted controls. Their recalibration performance was impaired right after surgery. This finding cannot be explained by their still lower visual acuity, since blurring vision in controls to a matching degree did not lead to comparable behavior. Nevertheless, the recalibration ability of cataract-treated participants improved with experience, matching controls performance after around 2 years from surgery. Thus, the lack of early visual experience affects visuomotor recalibration. However, this ability is not lost but slowly develops after sight restoration, highlighting the importance of sensorimotor experience for brain plasticity late in life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative MRI maps of human neocortex explored using cell type-specific gene expression analysis</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative MRI (qMRI) allows extraction of reproducible and robust parameter maps. However, the connection to underlying biological substrates remains murky, especially in the complex, densely packed cortex. We investigated associations in human neocortex between qMRI parameters and neocortical cell types by comparing the spatial distribution of the qMRI parameters longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*), and magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat) to gene expression from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, then combining this with lists of genes enriched in specific cell types found in the human brain. As qMRI parameters are magnetic field strength-dependent, the analysis was performed on MRI data at 3T and 7T. All qMRI parameters significantly covaried with genes enriched in GABA- and glutamatergic neurons, i.e. they were associated with cytoarchitecture. The qMRI parameters also significantly covaried with the distribution of genes enriched in astrocytes (R2* at 3T, R1 at 7T), endothelial cells (R1 and MTsat at 3T), microglia (R1 and MTsat at 3T, R1 at 7T), and oligodendrocytes (R1 at 7T). These results advance the potential use of qMRI parameters as biomarkers for specific cell types.

     alt="Estrogen receptors observed at extranuclear neuronal sites and in glia in the nucleus accumbens core and shell of the female rat: Evidence for localization to catecholaminergic and GABAergic neurons"/>
<p>This study used electron microscopy to examine the distribution ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core and shell. These receptors are localized, almost exclusively, to extranuclear sites in the NAc. They are observed in all neuronal profiles and in glia, but are most prevalent in presynaptic profiles. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic neurons, and a larger proportion are localized to GABAergic neurons. These results provide a mechanism for the rapid effects of estrogens on dopaminergic transmission in the NAc.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens affect dopamine-dependent diseases/behavior and have rapid effects on dopamine release and receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Low levels of nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ are seen in the NAc, which cannot account for the rapid effects of estrogens in this region. G-protein coupled ER 1 (GPER1) is observed at low levels in the NAc shell, which also likely does not account for the array of estrogens’ effects in this region. Prior studies demonstrated membrane-associated ERs in the dorsal striatum; these experiments extend those findings to the NAc core and shell. Single- and dual-immunolabeling electron microscopy determined whether ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are at extranuclear sites in the NAc core and shell and whether ERα and GPER1 were localized to catecholaminergic or γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons. All three ERs are observed, almost exclusively, at extranuclear sites in the NAc, and similarly distributed in the core and shell. ERα, ERβ, and GPER1 are primarily in axons and axon terminals suggesting that estrogens affect transmission in the NAc via presynaptic mechanisms. About 10% of these receptors are found on glia. A small proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to catecholaminergic terminals, suggesting that binding at these ERs alters release of catecholamines, including dopamine. A larger proportion of ERα and GPER1 are localized to GABAergic dendrites and terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter GABAergic transmission to indirectly affect dopamine transmission in the NAc. Thus, the localization of ERs could account for the rapid effects of estrogen in the NAc.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus has become a significant target of stress research in recent years because of its role in cognitive functioning, neuropathology, and regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Despite the pervasive impact of stress on psychiatric and neurological disease, many of the circuit- and cell-dependent mechanisms giving rise to the limbic regulation of the stress response remain unknown. Hippocampal excitatory neurons generally express high levels of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and are therefore positioned to respond directly to serum glucocorticoids. These neurons are, in turn, regulated by neighboring interneurons, subtypes of which have been shown to respond to stress exposure. However, GR expression among hippocampal interneurons is not well characterized. To determine whether key interneuron populations are direct targets for glucocorticoid action, we used two transgenic mouse lines to label parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneurons. GR immunostaining of labeled interneurons was characterized within the dorsal and ventral dentate hilus, dentate cell body layer, and CA1 and CA3 stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale. While nearly all hippocampal SST+ interneurons expressed GR across all regions, GR labeling of PV+ interneurons showed considerable subregion variability. The percentage of PV+, GR+ cells was highest in the CA3 stratum pyramidale and lowest in the CA1 stratum oriens, with other regions showing intermediate levels of expression. Together, these findings indicate that, under baseline conditions, hippocampal SST+ interneurons are a ubiquitous glucocorticoid target, while only distinct populations of PV+ interneurons are direct targets. This anatomical diversity suggests functional differences in the regulation of stress-dependent hippocampal responses.</p>

     alt="Integrated age-related immunohistological changes occur in human olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb"/>
<p>During human development a complete uninterrupted sheet of neuronal competent mucosa with well demarcated borders comprises the olfactory epithelium (OE) within the superior aspect of the nasal cavity along the septum and lateral wall. The axons of olfactory neurons within the epithelium target glomeruli along the peripheral edges of the olfactory bulb (OB). With advancing age, regions of the OE are disrupted and replaced with respiratory or aneuronal epithelium while the border becomes less defined. A decreasing area of OE occurs with a shift of neuronal density in a more posterior-dorsal direction. Intraepithelial neuromas and subepithelial cysts develop along with a decrease in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Proximally, distortions in olfactory targeting occur within the OB with an overall reduction in synapses in the ventral portion.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory epithelium (OE) is capable of lifelong regeneration due to presence of basal progenitor cells that respond to injury or neuronal loss with increased activity. However, this capability diminishes with advancing age and a decrease in odor perception in older individuals is well established. To characterize changes associated with age in the peripheral olfactory system, an in-depth analysis of the OE and its neuronal projections onto the olfactory bulb (OB) as a function of age was performed. Human olfactory tissue autopsy samples from 36 subjects with an average age of 74.1 years were analyzed. Established cell type-specific antibodies were used to identify OE component cells in whole mucosal sheets and epithelial sections as well as glomeruli and periglomerular structures in OB sections. With age, a reduction in OE area occurs across the mucosa progressing in a posterior-dorsal direction. Deterioration of the olfactory system is accompanied with diminution of neuron-containing OE, mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and OB innervation. On an individual level, the neuronal density within the epithelium appears to predict synapse density within the OB. The innervation of the OB is uneven with higher density at the ventral half that decreases with age as opposed to stable innervation at the dorsal half. Respiratory metaplasia, submucosal cysts, and neuromata, were commonly identified in aged OE. The finding of respiratory metaplasia and aneuronal epithelium with reduction in global basal cells suggests a progression of stem cell quiescence as an underlying pathophysiology of age-related smell loss in humans.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
<p>A gradual loss of olfactory sensory neurons with age in human olfactory epithelium is also reflected in a reduction in glomeruli within the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>This gradual loss of neurons and synaptic connections with age occurs in a specific, spatially inhomogeneous manner.</p>
<p>Decreasing mitotically active olfactory epithelium basal cells may contribute to age-related neuronal decline and smell loss in humans.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Human brain injury elicits accumulation of water within the brain due to a variety of pathophysiological processes. As our understanding of edema emerged two temporally (and cellular) distinct processes were identified, cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. The emergence of both types of edema is reflected by the temporal evolution and is influenced by the underlying pathology (type and extent). However, this two-edema compartment model does not adequately describe the transition between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Hence, a third category has been proposed, termed ionic edema, that is observed in the transition between cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Magnetic resonance neuroimaging of edema today primarily utilizes T2-weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Clinical diagnostics and translational science studies have clearly demonstrated the temporal ability of both T2WI and DWI to monitor edema content and evolution. DWI measures water mobility within the brain reflecting cytotoxic edema. T2WI at later time points when vasogenic edema develops visualizes increased water content in the brain. Clinically relevant imaging modalities, including ultrasound and positron emission tomography, are not typically used to assess edema. In sum, edema imaging is an important cornerstone of clinical diagnostics and translational studies and can guide effective therapeutics manage edema and improve patient outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are common with an estimated 27.1 million cases per year. Approximately 80% of TBIs are categorized as mild TBI (mTBI) based on initial symptom presentation. While in most individuals, symptoms resolve within days to weeks, in some, symptoms become chronic. Advanced neuroimaging has the potential to characterize brain morphometric, microstructural, biochemical, and metabolic abnormalities following mTBI. However, translational studies are needed for the interpretation of neuroimaging findings in humans with respect to the underlying pathophysiological processes, and, ultimately, for developing novel and more targeted treatment options. In this review, we introduce the most commonly used animal models for the study of mTBI. We then summarize the neuroimaging findings in humans and animals after mTBI and, wherever applicable, the translational aspects of studies available today. Finally, we highlight the importance of translational approaches and outline future perspectives in the field of translational neuroimaging in mTBI.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Eating disorders and obesity form a major health problem in Western Society. To be able to provide adequate treatment and prevention, it is necessary to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the development of eating disorders and obesity. Specific brain networks have been shown to be involved in feeding behavior. We therefore hypothesized that functional connectivity in neural networks involved in feeding behavior is dependent on the status of homeostatic energy balance, thus on being hungry or satiated. To test our hypothesis, we measured functional connectivity and amplitudes of neural signals within neural networks in relation to food intake and sucrose tasting in rats. Therefore, 16 male Wistar rats, of which eight were food-restricted and eight were satiated, underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) at 9.4 T. Subsequently, half of these animals underwent a sucrose tasting procedure followed by a second rs-fMRI scan. Functional connectivity and amplitude of low-frequency signal fluctuations were statistically analyzed in a linear mixed model. Although we did not detect a significant effect of food intake on functional connectivity before sucrose tasting, there was a trend toward interaction between group (satiated vs. hungry) and treatment (sucrose tasting). Functional connectivity between feeding-related regions tended to decrease stronger upon sucrose tasting in satiated rats as compared to food-restricted rats. Furthermore, rs-fMRI signal amplitudes decreased stronger upon sucrose tasting in satiated rats, as compared to food-restricted rats. These findings indicate that food intake and sucrose tasting can affect functional network organization, which may explain the specific patterns in feeding behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The new insights into human brain imaging after stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Over the last two decades, developments of human brain stroke imaging have raised several questions about the place of new MRI biomarkers in the acute management of stroke and the prediction of poststroke outcome. Recent studies have demonstrated the main role of perfusion-weighted imaging in the identification of the best cerebral perfusion profile for a better response after reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke. A major issue remains the early prediction of stroke outcome. While voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping emphasized the influence of stroke location, the analysis of the brain parenchyma underpinning the stroke lesion showed the relevance of prestroke cerebral status, including cortical atrophy, white matter integrity, or presence of chronic cortical cerebral microinfarcts. Moreover, besides the evaluation of the visually abnormal brain tissue, the analysis of normal-appearing brain parenchyma using diffusion tensor imaging and magnetization transfer imaging or spectroscopy offered new biomarkers to improve the prediction of the prognosis and new targets to follow in therapeutic trials. The aim of this review was to depict the main new radiological biomarkers reported in the last two decades that will provide a more thorough prediction of functional, motor, and neuropsychological outcome following the stroke. These new developments in neuroimaging might be a cornerstone in the emerging personalized medicine for stroke patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Combining non‐invasive brain stimulation with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural substrates of cognitive aging</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As aging population is increasing, new methodologies to apprehend and enhance the mechanisms related to optimal brain function in advancing age become urgent. This review describes how the combined use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides novel experimental data on the putative neurophysiological mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in cognitive status among older adults, also further illuminating our understanding of theoretical models proposed within the cognitive neuroscience of aging literature. In addition, it explores published evidence of how this combined procedure entails the capacity to modify the activity and connectivity of specific brain networks in older adults, potentially leading to improvements in cognitive function and other measures reflecting mental health status. Although additional research is needed, combining NIBS with fMRI might provide innovative understanding of how fundamental brain plasticity mechanisms operate in advancing age, a knowledge that may be eventually used to refine more individually tailored approaches to promote brain health in aged populations.</p>
