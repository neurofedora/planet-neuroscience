	<p>Emerging research on psychological adjustment during the COVID-19 outbreak has suggested that young people may be particularly vulnerable to increases in negative affect during the pandemic. However, the association between alcohol use in youth and change in negative affect during this unprecedented time is not clear. Using an online survey, this study obtained scores on negative affect (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic), pandemic-related stress, change in drinking frequency, and traits including resilience, impulsivity and anhedonia, from a sample of drinkers and non-drinkers, up to the age of 21. Young drinkers experienced a greater increase in negative affect during the pandemic compared to non-drinkers, and this differential rise in negative affect was mediated by the pandemic-related stress of social isolation. Young drinkers also experienced a decrease in alcohol use during the pandemic, but this was not associated with a change in negative affect. Interestingly, young drinkers with greater resilience and lower anhedonia reported less increase in negative affect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, these results show that the greater increase in negative affect that young drinkers experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to their non-drinking counterparts, was mediated by pandemic-related social isolation. Moreover, greater resilience and lower anhedonia may have served as protective factors for mitigating the social isolation-induced worsening of negative affect in young drinkers during the pandemic. These findings may inform future studies investigating potential indicators of maladaptive affective responses to public health crises in vulnerable adolescent populations.</p>

                The nature of the representational code underlying conceptual knowledge remains a major unsolved problem in cognitive neuroscience. We assessed the extent to which different representational systems contribute to the instantiation of lexical concepts in high-level, heteromodal cortical areas previously associated with semantic cognition. We found that lexical semantic information can...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The action of acetylcholine in the cortex is critical for cognitive functions and cholinergic drugs can improve functions such as attention and working memory. An alternative means of enhancing cholinergic neuromodulation in primates is the intermittent electrical stimulation of the cortical source of acetylcholine, the nucleus basalis (NB) of Meynert. NB stimulation generally increases firing rate of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, however its effects on single neurons are diverse and complex. We sought to understand how NB stimulation affects global measures of neural activity by recording and analyzing local field potentials (LFPs) in monkeys as they performed working memory tasks. NB stimulation primarily decreased power in the alpha frequency range during the delay interval of working memory tasks. The effect was consistent across variants of the task. No consistent modulation in the delay interval of the task was observed in the gamma frequency range, which has previously been implicated in the maintenance of working memory. Our results reveal global effects of cholinergic neuromodulation via deep brain stimulation, an emerging intervention for the improvement of cognitive function.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Approximately 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The disorder is four times more common in males than in females. Zinc deficiency and mutations in <i>SHANK2</i> and <i>SHANK3</i> (members of a family of excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding proteins) are all risk factors that may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. The presence of shankopathies (loss of one copy of the <i>SHANK3</i> gene) can lead to the development of Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS)—a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, poor motor tone, and ASD-like symptoms. We reviewed the relationship between zinc, ASD, and PMDS as well as the effect of zinc supplementation in improving symptoms of ASD and PMDS based on 22 studies published within 6 years (2015–2020). Zinc deficiency (assessed by either dietary intake, blood, hair, or tooth matrix) was shown to be highly prevalent in ASD and PMDS patients as well as in preclinical models of ASD and PMDS. Zinc supplements improved the behavioral deficits in animal models of ASD and PMDS. Clinical trials are still needed to validate the beneficial therapeutic effects of zinc supplements in ASD and PMDS patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prospective cohort study of the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers over clinical variables in children and young people with cancer presenting with fever and neutropenia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Fever during chemotherapy induced neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of the treatment of childhood cancer. Predictions of poor outcome could be enhanced by incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation and reassessment. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted of children under 18 years old, being treated for cancer or a cancer-like condition, who presented with fever (≥ 38.0°C) and neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5*109/L). Clinical features were recorded, along with three experimental inflammatory biomarkers: procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Outcomes included serious medical complications (SMC): any infection related mortality, critical care and organ support, severe sepsis, septic shock, significant microbiologically defined infection, or radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Results Biomarker assessments were undertaken in 43 episodes of fever and neutropenia, from 31 patients aged between four months and 17 years old (median six years): 20 were female and 22 had acute leukaemia. Five episodes of SMC were noted. PCT, IL-6 and IL-8 had poor individual discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.48 to 0.60) and did not add to the value of clinical risk stratification tools. Insufficient data were collected to formally assess the value of repeated assessments. Conclusions Incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation of episodes of fever with neutropenia in childhood does not clearly improve risk stratification. The value of serial assessments requires further investigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Corporate governance and shareholders’ confidence in cooperative corporations: a systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The confidence of Bottom 40 (B40) shareholders is crucial for cooperative corporation’s sustenance within wider corporate governance. An in-depth study on cooperatives is needed, as they play a crucial role in the Malaysian economic system and contribute greatly to the country’s social development. However, in the current landscape, confidence among shareholders is at stake. This study aims to identify the research gap into corporate governance for cooperative corporations  in relation to B40 shareholder confidence, as well as identify current study challenges and develop a conceptual framework for future research. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review, with the use of agency theory to assess shareholders’ confidence. Emerald, ProQuest, InderScience, Scopus and Science Direct were the online databases used in this study to search  five  keyword phrases: corporate governance, confidence, cooperative, agency theory and Bottom 40% (B40) household. Tranfield’s five stages were used to conduct the systematic review. Results: Only 5 of the 324 studies assess shareholders’ confidence in cooperatives, as well as one paper on B40 and two papers on agency theory. Our review presents three major findings. First, research in the context of B40 shareholder’s confidence in cooperative corporations  is limited. Second, the challenges related to shareholders’ confidence in B40 are major issues in the context. Third, research on agency theory in the context of shareholders’ confidence within cooperative corporations and corporate governance is still scant. Conclusions: This review urges the research community to conduct more studies based on the highlighted research gaps.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness and safety profile of mesenchymal stem cell secretome as a treatment for severe cases of COVID-19: a randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and angiogenesis effects that are useful for relieving inflammation, recovery, and protection of lung tissues in COVID-19 patients. Secretome, a secretory product of MSCs, has several advantages over MSCs. We conducted a study to investigate secretomes’ effectiveness and safety profile as a treatment for severe COVID-19.  Methods: A double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between February 2021 and July 2021 in three top COVID-19 referral hospitals in the Greater Jakarta area, Indonesia. Eligible subjects (n=40) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention group (n=20) and a control group (n=20). The primary outcome of this study was the changes in inflammatory markers and the ratio of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory markers. The secondary outcomes of this study included clinical outcome, laboratory outcome, radiological outcome, RT-PCR result conversion, and safety profile of MSC secretome. Results: Our analysis showed that on the 14th day after placebo administration, IL-6 level in the control group was significantly increased [4.110 (2.403–12.820) at baseline to 13.320 (2.958–33.285) on the 14th day after intervention, p=0.017]. The IL-6/IL-10 ratio in the control group was significantly increased (p=0.036) on the 14th day after placebo administration. We also found that most of the subjects who received placebo had high levels of IL-6 and ferritin (p=0.043) on the seventh day after the intervention. However, we found no significant differences in inflammatory marker levels on the seventh day and 14th day after intervention between both groups. There was no adverse event reported. There were no significant differences in the laboratory outcome, radiology outcome, RT-PCR result conversion, and safety profiles between both groups. Conclusions: MSC secretome can control inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 and has a good safety profile. MSC secretome is a promising treatment modality for severe COVID-19.

                Background: In autoimmune vasculitis, autoantibodies to Human Proteinase 3 (PR3), a human serine protease, seems to have a role on the inception of c-ANCA associated vasculitis. The origin of this autoreactive response remains unclear. However, for several autoreactive responses, molecular mimicry between environmental antigens and human proteins is key to trigger autoantibodies and finally autoimmunity manifestations. Considering that PR3 is a serine protease and house dust mite (HDM) group 3 allergens share this biochemical activity, the aim of this study was to identify cross-reactive epitopes between serine proteases from human and mites using an in silico approach. Methods: Multi alignment among amino acid sequences of PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens was performed to explore identity and structural homology. ElliPro and BepiPred in silico tools were used to predict B and T cell epitopes. Consurf tool was used to conduct identification of conserved regions in serine proteases family. Results: PR3 and HDM group 3 allergens shared moderate identity and structural homology (root mean square deviation < 1). One B cell cross reactive epitope among serine proteases was identified (29I, 30V, 31G, 32G, 34E, 36K, 37A, 38L, 39A and 54C) and two T cell epitopes. Conclusions: PR3 have structural homology and share cross reactive epitopes with HDM group 3 allergens.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Career planning courses increase career readiness of graduate and postdoctoral trainees [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Given national calls for intentional career development during graduate and post-graduate scientific training, this study assessed career readiness development within the context of academic career courses. The current study evaluated the effects of academic career courses offered at two institutions that were specifically designed to increase career awareness, interest, and career-related confidence among doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows. Methods: Participants enrolled in a career course at trainees’ respective academic institutions and responded to pre- and post-course surveys (n=32, n=148). The paper offers a thematic analysis of each of the two courses using an individualized learning plan career development framework and describes the results of their respective pretest-posttest evaluations which indicated increases in career readiness. Results: Though the format and content provided in each course varied, participation was associated with increases in career readiness. Participants reported increased career-awareness including a greater familiarity with different types of careers overall. Furthermore, interest in tenure track faculty careers increased in both samples, which may assuage fears that exposure to diverse career pathways could reduce interest in academic careers. Transferrable skills, including career planning and awareness also significantly increased. Course participants reported an increase in the number and type of mentors they interacted with beyond their principal faculty mentor (other faculty, professional PhDs, peers, and administrative staff). Conclusions: Findings provide supporting evidence for the benefits of implementing structured career development efforts during PhD training; even with varying content, delivery methods, and instructor type, both academic career courses led to significant gains in career awareness and readiness. Successful development and delivery of academic career courses, with a focus on career planning skills, suggest that institutions can utilize these and are an effective way to prepare PhDs for their transition from training positions into careers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Meta-analysis reveals an extreme “decline effect” in the impacts of ocean acidification on fish behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeff C. Clements, Josefin Sundin, Timothy D. Clark, Fredrik Jutfelt</p>

Ocean acidification—decreasing oceanic pH resulting from the uptake of excess atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>—has the potential to affect marine life in the future. Among the possible consequences, a series of studies on coral reef fish suggested that the direct effects of acidification on fish behavior may be extreme and have broad ecological ramifications. Recent studies documenting a lack of effect of experimental ocean acidification on fish behavior, however, call this prediction into question. Indeed, the phenomenon of decreasing effect sizes over time is not uncommon and is typically referred to as the “decline effect.” Here, we explore the consistency and robustness of scientific evidence over the past decade regarding direct effects of ocean acidification on fish behavior. Using a systematic review and meta-analysis of 91 studies empirically testing effects of ocean acidification on fish behavior, we provide quantitative evidence that the research to date on this topic is characterized by a decline effect, where large effects in initial studies have all but disappeared in subsequent studies over a decade. The decline effect in this field cannot be explained by 3 likely biological explanations, including increasing proportions of studies examining (1) cold-water species; (2) nonolfactory-associated behaviors; and (3) nonlarval life stages. Furthermore, the vast majority of studies with large effect sizes in this field tend to be characterized by low sample sizes, yet are published in high-impact journals and have a disproportionate influence on the field in terms of citations. We contend that ocean acidification has a negligible direct impact on fish behavior, and we advocate for improved approaches to minimize the potential for a decline effect in future avenues of research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A feature of maternal sleep apnea during gestation causes autism-relevant neuronal and behavioral phenotypes in offspring</a></h4>

Mounting epidemiologic and scientific evidence indicates that many psychiatric disorders originate from a complex interplay between genetics and early life experiences, particularly in the womb. Despite decades of research, our understanding of the precise prenatal and perinatal experiences that increase susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders remains incomplete. Sleep apnea (SA) is increasingly common during pregnancy and is characterized by recurrent partial or complete cessations in breathing during sleep. SA causes pathological drops in blood oxygen levels (intermittent hypoxia, IH), often hundreds of times each night. Although SA is known to cause adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, the long-term consequences of maternal SA during pregnancy on brain-based behavioral outcomes and associated neuronal functioning in the offspring remain unknown. We developed a rat model of maternal SA during pregnancy by exposing dams to IH, a hallmark feature of SA, during gestational days 10 to 21 and investigated the consequences on the offspring’s forebrain synaptic structure, synaptic function, and behavioral phenotypes across multiples stages of development. Our findings represent a rare example of prenatal factors causing sexually dimorphic behavioral phenotypes associated with excessive (rather than reduced) synapse numbers and implicate hyperactivity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in contributing to the behavioral aberrations. These findings have implications for neuropsychiatric disorders typified by superfluous synapse maintenance that are believed to result, at least in part, from largely unknown insults to the maternal environment.

Nature experiences have been linked to mental and physical health. Despite the importance of understanding what determines individual variation in nature experience, the role of genes has been overlooked. Here, using a twin design (TwinsUK, number of individuals = 2,306), we investigate the genetic and environmental contributions to a person’s nature orientation, opportunity (living in less urbanized areas), and different dimensions of nature experience (frequency and duration of public nature space visits and frequency and duration of garden visits). We estimate moderate heritability of nature orientation (46%) and nature experiences (48% for frequency of public nature space visits, 34% for frequency of garden visits, and 38% for duration of garden visits) and show their genetic components partially overlap. We also find that the environmental influences on nature experiences are moderated by the level of urbanization of the home district. Our study demonstrates genetic contributions to individuals’ nature experiences, opening a new dimension for the study of human–nature interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A cortical network processes auditory error signals during human speech production to maintain fluency</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Muge Ozker, Werner Doyle, Orrin Devinsky, Adeen Flinker</p>

Hearing one’s own voice is critical for fluent speech production as it allows for the detection and correction of vocalization errors in real time. This behavior known as the auditory feedback control of speech is impaired in various neurological disorders ranging from stuttering to aphasia; however, the underlying neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. Computational models of speech motor control suggest that, during speech production, the brain uses an efference copy of the motor command to generate an internal estimate of the speech output. When actual feedback differs from this internal estimate, an error signal is generated to correct the internal estimate and update necessary motor commands to produce intended speech. We were able to localize the auditory error signal using electrocorticographic recordings from neurosurgical participants during a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) paradigm. In this task, participants hear their voice with a time delay as they produced words and sentences (similar to an echo on a conference call), which is well known to disrupt fluency by causing slow and stutter-like speech in humans. We observed a significant response enhancement in auditory cortex that scaled with the duration of feedback delay, indicating an auditory speech error signal. Immediately following auditory cortex, dorsal precentral gyrus (dPreCG), a region that has not been implicated in auditory feedback processing before, exhibited a markedly similar response enhancement, suggesting a tight coupling between the 2 regions. Critically, response enhancement in dPreCG occurred only during articulation of long utterances due to a continuous mismatch between produced speech and reafferent feedback. These results suggest that dPreCG plays an essential role in processing auditory error signals during speech production to maintain fluency.

                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was firstly identified in China and has been declared a global pandemic. Several serious extrapulmonary manifestations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection have also been reported and associated with hypercoagulability thrombotic vasculopathy. In addition, cases of Mycobacterium-leprae infection have also been known associated with blood coagulation abnormality. Methods: Here, we report a 56-year-old male with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with concomitant leprosy infection with manifestation of glans penile necrosis, presented to the emergency department with acute penile pain. This case is unique because no occlusion blood flow to the penile was observed in the radiographic imaging. We described the potential pathophysiology in this case through a literature review. Results: The patient received treatment according to the COVID-19 protocol and was given low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy for 4 days. During the follow up, the clinical and functional condition of the penis showed significant improvement. Conclusions: Microthrombus involvement, platelet abnormalities and impaired hemostasis due to SARS-CoV-2 and leprosy co-infection are the hypothesis in this case report.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A STUDY OF CATASTROPHIC HEALTH EXPENDITURES IN INDIA - EVIDENCE FROM NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY DATA: 2014-2018 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background: India is taking steps to provide Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Out-of-pocket (OOP) health care payment is the most important mechanism for health care payment in India. This study aims to investigate the effect of OOP health care payments on catastrophic health expenditures (CHE). Methods: Data from the National Sample Survey Organization, Social Consumption in Health 2014 and 2018 are used to investigate the effect of OOP health expenditure on household welfare in India. Three aspects of catastrophic expenditure were analyzed in this paper: (i) incidence and intensity of ‘catastrophic’ health expenditure, (ii) socioeconomic inequality in catastrophic health expenditures, and (iii) factors affecting catastrophic health expenditures. Results: The odds of incidence and intensity of CHE were higher for the poorer households. Using the logistic regression model, it was observed that the odds of incidence of CHE was higher among the households with at least one child aged less than 5 years, one elderly person, one secondary educated female member, and if at least one member in the household used a private healthcare facility for treatment. The multiple regression model showed that the intensity of CHE was higher among households with members having chronic illness, and if members had higher duration of stay in the hospital. Subsidizing healthcare to the households having elderly members and children is necessary to reduce CHE. Conclusion: Expanding health insurance coverage, increasing coverage limits, and inclusion of coverage for outpatient and preventive services are vital to protect households. Strengthening public primary health infrastructure and setting up a regulatory organization to establish policies and conduct regular audits to ensure that private hospitals do not increase hospitalizations and the duration of stay is necessary.

                Background: Several systemic diseases manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Oral manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) are associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer. Dentists who are unaware of these lesions will possibly miss them. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with LE in a sample of the Egyptian population. Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 189 patients attending the Internal Medicine Department, Rheumatology Clinic in EL Qasr EL Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Every patient was examined clinically after completing a questionnaire. Moreover, patients’ medical records were also evaluated.  The oral manifestations were recorded according to the WHO guide to physical examination of the oral cavity and classified according to their morphologic aspects and localization. Results: Out of 189 patients, there were 182 females (96.3%) and seven males (3.7%). The prevalence of oral lesions in LE patients was 55.6%. The most affected site was the tongue 25.7%. The most common clinical aspect was patches, 53%. About 77.1% of the lesions were asymptomatic.  Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of oral lesions to recognize patients with LE as the WHO considers oral manifestations of LE a widespread state. Also, implementation of oral hygiene measures and treatment to improve patients’ nutritional state and health-related quality of life are recommended.

                Diet and nutrition play a fundamental role not only in human body composition and in physiology, but have also relevant effects on mood, mental well-being and cognitive performance. In particular, the preservation of mental well-being through a healthy lifestyle, including a well-balanced diet and, in case, through the intake of specific food supplements, is of particular relevance in the perspective of global human ageing, as the brain is affected significantly by a persistent presence of stress factors. Due to the increasing burden of mental and neurological disorders and to the universality of food as a modifiable risk factor, even limited improvements in nutritional habits may translate to a considerable rise of well-being and mental health in the global population. Moreover, the use of targeted, well-balanced food supplements aiming to support the mental health and well-being will probably represent a relevant tool in future decades, together with an increased awareness of the importance of nutrition, also considering the COVID-19 pandemic and the related stressful events and limitations we are still experiencing at global level. The aim of this review is to summarize the experimental and clinical data reported in the literature concerning the beneficial effects of a subset of micro- and macronutrients contained both in food and in supplements, namely magnesium, folic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and alpha-tocopherol, on a series of disorders, including stress, anxiety, low sleep quality, and low cognitive performance.

                Harassment on the Internet, particularly on social media such as Twitter, has reached a level where it can, without exaggeration, be characterised as a real-world societal problem in Japan. However, studies on this phenomenon in the Japanese language environment, especially adopting a victim-centric perspective, are rare. In this paper, we incorporated the concept of online harassment and reviewed existing studies about online harassment from Japan and abroad. We then conducted a detailed case analysis of the “flaming” of a female journalist and those who targeted her on Twitter. Based on our analysis, we observed that there were three layers of users who targeted the journalist: influencers, users who responded to the instigation by influencers, and trolls. Each harassed the journalist, but in a different manner. Given Japan’s particular difficulty of imposing domestic regulations on social media companies that are mostly from abroad, we propose and describe possible measures that individuals and their employers should consider taking.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Predictive coding of natural images by V1 firing rates and rhythmic synchronization</a></h4>

              
                Uran, Peter et al. use self-supervised neural networks to quantify stimulus predictability in natural images to investigate the context-dependence of V1 signals. Firing rates decrease with the predictability, specifically of high-level image features. By contrast, γ-synchronization increases with the predictability of low-level features and emerges for low-dimensional, strongly compressible images.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell-type specific responses to associative learning in the primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                The primary motor cortex (M1) is known to be a critical site for movement initiation and motor learning. Surprisingly, it has also been shown to possess reward-related activity, presumably to facilitate reward-based learning of new movements. However, whether reward-related signals are represented among different cell types in M1, and whether their response properties change after cue-reward conditioning remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to monitor the activity of different neuronal cell types in M1 while mice engaged in a classical conditioning task. Our results demonstrate that most of the major neuronal cell types in M1 showed robust but differential responses to both the conditioned cue stimulus (CS) and reward, and their response properties undergo cell-type specific modifications after associative learning. PV-INs' responses became more reliable to the CS, while VIP-INs' responses became more reliable to reward. PNs only showed robust responses to novel reward, and they habituated to it after associative learning. Lastly, SOM-INs' responses emerged and became more reliable to both the CS and reward after conditioning. These observations suggest that cue- and reward-related signals are preferentially represented among different neuronal cell types in M1, and the distinct modifications they undergo during associative learning could be essential in triggering different aspects of local circuit reorganization in M1 during reward-based motor skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Overriding impaired FPR chemotaxis signaling in diabetic neutrophil stimulates infection control in murine diabetic wound</a></h4>

              
                Infection is a major co-morbidity that contributes to impaired healing in diabetic wounds. Although impairments in diabetic neutrophils have been blamed for this co-morbidity, what causes these impairments and whether they can be overcome, remain largely unclear. Diabetic neutrophils, isolated from diabetic individuals, exhibit chemotaxis impairment but this peculiar functional impairment has been largely ignored because it appears to contradict the clinical findings which blame excessive neutrophil influx as a major impediment to healing in chronic diabetic ulcers. Here, we report that exposure to glucose in diabetic range results in impaired chemotaxis signaling through the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) in neutrophils, culminating in reduced chemotaxis and delayed neutrophil trafficking in the wound of <i>Lepr<sup>db</sup></i> (db/db) type 2 diabetic mice, rendering diabetic wound vulnerable to infection. We further show that at least some auxiliary receptors remain functional under diabetic conditions and their engagement by the pro-inflammatory cytokine CCL3, overrides the requirement for FPR signaling and substantially improves infection control by jumpstarting the neutrophil trafficking toward infection, and stimulates healing in diabetic wound. We posit that CCL3 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers if it is applied topically after the surgical debridement process which is intended to reset chronic ulcers into acute fresh wounds.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional visualization of NK Cell-mediated killing of metastatic single tumor cells</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells lyse invading tumor cells to limit metastatic growth in the lung, but how some cancers evade this host protective mechanism to establish a growing lesion is unknown. Here we have combined ultra-sensitive bioluminescence imaging with intravital two-photon microscopy involving genetically-encoded biosensors to examine this question. NK cells eliminated disseminated tumor cells from the lung within 24 hrs of arrival, but not thereafter. Intravital dynamic imaging revealed that 50% of NK-tumor cell encounters lead to tumor cell death in the first 4 hrs after tumor cell arrival, but after 24 hrs of arrival, nearly 100% of the interactions result in the survival of the tumor cell. During this 24 hrs period, the probability of ERK activation in NK cells upon encountering the tumor cells was decreased from 68% to 8%, which correlated with the loss of the activating ligand CD155/PVR/Necl5 from the tumor cell surface. Thus, by quantitatively visualizing the NK-tumor cell interaction at the early stage of metastasis, we have revealed the crucial parameters of NK cell immune surveillance in the lung.

                T cell development in the thymus undergoes the process of differentiation, selective proliferation and survival from CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> double negative (DN) stage to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP) stage prior to the formation of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytolytic T cells ready for circulation. Each developmental stage is tightly regulated by sequentially-operating molecular networks, of which only limited numbers of transcription regulators have been deciphered. Here we identified Zfp335 transcription factor as a new player in the regulatory network controlling thymocyte development in mice. We demonstrate that <i>Zfp335</i> intrinsically controls DN to DP transition, as T cell-specific deficiency in <i>Zfp335</i> leads to a substantial accumulation of DN3 along with reduction of DP, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes. This developmental blockade at DN stage results from the impaired intracellular TCRβ expression as well as increased susceptibility to apoptosis in thymocytes. Transcriptomic and ChIP-seq analyses revealed a direct regulation of transcription factors <i>Bcl6</i> and <i>Rorcβ</i> by Zfp335. Importantly, enhanced expression of TCRβ and <i>Bcl6/Rorc</i> restores the developmental defect during DN3 to DN4 transition and improves thymocytes survival, respectively. These findings identify a critical role of <i>Zfp335</i> in controlling T cell development by maintaining intracellular TCRβ expression-mediated β-selection and independently activating cell survival signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping dopaminergic projections in the human brain with resting-state fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The striatum receives dense dopaminergic projections making it a key region of the dopaminergic system. Its dysfunction has been implicated in various conditions including Parkinson's disease (PD) and substance use disorder. However, the investigation of dopamine-specific functioning in humans is problematic as current MRI approaches are unable to differentiate between dopaminergic and other projections. Here, we demonstrate that 'connectopic mapping' -a novel approach for characterizing fine-grained, overlapping modes of functional connectivity- can be used to map dopaminergic projections in striatum. We applied connectopic mapping to resting-state functional MRI data of the Human Connectome Project (population cohort; <i>N</i>=839) and selected the second-order striatal connectivity mode for further analyses. We first validated its specificity to dopaminergic projections by demonstrating a high spatial correlation (<i>r</i>=0.884) with dopamine transporter availability -a marker of dopaminergic projections- derived from DaT SPECT scans of 209 healthy controls. Next, we obtained the subject-specific second-order modes from 20 controls, and 39 PD patients scanned under placebo and under dopamine replacement therapy (L-DOPA), and show that our proposed dopaminergic marker tracks PD diagnosis, symptom severity and sensitivity to L-DOPA. Finally, across 30 daily alcohol users and 38 daily smokers, we establish strong associations with self-reported alcohol and nicotine use. Our findings provide evidence that the second-order mode of functional connectivity in striatum maps onto dopaminergic projections, tracks inter-individual differences in PD symptom severity and L-DOPA sensitivity, and exhibits strong associations with levels of nicotine and alcohol use, thereby offering a new biomarker for dopamine-related (dys)function in the human brain.

                The outcome of an encounter with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>(<i>Mtb</i>) depends on the pathogen's ability to adapt to the variable immune pressures exerted by the host. Understanding this interplay has proven difficult, largely because experimentally tractable animal models do not recapitulate the heterogeneity of tuberculosis disease. We leveraged the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse panel in conjunction with a library of <i>Mtb</i> mutants to create a resource for associating bacterial genetic requirements with host genetics and immunity. We report that CC strains vary dramatically in their susceptibility to infection and produce qualitatively distinct immune states. Global analysis of <i>Mtb </i>transposon mutant fitness (TnSeq) across the CC panel revealed that many virulence pathways are only required in specific host microenvironments, identifying a large fraction of the pathogen's genome that has been maintained to ensure fitness in a diverse population. Both immunological and bacterial traits can be associated with genetic variants distributed across the mouse genome, making the CC a unique population for identifying specific host-pathogen genetic interactions that influence pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">COVID-19 infection enhances susceptibility to oxidative-stress induced parkinsonism</a></h4>

              
                Background: Viral induction of neurological syndromes has been a concern since parkinsonian-like features were observed in patients diagnosed with encephalitis lethargica subsequent to the 1918 influenza pandemic. Given the similarities in the systemic responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection with those observed after pandemic influenza, there is a question if a similar syndrome of post-encephalic parkinsonism could follow COVID-19 infection. Objectives: To determine if prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 increased sensitivity to a mitochondrial toxin known to induce parkinsonism. Methods: hACE2 mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to induce mild to moderate disease. After 31 days recovery, mice were administered a non-lesion inducing dose of the parkinsonian toxin MPTP. Subsequent neuroinflammation and SNpc dopaminergic neuron loss was determined and compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone. Results: hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP showed no SNpc DA neuron loss following MPTP. In mice infected and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, MPTP induced a 23% or 19% greater loss of SNpc dopaminergic neurons than SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP, respectively (p < 0.05). Examination of microglial activation showed a significant increase in the number of activated microglia in the SARS-CoV-2 + MPTP group compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone. Conclusions: Our observations have important implications for long-term public health, given the number of people that have survived SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for future public policy regarding infection mitigation. However, it will be critical to determine if other agents known to increase risk of PD also have synergistic effects with SARS-CoV-2 and if are abrogated by vaccination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic analysis of aging mouse sciatic nerve reveals early pathways leading to sarcopenia</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sarcopenia, the age-associated decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength, has long been considered a disease of muscle only, but accumulating evidence suggests that sarcopenia could originate from the neural components controlling muscles. To identify early molecular changes in the efferent nerves that may drive sarcopenia initiation, we performed a longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of the sciatic nerve in aging mice. Methods: Sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle were obtained from young adult, middle-aged, old, and sarcopenic (5,18, 21 and 24 months old, respectively) C57BL/6J female mice (n=6 per age group). Sciatic nerve RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment analysis of clusters of genes associated with patterns of gene expression across age groups was performed. Sarcopenia was confirmed with qRT-PCR of previously established markers of sarcopenia onset in gastrocnemius muscle. Results: We detected 33 significant DEGs in sciatic nerve of 18-month-old mice compared to 5-month-old mice (absolute value of fold change > 2; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) which we validated with qRT-PCR of the three top up- and down-regulated genes. Up-regulated genes were associated with circadian rhythm and the AMPK signaling pathway, while down-regulated genes were associated with biosynthesis and metabolic pathways and circadian rhythm. Strikingly, we detected a significant increase in Myog expression (log2 fold change = 18.93, FDR q-value = 1.54x10-12) in sciatic nerve of 18-month-old mice, before up-regulation in muscle was observed. We identified seven clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across groups. Functional enrichment analysis of these clusters revealed biological processes that may be implicated in sarcopenia initiation including extracellular matrix organization and circadian regulation of gene expression. Conclusions: Gene expression changes in mouse peripheral nerve can be detected prior to overt clinical onset of sarcopenia. These early molecular changes we report shed a new light on biological processes that may be implicated in sarcopenia initiation and pathogenesis. Future studies will validate which of the key changes we reported have disease modifying and/or biomarker potential.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of clozapine-N-oxide and compound 21 on sleep in laboratory mice</a></h4>

              
                Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are chemogenetic tools that modulate a targeted cell population using chemical ligands which bind specifically to modified receptors. Despite the common use of DREADDs in neuroscience and sleep research, potential effects of the DREADD actuator clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) on sleep, which could arise from back-metabolism to clozapine or binding to endogenous neurotransmitter receptors, have never been systematically tested. Here we show that intraperitoneal injections of commonly used doses of CNO alter sleep in wild-type male laboratory mice. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to analyse sleep, we found that CNO suppresses rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep, changes EEG spectral power during non-REM (NREM) sleep, and alters sleep architecture in a pattern previously reported for clozapine. Interestingly, we found that the novel DREADD actuator, compound 21 (C21), similarly modulates sleep despite not being able to back convert to clozapine. Our results demonstrate that CNO and C21 can affect the sleep of wild-type mice, which do not express DREADD receptors. This implies that back-metabolism to clozapine is not the sole mechanism underlying side effects of chemogenetic actuators and therefore any chemogenetic experiment should include a DREADD-free control group injected with the same CNO, C21 or newly developed actuator. We suggest that electrophysiological sleep assessment could serve as a sensitive tool to test the biological inertness of novel chemogenetic actuators.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex and age differences in cognitive bias and neural activation in response to cognitive bias</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive symptoms of depression, including negative cognitive bias, are more severe in women than in men. Current treatments to reduce negative cognitive bias are not effective and sex differences in the neural activity underlying cognitive bias may play a role. Here we examined sex and age differences in cognitive bias and functional connectivity in a novel paradigm. Male and female rats underwent an 18-day cognitive bias procedure, in which they learned to discriminate between two contexts (shock paired context A, no-shock paired context B), during either adolescence (postnatal day (PD 40)), young adulthood (PD 100), or middle-age (PD 210). Cognitive bias was measured as freezing behaviour in response to an ambiguous context (context C), with freezing levels akin to the shock paired context coded as negative bias. All animals learned to discriminate between the two contexts, regardless of sex or age. However, adults (young adults, middle-aged) displayed a greater negative cognitive bias compared to adolescents, and middle-aged males had a greater negative cognitive bias than middle-aged females. Females had greater neural activation of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampal regions to the ambiguous context compared to males, and young rats (adolescent, young adults) had greater neural activation in these regions compared to middle-aged rats. Functional connectivity between regions involved in cognitive bias differed by age and sex, and only adult males had negative correlations between the frontal regions and hippocampal regions. These findings highlight the importance of examining age and sex when investigating the underpinnings of negative cognitive bias and lay the groundwork for determining what age- and sex-specific regions to target in future cognitive bias studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociable Roles of FEF Neurons in Initiating Saccades</a></h4>

              
                The frontal eye field (FEF) plays a key role in initiating saccades. To explain how single neurons in this region may enable the initiation of saccades, Jeffery Schall proposed the "variable rate model" (Hanes and Schall, 1996) which assumes that the discharge of a neuron must reach a fixed activation threshold for a saccade to be evoked. However, the validity of this model has been questioned as results from later work testing saccades in different behavioral contexts seemed to require the assumption of variable thresholds. Moreover, even when sticking to the original behavioral context, not all types of frontal eye field neurons seemed to behave according to a variable rate model. In an attempt to reconsider the viability of the variable rate model avoiding limitations of previous research, we studied single neurons recorded from the FEF of two rhesus monkeys while they performed a memory-guided saccade task. We evaluated the degree to which each type of FEF neurons complied with the variable rate model by quantifying how precisely their discharge predicted an imminent saccade based on their immediate presaccadic activity. In addition, we asked whether there might be a hierarchical relation between visuomotor and motor neurons with only the latter responsible for the release of saccades and therefore satisfying the assumption of the variable rate model. We show that decoders trained on single motor neurons' presaccadic activity performed better than decoders trained on visuomotor neurons in predicting an imminent saccade, in line with the assumption of a top position in a putative processing hierarchy. While this position might have suggested significant resilience to perturbation of the visual input to the FEF, we found quite the opposite that motor neurons but not visuomotor neurons were susceptible to perturbation. As a matter of fact, they lost the ability to predict the initiation of a saccade based on their immediate pressacadic discharge rate. Our results support the notion that motor neurons and visuomotor neurons have dissociable functions in information processing for saccades with motor neurons more closely related to saccade initiation, in line with the tenets of the variable rate model. Yet, they also clearly indicate that even these supposedly top layer neurons exhibit an unexpected degree of dependence on afferent input questions the viability of the assumption of a simple processing hierarchy.

                Maintaining a stable estimate of head direction requires both self motion (ideothetic) information and environmental (allothetic) anchoring. In unfamiliar or dark environments ideothetic drive can maintain a rough estimate of heading but is subject to inaccuracy, visual information is required to stabilise the head direction estimate. When learning to associate visual scenes with head angle, animals do not have access to the 'ground truth' of their head direction, and must use egocentrically derived imprecise head direction estimates. We use both discriminative and generative methods of visual processing to learn these associations without extracting explicit landmarks from a natural visual scene, finding all are sufficiently capable at providing corrective signal. Further, we present a spiking continuous attractor model of head direction (SNN), which when driven by ideothetic input is subject to drift. We show that head direction predictions made by the chosen model-free visual learning algorithms can correct for drift, even when trained on a small training set of estimated head angles self-generated by the SNN. We validate this model against experimental work by reproducing cue rotation experiments which demonstrate visual control of the head direction signal.

                Cholesterol is essential for neuronal activity and function. Cholesterol depletion in the plasma membrane impairs synaptic transmission. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol deficiency leads to defects in vesicle fusion remain poorly understood. Here we show that cholesterol is required for Ca2+-dependent fusion using the in-vitro reconstitution of vesicle fusion, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and amperometry to monitor exocytosis in chromaffin cells. Purified native vesicles were crucial for the complete reconstitution of physiological Ca2+-dependent fusion, whereas vesicle-mimicking liposomes failed to reproduce the cholesterol effect. Intriguingly, cholesterol had no effect on membrane insertion of synaptotagmin-1, a Ca2+ sensor for ultrafast fusion. Cholesterol stabilizes local membrane bending induced by synaptotagmin-1 insertion, thereby lowering the energy barrier for Ca2+-dependent fusion to occur. Our data provide evidence that cholesterol depletion abolishes Ca2+-dependent vesicle fusion by disrupting synaptotagmin-1-induced membrane bending, and suggests that cholesterol is a master regulator for Ca2+-dependent fusion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CACNB4 overexpression decreases dendritic spine density in sex-specific manner</a></h4>

              
                The canonical voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) subunit complex is comprised of the 1 subunit, the ion permeable channel, plus three auxiliary subunits: {beta}, 2{delta} and {gamma}. {beta} is the most extensively studied auxiliary subunit and is necessary for proper forward trafficking of the 1 subunit to the plasma membrane. 1 subunits mediate voltage-dependent movement of calcium ions into the cytoplasm of neurons, including at dendritic sites, where increased intracellular calcium initiates signaling cascades that shape structural and functional plasticity of dendritic spines. Genetic studies strongly implicate calcium signaling dysfunction in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia. Dendritic spine density (DSD) is significantly decreased in schizophrenia in primary auditory cortex where DSD is driven by loss of small spines, and small spine loss is associated with increased peptide levels of ALFDFLK found in the VGCC {beta} subunit {beta}4. Overexpessing CACNB4 to increase {beta}4 levels selectively reduced small spine density in cortical neuron cultures. The studies described herein set out to validate this in vitro observation in an intact mammalian system within a neurodevelopmental context. We overexpressed CACNB4 in neurodevelopment and assessed DSD and morphology in cerebral cortex of male and female mice at an adult timpoint. We then characterized {beta} protein levels and {beta}4 protein-protein interactions in male and female mouse cortex. Overexpression selectively reduced small dendritic spine density but this effect was present only in female mice and did not appear to result from estrous stage. Instead, the sex-dependent effect on DSD corresponded to sex differences in the {beta}4 interactome of male versus female mice: the VGCC {beta} subunit {beta}1b was significantly enriched in the {beta}4 interactome of brain tissue of male mice, and thus may have served to mitigate VGCC overexpression-mediated spine loss in male mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of adult neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation by Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (NCAM2)</a></h4>

              
                Adult neurogenesis persists in mammals in the neurogenic zones where newborn neurons are incorporated into existing neuronal circuits. Relevant molecular elements of the neurogenic niches include the family of Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAM), which participate in signal transduction and regulate radial glial progenitor's (RGPs) survival, division and differentiation. The Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (NCAM2) is expressed in brain development and in adult stages, and controls dendrite arborisation and synaptic formation and maintenance during development. Nevertheless, the role of NCAM2 in neurogenesis and lineage progression is not well understood. Here we analyse the functions of NCAM2 in the regulation of RGPs in adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and during corticogenesis, by using different lentiviral-mediated genetic approaches to modulate its expression, both in vivo and in vitro. First, we characterized the expression of NCAM2 among the main actors of the neurogenic process revealing different levels of NCAM2 amid the progression of RGPs and the formation of juvenile neurons. Further, we show that overexpression of NCAM2 arrest infected cells in a RGP-like state, with characteristic morphological, immunocytochemical and electron microscopy features. In contrast, NCAM2 overexpression in embryonic cortical progenitors does not seems to alter cell fate, but causes transient migration deficits. These results reveal a differential role of NCAM2 in the regulation of adult and embryonic RGPs, and specifically, a significant implication of NCAM2 in the regulation and progression of RGPs during adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presenilin and APP regulate synaptic kainate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Kainate receptors (KARs) form a family of ionotropic glutamate receptors which regulate the activity of neuronal networks by both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms. Their implication in pathologies is well documented for epilepsy. The higher prevalence of epileptic symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients questions the role of KARs in AD. Here we investigated whether the synaptic expression and function of KARs was impaired in mouse models of AD. We addressed this question by immunostaining and electrophysiology at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells, in which KARs are abundant and play a prominent physiological role. We observed a decrease of the immunostaining for GluK2 in the stratum lucidum in CA3, and of the amplitude of synaptic currents mediated by GluK2-containing KARs in an amyloid mouse model (APP/PS1) of AD. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was observed in CA3 pyramidal cells with a genetic deletion of either presenilin or APP/APLP2 as well as in organotypic cultures treated with gamma-secretase inhibitors. Finally, the GluK2 protein interacts with full-length and C-terminal fragments of APP. Overall, our data suggest that APP stabilizes KARs at synapses, possibly through a trans-synaptic mechanism, and this interaction is under the control the gamma-secretase proteolytic activity of presenilin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PAX6 LIMITS THE COMPETENCE OF DEVELOPING CEREBRAL CORTICAL CELLS</a></h4>

              
                The development of stable specialized cell types in multicellular organisms relies on mechanisms controlling inductive intercellular signals and the competence of cells to respond to such signals. In developing cerebral cortex, progenitors generate only glutamatergic excitatory neurons despite being exposed to signals with the potential to initiate the production of other neuronal types, suggesting that their competence is limited. Here we tested the hypothesis that this limitation is due to their expression of transcription factor Pax6. We used bulk and single cell RNAseq to show that conditional cortex-specific Pax6 deletion from the onset of cortical neurogenesis allowed some progenitors to generate abnormal lineages resembling those normally found outside the cortex. Analysis of selected gene expression showed that the changes occurred in specific spatiotemporal patterns. We then compared the responses of control and Pax6-deleted cortical cells to in vivo and in vitro manipulations of extracellular signals. We found that Pax6 loss increased cortical progenitors competence to generate inappropriate lineages in response to extracellular factors normally present in developing cortex, including the morphogens Shh and Bmp4. Regional variation in the levels of these factors could explain spatiotemporal patterns of fate change following Pax6 deletion in vivo. We propose that Pax6s main role in developing cortical cells is to minimize the risk of their development being derailed by the potential side-effects of morphogens engaged contemporaneously in other essential functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dendritic compartmentalization of input-specific integration and plasticity rules across cortical development</a></h4>

              
                The modification of synaptic weights is critical for learning, while synaptic stability is required to maintain acquired knowledge. Single neurons have thousands of synapses within their dendritic arbors, and how the weights of specific inputs change across experience is poorly understood. Here we report that dendritic compartments receiving input from different presynaptic populations acquire distinct synaptic plasticity and integration rules across maturation. We find that apical oblique dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in adult mouse primary visual cortex receive direct monosynaptic projections from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), linearly integrate input, and lack synaptic potentiation. In contrast, basal dendrites, which do not receive dLGN input, exhibit NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated supralinear integration and synaptic potentiation. Earlier in development, during thalamic input refinement, oblique and basal dendrites exhibited comparable NMDAR-dependent properties. Oblique dendrites gain mature properties with visual experience, and over the course of maturation, spines on oblique dendrites develop higher AMPA/NMDA ratios relative to basal dendrites. Our results demonstrate that cortical neurons possess dendrite-specific integration and plasticity rules that are set by the activity of their inputs. The linear, non-plastic nature of mature synapses on oblique dendrites may stabilize feedforward sensory processing while synaptic weights in other parts of the dendritic tree remain plastic, facilitating robust yet flexible cortical computation in adults.

	<p>This pilot study aimed to investigate the initial effect of a remotely delivered performance-based client-centered intervention on activity performance and participation among adults in the chronic phase after acquired brain injury (ABI). Sixteen participants living at home with little to no assistance in basic daily activities were allocated into intervention or waitlist control groups. Assessments were conducted at the baseline, after the 3-month intervention/wait period, and at a 3-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were activity performance using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) and participation using the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4). The intervention included weekly videoconferencing sessions using the Cognitive Orientation to Daily Occupational Performance approach (tele-CO-OP). The participants identified five functional goals, of which three were directly addressed. Wilcoxon signed-ranks test results showed no significant improvements in the control group at the end of the 3-month wait period. Pooled data from both groups showed significant improvements in COPM scores for trained and untrained goals following the intervention. Significant improvements were also found in the PQRS and MPAI-4 scores. Improvements were partially maintained at follow-up. Our preliminary results suggest that tele-CO-OP may positively impact the lives of adults after ABI who are coping with long-term disability.</p>

	<p>Early auditory processing (EAP) deficits have been consistently documented in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZ). However, a relationship between EAP and executive attention has not been confirmed in SZ versus healthy controls (HC). The current study aimed to demonstrate that unlike HC, in SZ patients, auditory change-detection event-related potentials (ERPs) are significantly associated with executive working memory (WM) functioning. Additionally, correlational analyses investigated the relationships between patients&amp;amp;rsquo; auditory ERPs, WM performance, and schizophrenia symptom severity scores. We examined verbal WM accuracy associated with &amp;amp;ldquo;executive-control&amp;amp;rdquo; prefrontal cortex mechanisms and EAP ERPs under midline prefrontal electrodes in 12 SZ patients versus 12 demographically matched HC. Mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitudes and latencies in SZ patients were not significantly different from HC, however, their verbal WM performance was significantly impaired versus HC. Importantly, prolonged MMN latencies in the SZ group were correlated with better WM accuracy. In the HC group, WM accuracy was unrelated to MMN latencies. Patients&amp;amp;rsquo; MMN parameters were unrelated to schizophrenia symptom-domain severity. However, patients&amp;amp;rsquo; WM RTs and accuracy were significantly related to illness severity and negative symptom severity, respectively. Therefore, inefficient sensory excitation related to EAP timing may underlie poor executive verbal WM functioning and might indirectly exacerbate the severity of negative symptoms in SZ. Treatments targeting prefrontal cortex dysfunction in schizophrenia are discussed.</p>

                Background: Mass testing and adequate management are essential to terminate the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This testing is due to the possibility of unidentified cases, especially ones without COVID-19 related symptoms. This review aimed to examine the outcome of the existing studies on the ways of identifying COVID-19 cases, and determine the populations at risk, symptom and diagnostic test management of  COVID-19. Methods: The articles reviewed were scientific publications on the PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Scopus databases. The keywords used to obtain the data were COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and case detection, case management or diagnostic test. We applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Population, Intervention, Control and Outcomes (PICO) approaches. Results: A total of 21 articles from 13 countries met the inclusion criteria and were further analyzed qualitatively. However, 62% of the articles used a rapid antibody test for screening rather than a rapid antigen test. According to the rapid antigen test, 51.3% were positive, with men aged above 50 years recording the highest number of cases. Furthermore, 57.1% of patients were symptomatic, while diagnostic tests' sensitivity and specificity increased to 100% in 14 days after the onset. Conclusions:  Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  is recommended by the World Health Organization for detection of COVID-19. Suppose it is unavailable, the rapid antigen test is used as an alternative rather than the rapid antibody test. Diagnosis is expected to be confirmed using the PCR and serological assay to achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19, according to disease progression, gradual rapid tests can be used, such as rapid antigen in an earlier week and antibody tests confirmed by RT–PCR and serological assay in the second week of COVID-19.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Proper somatosensory circuit assembly is critical for processing somatosensory stimuli and for responding accordingly. In comparison to other sensory circuits (e.g., olfactory and visual), somatosensory circuits have unique anatomy and function. However, understanding of somatosensory circuit development lags far behind that of other sensory systems. For example, there are few identified transcription factors required for integration of interneurons into functional somatosensory circuits. Here, as a model, we examine one type of somatosensory interneuron, Even-skipped (Eve) expressing laterally placed interneurons (ELs) of the <I>Drosophila</I> larval nerve cord. Eve is a highly conserved, homeodomain transcription factor known to play a role in cell fate specification and neuronal axon guidance. Because marker genes are often functionally important in the cell types they define, we deleted <I>eve</I> expression specifically from EL interneurons. On the cell biological level, using single neuron labeling, we find <I>eve</I> plays several previously undescribed roles in refinement of neuron morphogenesis. Eve suppresses aberrant neurite branching, promotes axon elongation, and regulates dorsal-ventral dendrite position. On the circuit level, using optogenetics, calcium imaging, and behavioral analysis, we find <I>eve</I> expression is required in EL interneurons for the normal encoding of somatosensory stimuli and for normal mapping of outputs to behavior. We conclude that the <I>eve</I> gene product coordinately regulates multiple aspects of EL interneuron morphogenesis and is critically required to properly integrate EL interneurons into somatosensory circuits. Our data shed light on the genetic regulation of somatosensory circuit assembly.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The aging brain undergoes structural changes even in very healthy individuals. Quantifying these changes could help disentangle pathologic changes from those associated with the normal human aging process. Using longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 227 carefully selected healthy human cohort with age ranging from 50 to 80 years old at baseline scan, we quantified age-related volumetric changes in the brain of healthy human older adults. Longitudinally, the rates of tissue loss in total gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) were 2497.5 and 2579.8 mm<sup>3</sup> per year, respectively. Across the whole brain, the rates of GM decline varied with regions in the frontal and parietal lobes having faster rates of decline, whereas some regions in the occipital and temporal lobes appeared relatively preserved. In contrast, cross-sectional changes were mainly observed in the temporal-occipital regions. Similar longitudinal atrophic changes were also observed in subcortical regions including thalamus, hippocampus, putamen, and caudate, whereas the pallidum showed an increasing volume with age. Overall, regions maturing late in development (frontal, parietal) are more vulnerable to longitudinal decline, whereas those that fully mature in the early stage (temporal, occipital) are mainly affected by cross-sectional changes in healthy older cohort. This may suggest that, for a successful healthy aging, the former needs to be maximally developed at an earlier age to compensate for the longitudinal decline later in life and the latter to remain relatively preserved even in old age, consistent with both concepts of reserve and brain maintenance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Local Connections of Pyramidal Neurons to Parvalbumin-Producing Interneurons in Motor-Associated Cortical Areas of Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Parvalbumin (PV)-producing neurons are the largest subpopulation of cortical GABAergic interneurons, which mediate lateral, feedforward, and feedback inhibition in local circuits and modulate the activity of pyramidal neurons. Clarifying the specific connectivity between pyramidal and PV neurons is essential for understanding the role of PV neurons in local circuits. In the present study, we visualized somas and dendrites of PV neurons using transgenic mice in which PV neurons specifically express membrane-targeted GFP, and intracellularly labeled local axons of 26 pyramidal neurons in layers 2&ndash;6 in acute slices of the motor-associated cortex from transgenic mice. We mapped morphologically distribution of inputs from a pyramidal neuron to PV neurons based on contact sites (appositions) between the axons from an intracellularly filled pyramidal neuron and the dendrites of PV neurons. Layer 6 corticothalamic (CT)-like pyramidal neurons formed appositions to PV neurons at a significantly higher rate than other pyramidal neurons. The percentage of apposed varicosities to all the labeled varicosities of layer 6 CT-like neurons was 28%, and that of the other pyramidal neurons was 12&ndash;19%. Layer 6 CT-like neurons preferentially formed appositions with PV neurons in layers 5b&ndash;6, while other pyramidal neurons uniformly formed appositions with PV neurons in all layers. Furthermore, both layer 6 CT-like and corticocortical-like neurons more frequently formed compound appositions, where two or more appositions were located on a dendritic branch, than other pyramidal neurons. Layer 6 CT neurons may contribute to intracortical information processing through preferential connections with PV neurons in layers 5b&ndash;6.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chemical Signaling Regulates Axon Regeneration via the GPCR-Gq{alpha} Pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemical communication controls a wide range of behaviors via conserved signaling networks. Axon regeneration in response to injury is determined by the interaction between the extracellular environment and intrinsic growth potential. In this study, we investigated the role of chemical signaling in axon regeneration in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>. We find that the enzymes involved in ascaroside pheromone biosynthesis, ACOX-1.1, ACOX-1.2, and DAF-22, participate in axon regeneration by producing a dauer-inducing ascaroside, ascr#5. We demonstrate that the chemoreceptor genes, <I>srg-36</I> and <I>srg-37</I>, which encode G-protein-coupled receptors for ascr#5, are required for adult-specific axon regeneration. Furthermore, the activating mutation in <I>egl-30</I> encoding Gq&alpha; suppresses axon regeneration defective phenotype in <I>acox-1.1</I> and <I>srg-36 srg-37</I> mutants. Therefore, the ascaroside signaling system provides a unique example of a signaling molecule that regulates the regenerative pathway in the nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>, axon regeneration is positively regulated by the EGL-30 Gq&alpha;&ndash;JNK MAP kinase cascade. However, it remains unclear what signals activate the EGL-30 pathway in axon regeneration. Here, we show that SRG-36 and SRG-37 act as upstream G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate EGL-30. <I>C. elegans</I> secretes a family of small-molecule pheromones called ascarosides, which serve various functions in chemical signaling. SRG-36 and SRG-37 are GPCRs for the dauer-inducing ascaroside ascr#5. Consistent with this, we found that ascr#5 activates the axon regeneration pathway via SRG-36/SRG-37 and EGL-30. Thus, ascaroside signaling promotes axon regeneration by activating the GPCR&ndash;Gq&alpha; pathway.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Regulation of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Internalization and Synaptic AMPA Receptor Endocytosis by the Postsynaptic Protein Norbin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Group I mGluRs have diverse functions in some fundamental neuronal processes, including modulation of synaptic plasticity; and dysregulation of these receptors could lead to various neuropsychiatric disorders. Trafficking of Group I mGluRs plays critical roles in controlling the precise spatiotemporal localization and activity of these receptors, both of which contribute to proper downstream signaling. Using "molecular replacement" approach in hippocampal neurons derived from mice of both sexes, we demonstrate a critical role for the postsynaptic density protein Norbin in regulating the ligand-induced internalization of Group I mGluRs. We show that Norbin associates with protein kinase A (PKA) through its N-terminus and anchors mGluR5 through its C-terminus, both of which are necessary for the ligand-mediated endocytosis of mGluR5, a member of the Group I mGluR family. A point mutation (A687G) at the C-terminus of Norbin inhibits the binding of Norbin to mGluR5 and blocks mGluR5 endocytosis. Finally, we demonstrate an important mechanism by which Norbin regulates mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis in hippocampal neurons, a cellular correlate for mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity. Norbin, through its PKA-binding regions, recruits PKA to AMPARs on activation of mGluRs; and deletion of the PKA-binding regions of Norbin inhibits mGluR-triggered AMPAR endocytosis. We further report that Norbin is important specifically for the mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis, but not for NMDAR-dependent AMPAR endocytosis. Thus, this study unravels a novel role for Norbin in the internalization of mGluRs and mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis that can have clinical relevance to the function of Group I mGluRs in pathologic processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The postsynaptic protein Norbin interacts with mGluR5, and both of them have been implicated in disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, the mechanistic basis underlying the regulation of mGluRs by Norbin remains elusive. We have identified Norbin as an essential mediator of ligand-mediated endocytosis of Group I mGluRs. Mechanistically, Norbin N-terminus associates with protein kinase-A (PKA) and C-terminus binds to mGluR5 to coordinate receptor internalization. A point mutation NorA687G inhibits endocytosis by disrupting this interaction. Additionally, Norbin is critical for the recruitment of PKA to AMPARs on activation of Group I mGluRs that assists in mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis. Thus, Norbin has a dual function in the hippocampus: regulation of mGluR internalization and PKA-dependent modulation of mGluR-mediated AMPAR endocytosis, a prerequisite for mGluR-mediated synaptic plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Involvement of Denervated Midbrain-Derived Factors in the Formation of Ectopic Cortico-Mesencephalic Projection after Hemispherectomy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal remodeling after brain injury is essential for functional recovery. After unilateral cortical lesion, axons from the intact cortex ectopically project to the denervated midbrain, but the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined gene expression profiles in denervated and intact mouse midbrains after hemispherectomy at early developmental stages using mice of either sex, when ectopic contralateral projection occurs robustly. The analysis showed that various axon growth-related genes were upregulated in the denervated midbrain, and most of these genes are reportedly expressed by glial cells. To identify the underlying molecules, the receptors for candidate upregulated molecules were knocked out in layer 5 projection neurons in the intact cortex, using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated method, and axonal projection from the knocked-out cortical neurons was examined after hemispherectomy. We found that the ectopic projection was significantly reduced when integrin subunit &beta; three or neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (also known as TrkB) was knocked out. Overall, the present study suggests that denervated midbrain-derived glial factors contribute to lesion-induced remodeling of the cortico-mesencephalic projection via these receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> After brain injury, compensatory neural circuits are established that contribute to functional recovery. However, little is known about the intrinsic mechanism that underlies the injury-induced remodeling. We found that after unilateral cortical ablation expression of axon-growth promoting factors is elevated in the denervated midbrain and is involved in the formation of ectopic axonal projection from the intact cortex. Evidence further demonstrated that these factors are expressed by astrocytes and microglia, which are activated in the denervated midbrain. Thus, our present study provides a new insight into the mechanism of lesion-induced axonal remodeling and further therapeutic strategies after brain injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Robo2 Drives Target-Selective Peripheral Nerve Regeneration in Response to Glia-Derived Signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral nerves are divided into multiple branches leading to divergent synaptic targets. This poses a remarkable challenge for regenerating axons as they select their original trajectory at nerve branch-points. Despite implications for functional regeneration, the molecular mechanisms underlying target selectivity are not well characterized. <I>Danio Rerio</I> (zebrafish) motor nerves are composed of a ventral and a dorsal branch that diverge at a choice-point, and we have previously shown that regenerating axons faithfully select their original branch and targets. Here we identify <I>robo2</I> as a key regulator of target-selective regeneration (sex of experimental subjects unknown). We demonstrate that <I>robo2</I> function in regenerating axons is required and sufficient to drive target-selective regeneration, and that <I>robo2</I> acts in response to glia located precisely where regenerating axons select the branch-specific trajectory to prevent and correct axonal errors. Combined, our results reveal a glia-derived mechanism that acts locally via axonal <I>robo2</I> to promote target-selective regeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite its relevance for functional recovery, the molecular mechanisms that direct regenerating peripheral nerve axons toward their original targets are not well defined. Zebrafish spinal motor nerves are composed of a dorsal and a ventral branch that diverge at a stereotyped nerve branch-point, providing a unique opportunity to decipher the molecular mechanisms critical for target-selective regeneration. Using a combination of live cell imaging and molecular-genetic manipulations, we demonstrate that the <I>robo2</I> guidance receptor is necessary and sufficient to promote target-selective regeneration. Moreover, we demonstrate that <I>robo2</I> is part of a genetic pathway that generates transient, spatially restricted, and tightly coordinated signaling events that direct axons of the dorsal nerve branch toward their original, pre-injury targets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distributed and Localized Dynamics Emerge in the Mouse Neocortex during Reach-to-Grasp Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>A long-standing question in systems neuroscience is to what extent task-relevant features of neocortical processing are localized or distributed. Coordinated activity across the neocortex has been recently shown to drive complex behavior in the mouse, while activity in selected areas is canonically associated with specific functions (e.g., movements in the case of the motor cortex). Reach-to-grasp (RtG) movements are known to be dependent on motor circuits of the neocortex; however, the global activity of the neocortex during these movements has been largely unexplored in the mouse. Here, we characterized, using wide-field calcium imaging, these neocortex-wide dynamics in mice of either sex engaging in an RtG task. We demonstrate that, beyond motor regions, several areas, such as the visual and the retrosplenial cortices, also increase their activity levels during successful RtGs, and homologous regions across the ipsilateral hemisphere are also involved. Functional connectivity among neocortical areas increases transiently around movement onset and decreases during movement. Despite this global phenomenon, neural activity levels correlate with kinematics measures of successful RtGs in sensorimotor areas only. Our findings establish that distributed and localized neocortical dynamics co-orchestrate efficient control of complex movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mammals rely on reaching and grasping movements for fine-scale interactions with the physical world. In the mouse, the motor cortex is critical for the execution of such behavior, yet little is known about the activity patterns across neocortical areas. Using the mesoscale-level networks as a model of cortical processing, we investigated the hypothesis that areas beyond the motor regions could participate in RtG planning and execution, and indeed a large network of areas is involved while performing RtGs. Movement kinematics correlates mostly with neural activity in sensorimotor areas. By demonstrating that distributed and localized neocortical dynamics for the execution of fine movements coexist in the mouse neocortex during RtG, we offer an unprecedented view on the neocortical correlates of mammalian motor control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brainstem Circuits Triggering Saccades and Fixation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Omnipause neurons (OPNs) in the nucleus raphe interpositus have tonic activity while the eyes are stationary ("fixation") but stop firing immediately before and during saccades. To locate the source of suppression, we analyzed synaptic inputs from the rostral and caudal superior colliculi (SCs) to OPNs by using intracellular recording and staining, and investigated pathways transmitting the inputs in anesthetized cats of both sexes. Electrophysiologically or morphologically identified OPNs received monosynaptic excitation from the rostral SCs with contralateral dominance, and received disynaptic inhibition from the caudal SCs with ipsilateral dominance. Cutting the tectoreticular tract transversely between the contralateral OPN and inhibitory burst neuron (IBN) regions eliminated inhibition from the caudal SCs, but not excitation from the rostral SCs in OPNs. In contrast, a midline section between IBN regions eliminated disynaptic inhibition in OPNs from the caudal SCs but did not affect the monosynaptic excitation from the rostral SCs. Stimulation of the contralateral IBN region evoked monosynaptic inhibition in OPNs, which was facilitated by preconditioning SC stimulation. Three-dimensional reconstruction of HRP-stained cells revealed that individual OPNs have axons that terminate in the opposite IBN area, while individual IBNs have axon collaterals to the opposite OPN area. These results show that there are differences in the neural circuit from the rostral and caudal SCs to the brainstem premotor circuitry and that IBNs suppress OPNs immediately before and during saccades. Thus, the IBNs, which are activated by caudal SC saccade neurons, shut down OPN firing and help to trigger saccades and suppress ("latch") OPN activity during saccades.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Saccades are the fastest eye movements to redirect gaze to an object of interest and bring its image on the fovea for fixation. Burst neurons (BNs) and omnipause neurons (OPNs) which behave reciprocally in the brainstem, are important for saccade generation and fixation. This study investigated unsolved important questions about where these neurons receive command signals and how they interact for initiating saccades from visual fixation. The results show that the rostral superior colliculi (SCs) excite OPNs monosynaptically for fixation, whereas the caudal SCs monosynaptically excite inhibitory BNs, which then directly inhibit OPNs for the initiation of saccades. This inhibition from the caudal SCs may account for the omnipause behavior of OPNs for initiation and maintenance of saccades in all directions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Taste Bud Connectome: Implications for Taste Information Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Taste buds contain multiple cell types, two of which mediate transduction of specific taste qualities: Type III cells transduce sour while Type II cells transduce either sweet, or bitter or umami. In order to discern the degree of interaction between different cell types and specificity of connectivity with the afferent nerve fibers (NFs), we employed serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (sbfSEM) through five circumvallate mouse taste buds. Points of contact between Type II and Type III cells are rare and lack morphologically identifiable synapses, suggesting that interaction between these cell types does not occur via synapses. Of the 127 NFs that make synaptic contacts with taste cells in the sampling volume, ~70% (<I>n</I> = 91) synapse with only one taste cell while 32 fibers synapse exclusively with multiple Type II cells or multiple Type III cells. Our data do not rule out multimodal fibers innervating Type II cells of separate taste qualities. Notably, four fibers (~3%) synapse with both Type II and Type III cells, forming both mitochondrial and vesicular synapses on the different cell types. Since Type II and Type III cells transduce different taste qualities, these dual connected fibers are not consistent with a absolute labeled-line encoding system. Further, our data reveal considerable variation in both the number of synapses per cell/nerve pair and the number of innervating NFs per taste cell, both of which likely have consequences for encoding taste quality and concentration. Finally, we identify a subset of Type II cells which may represent an immature stage.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Taste buds, the sensory end organs for the sense of taste, contain multiple types of sensory cells, with each responding to one of the primary tastes: salt, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. In order to determine the degree of interaction between cell types and specificity of connectivity to afferent nerves, we employed serial blockface electron microscopy (EM) of mouse circumvallate taste buds. We find no synapses between cell types within the taste bud suggesting that any interactions are indirect. While the majority of nerve fibers (NFs) connect to a single type of taste cell, 3.1% of the fibers branch to receive input from taste cells of different specificities. Thus, taste cannot entirely be carried along NFs dedicated to single taste qualities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Threat and Bidirectional Valence Signaling in the Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

              
                <p>Appropriate responding to threat and reward is essential to survival. The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is known to support and organize reward behavior. The NAcc is also necessary to fully discriminate threat and safety cues. To directly reveal NAcc threat firing, we recorded single-unit activity from seven female rats undergoing pavlovian fear discrimination. Rats fully discriminated danger, uncertainty, and safety cues, and most NAcc neurons showed the greatest firing change to danger and uncertainty. Heterogeneity in cue and reward firing led us to identify distinct functional populations. One NAcc population signaled threat, specifically decreasing firing to danger and uncertainty cues. A separate population signaled Bidirectional Valence, decreasing firing to the danger cue (negative valence), but increasing firing to reward (positive valence). The results reveal the NAcc to be a source of threat information and a more general valence hub.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is synonymous with reward. Yet, anatomy, neurotoxic lesions, and optogenetic manipulation implicate the NAcc in threat. Here, we directly revealed NAcc threat firing by recording single-unit activity during multicue fear discrimination. Most cue-responsive NAcc neurons markedly altered firing to threat cues. Finer analyses revealed a NAcc population signaling threat, specifically decreasing firing to danger and uncertainty cues; and a NAcc population signaling Bidirectional Valence, increasing firing to reward but decreasing firing to the danger cue. The results reveal the NAcc to be a source of threat information and a valence hub.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Corticostriatal Suppression of Appetitive Pavlovian Conditioned Responding</a></h4>

              
                <p>The capacity to suppress learned responses is essential for animals to adapt in dynamic environments. Extinction is a process by which animals learn to suppress conditioned responding when an expected outcome is omitted. The infralimbic (IL) cortex to nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) neural circuit is implicated in suppressing conditioned responding after extinction, especially in the context of operant cocaine-seeking behavior. However, the role of the IL-to-NAcS neural circuit in the extinction of responding to appetitive Pavlovian cues is unknown, and the psychological mechanisms involved in response suppression following extinction are unclear. We trained male Long Evans rats to associate a 10 s auditory conditioned stimulus (CS; 14 trials per session) with a sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.2 ml per CS) in a specific context, and then following extinction in a different context, precipitated a renewal of CS responding by presenting the CS alone in the original Pavlovian conditioning context. Unilateral, optogenetic stimulation of the IL-to-NAcS circuit selectively during CS trials suppressed renewal. In a separate experiment, IL-to-NAcS stimulation suppressed CS responding regardless of prior extinction and impaired extinction retrieval. Finally, IL-to-NAcS stimulation during the CS did not suppress the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioning but was required for the subsequent expression of CS responding. These results are consistent with multiple studies showing that the IL-to-NAcS neural circuit is involved in the suppression of operant cocaine-seeking, extending these findings to appetitive Pavlovian cues. The suppression of appetitive Pavlovian responding following IL-to-NAcS circuit stimulation, however, does not appear to be an extinction-dependent process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Extinction is a form of inhibitory learning through which animals learn to suppress conditioned responding in the face of nonreinforcement. We investigated the role of the IL cortex inputs to the NAcS in the extinction of responding to appetitive Pavlovian cues and the psychological mechanisms involved in response suppression following extinction. Using <I>in vivo</I> optogenetics, we found that stimulating the IL-to-NAcS neural circuit suppressed context-induced renewal of conditioned responding after extinction. In a separate experiment, stimulating the IL-to-NAcS circuit suppressed conditioned responding in an extinction-independent manner. These findings can be used by future research aimed at understanding how corticostriatal circuits contribute to behavioral flexibility and mental disorders that involve the suppression of learned behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Working Memory for Spatial Sequences: Developmental and Evolutionary Factors in Encoding Ordinal and Relational Structures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sequence learning is a ubiquitous facet of human and animal cognition. Here, using a common sequence reproduction task, we investigated whether and how the ordinal and relational structures linking consecutive elements are acquired by human adults, children, and macaque monkeys. While children and monkeys exhibited significantly lower precision than adults for spatial location and temporal order information, only monkeys appeared to exceedingly focus on the first item. Most importantly, only humans, regardless of age, spontaneously extracted the spatial relations between consecutive items and used a chunking strategy to compress sequences in working memory. Monkeys did not detect such relational structures, even after extensive training. Monkey behavior was captured by a conjunctive coding model, whereas a chunk-based conjunctive model explained more variance in humans. These age- and species-related differences are indicative of developmental and evolutionary mechanisms of sequence encoding and may provide novel insights into the uniquely human cognitive capacities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sequence learning, the ability to encode the order of discrete elements and their relationships presented within a sequence, is a ubiquitous facet of cognition among humans and animals. By exploring sequence-processing abilities at different human developmental stages and in nonhuman primates, we found that only humans, regardless of age, spontaneously extracted the spatial relations between consecutive items and used an internal language to compress sequences in working memory. The findings provided insights into understanding the origins of sequence capabilities in humans and how they evolve through development to identify the unique aspects of human cognitive capacity, which includes the comprehension, learning, and production of sequences, and perhaps, above all, language processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Category-Biased Neural Representations Form Spontaneously during Learning That Emphasizes Memory for Specific Instances</a></h4>

              
                <p>Category learning, learning to sort a set of stimuli into categories or groups, can induce category biases in perception such that items in the same category are perceived as more similar than items from different categories. To what degree category bias develops when learning goals emphasize individuation of each stimulus and whether the bias emerges spontaneously during learning itself rather than in response to task demands is unclear. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) during encoding to test for category biases in neural representations of individual stimuli during learning. Human participants (males and females) encountered face-blend stimuli with unique first names and shared family names that indicated category membership. Participants were instructed to learn the full name for each face. Neural pattern classification and pattern similarity analyses were used to track category information in the brain. Results showed that stimulus category could be decoded during encoding across many frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. Furthermore, two stimuli from the same category were represented more similarly in the prefrontal cortex than two stimuli from different categories equated for physical similarity. These findings illustrate that a mere presence of category label can bias neural representations spontaneously during encoding to emphasize category-relevant information, even in the absence of explicit categorization demands and when category-irrelevant information remains relevant for task goals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Entities belonging to the same category are perceived as being more similar than entities belonging to different categories. Here, we show that neural representations highlighting category-relevant information form spontaneously during encoding. Notably, the presence of a category label led to neural category bias although participants focused on remembering individual stimuli and category-irrelevant stimulus features remained important for explicit task goals. These results may inform our understanding of bias in general and suggest that bias may emerge when category information is present even when one's explicit focus is on individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Contribution of Granular and Agranular Subdivisions of the Retrosplenial Cortex to Remote Contextual Fear Memory Retrieval</a></h4>

              
                <p>The retrieval of recent and remote memories are thought to rely on distinct brain circuits and mechanisms. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is robustly activated during the retrieval of remotely acquired contextual fear memories (CFMs), but the contribution of particular subdivisions [granular (RSG) vs agranular retrosplenial area (RSA)] and the circuit mechanisms through which they interact to retrieve remote memories remain unexplored. In this study, using both anterograde and retrograde viral tracing approaches, we identified excitatory projections from layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the RSG to the CA1 stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare of the dorsal hippocampus and the superficial layers of the RSA in male mice. We found that chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of the RSG-to-CA1, but not the RSG-to-RSA, pathway selectively impairs the retrieval of remote CFMs. Collectively, our results uncover a specific role for the RSG in remote CFM recall and provide circuit evidence that RSG-mediated remote CFM retrieval relies on direct RSG-to-CA1 connectivity. The present study provides a better understanding of brain circuit mechanisms underlying the retrieval of remote CFMs and may help guide the development of therapeutic strategies to attenuate remote traumatic memories that lead to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The RSC is implicated in contextual information processing and remote recall. However, how different subdivisions of the RSC and circuit mechanisms through which they interact to underlie remote memory recall remain unexplored. This study shows that granular subdivision of the RSC and its input to hippocampal area CA1 contributes to the retrieval of remote contextual fear memories. Our results support the hypothesis that the RSC and hippocampus require each other to preserve fear memories and may provide a novel therapeutic avenue to attenuate remote traumatic memories in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reliability of Neural Entrainment in the Human Auditory System</a></h4>

              
                <p>Auditory stimuli are often rhythmic in nature. Brain activity synchronizes with auditory rhythms via neural entrainment, and entrainment seems to be beneficial for auditory perception. However, it is not clear to what extent neural entrainment in the auditory system is reliable over time, which is a necessary prerequisite for targeted intervention. The current study aimed to establish the reliability of neural entrainment over time and to predict individual differences in auditory perception from associated neural activity. Across two different sessions, human listeners (21 females, 17 males) detected silent gaps presented at different phase locations of a 2 Hz frequency-modulated (FM) noise while EEG activity was recorded. As expected, neural activity was entrained by the 2 Hz FM noise. Moreover, gap detection was sinusoidally modulated by the phase of the 2 Hz FM into which the gap fell. Critically, both the strength of neural entrainment as well as the modulation of performance by the stimulus rhythm were highly reliable over sessions. Moreover, gap detection was predictable from pregap neural 2 Hz phase and alpha amplitude. Our results demonstrate that neural entrainment in the auditory system and the resulting behavioral modulation are reliable over time, and both entrained delta and nonentrained alpha oscillatory activity contribute to near-threshold stimulus perception. The latter suggests that improving auditory perception might require simultaneously targeting entrained brain rhythms as well as the alpha rhythm.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural activity synchronizes to the rhythms in sounds via neural entrainment, which seems to be important for successful auditory perception. A natural hypothesis is that improving neural entrainment, for example, via brain stimulation, should benefit perception. However, the extent to which neural entrainment is reliable over time, a necessary prerequisite for targeted intervention, has not been established. Using electroencephalogram recordings, we demonstrate that both neural entrainment to FM sounds and stimulus-induced behavioral modulation are reliable over time. Moreover, moment-by-moment fluctuations in perception are best predicted by entrained delta phase and nonentrained alpha amplitude. This work suggests that improving auditory perception might require simultaneously targeting entrained brain rhythms as well as the alpha rhythm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Progressions of Neuronal Activity Changes Underlie the Formation and Consolidation of a Gustatory Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Acquiring new memories is a multistage process. Numerous studies have convincingly demonstrated that initially acquired memories are labile and are stabilized only by later consolidation processes. These multiple phases of memory formation are known to involve modification of both cellular excitability and synaptic connectivity, which in turn change neuronal activity at both the single neuron and ensemble levels. However, the specific mapping between the known phases of memory and the changes in neuronal activity at different organizational levels&mdash;the single-neuron, population representations, and ensemble-state dynamics&mdash;remains unknown. Here we address this issue in the context of conditioned taste aversion learning by continuously tracking gustatory cortex neuronal taste responses in alert male and female rats during the 24 h following a taste&ndash;malaise pairing. We found that the progression of activity changes depends on the neuronal organizational level: whereas the population response changed continuously, the population mean response amplitude and the number of taste-responsive neurons only increased during the acquisition and consolidation phases. In addition, the known quickening of the ensemble-state dynamics associated with the faster rejection of harmful foods appeared only after consolidation. Overall, these results demonstrate how complex dynamics in the different representational levels of cortical activity underlie the formation and stabilization of memory within the cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memory formation is a multiphased process; early acquired memories are labile and consolidate to their stable forms over hours and days. The progression of memory is assumed to be supported by changes in neuronal activity, but the mapping between memory phases and neuronal activity changes remains elusive. Here we tracked cortical neuronal activity over 24 h as rats acquired and consolidated a taste&ndash;malaise association memory, and found specific differences between the progression at the single-neuron and populations levels. These results demonstrate how balanced changes on the single-neuron level lead to changes in the network-level representation and dynamics required for the stabilization of memories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Genetic Reduction of Mitochondria Complex I Subunits is Protective against Cisplatin-Induced Neurotoxicity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent side effect of widely used platinum-based anticancer agents. There are few predictable risk factors with which to identify susceptible patients. Effective preventive measures or treatments are not available. Here, we have used a model of CIPN in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> to identify genetic changes that confer resistance to cisplatin-induced neuronal damage but not in the rapidly dividing cells of the ovary. The <I>Drosophila</I> strain <I>attP40</I>, used as a genetic background for the creation of RNAi lines, is resistant to cisplatin damage compared with the similar <I>attP2</I> background strain. <I>attP40</I> flies have reduced mRNA expression of <I>ND-13A</I>, a component of the mitochondria electron transport chain complex I. Reduction of <I>ND-13A</I> via neuron-specific RNAi leads to resistance to the dose-dependent climbing deficiencies and neuronal apoptosis observed in control flies. These flies are also resistant to acute oxidative stress, suggesting a mechanism for resistance to cisplatin. The mitochondria of <I>attP40</I> flies function similarly to control <I>attP2</I> mitochondria under normal conditions. Mitochondria are damaged by cisplatin, leading to reduced activity, but <I>attP40</I> mitochondria are able to retain function and even increase basal respiration rates in response to this stress. This retained mitochondrial activity is likely mediated by Sirt1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1&alpha;, and is key to cisplatin resistance. Our findings represent the potential for both identification of susceptible patients and prevention of CIPN through the targeting of mitochondria.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a major, debilitating side effect of many platinum-based cancer drugs. There are few available screening tools to identify patients at risk, and there are no effective treatments. Here, we report a novel genetic change that confers resistance to cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity in a <I>Drosophila</I> model while preserving the toxic effect in rapidly dividing cells. This work has the potential to influence patient susceptibility testing and development of novel CIPN preventive treatments.</p>

                Background: Protein inadequacy is prevalent in developing countries because of the high consumption of starchy staple foods. Sago, as a staple food in Papua Province, was eaten with less protein. This study aimed to analyze the nutritional status of protein-energy in well-nourished adults of the moderately low protein in-take (MLP)-sago group compared to the sufficient protein intake (SP)-rice group, in lowland Mimika, Papua. Methods: This cross-sectional-analytic study was conducted on 50 participants. Twenty-four-hour food recall, body composition, albumin, and complete blood count were used to assess the nutritional status. Results: There were no differences in the body compositions and albumin levels between the MLP-sago and SP-rice groups. Multivariate linear regression showed that the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (β = -0.524, P = 0.007) was a predictive factor for albumin in the sago group, while in the rice group, hemoglobin (β = 0.354 P = 0.089) and white blood cell counts (β = 0.396, P = 0.059) were predictive factors. Conclusions: The MLP-sago and SP-rice groups exhibited no differences in the  body and visceral protein; however different predictors of albumin were found be- tween the groups, suggesting an adaptive mechanism in the MLP-sago group to  maintain normal albumin levels.

                Introduction: This paper discusses the ethical considerations involved in conducting qualitative non-therapeutic research on people suffering from obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), a topic covered in few, if any, prior studies. Methods: The study summarizes in depth the existing literature on ethical aspects of conducting qualitative and nursing research with psychiatric patients. It constructs an overview of the most important points that should be taken into account when conducting non-therapeutic qualitative research on individuals with this disorder. Results: This paper draws attention to three ethical considerations: (1) informed consent; (2) OCD sufferer’s competence to give consent; and (3) aspects of the relationship that arises between the researcher and participant. Conclusions: This paper argues that those with OCD remain capable of giving consent, notwithstanding the continuing debates around their cognitive condition. It also provides an informative overview of aspects concerning their competence and insight, and suggests precautions to be followed when conducting interviews, paying attention to several factors that may determine the nature of the interview. Keywords: qualitative research, non-therapeutic research, ethical considerations, obsessive–compulsive disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between pesticide exposure and obesity: A cross-sectional study of 20,295 farmers in Thailand [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Obesity is a serious condition because it is associated with other chronic diseases which affect the quality of life. In addition to problems associated with diet and exercise, recent research has found that pesticide exposure might be another important risk factor. The objective of this study was to determine the association between pesticide exposure and obesity among farmers in Nakhon Sawan and Phitsanulok province, Thailand.  Methods: This study was a population-based cross-sectional study. Data on pesticide use and obesity prevalence from 20,295 farmers aged 20 years and older were collected using an in-person interview questionnaire. The association was analysed using multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for its potential confounding factors.  Results: Obesity was found to be associated with pesticide use in the past. The risk of obesity was significantly predicted by types of pesticides, including insecticides (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.09-4.74), herbicides (OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.16-19.29), fungicides (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.37-3.44), rodenticides (OR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.59-3.99), and molluscicides (OR = 3.37, 95% CI 2.13-5.31). Among 35 surveyed individual pesticides, 24 were significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.00-3.06 to OR = 8.37, 95% CI 3.97-17.64), including herbicide butachlor, 17 insecticides (three carbamate insecticides, five organochlorine insecticides, and nine organophosphate insecticides), and six fungicides.  Conclusion: This study found obesity in farmers in Nakhon Sawan and Phitsanulok province, Thailand, to be associated with the long-term use of several types of pesticides. The issue should receive more public attention, and pesticide use should be strictly controlled.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of training of frontline health workers on tuberculosis: a cluster randomized control trial in South Nigeria [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intensified efforts to improve tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are needed to meet global EndTB targets. Community health workers’ (CHWs) knowledge with respect to case finding is vital in tuberculosis elimination. This study aimed to determine the effect of tuberculosis training on the knowledge of community health workers in Nigeria. Methods: As part of a larger multicomponent intervention study, a randomised control trial was conducted with CHWs in 18 primary health care (PHC) clusters in Nigeria. The clusters were allocated to three arms: training and cash incentive (A), training only (B), and control (C) arms. Arms (A) and (B) received training on tuberculosis symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment while the control arm (C) did not receive training. Participants’ knowledge on tuberculosis was assessed using questionnaires administered pre- and post-intervention. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Descriptive data was presented in tables and bivariate data was analyzed using chi square. Statistical significance was set as P<0.05. Results: There was a significant increase in the total knowledge score (25.4%), knowledge of general symptoms (24.4%), prevention (22.6%) and diagnosis and treatment (30.0%) across all study arms post-intervention (p<0.0001). Compared with the control arm, the training arm (A) had a higher proportion of good total knowledge score (94.4%) and arm (B) had a lower proportion of good total knowledge score (83.1%) when compared to the control group (93.1%). These were, however, not statistically significant. Conclusions: An improvement in the CHWs’ knowledge of symptoms, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis was observed after a training intervention was done. Integration of routine tuberculosis training is recommended to improve tuberculosis case finding in high burden communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effectiveness of different aerobic exercises to improve pain intensity and disability in chronic low back pain patients: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Physical activity, including aerobic exercise, is highly recommended for chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients to improve pain intensity and functional disability. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of different aerobic exercises to reduce pain intensity and functional disability in patients with CLBP. Methods: A computer-aided search was performed to find Randomised controlled Trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of different aerobic exercises in CLBP. Articles published between January 2007 to December 2020 were included in the review. Quality assessment using the PEDro scale, extraction of relevant information, and evaluation of outcomes were done by two reviewers independently. Results: A total of 17 studies were included that involved 1146 participants. Outcomes suggested that aerobic exercise combined with other interventions was more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Aerobic exercise with higher frequency (≥ 5 days/week) and longer duration (≥ 12 weeks) were effective to gain clinically significant (≥ 30%) improvements. Environment and using pedometer did not seem to influence the outcomes. Conclusions: Pain intensity and functional disability in CLBP patients can be minimized by prescribing aerobic exercise. However, to get better improvements, aerobic exercise should be done in combination with other interventions and at optimum frequency and duration. Further studies should emphasize examining the optimal doses and period of different aerobic exercises.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Thunderstruck: The ACDC model of flexible sequences and rhythms in recurrent neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cristian Buc Calderon, Tom Verguts, Michael J. Frank</p>

Adaptive sequential behavior is a hallmark of human cognition. In particular, humans can learn to produce precise spatiotemporal sequences given a certain context. For instance, musicians can not only reproduce learned action sequences in a context-dependent manner, they can also quickly and flexibly reapply them in any desired tempo or rhythm without overwriting previous learning. Existing neural network models fail to account for these properties. We argue that this limitation emerges from the fact that sequence information (i.e., the position of the action) and timing (i.e., the moment of response execution) are typically stored in the same neural network weights. Here, we augment a biologically plausible recurrent neural network of cortical dynamics to include a basal ganglia-thalamic module which uses reinforcement learning to dynamically modulate action. This “associative cluster-dependent chain” (ACDC) model modularly stores sequence and timing information in distinct loci of the network. This feature increases computational power and allows ACDC to display a wide range of temporal properties (e.g., multiple sequences, temporal shifting, rescaling, and compositionality), while still accounting for several behavioral and neurophysiological empirical observations. Finally, we apply this ACDC network to show how it can learn the famous “Thunderstruck” song intro and then flexibly play it in a “bossa nova” rhythm without further training.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Flux balance analysis of the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC19718 unravels specific metabolic activities while degrading toxic compounds</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriela Canto-Encalada, Diego Tec-Campos, Juan D. Tibocha-Bonilla, Karsten Zengler, Alejandro Zepeda, Cristal Zuñiga</p>

The ammonia-oxidizing bacterium <i>Nitrosomonas europaea</i> has been widely recognized as an important player in the nitrogen cycle as well as one of the most abundant members in microbial communities for the treatment of industrial or sewage wastewater. Its natural metabolic versatility and extraordinary ability to degrade environmental pollutants (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene) enable it to thrive under various harsh environmental conditions. Constraint-based metabolic models constructed from genome sequences enable quantitative insight into the central and specialized metabolism within a target organism. These genome-scale models have been utilized to understand, optimize, and design new strategies for improved bioprocesses. Reduced modeling approaches have been used to elucidate <i>Nitrosomonas europaea</i> metabolism at a pathway level. However, genome-scale knowledge about the simultaneous oxidation of ammonia and pollutant metabolism of <i>N</i>. <i>europaea</i> remains limited. Here, we describe the reconstruction, manual curation, and validation of the genome-scale metabolic model for <i>N</i>. <i>europaea</i>, <i>i</i>GC535. This reconstruction is the most accurate metabolic model for a nitrifying organism to date, reaching an average prediction accuracy of over 90% under several growth conditions. The manually curated model can predict phenotypes under chemolithotrophic and chemolithoorganotrophic conditions while oxidating methane and wastewater pollutants. Calculated flux distributions under different trophic conditions show that several key pathways are affected by the type of carbon source available, including central carbon metabolism and energy production.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RNA length has a non-trivial effect in the stability of biomolecular condensates formed by RNA-binding proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ignacio Sanchez-Burgos, Jorge R. Espinosa, Jerelle A. Joseph, Rosana Collepardo-Guevara</p>

Biomolecular condensates formed via liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal organization of the cell material. Nucleic acids can act as critical modulators in the stability of these protein condensates. Here, we present a multiscale computational strategy, exploiting the advantages of both a sequence-dependent coarse-grained representation of proteins and a minimal coarse-grained model that describes proteins as patchy colloids, to unveil the role of RNA length in regulating the stability of RNA-binding protein (RBP) condensates. We find that for a constant nucleotide/protein ratio at which phase separation is enhanced, the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS), which can phase separate on its own—i.e., via homotypic interactions—only exhibits a mild dependency on the RNA strand length. In contrast, the 25-repeat proline-arginine peptide (PR<sub>25</sub>), which does not undergo LLPS on its own at physiological conditions but instead exhibits complex coacervation with RNA—i.e., via heterotypic interactions—shows a strong dependence on the length of the RNA strands. Our minimal patchy particle simulations, where we recapitulate the modulation of homotypic protein LLPS and complex coacervation by RNA length, suggest that the strikingly different effect of RNA length on homotypic LLPS versus complex coacervation is general. Phase separation is RNA-length dependent as long as the relative contribution of heterotypic interactions sustaining LLPS is comparable or higher than that stemming from protein homotypic interactions. Taken together, our results contribute to illuminate the intricate physicochemical mechanisms that influence the stability of RBP condensates through RNA inclusion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Global diversity and balancing selection of 23 leading Plasmodium falciparum candidate vaccine antigens</a></h4>

Investigation of the diversity of malaria parasite antigens can help prioritize and validate them as vaccine candidates and identify the most common variants for inclusion in vaccine formulations. Studies of vaccine candidates of the most virulent human malaria parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, have focused on a handful of well-known antigens, while several others have never been studied. Here we examine the global diversity and population structure of leading vaccine candidate antigens of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> using the MalariaGEN Pf3K (version 5.1) resource, comprising more than 2600 genomes from 15 malaria endemic countries. A stringent variant calling pipeline was used to extract high quality antigen gene ‘haplotypes’ from the global dataset and a new R-package named <i>VaxPack</i> was used to streamline population genetic analyses. In addition, a newly developed algorithm that enables spatial averaging of selection pressure on 3D protein structures was applied to the dataset. We analysed the genes encoding 23 leading and novel candidate malaria vaccine antigens including <i>csp</i>, <i>trap</i>, <i>eba175</i>, <i>ama1</i>, <i>rh5</i>, and <i>CelTOS</i>. Our analysis shows that current malaria vaccine formulations are based on rare haplotypes and thus may have limited efficacy against natural parasite populations. High levels of diversity with evidence of balancing selection was detected for most of the erythrocytic and pre-erythrocytic antigens. Measures of natural selection were then mapped to 3D protein structures to predict targets of functional antibodies. For some antigens, geographical variation in the intensity and distribution of these signals on the 3D structure suggests adaptation to different human host or mosquito vector populations. This study provides an essential framework for the diversity of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> antigens to be considered in the design of the next generation of malaria vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The first report on detecting SARS-CoV-2 inside human fecal-oral bacteria: A case series on asymptomatic family members and a child with COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Many studies report the importance of using feces as source sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 symptoms but who are negative to oropharyngeal/ nasopharyngeal tests. Here, we report the case of an asymptomatic child whose family members had negative results with the rapid antigen nasopharyngeal swab tests. The 21-month-old child presented with fever, diarrhea, bilateral conjunctivitis, and conspicuous lacrimation. In this study, analysis for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples by using Luminex technology allowed accurate detection of the presence of the viral RNA in the feces of the child and of all her relatives, which thus resulted to be positive but asymptomatic. It is the first time that SARS-CoV-2- is observed inside human fecal-oral bacteria and outside a matrix resembling extracellular bacterial lysates, in agreement with a bacteriophage mechanism with the images obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), post-embedding immunogold, and by fluorescence microscope. In addition to the typical observations of respiratory symptoms, accurate evaluation of clinical gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, combined with efficient highly sensitive molecular testing on feces, represent an efficient approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and for providing the correct therapy in challenging COVID-19 cases, like the one here reported.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effectiveness of a sexual assault nurse examiner-grounding program (SANE-GP) on knowledge, skill and practice regarding sexual assault examination (SAE) among nurses working in a tertiary care hospital in Udupi district, India: A study protocol [versi</a></h4>

              
                The medico-legal care of victims of sexual assault is very challenging, and requires specific knowledge and skills. Professionals in the emergency departments of hospitals might not have specialised training in forensic science. Nurses have a very significant role in these settings, but they lack any formal forensic training. This study aims to develop a sexual assault nurse examiner-grounding program (SANE-GP) for Indian nurses to inculcate knowledge and skill regarding sexual assault examination. The study adopts a three-stage Delphi technique to develop the training module and uses a time-series design to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. A questionnaire on nurses’ knowledge on sexual assault examination (KQSANE-I) will be developed in phase-I and subsequently used in phase-II. The protocol of SANE-GP will help the medical community to implement the program across India. The implementation of SANE-GP can also help to start a sexual assault nurse examiner network.

                This paper describes a laboratory protocol to perform the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay from nasopharyngeal swab samples.  It is urgently necessary to identify factors related to severe symptoms of respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in order to assess the possibility of establishing preventive or preliminary therapeutic measures and to plan the services to be provided on hospital admission. At present, the samples recommended for microbiological diagnosis are those taken from the upper and/or the lower respiratory tract.  The NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay is a method based on the direct digital detection of mRNA molecules by means of target-specific, colour-coded probe pairs, without the need for mRNA conversion to cDNA by reverse transcription or the amplification of the resulting cDNA by PCR. This platform includes advanced analysis tools that reduce the need for bioinformatics support and also offers reliable sensitivity, reproducibility, technical robustness and utility for clinical application, even in RNA samples of low RNA quality or concentration, such as paraffin-embedded samples. Although the protocols for the analysis of blood or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples are provided by the manufacturer, no corresponding protocol for the analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples has yet been established. Therefore, the approach we describe could be adopted to determine the expression of target genes in samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using the nCOUNTER technology.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution quantitatively supports a therapeutic role in COVID-19 at a minimum dose of 20 mg per day [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background.  Various in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits multiple variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic and multiple observational clinical studies have shown that patients receiving fluoxetine experienced clinical benefit by lowering the risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to conduct population pharmacokinetic dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 50% (EC50) and 90% (EC90) inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells. Methods.  Pharmacometric parameter estimates used in this study were obtained from the U.S. FDA website from a new drug application for fluoxetine hydrochloride. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine antidepressant doses (20 mg/day, 30 mg/day, 40 mg/day, 50 mg/day, and 60 mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough plasma level for the EC50 and EC90 SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. All analyses and graphing were conducted in the R. Results.  By day-10 at 20 mg/day 93.2% and 47% of the population will achieve the trough target plasma EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectively, which translates to a lung tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher EC50 (283.6 ng/ml [0.82 mM]) and EC90 (1390.1 ng/ml [4.02 mM]). Further, by day-10 at an ideal dose of 40 mg/day, 99% and 93% of patients will reach the trough EC50 and EC90 concentrations, respectfully. Lastly, only a dose of 60 mg/day will reach the SARS-CoV-2 EC90 inhibitory concentration in the brain. Conclusion. Overall, with a minimum treatment period of 10-days and a minimum dose of 20 mg/day, this study corroborates in vitro studies reporting fluoxetine inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 titers and also multiple observational clinical studies showing therapeutic benefit of fluoxetine in COVID-19 patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of oxidative stress markers in Indonesian chronic kidney disease patients: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several aspects of chronic kidney disease (CKD) such as the incidence rate and mortality rate are concerning. Oxidative stress contributes to progression and mortality in patients with CKD; however, a specific correlation between several markers of oxidative stress and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in the Indonesian population has not been sufficiently described yet. Methods: This study was an analytic observational study with a sample of 56 patients with CKD in Universitas Airlangga Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, from December 2019 – March 2020. The markers for oxidative stress investigated were urinary 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). The correlations between each variable of oxidative stress and CKD were analyzed using Pearson analysis. Results: There was a positive correlation between 8-OHdG and eGFR (p=0.00, r=0.51); however, there was a negative correlation between 8-OHdG and ACR (p=0.025, r=-0.30). SDMA and eGFR showed a negative correlation (p=0.00, r=-0.648), while SDMA and ACR showed a positive correlation (p=0.03, r=0.349). ADMA showed a negative correlation with eGFR (p=0.00, r=-0.476). There were significantly decreased 8-OHdG but increased ADMA and SDMA as the CKD stage progressed (p=0.001, p=0.00, and p = 0.00, respectively). Higher urine 8-OHdG was detected in patients without history of hemodialysis, whereas ADMA and SDMA showed higher value in patients with hemodialysis (p=0.00, p=0.00, and p=0.004, respectively), patients with history of diabetes mellitus (DM) had higher mean 8-OHdG (p 0.000) yet lower serum ADMA and SDMA (p=0.004 and p=0.003, respectively). Conclusions: In patients with CKD in Indonesia, the markers for oxidative stress 8-OHdG, SDMA, and ADMA are correlated with eGFR and ACR levels. There were also significant difference in 8-OHdG, SDMA, and ADMA levels among CKD stages, between dialysis vs non dialysis, and DM vs non DM patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Student biocuration projects as a learning environment [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bioinformatics is becoming an essential tool for the majority of biological and biomedical researchers. Although bioinformatics data is exploited by academic and industrial researchers, limited focus is on teaching this area to undergraduates, postgraduates and senior scientists. Many scientists are developing their own expertise without formal training and often without appreciating the source of the data they are reliant upon. Some universities do provide courses on a variety of bioinformatics resources and tools, a few also provide biocuration projects, during which students submit data to annotation resources. Methods: To assess the usefulness and enjoyability of annotation projects a survey was sent to University College London (UCL) students who have undertaken Gene Ontology biocuration projects. Results: Analysis of survey responses suggest that these projects provide students with an opportunity not only to learn about bioinformatics resources but also to improve their literature analysis, presentation and writing skills. Conclusion: Biocuration student projects provide valuable annotations as well as enabling students to develop a variety of skills relevant to their future careers. It is also hoped that, as future scientists, these students will critically assess their own manuscripts and ensure that these are written with the biocurators of the future in mind.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to validate the Erasmus Guillain-Barré syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score in the International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcome Study cohort, and to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined data from the first 1,500 included patients, aged ≥6 years and not ventilated prior to study entry. Patients with a clinical variant or mild symptoms were also included. Outcome was mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Model performance was assessed regarding the discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and the calibration (observed versus predicted probability of mechanical ventilation), in the full cohort and in Europe/North America and Asia separately. We recalibrated the model to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the group of 1,023 eligible patients (Europe/North America n = 842, Asia n = 104, other n = 77), 104 (10%) required mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Area under the curve values were ≥ 0.80 for all validation subgroups. Mean observed proportions of mechanical ventilation were lower than predicted risks: full cohort 10% vs. 21%, Europe/North America 9% vs. 21% and Asia 17% vs. 23%. After recalibration, predicted risks for the full cohort and Europe/North America corresponded to observed proportions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This prospective, international, cohort study validated the Erasmus Guillain-Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score, and showed that the model can be used in the full spectrum of Guillain-Barré syndrome patients. In addition, a more accurate, region-specific version of the model was developed for patients from Europe/North America.</p>

                Zheng et al. reveal a circuit mechanism for processing chronic stress. Potentiating hypothalamus-to-habenula pathway leads to lasting changes of emotional status. This study makes a significant stride toward the elucidation of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying chronic-stress-induced depression and sheds light on early interventions before depression onset.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cooperation among c-subunits of FoF1-ATP synthase in rotation-coupled proton translocation</a></h4>

              
                In F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase, proton translocation through F<sub>o</sub> drives rotation of the <i>c</i>-subunit oligomeric ring relative to the <i>a</i>-subunit. Recent studies suggest that in each step of the rotation, key glutamic acid residues in different <i>c</i>-subunits contribute to proton release to and proton uptake from the <i>a</i>-subunit. However, no studies have demonstrated cooperativity among <i>c</i>-subunits toward F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP synthase activity. Here, we addressed this using <i>Bacillus</i> PS3 ATP synthase harboring a <i>c</i>-ring with various combinations of wild-type and <i>c</i>E56D, enabled by genetically fused single-chain <i>c</i>-ring. ATP synthesis and proton pump activities were decreased by a single <i>c</i>E56D mutation and further decreased by double <i>c</i>E56D mutations. Moreover, activity further decreased as the two mutation sites were separated, indicating cooperation among <i>c</i>-subunits. Similar results were obtained for proton transfer-coupled molecular simulations. The simulations revealed that prolonged proton uptake in mutated <i>c</i>-subunits is shared between two <i>c</i>-subunits, explaining the cooperation observed in biochemical assays.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pupil diameter is not an accurate real-time readout of locus coeruleus activity</a></h4>

              
                Pupil diameter is often treated as a noninvasive readout of activity in the locus coeruleus (LC). However, how accurately it can be used to index LC activity is not known. To address this question, we established a graded relationship between pupil size changes and LC spiking activity in mice, where pupil dilation increased monotonically with the number of LC spikes. However, this relationship exists with substantial variability such that pupil diameter can only be used to accurately predict a small fraction of LC activity on a moment-by-moment basis. In addition, pupil exhibited large session-to-session fluctuations in response to identical optical stimulation in the LC. The variations in the pupil–LC relationship were strongly correlated with decision bias-related behavioral variables. Together, our data show that substantial variability exists in an overall graded relationship between pupil diameter and LC activity, and further suggest that the pupil–LC relationship is dynamically modulated by brain states, supporting and extending our previous findings (Yang et al., 2021).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rolling circle RNA synthesis catalysed by RNA</a></h4>

              
                RNA-catalysed RNA replication is widely considered a key step in the emergence of life's first genetic system. However, RNA replication can be impeded by the extraordinary stability of duplex RNA products, which must be dissociated for re-initiation of the next replication cycle. Here we have explored rolling circle synthesis (RCS) as a potential solution to this strand separation problem. We observe sustained RCS by a triplet polymerase ribozyme beyond full-length circle synthesis with strand displacement yielding concatemeric RNA products. Furthermore, we show RCS of a circular Hammerhead ribozyme capable of self-cleavage and re-circularisation. Thus, all steps of a viroid-like RNA replication pathway can be catalysed by RNA alone. Finally, we explore potential RCS mechanisms by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate a progressive build-up of conformational strain upon RCS' with destabilisation of nascent strand 5'- and 3'-ends. Our results have implications for the emergence of RNA replication and for understanding the potential of RNA to support complex genetic processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Broca area homologue's asymmetry reflects gestural communication lateralisation in monkeys (Papio anubis)</a></h4>

              
                Manual gestures and speech recruit a common neural network, involving Broca's area in the left hemisphere. Such speech-gesture integration gave rise to theories on the critical role of manual gesturing in the origin of language. Within this evolutionary framework, research on gestural communication in our closer primate relatives has received renewed attention for investigating its potential language-like features. Here, using <i>in-vivo</i> anatomical MRI in 50 baboons, we found that communicative gesturing is related to Broca homologue's marker in monkeys, namely the ventral portion of the Inferior Arcuate sulcus (<i>IA sulcus</i>). In fact, both direction and degree of gestural communication's handedness - but not handedness for object manipulation - are associated and correlated with contralateral depth asymmetry at this exact <i>IA sulcus</i> portion. In other words, baboons that prefer to communicate with their right hand have a deeper left-than-right <i>IA sulcus</i>, than those preferring to communicate with their left hand and vice versa. Interestingly, in contrast to handedness for object manipulation, gestural communication's lateralisation is not associated to the <i>Central sulcus</i> depth asymmetry, suggesting a double dissociation of handedness' types between manipulative action and gestural communication. It is thus not excluded that this specific gestural lateralisation signature within the baboons' frontal cortex might reflect a phylogenetical continuity with language-related Broca lateralisation in humans.

                Engineered Genetic Incompatibility (EGI) is a method to create species-like barriers to sexual reproduction. It has applications in pest control that mimic Sterile Insect Technique when only EGI males are released. This can be facilitated by introducing conditional female-lethality to EGI strains to generate a sex-sorting incompatible male system (SSIMS). Here, we demonstrate a proof of concept by combining tetracycline-controlled female lethality constructs with a <i>pyramus</i>-targeting EGI line in the model insect <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We show that both functions (incompatibility and sex-sorting) are robustly maintained in the SSIMS line and that this approach is effective for population suppression in cage experiments. Further we show that SSIMS males remain competitive with wild-type males for reproduction with wild-type females, including at the level of sperm competition.

                Despite profound mechanistic insight into motor pattern generation, for asynchronous insect flight - the most prevalent form of flight employed by >600.000 species - architecture and function of the underlying central pattern generating (CPG) neural network remain elusive. Combining electro- and optophysiology, Drosophila genetics, and mathematical modelling, we uncover a miniaturized circuit solution of motoneurons interconnected by electrical synapses that, contrary to doctrine, serve to de-synchronize network activity. This minimal gap-junctional motoneuron network suffices to translate unpatterned premotor input into stereotyped firing sequences which are conserved across species and generate stable wingbeat power. Mechanistically, network de-synchronization requires weak electrical coupling in conjunction with specific postsynaptic excitability dynamics, revealing an unexpected, generic feature in the control of neural circuit dynamics by electrical synapses.

                As in the mammalian system, sleep in Drosophila is regulated by multiple brain regions. Among them, neurons projecting to the dorsal Fan-Shaped Body (dFB) have been intensively studied and the data suggest they play a critical role for in sleep regulation. The 23E10-GAL4 driver is the most widely used tool to label and manipulate dFB neurons. Multiple studies have reported that activation of 23E10-GAL4 neurons promotes sleep. However, anatomical analysis revealed that 23E10-GAL4 labels 23-30 dFB neurons in the Drosophila brain and many non-dFB neurons in the brain and in the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC), the fly equivalent of the spinal cord. To better understand the role of individual dFB neurons in sleep regulation, we undertook a Split-GAL4 screen to gain access to subsets of 23E10-GAL expressing cells. In this study, we report the discovery of two VNC cholinergic sleep-promoting neurons labeled by the 23E10-GAL4 driver.

                Electron microscopy-based connectomes provide important insights into how visual circuitry of fruit fly Drosophila computes various visual features, guiding and complementing behavioral and physiological studies. However, connectomic analyses of lobula, a putative center of object-like feature detection, remains underdeveloped, largely because of incomplete data on the inputs to the brain region. Here, we attempted to map the columnar inputs into the Drosophila lobula neuropil by performing connectivity- and morphology-based clustering on a densely reconstructed connectome dataset. While the dataset mostly lacked visual neuropils other than lobula, which would normally help identify inputs to lobula, our clustering analysis successfully extracted clusters of cells with homogeneous connectivity and morphology, likely representing genuine cell types. We were able to draw a correspondence between the resulting clusters and previously identified cell types, revealing previously undocumented connectivity between lobula input and output neurons. While future, more complete connectomic reconstructions are necessary to verify the results presented here, they can serve as a useful basis for formulating hypotheses on mechanisms of visual feature detection in lobula.

                In evaluating the personality attributes and performance of the self, people are inclined to view themselves superior to others, a phenomenon known as superiority illusion (SI). This illusive outlook pervades people's thoughts, creating hope for the future and promoting mental health. Although a specific cortico-striatal functional connectivity (FC) under dopaminergic modulation was previously shown to be implicated in SI, the underlying whole-brain mechanisms have remained unclarified. Herein, to reveal the neural network subserving individual's SI, we conducted a data-driven, machine-learning investigation to explore the resting-state FC network across the whole brain. Using the locally-acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 123), we identified a set of 15 FCs most informative in classifying individuals with higher- versus lower-than-average levels of SI in evaluating positive trait words (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.81). Among the 15 FCs, the contribution level to the classification was 11% by the previously-highlighted cortico-striatal FC alone, but 60% by the encompassing cortico-limbico-striatal network cluster. A newly-identified, cortico-thalamic FC and another FC cluster also demonstrated substantial contribution. The classification accuracy was generalized into an independent cohort (n = 36; AUC = 0.73). Importantly, using the same set of 15 FCs, we achieved prediction on an individual's level of striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability (Pearson correlation, r = 0.46, P = 0.005). This is the first successful identification of the whole-brain neural network that simultaneously predicts the behavioral manifestation and molecular underpinning of an essential psychological process that promotes well-being and mental health.

                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) visualizes brain structures at increasingly higher resolution and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as field strength increases. Yet, mapping the BOLD response to distinct neuronal processes continues to be challenging. Here, we performed 3T and 7T-fMRI analysis of motor-task activation and resting-state connectivity with adjusted SNR. We then applied graph theory to analyze resting-state neuronal networks detected by fMRI after a simple motor task. Despite adjusted SNR, 7T achieved a higher functional specificity of the BOLD response than 3T-fMRI. Following the motor task, 7T-fMRI therefore enabled the detection of an "offline replay" that was directly linked to brain regions associated with memory consolidation. These findings reveal how memory processing is initiated even after simple motor tasks and begins earlier than previously shown. Thus, the superior capability of 7T-fMRI to detect subtle functional dynamics promises to improve diagnostics and therapeutic assessment of neurological diseases.

                Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has accelerated human neuroscience by fostering the analysis of brain structure, function, and connectivity across multiple scales and in living brains. The richness and complexity of multimodal neuroimaging, however, demands processing methods to integrate information across modalities and different spatial scales. Here, we present micapipe, an open processing pipeline for BIDS-conform multimodal MRI datasets. micapipe can generate i) structural connectomes derived from diffusion tractography, ii) functional connectomes derived from resting-state signal correlations, iii) geodesic distance matrices that quantify cortico-cortical proximity, and iv) microstructural profile covariance matrices that assess inter-regional similarity in cortical myelin proxies. These matrices are routinely generated across established 18 cortical parcellations (100-1000 parcels), in addition to subcortical and cerebellar parcellations. Results are represented on three different surface spaces (native, conte69, fsaverage5), and outputs are BIDS-conform. Processed outputs can be quality controlled at the individual and group level. micapipe was tested on several datasets and is available at https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe, documented at https://micapipe.readthedocs.io/, and containerized as a BIDS App http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/. We hope that micapipe will foster robust and integrative studies of human brain microstructure, morphology, and connectivity.

                Asymmetric segregation of cellular components regulates the fate and behavior of somatic stem cells. Similar to dividing budding yeast and precursor cells in C. elegans, it has been shown that mouse neural progenitors establish a diffusion barrier in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which has been associated with asymmetric partitioning of damaged proteins and cellular age. However, the existence of an ER-diffusion barrier in human cells remains unknown. Here we used fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) imaging to show that human embryonic stem cell (hESC)- and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells establish an ER-diffusion barrier during cell division. The human ER-diffusion barrier is regulated via Lamin-dependent mechanisms and is associated with asymmetric segregation of mono- and polyubiquitinated, damaged proteins. Further, forebrain regionalized organoids derived from hESCs were used to show the establishment of an ER-membrane diffusion barrier in more naturalistic tissues mimicking early steps of human brain development. Thus, the data provided here show that human neural progenitors establish a diffusion barrier during cell division in the membrane of the ER, which may allow for asymmetric segregation of cellular components, contributing to the fate and behavior of human neural progenitor cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Autism in a dish: ES cell models of autism with copy number variations reveal cell-type-specific vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                Human genetics has identified numerous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and other psychiatric disorders. However, the lack of standardized biological resources impedes understanding of the common pathophysiology of ASD. Here, using next-generation chromosome engineering based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we established a biological resource including 65 genetically modified mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines as genetic models of human SNVs and CNVs. To illustrate cell-type and CNV specific molecular features of ASD, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (37,397 cells in total), morphological, and physiological analyses using 12 representative cell lines with CNVs highly associated with ASD. These results uncover gene ontology (GO) terms, canonical pathways, upstream regulators, and related neuropsychiatric disorders in a cell-type and CNV specific manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Metabolic switch in the aging astrocyte evidenced via integrative approach comprising network and transcriptome analyses</a></h4>

              
                Central energy metabolism is a pivotal process dysregulated during brain aging. The neuron and the astrocyte form an extensive interconnected metabolic network that allows achieving the high energy demand required by the neuron to propagate information in the brain. While most of this energy is utilized to re-establish cation gradients in neurons and glial cells, which specific genes in the neuron-astrocyte metabolic network are essential for continuous neurotransmission and are responsible for cognitive decline during brain aging remains largely unknown. To identify these gene products, we used a novel approach to analyze the neuron-astrocyte metabolic network, integrating network flux (optimality) and structure (centrality) and determined how the contribution of each gene in the network affected its function. Genes with the highest optimality and centrality scores were termed hub genes. They were searched in astrocyte and neuron transcriptomic databases to identify differential hub genes, which were differentially expressed during neurotransmission or aging. The identified differential hub genes suggest that during brain aging: 1) The neuron suffers energetic deficit by substantial downregulation of Krebs cycle genes including mdh1 and mdh2 (malate-aspartate shuttle), while the astrocyte undergoes a metabolic switch from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, hampering the supply of lactate to the neuron; 2) Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation hub genes were downregulated, including hub gene dld, an integrative gene that encodes for a subunit in BCAA-, pyruvate- and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes; and 3) Increased ketone body synthesis in the neuron and augmented astrocytic utilization, in line with neuronal energy deficit in favor of astrocytes. Differential hub gene identification was robust and resulted in novel candidates for future pre-clinical studies targeting energy metabolism to prevent age-associated cognitive decline. Importantly, our approach narrows down the number of candidate genes identified in transcriptomic databases by two orders of magnitude. This method may be applied to other metabolic cellular models in future omics studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">JUN Regulation of Injury-induced Enhancers in Schwann Cells</a></h4>

              
                Schwann cells play a critical role after peripheral nerve injury by clearing myelin debris, forming axon-guiding Bands of Bungner, and re-myelinating regenerating axons. Schwann cells undergo epigenomic remodeling to differentiate into a repair state that expresses unique genes, some of which are not expressed at other stages of Schwann cell development. We previously identified a set of enhancers that are activated in Schwann cells after nerve injury, and we determined if these enhancers are pre-programmed into the Schwann cell epigenome as poised enhancers prior to injury. Poised enhancers share many attributes of active enhancers, such as open chromatin, but are marked by repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) rather than H3K27ac. We find that most injury-induced enhancers are not marked as poised enhancers prior to injury indicating that injury-induced enhancers are not pre-programmed in the Schwann cell epigenome. Injury-induced enhancers are enriched with AP-1 binding motifs, and the c-JUN subunit of AP-1 had been shown to be critical to drive the transcriptional response of Schwann cells after injury. Using in vivo ChIP-seq analysis we find that c-JUN binds to a subset of injury-induced enhancers. To test the role of specific injury-induced enhancers, we focused on c-JUN-binding enhancers upstream of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) gene, which is only upregulated in repair Schwann cells compared to other stages of Schwann cell development. We confirm that c-JUN regulates these enhancers and also show that the enhancers are required for robust induction of the Shh gene after injury.
