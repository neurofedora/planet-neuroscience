                Background The nursing workforce is crucial in healthcare systems worldwide and contributes to community well-being. also, Nurses experience numerous psychological, social, emotional, and behavioral shocks and challenges in their work. In Jordan, 43% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of burnout, around 55% experience high levels of emotional exhaustion, and 33% of doctors and nurses suffer from high levels of psychological pressure and job stress. Others found that 70% of nurses experience stress. these issues can be reduced by practicing self-care and psychological flow which impact in work-related tasks which are important in effectively addressing occupational stress healthily and soundly. This study aims to determine assessing the predictive power of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses Methods This study follows the quantitative technique. sample consisting of 476 nurses in Amman Jordan was chosen. Three scales were adapted to meet the study objectives: Occupational stress scale, Self-care scale, and psychological flow scale. There validity and reliability were checked. Results The study results indicate that self-care and psychological flow levels were low with means of 2.32 and 2.13, while the occupational stress level was high with a mean of 3.91. Also, there are a predictive power of self-care and psychological flow in occupational stress among nurses. Conclusions This study shows that of self-care and psychological flow predict occupational stress among nurses, which helps us to manage the occupational stress among them by giving them self-care and psychological flow practices and healing time during work by group counseling and lectures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19565">Noise-induced Extreme Events in Hodgkin-Huxley Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme events are rare, large-scale deviations from typical system behavior that can occur in nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we explore the emergence of extreme events within a network of identical stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with mean-field coupling. The neurons are exposed to uncorrelated noise, which introduces stochastic electrical fluctuations that influence their spiking activity. Analyzing the variations in the amplitude of the mean field, we observe a smooth transition from small-amplitude, out-of-sync activity to synchronized spiking activity as the coupling parameter increases, while an abrupt transition occurs with increasing noise intensity. However, beyond a certain threshold, the coupling abruptly suppresses the spiking activity of the network. Our analysis reveals that the influence of noise combined with neuronal coupling near the abrupt transitions can trigger cascades of synchronized spiking activity, identified as extreme events. The analysis of the entropy of the mean field allows us to detect the parameter region where these events occur. We characterize the statistics of these events and find that, as the network size increases, the parameter range where they occur decreases significantly. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms driving extreme events in neural networks and how noise and neural coupling shape collective behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19869">Research on Event-Related Desynchronization of Motor Imagery and Movement Based on Localized EEG Cortical Sources</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates event-related desynchronization (ERD) phenomena during motor imagery and actual movement. Using sLORETA software, we analyzed the cortical current source density distributions in Mu and Beta frequency bands for 33 subjects during rest, motor imagery, and actual movement conditions. The results were normalized for analysis. Using sLORETA's statistical tools, paired t-tests were conducted to compare the normalized current source density results between rest and motor imagery, rest and actual movement, and motor imagery and actual movement conditions in both frequency bands. The findings revealed: In both Mu and Beta frequency bands, during motor imagery, significant ERD (P<0.01) was observed in the salience network, supplementary motor area, primary motor area, premotor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and parietofrontal mirror neuron system. During actual movement, significant ERD (P<0.05) was observed in the primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor area, and parietofrontal mirror neuron system in both frequency bands. Comparing motor imagery to actual movement, the current source density in the primary somatosensory cortex and parietofrontal mirror neuron system was higher during motor imagery, though this difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). This paper analyzes the factors contributing to these statistical results and proposes preliminary solutions.

                arXiv:2502.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence increasingly pursues large, complex models that perform many tasks within increasingly realistic domains. How, if at all, should these developments in AI influence cognitive science?
  We argue that progress in AI offers timely opportunities for cognitive science to embrace experiments with increasingly naturalistic stimuli, tasks, and behaviors; and computational models that can accommodate these changes. We first review a growing body of research spanning neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI that suggests that incorporating a broader range of naturalistic experimental paradigms (and models that accommodate them) may be necessary to resolve some aspects of natural intelligence and ensure that our theories generalize. We then suggest that integrating recent progress in AI and cognitive science will enable us to engage with more naturalistic phenomena without giving up experimental control or the pursuit of theoretically grounded understanding. We offer practical guidance on how methodological practices can contribute to cumulative progress in naturalistic computational cognitive science, and illustrate a path towards building computational models that solve the real problems of natural cognition - together with a reductive understanding of the processes and principles by which they do so.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19648">Spectral Analysis of Representational Similarity with Limited Neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.19648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring representational similarity between neural recordings and computational models is challenging due to constraints on the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously. In this work, we investigate how such limitations affect similarity measures, focusing on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). Leveraging tools from Random Matrix Theory, we develop a predictive spectral framework for these measures and demonstrate that finite neuron sampling systematically underestimates similarity due to eigenvector delocalization. To overcome this, we introduce a denoising method to infer population-level similarity, enabling accurate analysis even with small neuron samples. Our theory is validated on synthetic and real datasets, offering practical strategies for interpreting neural data under finite sampling constraints.

                arXiv:2405.16865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for the hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. We posit that grid cell activities form a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis proposes that this neural manifold is a conformal isometric embedding of 2D physical space, where local physical distance is preserved by the embedding up to a scaling factor (or unit of metric). Such distance-preserving position embedding is indispensable for path planning in navigation, especially planning local straight path segments. We conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagonal grid firing patterns by learning maximally distance-preserving position embedding, agnostic to the choice of the recurrent neural network. Furthermore, we present a theoretical explanation of why hexagon periodic patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function by showing that hexagon flat torus is maximally distance preserving.

Abstract: This perspective explores various quantum models of consciousness from the viewpoint of quantum information science, offering potential ideas and insights. The models under consideration can be categorized into three distinct groups based on the level at which quantum mechanics might operate within the brain: those suggesting that consciousness arises from electron delocalization within microtubules inside neurons, those proposing it emerges from the electromagnetic field surrounding the entire neural network, and those positing it originates from the interactions between individual neurons governed by neurotransmitter molecules. Our focus is particularly on the Posner model of cognition, for which we provide preliminary calculations on the preservation of entanglement of phosphate molecules within the geometric structure of Posner clusters. These findings provide valuable insights into how quantum information theory can enhance our understanding of brain functions.

                arXiv:2502.11105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational theory of memory is proposed to explain how we can accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded storage space. Memory is stored as statistics, organized into complex structures that are constantly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. This process, driven by space constraints, is guided by heuristics that optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are more slowly elaborated into more abstract constructs. This theory differs from previous accounts of memory by (a) its reliance on statistics, (b) its use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics, and (c) the emphasis on memory as a process that is intensive, complex, and expensive. The theory is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.

Abstract: We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high values of the Lyapunov dimension that change significantly across the region. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.

Abstract: Advancements in cloud computing and distributed computing have fostered research activities in Computer science. As a result, researchers have made significant progress in Neural Networks, Evolutionary Computing Algorithms like Genetic, and Differential evolution algorithms. These algorithms are used to develop clustering, recommendation, and question-and-answering systems using various text representation and similarity measurement techniques. In this research paper, Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) is used to capture the semantic similarity of text; And the transfer learning technique is used to apply Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms to search and retrieve relevant top N documents based on user query. The proposed approach is applied to the Stanford Question and Answer (SQuAD) Dataset to identify a user query. Finally, through experiments, we prove that text documents can be efficiently represented as sentence embedding vectors using USE to capture the semantic similarity, and by comparing the results of the Manhattan Distance, GA, and DE algorithms we prove that the evolutionary algorithms are good at finding the top N results than the traditional ranking approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-objective version of the Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm called the Grid-based Multi-objective Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (GMOCSO). Convergence and diversity preservation are the two main goals pursued by modern multi-objective algorithms to yield robust results. To achieve these goals, we first replace the roulette wheel method of the original CSO algorithm with a greedy method. Then, two key concepts from Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy Algorithm (PAES) are adopted: the grid system and double archive strategy. Several test functions and a real-world scenario called the Pressure vessel design problem are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance. In the experiment, the proposed algorithm is compared with other well-known algorithms using different metrics such as Reversed Generational Distance, Spacing metric, and Spread metric. The optimization results show the robustness of the proposed algorithm, and the results are further confirmed using statistical methods and graphs. Finally, conclusions and future directions were presented..

                arXiv:2502.20027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FOX optimizer, inspired by red fox hunting behavior, is a powerful algorithm for solving real-world and engineering problems. However, despite balancing exploration and exploitation, it can prematurely converge to local optima, as agent positions are updated solely based on the current best-known position, causing all agents to converge on one location. This study proposes the modified FOX optimizer (mFOX) to enhance exploration and balance exploration and exploitation in three steps. First, the Oppositional-Based Learning (OBL) strategy is used to improve the initial population. Second, control parameters are refined to achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation. Third, a new update equation is introduced, allowing agents to adjust their positions relative to one another rather than relying solely on the best-known position. This approach improves exploration efficiency without adding complexity. The mFOX algorithm's performance is evaluated against 12 well-known algorithms on 23 classical benchmark functions, 10 CEC2019 functions, and 12 CEC2022 functions. It outperforms competitors in 74% of the classical benchmarks, 60% of the CEC2019 benchmarks, and 58% of the CEC2022 benchmarks. Additionally, mFOX effectively addresses four engineering problems. These results demonstrate mFOX's strong competitiveness in solving complex optimization tasks, including unimodal, constrained, and high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: Neural systems use the same underlying computational substrate to carry out analog filtering and signal processing operations, as well as discrete symbol manipulation and digital computation. Inspired by the computational principles of canonical cortical microcircuits, we propose a framework for using recurrent spiking neural networks to seamlessly and robustly switch between analog signal processing and categorical and discrete computation. We provide theoretical analysis and practical neural network design tools to formally determine the conditions for inducing this switch. We demonstrate the robustness of this framework experimentally with hardware soft Winner-Take-All and mixed-feedback recurrent spiking neural networks, implemented by appropriately configuring the analog neuron and synapse circuits of a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor chip.

                arXiv:2502.20050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the post-Moore era, the need for efficient solutions to non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) problems is becoming more pressing. In this context, the Ising model implemented by the probabilistic computing systems with probabilistic bits (p-bits) has attracted attention due to the widespread availability of p-bits and support for large-scale simulations. This study marks the first work to apply probabilistic computing to tackle protein folding, a significant NP-complete problem challenge in biology. We represent proteins as sequences of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) beads within a three-dimensional (3-D) grid and introduce a novel many-body interaction-based encoding method to map the problem onto an Ising model. Our simulations show that this approach significantly simplifies the energy landscape for short peptide sequences of six amino acids, halving the number of energy levels. Furthermore, the proposed mapping method achieves approximately 100 times acceleration for sequences consisting of ten amino acids in identifying the correct folding configuration. We predicted the optimal folding configuration for a peptide sequence of 36 amino acids by identifying the ground state. These findings highlight the unique potential of the proposed encoding method for solving protein folding and, importantly, provide new tools for solving similar NP-complete problems in biology by probabilistic computing approach.

                arXiv:2502.20113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most popular technique to train a neural network is backpropagation. Recently, the Forward-Forward technique has also been introduced for certain learning tasks. However, in real life, human learning does not follow any of these techniques exclusively. The way a human learns is basically a combination of forward learning, backward propagation and cooperation. Humans start learning a new concept by themselves and try to refine their understanding hierarchically during which they might come across several doubts. The most common approach to doubt solving is a discussion with peers, which can be called cooperation. Cooperation/discussion/knowledge sharing among peers is one of the most important steps of learning that humans follow. However, there might still be a few doubts even after the discussion. Then the difference between the understanding of the concept and the original literature is identified and minimized over several revisions. Inspired by this, the paper introduces Forward-Cooperation-Backward (FCB) learning in a deep neural network framework mimicking the human nature of learning a new concept. A novel deep neural network architecture, called Multi Encoding Uni Decoding neural network model, has been designed which learns using the notion of FCB. A special lateral synaptic connection has also been introduced to realize cooperation. The models have been justified in terms of their performance in dimension reduction on four popular datasets. The ability to preserve the granular properties of data in low-rank embedding has been tested to justify the quality of dimension reduction. For downstream analyses, classification has also been performed. An experimental study on convergence analysis has been performed to establish the efficacy of the FCB learning strategy.

                arXiv:2502.20168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for robot learning. However, model-free RL (MFRL) requires a large number of environment interactions to learn successful control policies. This is due to the noisy RL training updates and the complexity of robotic systems, which typically involve highly non-linear dynamics and noisy sensor signals. In contrast, model-based RL (MBRL) not only trains a policy but simultaneously learns a world model that captures the environment's dynamics and rewards. The world model can either be used for planning, for data collection, or to provide first-order policy gradients for training. Leveraging a world model significantly improves sample efficiency compared to model-free RL. However, training a world model alongside the policy increases the computational complexity, leading to longer training times that are often intractable for complex real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a new method for accelerating model-based RL using state-space world models. Our approach leverages state-space models (SSMs) to parallelize the training of the dynamics model, which is typically the main computational bottleneck. Additionally, we propose an architecture that provides privileged information to the world model during training, which is particularly relevant for partially observable environments. We evaluate our method in several real-world agile quadrotor flight tasks, involving complex dynamics, for both fully and partially observable environments. We demonstrate a significant speedup, reducing the world model training time by up to 10 times, and the overall MBRL training time by up to 4 times. This benefit comes without compromising performance, as our method achieves similar sample efficiency and task rewards to state-of-the-art MBRL methods.

Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges associated with algorithm configuration. However, making an RL agent work properly is a non-trivial task, especially in reward design, which necessitates a substantial amount of handcrafted knowledge based on domain expertise. In this work, we study the importance of reward design in the context of DAC via a case study on controlling the population size of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA optimizing OneMax. We observed that a poorly designed reward can hinder the RL agent's ability to learn an optimal policy because of a lack of exploration, leading to both scalability and learning divergence issues. To address those challenges, we propose the application of a reward shaping mechanism to facilitate enhanced exploration of the environment by the RL agent. Our work not only demonstrates the ability of RL in dynamically configuring the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$-GA, but also confirms the advantages of reward shaping in the scalability of RL agents across various sizes of OneMax problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07375">A RankNet-Inspired Surrogate-Assisted Hybrid Metaheuristic for Expensive Coverage Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.07375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coverage optimization generally involves deploying a set of facilities to best satisfy the demands of specified points, with broad applications in fields such as location science and sensor networks. Recent applications reveal that the subset site selection coupled with continuous angular parameter optimization can be formulated as Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems (MVOPs). Meanwhile, high-fidelity discretization and visibility analysis significantly increase computational cost and complexity, evolving the MVOP into an Expensive Mixed-Variable Optimization Problem (EMVOP). While canonical Evolutionary Algorithms have yielded promising results, their reliance on numerous fitness evaluations is too costly for our problem. Furthermore, most surrogate-assisted methods face limitations due to their reliance on regression-based models. To address these issues, we propose the RankNet-Inspired Surrogate-assisted Hybrid Metaheuristic (RI-SHM), an extension of our previous work. RI-SHM integrates three key components: (1) a RankNet-based pairwise global surrogate that innovatively predicts rankings between pairs of individuals, bypassing the challenges of fitness estimation in discontinuous solution space; (2) a surrogate-assisted local Estimation of Distribution Algorithm that enhances local exploitation and helps escape from local optima; and (3) a fitness diversity-driven switching strategy that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively handle large-scale coverage optimization tasks of up to 300 dimensions and more than 1,800 targets within desirable runtime. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for EMVOPs, RI-SHM consistently outperforms them by up to 56.5$\%$ across all tested instances.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17394">Continual learning with the neural tangent ensemble</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.17394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural strategy for continual learning is to weigh a Bayesian ensemble of fixed functions. This suggests that if a (single) neural network could be interpreted as an ensemble, one could design effective algorithms that learn without forgetting. To realize this possibility, we observe that a neural network classifier with N parameters can be interpreted as a weighted ensemble of N classifiers, and that in the lazy regime limit these classifiers are fixed throughout learning. We call these classifiers the neural tangent experts and show they output valid probability distributions over the labels. We then derive the likelihood and posterior probability of each expert given past data. Surprisingly, the posterior updates for these experts are equivalent to a scaled and projected form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over the network weights. Away from the lazy regime, networks can be seen as ensembles of adaptive experts which improve over time. These results offer a new interpretation of neural networks as Bayesian ensembles of experts, providing a principled framework for understanding and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings.

	<p>Background: Both transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and acupuncture are promising methods for managing chronic low back pain (cLBP), however, their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: To explore the neural mechanisms of tDCS and acupuncture on cLBP, we examined how real and sham tDCS applied to the bilateral motor cortex (M1), combined with real or sham acupuncture, influenced cerebral blood flow (CBF) using pulsed continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) imaging. tDCS was administered over six sessions, combined with real or sham acupuncture, over one month. Results: Following real tDCS, we observed increased CBF in the bilateral occipital cortex, precuneus, left hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus/posterior cingulate cortex. After sham tDCS, CBF decreased in regions including the bilateral superior parietal lobule, precuneus, bilateral precentral and postcentral gyri, and left angular gyrus. Real acupuncture led to reduced CBF in the bilateral occipital cortex and hippocampus, and left posterior cingulate gyrus, and increased CBF in the right postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and frontal areas. Sham acupuncture was associated with decreased CBF in the bilateral hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus. Conclusions: These results suggest both shared and distinct patterns of CBF changes between real and sham tDCS, as well as between real and sham acupuncture, reflecting mode-dependent effects on brain networks involved in pain processing and modulation. Our findings highlight the different neural circuits implicated in the therapeutic mechanisms of tDCS and acupuncture in the management of cLBP.</p>

	<p>Background: Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCCs) are a rare disorder of various etiologies referred to as transient lesions of the splenium of the corpus callosum, with a usually mild clinical course. Epstein&amp;amp;ndash;Barr virus (EBV) is one of the factors potentially responsible for triggering this abnormality. Results: The authors present the case of a 15-year-old girl, so far without any health burden, who suffered from severe CLOCCs with the etiology of EBV. The patient was admitted to hospital because of hepatosplenomegaly and hypertransaminasemia. Her condition rapidly deteriorated&amp;amp;mdash;she had seizures with respiratory failure, requiring treatment in the PICU. The first MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan showed changes in the hippocampus, and, in the early control, changes like those of CLOCCs; in follow-up studies (one and three months after the onset of respiratory failure), a gradual incomplete regression of the changes in the corpus callosum was seen. Her clinical condition improved quickly, with no seizures during the follow-up and no signs of focal CNS deficits. Cases of CLOCCs are reported as a secondary syndrome connected with many disease entities (e.g., toxic, infectious, and metabolic). The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to severe cases demanding intensive treatment. The diagnosis is determined via an MRI examination. Conclusions: The general prognosis for CLOCCs is good, though the normalization of a brain MRI can take several months. As the only method of showing CLOCCs, MRI is the imaging gold standard. Still, clinical abnormalities often precede radiological changes, as was the case with the reported patient.</p>

                <p>Transgenic mice provide unprecedented access to manipulate and visualize neural circuits; however, those on a C57BL/6 background develop progressive hearing loss, significantly confounding systems-level and behavioral analysis. While outbreeding can limit hearing loss, it introduces strain variability and complicates the generation of complex genotypes. Here, we propose an approach to preserve hearing by crossing transgenic mice with congenic B6.CAST-<I>Cdh23<sup>Ahl</sup></I><sup>+</sup> mice, which maintain low-threshold hearing into adulthood. Widefield and two-photon imaging of the auditory cortex revealed that 2.5-month-old C57BL/6 mice exhibit elevated thresholds to high-frequency tones and widespread cortical reorganization, with most neurons responding best to lower frequencies. In contrast, <I>Ahl+</I> C57BL/6 mice exhibited robust neural responses across tested frequencies and sound levels (4&ndash;64&nbsp;kHz, 30&ndash;90&nbsp;dB SPL) and retained low thresholds into adulthood. Our approach offers a cost-effective solution for generating complex genotypes and facilitates more interpretable systems neuroscience research by eliminating confounding effects from hearing loss.</p>

                Background Cayratia trifolia has been extensively studied for its bioactive components and medicinal properties. This study was carried out to evaluate the fermentation ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2.1 yeast to determine suitable fermentation conditions. Methods The suitable initial sugar content, temperature, and incubation time were investigated in the fermentation in the 100-milliliter flask scale. Besides, a trial fermentation at the 1-liter scale was conducted to assess yeast performance. Results All treatments showed that the total sugar content decreased after 9 days of fermentation compared to the initial level. Temperature during fermentation has a direct effect on yeast activity. Temperature increases the growth of yeast and the speed of enzyme activity. The fermentation time changes depending on temperature, initial soluble solid contents, and yeast strains, leading to changes in the ethanol content after the end of fermentation. The results showed that the S. cerevisiae 2.1 was able to ferment at room temperature with an initial pH of 4.5, 24 °Brix, and a yeast density of 107 cells/mL. The appropriate fermentation conditions determined for S. cerevisiae 2.1 were 24 °Brix and incubation at room temperature (28-33°C) with a fermentation time of 11 days. In 1-L scale fermentation, three-leaf cayratia wine had 9.46% (v/v) and the fermentation efficiency was 90.34%. The wine produced had a unique color, flavor, and aroma that met the sensory evaluation of the Vietnamese national standard TCVN-3217:79. Concusion The results showed that the S. cerevisiae 2.1 was able to produce wine from Cayratia trifolia extract in suitable conditions with high ethanol content and organoleptic values. The results of this study supplied needed information for further studies on analysis of bioactive compounds produced by the fermentation.

                Background This study investigates the mediating role of comfort (CMT), convenience (CNV), and aesthetics (AST) in the relationship between the enablers of an age-friendly built environment for walkability (BEW) and outcomes such as increased physical activity level (IPL), increased socialization (ISL), and improved quality of life (IQL) in older adults. The research emphasizes the importance of creating age-friendly environments to support the well-being and quality of life of older adults, with implications for urban planners and policymakers to promote sustainable and inclusive design. Methods The research follows a positivist paradigm using a quantitative approach and survey strategy with a cross-sectional design. A sample of 333 older adults was selected using the convenience sampling technique, and data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire. Results Findings from hypothesis testing indicate that, among the enablers, age-friendly urban design policies (AUP) are the most significant construct, positively impacting all three mediating variables. AST was found to have a significant positive effect on IPL and ISL, while CMT and CNV significantly influenced IPL and IQL, respectively. Conclusion These results suggest implications for urban planners and policymakers to enhance the contribution of BEW toward IPL, ISL, and IQL for older adults. The research offers valuable insights for academics and practitioners, emphasizing the importance of sustainable design while ensuring inclusivity to promote the well-being and quality of life of older adults.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1542/v2?src=rss">Assessment of occupational noise‐related hearing impairment among dental health personnel [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental professionals are exposed to either high level of noise which often becomes annoying over a time, and it is largely related to turbines and suctions used during the procedure. We performed this study with an aim to examine the occupational noise related hearing impairment among dentists and to know the need for efforts to reduce its impact on young dentists. Methods The study group comprised of 102 dentists (53 males and 49 females) final year dental students, interns and board students of family dentistry, endodontics, prosthodontics was enrolled between the age of 22 years to 33 years having a mean age of 25.60 years. The sound level meter is switched on to know the base noise level in the clinics and to know hearing ability of the dentist through a pre – recorded verbal communication. When the dentist starts the procedure, the same verbal communication is re-introduced and based on his reaction the decibel level is increased to a point where he can understand it. The same is followed after the procedure. Results Using T – test the age and gender mean was assessed, while ANNOVA test was used to know the hearing impairment and its mean before, during and after procedure. We have found that before the procedure has started the mean general sound level in the clinics is 61.70 dB while during the procedure this mean sound level rises to 73.38dB suggesting there is an imminent increase of sound during the procedure and thereby associated impairment as males had a hearing mean of 58.37dB before the start of procedure which increased to 63.36dB during the procedure and after the procedure the mean is 61.91dB; while for the females it was 58.60dB before the start of procedure while during the procedure the mean increased to 64.51dB and after the procedure the mean is 61.03dB suggesting an eminent impairment in the hearing ability even though the procedure is completed. Discussion and Conclusion We have highlighted few guidelines from various studies which range from reducing multiple turbine usage at a given point of treatment wherever possible to a recommendation to use ear plugs for those procedures related to high noise levels. Although there are few noise cancellation devices in the market, dental professionals need something that is specific to their requirements, because commercially available products are built and developed for other purposes. Our study was not able to highlight which procedures have a greater noise impact to suggest specific recommendations.

                Background The Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI) has been verified among a variety of populations. However, there is a lack of existing research on its comprehensive psychometric properties, specifically when used with nursing students. This study examined the WHOQOL-BREF’s unique psychometric features with Thai nursing students in northeast Thailand. Methods In this cross-sectional study, Thai nursing students were recruited using multi-stage simple random sampling from universities located in the northeast of Thailand. The data was collected via self-assessment questionnaires, and the 3,570 participants were then randomly split into two subsamples (group 1, n=2,000, and group 2, n=1,570). After reducing the number of items using statistical methods, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out on group 1 to explore the factor structure of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Finally, group 2 was used in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the EFA’s modified structure along with an assessment of the construct validity of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Results Principal component analysis on a random subsample supported a four-factor model with 24 items, originally suggested for factorial construct validity; these 24 items were distributed across the original four domain. The domain structure for the purpose showed a good fit in the CFA on the other subsample. Internal reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha was greater than 0.70) for both the total scale and subscales. In terms of convergent validity, average variance extracted (AVE) revealed that all WHOQOL-BREF-THAI subscales achieved convergence, with AVE values ranging from 0.50 to 0.69. Conclusion These results reveal that the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI is a valid and reliable tool which health care providers can utilize to measure QOL among Thai nursing students. Therefore, the WHOQOL-BREF can serve as an essential tool for researching the factors influencing nursing students’ QOL, with implications for nursing education.

                <p>by Alexandra Teslya, Janneke Cornelia Maria Heijne, Maarten Franciscus Schim van der Loeff, Ard van Sighem, Jacob Aiden Roberts, Maartje Dijkstra, Godelieve J de Bree, Axel Jeremias Schmidt, Kai J Jonas, Mirjam E Kretzschmar, Ganna Rozhnova</p>

The number of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands has been decreasing, but additional efforts are required to bring it further down. This study aims to assess the impact of increased diagnosis of early HIV infection combined with immediate antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation on reducing HIV transmission among MSM. We developed an agent-based model calibrated to HIV surveillance and sexual behavior data for MSM in the Netherlands in 2017-2022. Starting in 2023, we simulated a 10-year intervention that accelerates HIV diagnosis during the first 3 or 6 months after HIV acquisition across five levels of increased diagnosis rates (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32-fold), followed by immediate ART initiation. The upper limit of the intervention’s impact over 10 years is projected to result in the cumulative 298 (95-th QI: 162–451) HIV infections averted. A 32-fold increase in the diagnosis rate within 3 months after HIV acquisition (corresponding to 100% of all new HIV infections diagnosed within 3 months of acquisition) results in 269 (95-th QI: 147–400) infections averted, approaching closely maximum impact. By extending the scope of the intervention to individuals who acquired HIV infection within the previous 6 months, a smaller 8-fold increase in the diagnosis rate (corresponding to 97% of new HIV infections diagnosed within 6 months of acquisition) approaches closely the maximum impact of the intervention by averting 256 (95-th QI: 122–411) HIV infections. Our sensitivity analyses showed, that in an epidemiological context similar to the modern-day the Netherlands, immediate initiation of ART accompanying accelerated diagnosis of individuals with early HIV infection does not significantly affect HIV transmission dynamics. Accelerating early HIV diagnosis through increased awareness, screening, and testing can further reduce transmission among MSM. Meeting this goal necessitates a stakeholder needs assessment.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>As a monovalent cation channel, the transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channel is a unique member of the transient receptor potential family. Abnormal TRPM4 activity has been identified in various neurologic disorders, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pathologic pain, and epilepsy. Following brain hypoxia/ischemia and inflammation, TRPM4 up-regulation and enhanced activity contribute to the cell death of neurons, vascular endothelial cells, and astrocytes. Enhanced ionic influx via TRPM4 leads to cell volume increase and oncosis. Depolarization of membrane potential following TRPM4 activation and interaction between TRPM4 and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors exacerbate excitotoxicity during hypoxia. Importantly, TRPM4 expression and activity remain low in healthy neurons, making it an ideal drug target. Current approaches to inhibit or modulate the TRPM4 channel have various limitations that hamper the interpretation of TRPM4 physiology in the nervous system and potentially hinder their translation into therapy. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiologic roles of TRPM4 and the different inhibitors that modulate TRPM4 activity for potential treatment of neurologic diseases.

                Hou et al. demonstrate that TOLLIP forms IDR-dependent condensates upon RNA viral infection. TOLLIP condensates promote the aggregation of SUMO protease SENP1 and enhance the interaction between SENP1 and MAVS in mitochondria, consequently leading to deSUMOylation of MAVS and attenuation of RLR signaling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101825">Characterization of direct Purkinje cell outputs to the brainstem</a></h4>

              
                Purkinje cells (PCs) primarily project to cerebellar nuclei but also directly innervate the brainstem. Some PC-brainstem projections have been described previously, but most have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we use a PC-specific cre line to anatomically and electrophysiologically characterize PC projections to the brainstem. PC synapses are surprisingly widespread, with the highest densities found in the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. However, there are pronounced regional differences in synaptic densities within both the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. Large optogenetically evoked PC-IPSCs are preferentially observed in subregions with the highest densities of putative PC boutons, suggesting that PCs selectively influence these areas and the behaviors they regulate. Unexpectedly, the pontine central gray and nearby subnuclei also contained a low density of putative PC boutons, and large PC-IPSCs are observed in a small fraction of cells. We combined electrophysiological recordings with immunohistochemistry to assess the molecular identities of two potential PC targets: PC synapses onto mesencephalic trigeminal neurons were not observed even though these cells are in close proximity to PC boutons; PC synapses onto locus coeruleus neurons are exceedingly rare or absent, even though previous studies concluded that PCs are a major input to these neurons. The availability of a highly selective cre line for PCs allowed us to study functional synapses, while avoiding complications that can accompany the use of viral approaches. We conclude that PCs directly innervate numerous brainstem nuclei, and in many nuclei they strongly inhibit a small fraction of cells. This suggests that PCs selectively target cell types with specific behavioral roles in the brainstem.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100735">Emerging cooperativity between Oct4 and Sox2 governs the pluripotency network in early mouse embryos</a></h4>

              
                During the first lineage segregation, mammalian embryos generate the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). ICM gives rise to the epiblast (EPI) that forms all cell types of the body, an ability referred to as pluripotency. The molecular mechanisms that induce pluripotency in embryos remain incompletely elucidated. Using knockout (KO) mouse models in conjunction with low-input ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 gradually come into play in the early ICM, coinciding with the initiation of Sox2 expression. Oct4 and Sox2 activate the pluripotency-related genes through the putative OCT-SOX enhancers in the early ICM. Furthermore, we observed a substantial reorganization of chromatin landscape and transcriptome from the morula to the early ICM stages, which was partially driven by Oct4 and Sox2, highlighting their pivotal role in promoting the developmental trajectory toward the ICM. Our study provides new insights into the establishment of the pluripotency network in mouse preimplantation embryos.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101127">PROTAC-induced protein structural dynamics in targeted protein degradation</a></h4>

              
                PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) are small molecules that induce target protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. PROTACs recruit the target protein and E3 ligase; a critical first step is forming a ternary complex. However, while the formation of a ternary complex is crucial, it may not always guarantee successful protein degradation. The dynamics of the PROTAC-induced degradation complex play a key role in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In this study, we computationally modelled protein complex structures and dynamics associated with a series of PROTACs featuring different linkers to investigate why these PROTACs, all of which formed ternary complexes with Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase and the target protein bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4<sup>BD1</sup>), exhibited varying degrees of degradation potency. We constructed the degradation machinery complexes with Culling-Ring Ligase 4A (CRL4A) E3 ligase scaffolds. Through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we illustrated how PROTAC-dependent protein dynamics facilitating the arrangement of surface lysine residues of BRD4<sup>BD1</sup> into the catalytic pocket of E2/ubiquitin cascade for ubiquitination. Despite featuring identical warheads in this PROTAC series, the linkers were found to affect the residue-interaction networks, and thus governing the essential motions of the entire degradation machine for ubiquitination. These findings offer a structural dynamic perspective on ligand-induced protein degradation, providing insights to guide future PROTAC design endeavors.

">Copper supplementation mitigates Parkinson-like wild-type SOD1 pathology and nigrostriatal degeneration in a novel mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Wild-type superoxide dismutase 1 (disSOD1) protein misfolding and deposition is implicated in the death of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons in Parkinson disease. Regionally reduced copper availability, and subsequent reduced copper binding to SOD1, is a key factor driving the development of this pathology, suggesting brain copper supplementation may constitute an effective means of preventing its formation. We evaluated the potential of the blood-brain-barrier-permeable copper delivery drug, CuATSM, to attenuate the misfolding and deposition of wild-type disSOD1, and associated neuron death, in a novel mouse model that expresses this pathology. Using proteomic and elemental mass spectrometry, together with biochemical and histological workflows, we demonstrated copper supplementation corrects altered post-translational modifications on soluble SOD1 and improves the enzymatic activity of the protein in the brains of these animals. These changes were associated with a significant reduction in disSOD1 pathology and preservation of dopamine neurons in the SN, which were highly correlated with tissue copper levels. These data position wild-type disSOD1 pathology as a novel drug target for Parkinson disease and suggest that brain copper supplementation may constitute an effective means of slowing SN dopamine neuron death in this disorder.

">Mapping Hand Function with Simultaneous Brain-Spinal Cord Functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Hand motor control depends on intricate brain-spinal cord interactions that regulate muscle activity. Hand function can be disrupted by injury to the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves leading to weakness and impaired coordination. Functional MRI (fMRI) can map motor-related neural activity and potentially characterize the mechanisms underlying hand weakness and diminished coordination. Although brain motor control has been extensively studied, spinal cord mechanisms remain less explored. Here we use simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI to map neural activity related to hand strength and dexterity across the central nervous system using force matching and finger tapping tasks. This study pioneers the use of simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI to comprehensively map hand function, offering novel insights into coordinated motor processing across the central nervous system. METHODS: We performed simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI in 28 right-handed healthy volunteers (age: 40.0 {+/-} 13.8 years, 14 females, 14 males) using a 3T GE SIGNA Premier scanner equipped with a 21-channel head-neck coil. Participants performed a force-matching task at 10%, 20%, and 30% of maximum voluntary contraction using a hand dynamometer. For the finger tapping task, participants completed button-presses at 1 Hz with a 5-button response pad for three task levels: single-digit response with the second digit only (low), single-digit response with all digits in a sequential order (medium), single-digit response with all digits in a random order (high). Visual cues and feedback were provided during the tasks. Brain and spinal cord images were processed separately using FSL and the Spinal Cord Toolbox, with motion correction, physiological noise filtering, and spatial normalization to standard templates. Subject level activity maps were generated and entered into group level analyses to explore both activations and deactivations. For the brain, we used a mixed effect design with a voxelwise threshold of Z score > 3.10 and cluster threshold of p < 0.05. For the spinal cord, we used a fixed effect design with a voxelwise threshold of Z score > 1.64 and cluster threshold of p < 0.05. Region of interest (ROI) analyses were conducted to examine localized changes in activation across task levels RESULTS: Both tasks elicited activation in motor and sensory regions of the brain and spinal cord, with graded responses in the left primary motor (M1), left primary sensory (S1) cortex, and right spinal cord gray matter across task levels. Deactivation of the right M1 and S1 was also present for both tasks. Deactivation of the left spinal cord gray matter was present in the high task level of the force matching task. The ROI analysis findings complemented the group level activity maps. DISCUSSION: Our study provides a detailed map of brain-spinal cord interactions in hand function, revealing graded neural activation and inhibition patterns across motor and sensory regions. Interhemispheric inhibition, reflected in right M1 deactivation, likely restricts extraneous motor output during unilateral tasks. For force matching, the deactivation of the left ventral and dorsal horns of the spinal cord, provides the first evidence that the inhibition of motor areas during a unilateral motor task extends to the spinal cord. Whether this inhibition results from direct descending modulation from the brain or interneuronal inhibition in the cord remains to be interrogated. These findings expand our understanding of central motor control mechanisms and could inform rehabilitation strategies for individuals with motor impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Our simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI approach provides novel insights into the neural coordination of hand function, enhancing our understanding of motor control and its modulation. This approach may offer a foundation for studying motor dysfunction in conditions such as stroke, spinal cord injury, and neurodegenerative diseases.

                Miniaturized two-photon imaging devices enable real-time in vivo and in situ imaging at subcellular resolution, highly valuable for clinical applications and basic research (such as neuroscience). However, achieving high-quality volumetric imaging at varying depths remains challenging. In this study, we demonstrated a 2P fiberscope capable of three-dimensional imaging over a cylindrical volume of a 350 m diameter and a 400 m depth. Depth scanning was achieved by incorporating a miniature electrowetting-based varioptic lens (VL) into a two-dimensional scanning 2P fiberscope, whose focus was tuned by modulating the VL drive voltage. The performance of the fiberscope was first characterized using phantoms and then demonstrated by ex vivo imaging of fluorescently stained convallaria and GFP mouse brain sections, as well as in vivo dynamic GCaMP-based calcium imaging of cortical neurons in an awake mouse.

">Growth hormone is required for hippocampal engram cell maturation</a></h4>

              
                Memory is thought to be stored in a sparse population of neurons or synapses 1. These neurons or synapses collectively termed the engram are necessary and sufficient for memory recall 2,3. Learning induces synaptic strengthening in engram cells at both pre- and postsynaptic sites 4,5. However, the critical time window and the molecule related to the induction of such synaptic changes are unknown. Here we show that the initial translation plays a key role in engram maturation by facilitating pre- and postsynaptic strengthening and that growth hormone (GH) is required to induce this process in the Dentate Gyrus. Using anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, we found that blocking the initial and the subsequent second wave of translation arrests the maturation of engram cells. Revisiting our hippocampal translatome during memory formation 6 proposed GH as a mediator of engram maturation. Overexpression of the dominant negative (G118R) GH blocked the maturation of the hippocampal engram cell 7. Facilitating activity-dependent GH uptake by injecting recombinant human GH (rhGH) into the animal rescued the arrestment caused by anisomycin. Together, our findings propose GH as a key mediator of hippocampal engram cell maturation.

">Microelectrode array scaled for recording human hippocampal slices</a></h4>

              
                Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures originating from the cortex, amygdala and especially hippocampus. While two-thirds of TLE patients achieve seizure control through medication, approximately one-third remain refractory to pharmacological interventions. For these individuals, surgical resection offers a potential curative option, with approximately 70% achieving seizure freedom. However, the pathogenesis of TLE remains incompletely understood, necessitating further investigation. Therefore, resected brain tissue obtained during the surgery provides a valuable resource for ex vivo study of pathological neuronal activity. Currently, microelectrode array (MEA) technology is widely used for electrophysiological studies. However, commercially available MEAs are limited in their ability to record from large tissue samples, such as an entire hippocampal section. To address this limitation, we have developed a custom MEA and sample chamber compatible with commercially available headstages. This system enables recording of extracellular action potentials (EAPs) and local field potentials (LFPs) across human hippocampal tissue, providing a valuable tool for investigating the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying TLE.

">Unraveling the distinct motion bias of TrkA-NGF complex in NGFR100W-driven HSAN V disease</a></h4>

              
                Nerve growth factor (NGF), which binds to tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) receptor, plays essential roles in neuronal survival and function and is also a potent mediator of pain sensation. Mutations in NGF, particularly NGFR100W, cause hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy V (HSAN V), which is characterized by insensitivity to pain but without impairment of neurotrophin function. Even though several studies reported the mechanism of growing HSAN V disease, the dynamic mechanisms that dictate its functional specificity remain unclear. In this study, we performed a microsecond scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to elucidate the changes in the structural dynamics of NGF by NGFR100W at an atomic level to dissect the distinct motion bias for specific TrkA functions. We found that the NGFR100W reduced NGF dimerization while its binding to the TrkA remained unchanged. NGFR100W enhanced the magnitude of bond formation in the different regions from TrkA, which induced different correlated and dynamic motions associated with impaired nociceptive signaling. The dynamics scenario from this study, shedding light on the deleterious role of NGFR100W, provides new structural insights into the function-oriented dynamics motion of the TrkA-NGF complex, offering potential avenues for designing new therapeutics.

">Distinct distributed brain networks dissociate self-generated mental states</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition relies on two modes: a perceptually-coupled mode where mental states are driven by sensory input and a perceptually-decoupled mode featuring self-generated mental content. Past work suggests that imagined states are supported by the reinstatement of activity in sensory cortex, but transmodal systems within the canonical default network are also implicated in mind-wandering, recollection, and imagining the future. We identified brain systems supporting self-generated states using precision fMRI. Participants imagined different scenarios in the scanner, then rated their mental states on several properties using multi-dimensional experience sampling. We found that thinking involving scenes evoked activity within or near the default network, while imagining speech evoked activity within or near the language network. Imagining-related regions overlapped with activity evoked by viewing scenes or listening to speech, respectively; however, this overlap was predominantly within transmodal association networks, rather than adjacent unimodal sensory networks. The results suggest that different association networks support imagined states that are high in visual or auditory vividness.

">Decoding the neural basis of sensory phenotypes in Autism</a></h4>

              
                Background: Differences in sensory processing are a defining characteristic of autism, affecting up to 87% of autistic individuals. These differences cause widespread perceptual changes that can negatively impact cognition, development, and daily functioning. Recent research identified five sensory processing phenotypes with varied behavioural presentations; however, their neural basis remains unclear. This study aims to ground these sensory phenotypes in unique patterns of functional connectivity. Methods: We analyzed data from 146 autistic participants in the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Network. We classified participants into sensory phenotypes using k-means clustering of scores from the Short Sensory Profile. We then computed a connectivity matrix from 200 cortical and 32 subcortical regions and calculated graph-theoretic measures (betweenness centrality, strength, local efficiency, clustering coefficient) to assess information exchange between these regions. We then trained machine learning models to use these measures to classify between all pairs of sensory phenotypes. Results: We replicated that our sample of autistic participants was best categorized into five sensory phenotypes. The machine learning models distinguished 7/10 phenotype pairs using graph-theoretic measures (p < 0.005). Information exchange within and between the somatomotor network, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex and subcortical areas were highly predictive of sensory phenotype. Conclusions: This study shows that distinct sensory phenotypes in autism correspond with unique patterns of functional connectivity. Cortical, subcortical, and network-level connectivity all play a role in shaping distinct sensory processing styles in autism. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding these phenotypes and highlight opportunities to develop interventions in cases of maladaptive sensory processing

">INFLUENCE OF LIFESTYLE ON BRAIN SENSITIVITY TO CIRCULATING INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 1</a></h4>

              
                Life style conditions such as social relationships and diet impinge on mood homeostasis, a mechanism that becomes dysregulated in high-incidence mental illnesses such as depression or Alzheimer dementia (AD). Since insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) modulates mood and its blood levels are altered both in AD and in affective disorders, we investigated whether its activity was altered in the brain of mice submitted to isolation or fed with a high-fat diet (HFD). As in humans, both life style conditions increased anxiety and depression-like behavior. Significantly, both life style conditions abrogated neuronal responses to systemic IGF-1. Thus, enhanced neuronal activity in response to intraperitoneal IGF-1, as determined by Ca++ fiber-photometry in the prefrontal cortex, was lost in isolated or HFD-fed mice. However, only the latter had elevated serum IGF-1 levels. These findings suggest that loss of brain IGF-1 input may contribute to mood disturbances observed in lonely and obese subjects. Furthermore, they provide additional insight into the heightened risk of depression and Alzheimer's disease associated with these conditions. Importantly, since the reduction of IGF-1 activity in the brain is not consistently mirrored by its serum levels, serum measurements do not reliably reflect brain IGF-1 activity.

">Physical Network Constraints Define the Lognormal Architecture of the Brain's Connectome</a></h4>

              
                The brain has long been conceptualized as a network of neurons connected by synapses. However, attempts to describe the connectome using established network science models have yielded conflicting outcomes, leaving the architecture of neural networks unresolved. Here, by performing a comparative analysis of eight experimentally mapped connectomes, we find that their degree distributions cannot be captured by the well-established random or scale-free models. Instead, the node degrees and strengths are well approximated by lognormal distributions, although these lack a mechanistic explanation in the context of the brain. By acknowledging the physical network nature of the brain, we show that neuron size is governed by a multiplicative process, which allows us to analytically derive the lognormal nature of the neuron length distribution. Our framework not only predicts the degree and strength distributions across each of the eight connectomes, but also yields a series of novel and empirically falsifiable relationships between different neuron characteristics. The resulting multiplicative network represents a novel architecture for network science, whose distinctive quantitative features bridge critical gaps between neural structure and function, with implications for brain dynamics, robustness, and synchronization.

">AIRUS: a simple workflow for AI-assisted exploration of scientific data</a></h4>

              
                The development "reasoning" large language models (LLMs) seems poised to transform data analysis in all fields of science. This note describes a simple, iterative workflow termed AIRUS (AI Research Under Supervision), that allows working scientists, including those who lack extensive AI or programming expertise, to immediately start taking advantage of these capabilities. In the proposed workflow, a researcher uses an LLM to generate hypotheses, produce code, interpret results, and refine its approach in repeated cycles, only intervening when necessary. This can be run by simple cut-and-paste of code and results between web-based LLMs and an online Jupyter notebook. We demonstrate the workflow with two examples: one analysis of synthetic data, and one analysis of data from the International Brain Lab.

	<p>Background/Objectives. Mirror properties of the action observation network (AON) can be modulated through Hebbian-like associative plasticity using paired associative stimulation (PAS). We recently introduced a visuomotor protocol (mirror&amp;amp;ndash;PAS, m-PAS) that pairs transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) with visual stimuli of ipsilateral (to TMS) movements, leading to atypical corticospinal excitability (CSE) facilitation (i.e., motor resonance) during PAS-conditioned action observation. While m-PAS aftereffects are robust, little is known about markers of associative plasticity during its administration and their predictive value for subsequent motor resonance rewriting. The present study aims to fill this gap by investigating CSE modulations during m-PAS and their relationship with the protocol&amp;amp;rsquo;s aftereffects. Methods. We analyzed CSE dynamics in 81 healthy participants undergoing the m-PAS before and after passively observing left- or right-hand index finger movements. Here, typical and PAS-conditioned motor resonance was assessed with TMS over the right M1. We examined CSE changes during the m-PAS and used linear regression models to explore their relationship with motor resonance modulations. Results. m-PAS transiently reshaped both typical and PAS-induced motor resonance. Importantly, we found a gradual increase in CSE during m-PAS, which predicted the loss of typical motor resonance but not the emergence of atypical responses after the protocol&amp;amp;rsquo;s administration. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the motor resonance reshaping induced by the m-PAS is not entirely predictable by CSE online modulations. Likely, this rewriting is the product of a large-scale reorganization of the AON rather than a phenomenon restricted to the PAS-stimulated motor cortex. This study underlines that monitoring CSE during non-invasive brain stimulation protocols could provide valuable insight into some but not all plastic outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background: The relationship between routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing and clinical and prognostic data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains unclear. Additionally, biochemical data have never been correlated with markers of neurodegeneration. The purpose of this study is to determine whether lumbar puncture may still have clinical utility in ALS. Methods: We collected the CSF profiles of 140 ALS subjects. CSF protein, albumin, IgG, IgG index, albumin quotient (QAlb), t-tau, p-tau, and A&amp;amp;beta;42 were analyzed. Results: Approximately one-quarter of ALS patients had elevated levels of protein, albumin, and QAlb in the CSF, but these were not associated with clinical or survival data. Among the neurodegeneration markers, the percentage of patients with abnormal values ranged from 26.3% to 35.4%. The p-tau/t-tau ratio and A&amp;amp;beta;42 were correlated with both the ALS progression rate and the time from diagnosis to death. A&amp;amp;beta;42 was the prognostic marker most strongly associated with survival. Conclusions: The lack of correlation between biochemical CSF findings and the clinical and/or prognostic status of ALS suggests that these markers have no clinical value. However, neurodegeneration markers that are easily measurable in clinical laboratories, particularly A&amp;amp;beta;42, may be useful at the time of diagnosis for predicting ALS survival and progression rate.</p>

	<p>Background: Referred pain frequently co-exists with visceral pain. However, the exact mechanism governing referred somatic hyperalgesia remains elusive. Methods: By injecting 20% acetic acid into the stomach, we established a mouse model of gastric ulcer (GU). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;amp;E) staining was used as the evaluation criterion for the gastric ulcer model. Evan&amp;amp;rsquo;s blue (EB) and von Frey tests detected the somatic sensitized area. The DRG neurons distributed among the spinal segments of the sensitized area were prepared for biochemical and electrophysiological experiments. The CCR2 antagonist was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected into GU mice to test the effect of blocking CCR2 on somatic neurogenic inflammation. Results: GU not only instigated neurogenic plasma extravasation and referred somatic allodynia in the upper back regions spanning the T9 to T11 segments but also augmented the co-expression of T-type Ca2+ channels and CCR2 and led to the gating properties of T-type Ca2+ channel alteration in T9&amp;amp;ndash;T11 small-diameter DRG neurons. Moreover, the administration of the CCR2 antagonist inhibited the T-type Ca2+ channel activation, consequently mitigating neurogenic inflammation and referred somatic hyperalgesia. The application of the CCR2 agonist to normal T9&amp;amp;ndash;T11 small-diameter DRG neurons simulates the changes in the gating properties of T-type Ca2+ channel that occur in the GU group. Conclusions: Therefore, these findings indicate that CCR2 may function as a critical regulator in the generation of neurogenic inflammation and mechanical allodynia by modulating the gating properties of the T-type Ca2+ channels.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Hypoglossal nerve palsy (HNP) is a rare complication after cervical spine surgery and is reported after both anterior and posterior approaches. It often presents with dysarthria, dysphagia, and hoarseness. We present a systematic review of the literature and two cases of patients presenting with confirmed HNP after anterior cervical spine surgery. Methods: Two retrospective case reports and a systematic review of the literature were presented. The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were systematically searched from inception. Results: In total, 17 cases of HNP were reported in the literature, including the two hereby presented. Ten cases involved the anterior approach and seven the posterior approach. The reported risk of HNP following cervical spine surgery varied between 0.01% and 2.5% depending on the procedure. The main etiology was mechanical compression of the nerve. Most of the cases recovered within a few months with conservative treatment. In some cases, permanent hypoglossal injury with persistent symptoms was reported. In both of the current cases, the symptoms gradually improved and completely resolved after a few months. Conclusions: HNP is a rare complication after cervical spine surgery. The causes of hypoglossal palsy are multifactorial, but mechanical injury is the most common. A thorough understanding of the nerve&amp;amp;rsquo;s anatomy is essential to minimize the risk of injury during anesthesia, patient positioning, and surgery. Understanding the underlying mechanisms contributing to HNP post-cervical spine surgery enables the implementation of preventive measures to mitigate its occurrence.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a critical exercise-induced modulator of various neuroplasticity processes, including adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Environmental affordance for physical activity is a novel theory that aims to increase the BDNF through walking or climbing stairs, stimulated by the urban and interior environment. In a systematic review, this paper explores the association between walking, as a structured or free-living form of physical activity, and changes in the BDNF in humans with healthy locomotion. Method: A systematic review with a registered protocol, INPLASY2024110093, and following the PRISMA guidelines, includes English-language original research articles on adult and older adult human subjects who are locomotor-healthy, studies on walking as a structured exercise or free-living physical activity that is presented in a non-combined intervention, and must report changes in the BDNF as a dependent variable. The search was conducted using three databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, resulting in 21 eligible studies. Results: This systematic review finds that the impact of walking on the BDNF is evidenced, but subject to moderate to high intensities in single bouts. At the same time, the long-term effects are yet to be fully understood, potentially due to the uptake of the BDNF for functional brain improvements, neuroplasticity processes, or muscle repair, instead of an accumulation of the BDNF itself, yet still confirm the important role of the BDNF for neurosustainability. Age and environmental factors such as heat are also found to affect the increase in the BDNF. The narrative synthesis provides elaborate explanations for understanding those complex dynamics before reaching future conclusions on the impact of walking or environmental affordance for physical activity on the changes in the BDNF concentrations. Conclusions: This systematic review highlights the potential role played by moderate- and high-intensity walking as a lifestyle intervention that can be utilised through the built environment to promote adaptive brain changes, through the sustainable regulation of the BDNF.</p>

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by neurodegeneration, axonal damage, demyelination, and inflammation. Recently, gut dysbiosis has been linked to MS and other autoimmune conditions. Namely, gut microbiota has a vital role in regulating immune function by influencing immune cell development, cytokine production, and intestinal barrier integrity. While balanced microbiota fosters immune tolerance, dysbiosis disrupts immune regulation, damages intestinal permeability, and heightens the risk of autoimmune diseases. The critical factor in shaping the gut microbiota and modulating immune response is diet. Research shows that high-fat diets rich in saturated fats are associated with disease progression. Conversely, diets rich in fruits, yogurt, and legumes may lower the risk of MS onset and progression. Specific dietary interventions, such as the Mediterranean diet (MD) and ketogenic diet, have shown potential to reduce inflammation, support neuroprotection, and promote CNS repair. Probiotics, by restoring microbial balance, may also help mitigate immune dysfunction noted in MS. Personalized dietary strategies targeting the gut microbiota hold promise for managing MS by modulating immune responses and slowing disease progression. Optimizing nutrient intake and adopting anti-inflammatory diets could improve disease control and quality of life. Understanding gut-immune interactions is essential for developing tailored nutritional therapies for MS patients.</p>

	<p>Neurological disorders are defined by a deterioration or disruption of the nervous system&amp;amp;rsquo;s structure and function. These diseases, which include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and schizophrenia, are caused by intricate pathological processes that include excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, genetic mutations, and compromised neurotrophic signaling. Although current pharmaceutical treatments relieve symptoms, their long-term efficacy is limited due to adverse side effects and weak neuroprotective properties. However, when combined with other neuroprotective drugs or adjunct therapy, they may offer additional benefits and improve treatment outcomes. Phytochemicals have emerged as attractive therapeutic agents due to their ability to regulate essential neurotrophic pathways, especially the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling cascade. BDNF is an important target for neurodegenerative disease (ND) treatment since it regulates neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. This review emphasizes the molecular pathways through which various phytochemicals&amp;amp;mdash;such as flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds&amp;amp;mdash;stimulate BDNF expression and modulate its downstream signaling pathways, including GSK-3&amp;amp;beta;, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, CREB, and Wnt/&amp;amp;beta;-catenin. This paper also highlights how phytochemical combinations may interact to enhance BDNF activity, offering new therapeutic options for ND treatment. Despite their potential for neuroprotection, phytochemicals face challenges related to pharmacokinetics, blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and absorption, highlighting the need for further research into combination therapies and improved formulations. Clinical assessment and mechanistic understanding of BDNF-targeted phytotherapy should be the main goals of future studies. The therapeutic efficacy of natural compounds in regulating neurotrophic signaling is highlighted in this review, providing a viable approach to the prevention and treatment of NDs.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Nerve transfer surgery is a state-of-the-art surgical approach to restore hand and arm function in individuals living with tetraplegia, significantly impacting daily life. While nearly a third of all individuals with chronic spinal cord injury may benefit from this intervention, variability in outcomes can limit the functional impact. A bedside to bench approach was taken to address the variable response of tetraplegic individuals to nerve transfer surgery. Methods: We used a hierarchical multiple factor analysis to evaluate the effects of conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) on outcomes in a mouse model of nerve transfer to treat chronic cervical spinal cord injury. Results: We found that CES of donor nerves one week prior to nerve transfer surgery enhanced anatomical and functional measures of innervation of targeted muscles. Furthermore, CES increased the rate of recovery of naturalistic behavior. Conclusions: While the model has some limitations due to the small size of the rodent, our results support the use of CES as an effective approach to improve outcomes in clinical nerve repair settings.</p>

                Objective Tuberculosis is a global health challenge with one-third of the world’s population infected by it. Although ocular side effects of Anti-tubercular drugs are well known, the patients generally report late in the course which can result in irreversible vision loss. The purpose of this study was to study the visual field changes during the time course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Methods A total of 48 patients were studied in this prospective type of study. All patients newly diagnosed with TB and started on treatment were included in the study. Baseline examination which included visual acuity, color vision, anterior segment, IOP, Amsler grid, fundus, and visual field test were performed before starting ATT and at 6-month follow-up. Results The mean age of the study population was 35.90 ± 10.2 years. 35 (72.9%) were males and 13 (27.1%) females. 32(66.6%) had pulmonary TB and the rest 16 (33.3%) had extrapulmonary TB. MDR TB was diagnosed in 27 (56.3%) of the patients with the rest 21 (43.8%) being drug sensitive. The baseline examination was normal in all 48 patients. 3(6.3%) out of 45 patients presented with visual complaints after the treatment initiation. Altogether 7 patients out of 48, had visual field defects at the 6-month follow-up. The incidence of visual field defects in our study was 14.6% with the value being significant (0.016). 8.3% had peripheral constriction of visual fields, 2.1% with Severe generalized depression of visual fields and 2.1% with central scotoma. Out of the 45 patients with no visual complaints at 6-month follow-up, 4 (8.33%) showed peripheral field constriction. Conclusion Visual field defects caused by ATT can precede clinical symptoms. Visual field evaluation can be an important tool for the early detection of optic neuropathy in patients receiving ATT in clinical settings where Visual evoked potential testing and RNFL-OCT are not available.

                <p>The detrimental effects of oligomeric amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) on synapses are considered the leading cause for cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. However, through which mechanism A&beta; oligomers impair synaptic structure and function remains unknown. Here, we used electrophysiology and amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) imaging on mouse and rat neurons to demonstrate that GluA3 expression in neurons lacking GluA3 is sufficient to resensitize their synapses to the damaging effects of A&beta;, indicating that GluA3-containing AMPARs at synapses are necessary and sufficient for A&beta; to induce synaptic deficits. We found that A&beta; oligomers trigger the endocytosis of GluA3 and promote its translocation toward endolysosomal compartments for degradation. Mechanistically, these A&beta;-driven effects critically depend on the PDZ-binding motif of GluA3. A single point mutation in the GluA3 PDZ-binding motif prevented A&beta;-driven effects and rendered synapses fully resistant to the effects of A&beta;. Correspondingly, proteomics on synaptosome fractions from APP/PS1-transgenic mice revealed a selective reduction of GluA3 at an early age. These findings support a model where the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of GluA3-containing AMPARs are a critical early step in the cascade of events through which A&beta; accumulation causes a loss of synapses.</p>

                <p>Generative models have diverse applications, including language processing and birdsong analysis. In this study, we demonstrate how a statistical test, designed to prevent overgeneralization in sequence generation, can be used to infer minimal models for the syllable sequences in Bengalese finch songs. We focus on the partially observable Markov model (POMM), which consists of states and the probabilistic transitions between them. Each state is associated with a specific syllable, with the possibility that multiple states may correspond to the same syllable. This characteristic differentiates the POMM from a standard Markov model, where each syllable is linked to a single state. The presence of multiple states for a syllable suggests that transitions between syllables are influenced by the specific contexts in which these transitions occur. We apply this method to analyze the songs of six adult male Bengalese finches, both before and after they were deafened. Our results indicate that auditory feedback plays a crucial role in shaping the context-dependent syllable transitions characteristic of Bengalese finch songs.</p>

                <p>Blunted sensitivity to ethanol&rsquo;s aversive effects can increase motivation to consume ethanol; yet, the neurobiological circuits responsible for encoding these aversive properties are not fully understood. Plasticity in cells projecting from the anterior insular cortex (aIC) to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical for taste aversion learning and retrieval, suggesting this circuit&rsquo;s potential involvement in modulating the aversive properties of ethanol. Here, we tested the hypothesis that GABAergic currents onto aIC-&gt;BLA projections would be facilitated as a consequence of retrieval of an ethanol-conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Consistent with this hypothesis, frequency of mIPSCs was increased 1&nbsp;h following retrieval of an ethanol-CTA across cell layers in aIC-&gt;BLA projection neurons. This increase in GABAergic plasticity occurred in a circuit-specific, time-limited, and ethanol-CTA retrieval-dependent manner. Additionally, local inhibitory inputs onto layer 2/3 aIC-&gt;BLA projection neurons were greater in number and strength following ethanol-CTA. Finally, DREADD-mediated inhibition of aIC parvalbumin-expressing cells blunted the retrieval of ethanol-CTA in male, but not female, mice. Collectively, this work implicates a circuit-specific and memory retrieval-dependent increase in GABAergic tone following retrieval of an ethanol-CTA, thereby advancing our understanding of how the aversive effects of ethanol are encoded in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/9/e0688242024?rss=1">A Shift Toward Supercritical Brain Dynamics Predicts Alzheimers Disease Progression</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with continuum of disease progression of increasing severity from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and lastly to AD. The transition from MCI to AD has been linked to brain hypersynchronization, but the underlying mechanisms leading to this are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that excessive excitation in AD disease progression would shift brain dynamics toward supercriticality across an extended regime of critical-like dynamics. In this framework, healthy brain activity during aging preserves operation at near the critical phase transition at balanced excitation&ndash;inhibition (E/I). To test this hypothesis, we used source-reconstructed resting-state MEG data from a cross-sectional cohort (<I>N</I> = 343) of individuals with SCD, MCI, and healthy controls (HC) as well as from a longitudinal cohort (<I>N</I> = 45) of MCI patients. We then assessed brain criticality by quantifying long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) and functional EI (fE/I) of neuronal oscillations. LRTCs were attenuated in SCD in spectrally and anatomically constrained regions while this breakdown was progressively more widespread in MC. In parallel, fE/I was increased in the MCI but not in the SC cohort. Both observations also predicted the disease progression in the longitudinal cohort. Finally, using machine learning trained on functional (LRTCs, fE/I) and structural (MTL volumes) features, we show that LRTCs and f/EI are the most informative features for accurate classification of individuals with SCD while structural changes accurate classify the individuals with MCI. These findings establish that a shift toward supercritical brain dynamics reflects early AD disease progression.</p>

                <p>The development of the nervous system is a complex process, with many challenging scientific questions yet to be resolved. Disruptions in brain development are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability and autism. While the genetic basis of autism is well established, the precise pathological mechanisms remain unclear. Variations on chromosome 2q have been linked to autism, yet the specific genes responsible for the disorder have not been identified. This study investigates the role of the transmembrane protein 169 (<I>TMEM169</I>) gene, located on human chromosome 2q35, which has not been previously characterized. Our findings indicate that<I> Tmem169</I> is highly expressed in the nervous system, and its deletion in the male mouse dorsal forebrain results in neuronal morphological abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction. Notably, <I>Tmem169</I>-deficient mice, irrespective of sex, display behavioral traits resembling those observed in individuals with autism. These results suggest that Tmem169 interacts with several key neuronal proteins, many of which are implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Tmem169 promotes neuronal process and synapse development through its interaction with Shank3.</p>

                <p>Damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) results in visual field deficits on the contralateral side of the world corresponding to the damaged region. Patients with such loss nonetheless show varying residual vision within this apparently blind region, with the neural mechanisms underlying this ability obscured by small study populations. We identified lesions on structural scans from 39 patients (12 female) with hemianopia and occipital lobe damage. We estimated the proportion of damage throughout the visual cortex and correlated this with performance in up to three different tests of residual vision in the blind field. We then performed voxel-based lesion&ndash;symptom mapping (VLSM) to determine the precise neural regions associated with residual vision. V1 damage did not show a relationship with residual vision measured with any task, although the extent of damage to V4 and hMT+/V5 both correlated with the ability to detect contrast-modulated stimuli. Indeed, damage to hMT+/V5 severely impacted performance across all three tasks, particularly motion detection. Although hMT+/V5 appeared necessary for residual vision, some patients with intact hMT+/V5 had no residual vision, indicating this area alone was not sufficient. VLSM revealed that damage to the optic radiation laterally was most highly associated with poor residual vision. Thus, VLSM indicates that hMT+/V5 and the optic radiation specifically are critical for residual vision in hemianopia.</p>

                <p>How do the neural representations underlying category learning change as skill develops? We examined perceptual category learning using a prototype learning task known to recruit a corticostriatal system including the posterior striatum, motor cortex, visual cortex, and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Male and female human participants practiced categorizing stimuli as category members or nonmembers (A vs not-A) across 3&nbsp;d, with fMRI data collected at the beginning and end. Univariate analyses found that corticostriatal activity in regions associated with habitual instrumental learning was recruited across both sessions, but activity in regions associated with goal-directed instrumental learning decreased from Day 1 to Day 3. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) indicated that after training, the trained category could be more easily decoded from the IPS when compared with a novel category. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) showed development of category representations in the IPS and motor cortex. In addition, RSA revealed evidence for category-related representations including prototype representation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex which may reflect parallel development of schematic memory for the category structure. Overall, the results converge to show how performance of category decisions and representations of the category structure emerge after extensive training across the corticostriatal system underlying perceptual category learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/9/e1317242024?rss=1">Neuroimaging Model of Visceral Manipulation in an Awake Rat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reciprocal neuronal connections exist between the internal organs of the body and the nervous system. These projections to and from the viscera play an essential role in maintaining and fine-tuning organ responses in order to sustain homeostasis and allostasis. Functional maps of brain regions participating in this bidirectional communication have been previously studied in awake humans and anesthetized rodents. To further refine the mechanistic understanding of visceral influence on brain states, however, new paradigms that allow for more invasive, and ultimately more informative, measurements and perturbations must be explored. Furthermore, such paradigms should prioritize human translatability. In the current paper, we address these issues by demonstrating the feasibility of nonanesthetized animal imaging during visceral manipulation. More specifically, we used a barostat interfaced with an implanted gastric balloon to cyclically induce distension of a nonanesthetized male rat's stomach during simultaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging. General linear modeling and spatial independent component analysis revealed several regions with BOLD activation temporally coincident with the gastric distension stimulus. The ON&ndash;OFF (20&ndash;0&nbsp;mmHg) barostat balloon pressure cycle resulted in widespread BOLD activation of the inferior colliculus, cerebellum, ventral midbrain, and a variety of hippocampal structures. These results suggest that neuroimaging models of gastric manipulation in the nonanesthetized rat are achievable and provide an avenue for more comprehensive studies involving the integration of other neuroscience techniques like electrophysiology.</p>

                <p>The inner ear houses both hearing and balance sensory modalities. The hearing and balance organs consist of similar cell types, including sensory hair cells and associated supporting cells. Previously we showed that <I>Notch1</I> is required for maintaining supporting cell survival during cochlear maturation. To understand the role of Notch during vestibular maturation, we deleted <I>Notch1</I> from the vestibular organs of both male and female mice at birth. Histological analyses showed a reduction of supporting cells accompanied by an increase in type II hair cells, indicating a conversion of supporting cells to hair cells. Analysis of mature sensory organs indicate the converted hair cells survive, despite a severe reduction of supporting cells. Vestibular sensory evoked potentials (VsEPs), thought to be generated within the striola regions of the maculae, were absent, indicating that NOTCH1 is critical for striolar function. Specialized type I hair cells in the striola failed to develop the complex calyces typical of these cells. <I>Notch1</I> mutants did not exhibit vestibular behaviors such as circling and head shaking but showed difficulties with tests of balance and swimming. These results indicate that, unlike the cochlea, supporting cells in balance organs retain the plasticity to convert to hair cells which can survive into adulthood. Despite hair cell survival, vestibular function is compromised likely due to the loss of supporting cells and altered innervation.</p>

                <p>Recordings from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show strong beta-band oscillations (13&ndash;35&nbsp;Hz), which can be modulated by deep brain stimulation (DBS). While high-frequency DBS (&gt;100&nbsp;Hz) ameliorates motor symptoms and reduces beta activity in the basal ganglia and motor cortex, the effects of low-frequency DBS (&lt;30&nbsp;Hz) are less clear. Clarifying these effects is relevant for the debate about the role of beta oscillations in motor slowing, which might be causal or epiphenomenal. Here, we investigated how subthalamic nucleus (STN) beta-band DBS affects cortical beta oscillations and motor performance. We recorded the magnetoencephalogram of 14 PD patients (nine males) with DBS implants while on their usual medication. Following a baseline recording (DBS OFF), we applied bipolar DBS at beta frequencies (10, 16, 20, 26, and 30&nbsp;Hz) via the left electrode in a cyclic fashion, turning stimulation on (5&nbsp;s) and off (3&nbsp;s) repeatedly. Cyclic stimulation was applied at rest and during right-hand finger tapping. In the baseline recording, we observed a negative correlation between the strength of hemispheric beta power lateralization and the tap rate. Importantly, beta-band DBS accentuated the lateralization and reduced the tap rate proportionally. The change in lateralization was specific to the alpha/beta range (8&ndash;26&nbsp;Hz), outlasted stimulation, and did not depend on the stimulation frequency, suggesting a remote-induced response rather than entrainment. Our study demonstrates that cortical beta oscillations can be manipulated by STN beta-band DBS. This manipulation has consequences for motor performance, supporting a causal role of beta oscillations.</p>

                <p>Based on the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons during behavioral states, the DA system has long been thought to be foundational in regulating sleep&ndash;wake behavior; over the past decade, advances in circuit manipulation and recording techniques have strengthened this perspective. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that DA release in regions of the limbic system is important in the promotion of REM sleep. Yet how DA dynamics change within bouts of sleep, how these changes are regulated, and whether they influence future state changes remains unclear. To address these questions, in mice of both sexes we used in vivo fiber photometry and inhibitory optogenetics to identify a specific role of DA transients in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in state transitions from NREM sleep. We found that DA transients increase their frequency and amplitude over the duration of NREM sleep and that this increase is more pronounced during NREM bouts that transition into REM sleep. Next, we found that DA transients in NREM sleep are influenced by changes in REM sleep pressure. Finally, we show that transient DA release in the NAcc plays a functional role in regulating the timing of REM sleep entrances, as inhibition of midbrain DA neuron terminals in the NAcc prolonged bouts of NREM sleep and decreased the frequency of bouts of REM sleep. These findings demonstrate that DA release in the NAcc is dynamically regulated by sleep pressure and has a functional role in transitions from NREM sleep, particularly those into REM sleep.</p>

                <p>Ghrelin enhances feeding by activating the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). In the brain, GHSRs are expressed in regions responsible for regulating food motivation including the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Endogenous cannabinoids also promote food-seeking behaviors through the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB-1Rs) in brain regions including the VTA. It is not known, however, if ghrelin and endocannabinoids interact in the VTA to produce these effects. We therefore examined if GHSR and CB-1R interact within the VTA to enhance food motivation. Results show that GHSR and CB-1R mRNA are expressed in the VTA cells in male and female rats and mice, with the GHSR being expressed in dopamine cells and the CB-1R being expressed primarily in nondopaminergic cells with no obvious sex differences. Ghrelin directly activated and increased excitatory tone onto dopamine cells of male and female mice. Male rats lacking fully functional GHSR signaling showed disrupted gene expression of transcripts important for regulating the synthesis, release, and degradation of endocannabinoids and lowered the levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) within the VTA. Moreover, pharmacological antagonism of VTA CB-1Rs attenuates the orexigenic and appetitive effects of intra-VTA ghrelin in rats and blocks the ability of ghrelin to promote excitatory drive to VTA dopamine neurons. Finally, blocking the breakdown of cannabinoids in the VTA enhances the effects of ghrelin on food motivation. Together, our data show that ghrelin stimulates VTA dopamine cells and ultimately food motivation in part through a mechanism that involves endocannabinoid signaling at the CB-1R.</p>

                <p>Limits on information processing capacity impose limits on task performance. We show that male and female mice achieve performance on a perceptual decision task that is near-optimal given their capacity limits, as measured by policy complexity (the mutual information between states and actions). This behavioral profile could be achieved by reinforcement learning with a penalty on high complexity policies, realized through modulation of dopaminergic learning signals. In support of this hypothesis, we find that policy complexity suppresses midbrain dopamine responses to reward outcomes. Furthermore, neural and behavioral reward sensitivity were positively correlated across sessions. Our results suggest that policy compression shapes basic mechanisms of reinforcement learning in the brain.</p>

                <p>Our visual system enables us to effortlessly navigate and recognize real-world visual environments. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest a network of scene-responsive cortical visual areas, but much less is known about the temporal order in which different scene properties are analyzed by the human visual system. In this study, we selected a set of 36 full-color natural scenes that varied in spatial structure and semantic content that our male and female human participants viewed both in 2D and 3D while we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. MEG enables tracking of cortical activity in humans at millisecond timescale. We compared the representational geometry in the MEG responses with predictions based on the scene stimuli using the representational similarity analysis framework. The representational structure first reflected the spatial structure in the scenes in time window 90&ndash;125&nbsp;ms, followed by the semantic content in time window 140&ndash;175&nbsp;ms after stimulus onset. The 3D stereoscopic viewing of the scenes affected the responses relatively late, from ~140&nbsp;ms from stimulus onset. Taken together, our results indicate that the human visual system rapidly encodes a scene's spatial structure and suggest that this information is based on monocular instead of binocular depth cues.</p>

                <p>Functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging is a well-established neuroimaging technology that offers high spatiotemporal resolution and a large field of view. Typical strategies for analyzing fUS data comprise either region-based averaging, typically based on reference atlases, or correlation with experimental events. Nevertheless, these methodologies possess several inherent limitations, including a restricted utilization of the spatial dimension and a pronounced bias influenced by preconceived notions about the recorded activity. In this study, we put forth single-voxel clustering as a third method to address these issues. A comparison was conducted between the three strategies on a typical dataset comprising visually evoked activity in the superior colliculus in awake mice. The application of single-voxel clustering yielded the generation of detailed activity maps, which revealed a consistent layout of activity and a clear separation between hemodynamic responses. This method is best considered as a complement to region-based averaging and correlation. It has direct applicability to challenging contexts, such as paradigm-free analysis on behaving subjects and brain decoding.</p>

Self-assessed intensity of emotions attributed to abortion in a national sample of women aged 41 to 45 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background It is widely reported that the most prominent emotion following abortions is relief. This claim primarily rests on two studies of abortion clinic patients which had methodological and self-censure bias. Other studies have indicated that negative emotions are more common than positive emotions. The objective of this study is to obtain self-assessed data on the intensity of emotional responses to abortion and pregnancy loss in a random national sample. Methods Using visual analog scales, a random sample of 1,925 women aged 41 to 45 completed a survey in which respondents rated the degree to which they experienced emotional responses to their first abortion or natural pregnancy loss. The emotions assessed included relief, grief, depression, anxiety, guilt, emptiness, anger, regret, shame, unforgiveness of self, uncontrollable weeping, frequent thoughts of the child they could have had, and difficulty completing the grief process. Women were categorized into five groups based on pregnancy outcomes, and four abortion decision types: Wanted, Inconsistent, Unwanted, or Coerced. Results Among women with a history of abortion (n=409), negative emotions were reported more intensely than relief. Relief was the predominant emotion only among the 29.8% of women whose abortions were freely wanted and consistent with their own values and preferences. For all other groups, relief was low and negative emotions were more prominent. Emotions following natural pregnancy losses were similar to those following abortion, but less severe following wanted abortions and more severe following coerced abortions. Conclusions Relief is only common after freely wanted abortions. Most abortions are inconsistent or contrary to women’s own values. In these cases, strong negative emotions are far more dominant than relief. These results should inform pre-abortion screening, counseling supportive of women’s own values and preferences, and mental health support post-abortion.

                Background: We have little knowledge about the synchronous occurrence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and other types of histologic tumors. This association is very rare. Case presentation: We describe a case of synchronous stromal tumor and adenocarcinoma of the left side colonic localization. Immunohistochemistry identified c-Kit expression. The discovery of colonic adenocarcinoma was on operative specimen after histologic examination. The patient underwent left carcinologic colectomy with stoma. Follow-up at one year postoperatively did not detect tumor recurrence. Discussion: Clinical implications of the association between these two neoplasms are not clearly described. Treatment depends on the dominance of one histologic type. Knowledge of the genetic data of this association offers opportunity of treatment with the new targeted-therapy molecules. Surgical resection, may remain the curative treatment. Conclusions: Synchronous adenocarcinoma and GIST has been more commonly described in the stomach.  The pathogeneses of tumorigenesis may not be the same for the two tumors. More studies seem be necessary to clarify a potential role of different genes in the development of adenocarcinomas. And therefore, above all their therapeutic implications

                Introduction The perception of oral health that hospital staff may have has repercussions on the general quality of life that they lead and the corresponding work performance. This work attempts to show how these two dimensions of the human being go hand in hand, which would provide the necessary knowledge to draw up strategies that can alleviate the aforementioned profile, and at the same time would help to build a work context that could well have a healthier horizon. Aim To determine the relationship between quality of life (QoL) and oral health perception (OHP) in the staff of level II-1 hospital, located in the northern zone of Peru. Methods The study had a quantitative approach, a cross-sectional design, an applied type and a correlational-causal scope. The participation consisted of 72 participants. Reference was made to the validated questionnaires OHIP-14 and HU-DBI, which allow measuring the quality of life and the perception of oral health, and obtained reliability coefficients of 0.847 and 0.804, respectively. Data processing was carried out by applying the Spearman correlation coefficient and ordinal logistic regression. Results The analyses showed a significant association between quality of life and oral health perception (Rho=0.391, p<0.05), with an impact of 19.8% according to Nagelkerke’s pseudo R square. The dimensions of quality of life that most significantly influenced oral health perception were physical limitation (Rho=0.319, p<0.05) and social limitation (Rho=0.242, p<0.05). Regarding the general results, the excellent level of quality of life was the most prevalent (38.9%), while the low level of oral health perception was the most frequent, with 52.8%. Conclusion The link between quality of life and the perception of oral health in hospital staff emphasizes the need to implement comprehensive strategies that optimize their well-being and work performance, contributing significantly to improving hospital services.

                Objective To develop an affordable kidney phantom for ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy training model. Methods Twenty one kidney models were manufactured and implemented as ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) training models for urologists without any prior experience of independently performing PCNL in Indonesia. The unit cost of an alternative model was less than 30 USD (IDR 450,000). Twenty one junior with no prior experience of performing ultrasound guided PCNL participated in the research. The evaluation was done through anonymous responses to a questionnaire using the Likert scale. Result The affordable PCNL model showed highly positive results among all participants (realistic anatomy 7.86/10, realistic visualization of calyx 8.19/10, realistic puncture 7.43/10, guidewire placement 8.19/10, realistic nephrostomy 7.57/10, stone visualization 7.76/10, feedback 7.52/10, post-training discussion 8.57/10). All of the participants recommended the affordable PCNL model phantom for ultrasound guided PCNL training in Indonesia. Conclusion An affordable model utilizing 3D printed mould, silicone, and gelatine jelly is a feasible option for ultrasound guided PCNL training among urologists in developing countries. The utilization of 3D printing and silicone moulding will be beneficial in reducing the cost of surgery model while preserving the realistic tactile feedback.

                Background This paper analyzes the mechanism of the proliferation and disappearance of graphical characters in the manga Dragon Ball, a globally successful media franchise. Dragon Ball was serialized by Japanese manga artist, Toriyama Akira (1955–2024), in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine between 1984 and 1995. The manga, published in 42 volumes, was animated for TV from 1986 to 1996 as Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. Methods In support of the arguments on animation, such as Susan Napier’s metamorphosis, Sergei Eisenstein’s plasmaticity, and theories on characters in anime and manga studies, this paper analyses visual properties of characters in Toriyama’s Drgaon Ball, with a special focus on the graphical and biological reproduction. Results This paper found that characters in Dragon Ball operate as a vessel for the shape-shifting fluidity of ink lines. The free kinetic movement of lines results in the graphical proliferation of characters and reproduction devoid of sexual expression. This is a version of the “abjection” — a reaction of the subject to reject familiar things as something horrific — that Napier argued regarding metamorphosis in turn-of-the-century Japanese anime. In Dragon Ball, muscular men’s battles hide the potentially grotesque graphic/biological proliferation of the characters. What stops this medium-specific proliferation of images is light as the lack of ink, a media-aesthetic element inherent to manga and anime. It is not flesh-and-blood combat but energy waves that inflict death on the villains who resurrect even from a single cell, just as lines drawn in ink multiply endlessly. Conclusions These findings offer rich insights into the history of visual popular media in post-war Japan. The glow of the energy waves expressed by the lack of ink echoes the repeated motif of mass destruction in the history of Japanese anime and manga, which reminds us of the extinction of lives in the atomic bomb explosions.

                <p>by Sara Ershadmanesh, Sahar Rajabi, Reza Rostami, Rani Moran, Peter Dayan</p>

Humans and animals use multiple control systems for decision-making. This involvement is subject to meta-cognitive regulation – as a form of control over control or meta-control. However, the nature of this meta-control is unclear. For instance, Model-based (MB) control may be boosted when decision-makers generally lack confidence as it is more statistically efficient; or it may be suppressed, since the MB controller can correctly assess its own unreliability. Since control and metacontrol are themselves subject to the influence of neuromodulators, we examined the effects of perturbing the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems with propranolol and L-DOPA, respectively. We first administered a simple perceptual task to examine the effects of the manipulations on meta-cognitive ability. Using Bayesian analyses, we found that 81<i>%</i> of group M-ratio samples were lower under propranolol relative to Placebo, suggesting a decrease of meta-cognitive ability; and 60<i>%</i> of group M-ratio samples were higher under L-DOPA relative to Placebo, considered as no effect of L-DOPA on meta-cognitive ability . We then asked subjects to provide choices and confidence ratings in a two-outcome decision-making task that has been used to dissociate Model-free (MF) and MB control. MB behavior was enhanced by propranolol, while MF behavior was not significantly affected by either drug. The interaction between confidence and MF/MB behavior was highly variable under propranolol, but under L-DOPA, the interaction was significantly lower/higher relative to Placebo. Our results suggest a decrease in metacognitive ability under the influence of propranolol and an enhancement of MB behavior and meta-control under the influence of propranolol and L-DOPA, respectively. These findings shed light on the role of NE and DA in different aspects of control and meta-control and suggest potential avenues for mitigating dysfunction.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common cause of arboviral disease in the United States. Approximately 1% of infections involve the nervous system, most commonly resulting in West Nile encephalitis (WNE), West Nile meningitis (WNM), or acute flaccid paralysis (AFP).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this systematic review, we characterized comprehensively the diagnostic and clinical features of WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND) in the United States, as well as the evidence regarding prognostic factors and long-term outcomes of WNND.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 47 relevant studies reporting data on acute or longitudinal features of WNND. Across studies, the most common presenting symptoms were fever (88%), nausea/vomiting (58%), and fatigue (50%) coupled neurologically with headache (50%), altered mental status (39%), and focal weakness (32%). Pooled mortality was 9.2%, and 42.1% of reported cases required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In meta-analyses, chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR] = 5.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.71–13.23), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.54–3.84), and hypertension (OR = 4.01, 95% CI = 2.39–6.72) were associated with an increased risk of mortality. Multidomain neurocognitive impairment was reported in several studies at post-hospitalization follow-up, although with marked heterogeneity between study methodology. Subjective neurocognitive impairment, most notably fatigue (37–75%), memory concerns (11–57%), concentration deficits (17–48%), and depression (17–38%), were also common at post-hospitalization follow-up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings underscore the significant mortality and morbidity of WNND in the acute and long-term setting. Our findings may additionally provide utility for risk stratification of hospitalized patients with WNND and suggest the need for further evaluation of novel therapeutics to prevent substantial disease-associated acute and long-term disability.

                Background The dynamic nature of consumer behavior and the complex design of banking services make digital banking interactions challenging. Automated systems/responses lack a personal touch and may lead to miscommunication creating further difficulty in retaining customers. Hence, a co-creating interaction and interactional value formation (IVF) becomes a necessity for banks to have meaningful and experiential customer interactions. This article adds to the limited body of banking literature by explaining the precursors that influence IVF in digital banking interactions. Methods 442 digitally active banking customers of private, public, and small finance banks were selected from the Karnataka region to assess the relationship of precursors with IVF. A quantitative approach was adopted through a survey questionnaire to gather the responses. The data gathered was analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0 software. Findings Knowledge has the most significant relationship with IVF. Customers perceive the seeking and sharing of information as the most critical for a co-creating interaction. Relationship quality moderately influences value formation in digital interactions; however, communication was not found to have a relationship with co-creation. Conclusions The study will help bank managers and employees align their resources to develop knowledge and relationship aspects in their digital interactions to foster co-creation. Banks must move beyond frequent, generic updates or promotional messages that may overwhelm customers. Instead, they should adopt a more tailored approach, emphasizing relevance and value in their interactions to avoid perceptions of intrusion or inefficiency.

                Background Women’s studies in Latin America are transcendental because they make visible and challenge gender inequalities to achieve a more just and equitable society. However, despite this, there are still many research gaps, for which the objective is to examine the trends in research on women’s studies in Latin America. Methods An exploratory methodology based on bibliometric analysis is proposed to evaluate the scientific literature, based on the parameters of the PRISMA-2020 declaration. Results The bibliometric analysis reveals a growth in women’s studies in Latin America, reflecting its importance and relevance. Scientific production has experienced exponential growth, with leading researchers and journals. The United States and Canada lead scientific production. A change is observed in the topics addressed, focusing more on gender and equality. The thematic clusters identified highlight priority areas such as politics, institutions and representation. Conclusions Emerging keywords include neoliberalism, gender violence, political participation, female empowerment, and femicide, reflecting new concerns and challenges addressed in gender studies in Latin America.

     alt="Review of Fish Neuropeptides: A Novel Perspective on Animal Welfare"/>
<p>Neuropeptides are conserved molecules regulating physiological processes and behaviours in fish. This review integrates recent findings on neuropeptide isoforms and their receptors, highlighting their roles in neuroendocrine, immune, digestive, and reproductive systems, and discusses how monitoring these neuropeptides can serve as a novel approach to assess fish welfare.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides are highly variable but widely conserved molecules, the main functions of which are the regulation and coordination of physiological processes and behaviors. They are synthesized in the nervous system and generally act on other neuronal and non-neuronal tissues or organs. In recent years, diverse neuropeptide isoforms and their receptors have been identified in different fish species, regulating functions in the neuroendocrine (e.g., corticotropin-releasing hormone and arginine vasotocin), immune (e.g., vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and somatostatin), digestive (e.g., neuropeptide Y), and reproductive (e.g., isotocin) systems, as well as in the commensal microbiota. Interestingly, all these processes carried out by neuropeptides are integrated into the nervous system and are manifested externally in the behavior and affective states of fish, thus having an impact on the modulation of these actions. In this sense, the monitoring of neuropeptides may represent a new approach to assess animal welfare, targeting both physiological and affective aspects in fish. Therefore, although there are many studies investigating the action of neuropeptides in a wide range of paradigms, especially in mammals, their study within a fish welfare framework is scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that gathers and integrates up-to-date information on neuropeptides from an animal welfare perspective. In this review, we summarize current findings on neuropeptides in fish and discuss their possible implication in the physiological and emotional state of fish, and therefore in their welfare.</p>

<p>Immunohistochemical staining for orexin-A reveals the novel parvocellular orexinergic neuronal cluster (left) in the human brain. In comparison to the more typically observed orexinergic neurons of the main cluster (right), the parvocellular neurons have much smaller soma. Scale bar = 100 µm, applies to both images.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The phylogenetic contextualization of human neuroanatomy is crucial for understanding the positive, neutral, and/or negative effects of therapeutic interventions derived from animal models. Here we determined the parcellation of, and quantified, orexinergic (or hypocretinergic) neurons in the hypothalami of humans and several species of primates, including strepsirrhines (two species), platyrrhines (two species), cercopithecoids (three species), and hominoids (three species, including humans). The strepsirrhines, platyrrhines, and cercopithecoids presented with three distinct clusters of orexinergic neurons, revealing an organization like that observed in most mammals. In the three hominoids, an additional orexinergic cluster was found in the tuberal region of the hypothalamus, termed the optic tract cluster extension. In humans only, an additional parvocellular cluster of orexinergic neurons was observed in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. The human presented with the most complex parcellation of orexinergic neurons of the primates studied. Total numbers of orexinergic neurons in nonhuman primates were strongly correlated to brain mass (<i>P</i>
<sub>uncorr</sub> = 1.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), with every doubling in brain mass leading to an ∼1.5-times increase in neuron number. In contrast, humans have approximately 74,300 orexinergic neurons, which is significantly less than the 205,000 predicted using the nonhuman primate regression for a brain mass of ∼1363 g. We conclude that although the human orexinergic system is the most complex of primates in terms of parcellation, with potential associated functional specializations, this system is quantitatively paradoxical in having a significantly lower neuronal number than expected for a primate with an ∼1363-g brain.</p>
