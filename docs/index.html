	<p>Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between Cathepsin B and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD), with a particular focus on determining the role of N-acetylaspartate as a potential mediator. Methods: We used summary-level data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, exploring the association between Cathepsin B (3301 cases) and PD (4681 cases). A sequential two-step MR approach was applied (8148 cases) to study the role of N-acetylaspartate. Results: The MR analysis yielded that genetically predicted elevated Cathepsin B levels correlated with a reduced risk of developing PD (p = 0.0133, OR: 0.9171, 95% CI: 0.8563&amp;amp;ndash;0.9821). On the other hand, the analysis provided insufficient evidence to determine that PD affected Cathepsin B levels (p = 0.8567, OR: 1.0035, 95% CI: 0.9666&amp;amp;ndash;1.0418). The estimated effect of N-acetylaspartate in this process was 7.52% (95% CI = &amp;amp;minus;3.65% to 18.69%). Conclusions: This study suggested that elevated Cathepsin B levels decreased the risk of developing PD, with the mediation effect of N-acetylaspartate. Further research is needed to better understand this relationship.</p>

	<p>Hyperserotonemia is one of the most studied endophenotypes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but there are still no unequivocal results about its causes or biological and behavioral outcomes. This systematic review summarizes the studies investigating the relationship between blood serotonin (5-HT) levels and ASD, comparing diagnostic tools, analytical methods, and clinical outcomes. A literature search on peripheral 5-HT levels and ASD was conducted. In total, 1104 publications were screened, of which 113 entered the present systematic review. Of these, 59 articles reported hyperserotonemia in subjects with ASD, and 26 presented correlations between 5-HT levels and ASD-core clinical outcomes. The 5-HT levels are increased in about half, and correlations between hyperserotonemia and clinical outcomes are detected in a quarter of the studies. The present research highlights a large amount of heterogeneity in this field, ranging from the characterization of ASD and control groups to diagnostic and clinical assessments, from blood sampling procedures to analytical methods, allowing us to delineate critical topics for future studies.</p>

                <p>The primary motor cortex (M1) integrates sensory and cognitive inputs to generate voluntary movement. Its functional impairments have been implicated in the pathophysiology of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, dopaminergic degeneration and basal ganglia dysfunction entrain M1 neurons into the abnormally synchronized bursting pattern of activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network. However, how degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons affects the anatomy, microcircuit connectivity, and function of the M1 network remains poorly understood. The present study examined whether and how the loss of dopamine (DA) affects the morphology, cellular excitability, and synaptic physiology of Layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing (PV<sup>+</sup>) cells in the M1 of mice of both sexes. Here, we reported that loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons does not alter the number, morphology, and physiology of Layer 5 PV<sup>+</sup> cells in M1. Moreover, we demonstrated that the number of perisomatic PV<sup>+</sup> puncta of M1 pyramidal neurons as well as their functional innervation of cortical pyramidal neurons were not altered following the loss of DA. Together, the present study documents an intact GABAergic inhibitory network formed by PV<sup>+</sup> cells following the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.</p>

                <p>More and more patients worldwide are diagnosed with dementia, which emphasizes the urgent need for early detection markers. In this study, we built on the auditory hypersensitivity theory of a previous study&mdash;which postulated that responses to auditory input in the subcortex as well as cortex are enhanced in cognitive decline&mdash;and examined auditory encoding of natural continuous speech at both neural levels for its indicative potential for cognitive decline. We recruited study participants aged 60 years and older, who were divided into two groups based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, one group with low scores (<I>n</I> = 19, participants with signs of cognitive decline) and a control group (<I>n</I> = 25). Participants completed an audiometric assessment and then we recorded their electroencephalography while they listened to an audiobook and click sounds. We derived temporal response functions and evoked potentials from the data and examined response amplitudes for their potential to predict cognitive decline, controlling for hearing ability and age. Contrary to our expectations, no evidence of auditory hypersensitivity was observed in participants with signs of cognitive decline; response amplitudes were comparable in both cognitive groups. Moreover, the combination of response amplitudes showed no predictive value for cognitive decline. These results challenge the proposed hypothesis and emphasize the need for further research to identify reliable auditory markers for the early detection of cognitive decline.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-470/v1?src=rss">The role of therapeutic MicroRNA in arteriogenesis process in limb ischemia: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                The routine genomic surveillance of pathogens in diverse geographical settings and equitable data sharing are critical to inform effective infection control and therapeutic development. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the importance of routine genomic surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to detect emerging variants of concern. However, the majority of high-income countries sequenced >0.5% of their COVID-19 cases, unlike low- and middle-income countries. By the end of 2022, many countries around the world had managed to establish capacity for pathogen genomic surveillance. Notably, Beta and Omicron; 2 of the 5 current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were first discovered in Africa through an aggressive sequencing campaign led by African scientists. To sustain such infrastructure and expertise beyond this pandemic, other endemic pathogens should leverage this investment. Therefore, countries are establishing multi-pathogen genomic surveillance strategies. Here we provide a catalog of the current landscape of sequenced and publicly shared pathogens in different countries in Africa. Drawing upon our collective knowledge and expertise, we review the ever-evolving challenges and propose innovative recommendations.

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                <p>by Hazal Koptagel, Seong-Hwan Jun, Joanna Hård, Jens Lagergren</p>

Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The method’s robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells.

                <p>by Raphael Sonabend, Hugo Gruson, Leo Wolansky, Agnes Kiragga, Daniel S. Katz</p>

This paper extends the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) guidelines to provide criteria for assessing if software conforms to best practices in open source. By adding “USE” (User-Centered, Sustainable, Equitable), software development can adhere to open source best practice by incorporating user-input early on, ensuring front-end designs are accessible to all possible stakeholders, and planning long-term sustainability alongside software design. The FAIR-USE4OS guidelines will allow funders and researchers to more effectively evaluate and plan open-source software projects. There is good evidence of funders increasingly mandating that all funded research software is open source; however, even under the FAIR guidelines, this could simply mean software released on public repositories with a Zenodo DOI. By creating FAIR-USE software, best practice can be demonstrated from the very beginning of the design process and the software has the greatest chance of success by being impactful.

                Background In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organization recommended the use of alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) to curb transmission, leading to increased production and use. This has posed a danger of production and use of poor-quality ABHRs. Methods This study assessed and compared the quality of ABHRs in the Kenyan market that were produced before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Quality testing was carried out against European EN 1500:2013 and Kenyan EAS 789:2013 Standards and 20 samples analyzed for alcohol content by GC-FID. Results The study found that 27.8% of the peri-COVID-19 pandemic sanitizers had less than 90% bactericidal reduction activity as compared to 12.5% manufactured pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Only 25% peri-COVID-19 pandemic ABHRs met the EAS 789:2013 acceptable limit of over 60% alcohol content. Product adulteration with methanol was found in 20 % of the samples with only 5% complying with FDA approval limit of <0.063% v/v methanol. Study found no correlation between the total alcohol content and the efficacy of ABHRs. Conclusions The study found that more substandard products were produced during the pandemic. This raises a concern about possible emergence of alcohol resistant strains of microorganisms. The study therefore recommends an adequate quality monitoring system to curb against substandard products.

                Background Parthenium is an invasive annual weed that affects crop production, rangelands, grasslands, animals, the environment, and human health. Since its introduction into Ethiopia, different management options such as uprooting, slashing, burning, plowing, and applying synthetic herbicides have been practiced. However, these options are not sustainable in weed management. However, Zygogramma bicolorata is known to be used in different countries. Although many countries use it under field conditions, its population-based efficacy has not been well studied in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of Z. bicolorata populations on parthenium plants under greenhouse conditions. Methods This experiment was conducted at the Ambo Agricultural Research Center. Different numbers of Z. bicolorata per plant were used as treatments and were laid out in a completely randomized design with three replications. The numbers of damaged leaves, eggs, and larvae were recorded daily until the leaves were completely defoliated. The collected data and the correlation between beetle population and leaf defoliation were analyzed using SAS. Results The result revealed that all beetle populations caused damage to weed plants. A higher population of beetles completely defoliated the leaves within 12 days. However, lower numbers required 21 days to completely defoliate the weed. In contrast, a higher number of eggs (328.67) and larvae (272.33) were obtained from plants that received 20 pairs of beetles. The beetle population and exposure time were positively correlated, and the effectiveness of the bioagent was greater following the emergence of larvae. Conclusions Z. bicolorata can manage parthenium weeds, even with a lower population. However, more than 15 pairs of beetles could be suggested to manage weeds in a shorter time, and further study is needed under field conditions by considering the different agroecologies of the country.

                Background Twenty-two Arab countries share a common language, history, and culture. Nevertheless, governmental policies, healthcare systems, and resources differ from one Arab country to another. We have been following Coronavirus (COVID-19) from the beginning in each Arab country. In the present study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world and to compare these findings with other significantly affected countries. Methods Websites of the World Health Organization, World COVID-vaccinations tracker, Worldometer, and Ministries of Health were used to extract COVID-19 data in all Arab countries between the period January 2020 to December 2022. Results All Arab countries had 14,218,042 total confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13,384,924 total recovered cases and 173,544 total related deaths. The trend demonstrated that the third quarter of 2021 recorded the highest death toll and the first quarter of 2022 recorded the highest number of confirmed and recovered cases. Compared to the top 15 affected countries, the Arab world ranked last as it had the lowest overall incidence per million population (PMP) of 31,609. The data on total deaths PMP showed that India had the lowest number of deaths with only 377 cases followed by the Arab world with 386 cases. Conclusions Although the number of confirmed, death, and subsequently recovered cases of COVID-19 have greatly reduced in the last quarter of 2022 in most Arab countries, many Arab countries still need to re-campaign about COVID-19 vaccines and raise awareness programs about boosters. COVID-19 has had a relatively smaller impact on Arab countries than on other countries that have been significantly affected.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity are considered closely related motor signs in Parkinson disease (PD), but recent neurophysiological findings suggest distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. This study aims to examine and compare longitudinal changes in bradykinesia and rigidity in PD patients treated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective cohort study, the clinical progression of appendicular and axial bradykinesia and rigidity was assessed up to 15 years after STN-DBS in the best treatment conditions (ON medication and ON stimulation). The severity of bradykinesia and rigidity was examined using ad hoc composite scores from specific subitems of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor part (UPDRS-III). Short- and long-term predictors of bradykinesia and rigidity were analyzed through linear regression analysis, considering various preoperative demographic and clinical data, including disease duration and severity, phenotype, motor and cognitive scores (eg, frontal score), and medication.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 301 patients were examined before and 1 year after surgery. Among them, 101 and 56 individuals were also evaluated at 10-year and 15-year follow-ups, respectively. Bradykinesia significantly worsened after surgery, especially in appendicular segments (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, rigidity showed sustained benefit, with unchanged clinical scores compared to preoperative assessment (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Preoperative motor disability (eg, composite scores from the UPDRS-III) predicted short- and long-term outcomes for both bradykinesia and rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Executive dysfunction was specifically linked to bradykinesia but not to rigidity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bradykinesia and rigidity show long-term divergent progression in PD following STN-DBS and are associated with independent clinical factors, supporting the hypothesis of partially distinct pathophysiology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to characterize quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) features in participants from the Natural history study of RTT and Related Disorders and to assess the potential for these features to act as objective measures of cortical function for Rett syndrome (RTT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>EEG amplitude and power features were derived from the resting EEG of 60 females with RTT (median age = 10.7 years) and 26 neurotypical females (median age = 10.6 years). Analyses focus on group differences and within the RTT group, associations between the EEG parameters and clinical severity. For a subset of participants (n = 20), follow-up data were available for assessing the reproducibility of the results and the stability in the parameters over 1 year.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to neurotypical participants, participants with RTT had greater amplitude variability and greater low-frequency activity as reflected by greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower theta/delta, alpha/delta, beta/delta, alpha/theta, and beta/theta ratios. Greater delta power, more negative 1/f slope, and lower power ratios were associated with greater severity. Analyses of year 1 data replicated the associations between 1/f slope and power ratios and clinical severity and demonstrated good within-subject consistency in these measures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, group comparisons reflected a greater predominance of lower versus higher frequency activity in participants with RTT, which is consistent with prior clinical interpretations of resting EEG in this population. The observed associations between the EEG power measures and clinical assessments and the repeatability of these measures underscore the potential for EEG to provide an objective measure of cortical function and clinical severity for RTT.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Classic research has shown a division in the neuroanatomical structures that support flexible (e.g., short-cutting) and habitual (e.g., familiar route following) navigational behavior, with hippocampal–caudate systems associated with the former and putamen systems with the latter. There is, however, disagreement about whether the neural structures involved in navigation process particular forms of spatial information, such as associations between constellations of cues forming a cognitive map, versus single landmark-action associations, or alternatively, perform particular reinforcement learning algorithms that allow the use of different spatial strategies, so-called model-based (flexible) or model-free (habitual) forms of learning. We sought to test these theories by asking participants (<i>N</i> = 24) to navigate within a virtual environment through a previously learned, 9-junction route with distinctive landmarks at each junction while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a series of probe trials, we distinguished knowledge of individual landmark-action associations along the route versus knowledge of the correct <i>sequence</i> of landmark-action associations, either by having absent landmarks, or “out-of-sequence” landmarks. Under a map-based perspective, sequence knowledge would not require hippocampal systems, because there are no constellations of cues available for cognitive map formation. Within a learning-based model, however, responding based on knowledge of sequence <i>would</i> require hippocampal systems because prior context has to be utilized. We found that hippocampal–caudate systems were more active in probes requiring sequence knowledge, supporting the learning-based model. However, we also found greater putamen activation in probes where navigation based purely on sequence memory could be planned, supporting models of putamen function that emphasize its role in action sequencing.</p>

                Aging may lead to low-level chronic inflammation that increases the susceptibility to age-related conditions, including memory impairment and progressive loss of brain volume. As brain health is essential to promoting healthspan and lifespan, it is vital to understand age-related changes in the immune system and central nervous system (CNS) that drive normal brain aging. However, the relative importance, mechanistic interrelationships, and hierarchical order of such changes and their impact on normal brain aging remain to be clarified. Here, we synthesize accumulating evidence that age-related DNA damage and cellular senescence in the immune system and CNS contribute to the escalation of neuroinflammation and cognitive decline during normal brain aging. Targeting cellular senescence and immune modulation may provide a logical rationale for developing new treatment options to restore immune homeostasis and counteract age-related brain dysfunction and diseases.

                Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells show heterogeneous levels of pigmentation when cultured in vitro. To know whether their color in appearance is correlated with the function of the RPE, we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells (iPSC-RPE) together with the gene expression profile at the single-cell level. For this purpose, we utilized our recent invention, Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System (ALPS), which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. While our iPSC-RPE were categorized into four clusters by gene expression, the color intensity of iPSC-RPE did not project any specific gene expression profiles. We reasoned this by less correlation between the actual color and the gene expressions that directly define the level of pigmentation, from which we hypothesized the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating the functional characteristics of the RPE.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89947">Improved clinical data imputation via classical and quantum determinantal point processes</a></h4>

              
                Imputing data is a critical issue for machine learning practitioners, including in the life sciences domain, where missing clinical data is a typical situation and the reliability of the imputation is of great importance. Currently, there is no canonical approach for imputation of clinical data and widely used algorithms introduce variance in the downstream classification. Here we propose novel imputation methods based on determinantal point processes (DPP) that enhance popular techniques such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations and MissForest. Their advantages are twofold: improving the quality of the imputed data demonstrated by increased accuracy of the downstream classification and providing deterministic and reliable imputations that remove the variance from the classification results. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our methods by performing extensive imputations on synthetic and real clinical data. We also perform quantum hardware experiments by applying the quantum circuits for DPP sampling since such quantum algorithms provide a computational advantage with respect to classical ones. We demonstrate competitive results with up to 10 qubits for small-scale imputation tasks on a state-of-the-art IBM quantum processor. Our classical and quantum methods improve the effectiveness and robustness of clinical data prediction modeling by providing better and more reliable data imputations. These improvements can add significant value in settings demanding high precision, such as in pharmaceutical drug trials where our approach can provide higher confidence in the predictions made.

                Environmental air irritants including nanosized carbon black (nCB) can drive systemic inflammation, promoting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema development. The <i>let-7</i> microRNA (<i>Mirlet7</i> miRNA) family is associated with IL-17-driven T cell inflammation, a canonical signature of lung inflammation. Recent evidence suggests the <i>Mirlet7</i> family is downregulated in patients with COPD, however, whether this repression conveys a functional consequence on emphysema pathology has not been elucidated. Here, we show that overall expression of the <i>Mirlet7</i> clusters, <i>Mirlet7b/Mirlet7c2</i> and <i>Mirlet7a1/Mirlet7f1/Mirlet7d</i>, are reduced in the lungs and T cells of smokers with emphysema as well as in mice with cigarette smoke (CS)- or nCB-elicited emphysema. We demonstrate that loss of the <i>Mirlet7b/Mirlet7c2</i> cluster in T cells predisposed mice to exaggerated CS- or nCB-elicited emphysema. Furthermore, ablation of the <i>Mirlet7b/Mirlet7c2</i> cluster enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup>IL17a<sup>+</sup> T cells (Tc17) formation in emphysema development in mice. Additionally, transgenic mice overexpressing <i>Mirlet7g</i> in T cells are resistant to Tc17 and CD4<sup>+</sup>IL17a<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th17) development when exposed to nCB. Mechanistically, our findings reveal the master regulator of Tc17/Th17 differentiation, RAR-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), as a direct target of <i>Mirlet7</i> in T cells. Overall, our findings shed light on the <i>Mirlet7/</i>RORγt axis with <i>Mirlet7</i> acting as a molecular brake in the generation of Tc17 cells and suggest a novel therapeutic approach for tempering the augmented IL-17-mediated response in emphysema.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87346">Action sequence learning, habits, and automaticity in obsessive-compulsive disorder</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the goal/habit imbalance theory of compulsion in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which postulates enhanced habit formation, increased automaticity, and impaired goal/habit arbitration. It directly tests these hypotheses using newly developed behavioral tasks. First, OCD patients and healthy participants were trained daily for a month using a smartphone app to perform chunked action sequences. Despite similar procedural learning and attainment of habitual performance (measured by an objective automaticity criterion) by both groups, OCD patients self-reported higher subjective habitual tendencies via a recently developed questionnaire. Subsequently, in a re-evaluation task assessing choices between established automatic and novel goal-directed actions, both groups were sensitive to re-evaluation based on monetary feedback. However, OCD patients, especially those with higher compulsive symptoms and habitual tendencies, showed a clear preference for trained/habitual sequences when choices were based on physical effort, possibly due to their higher attributed intrinsic value. These patients also used the habit-training app more extensively and reported symptom relief post-study. The tendency to attribute higher intrinsic value to familiar actions may be a potential mechanism leading to compulsions and an important addition to the goal/habit imbalance hypothesis in OCD. We also highlight the potential of smartphone app training as a habit reversal therapeutic tool.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/74940">SAFB regulates hippocampal stem cell fate by targeting Drosha to destabilize Nfib mRNA</a></h4>

              
                Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent and correct fate determination is crucial to guarantee brain formation and homeostasis. How NSCs are instructed to generate neuronal or glial progeny is not well understood. Here we addressed how murine adult hippocampal NSC fate is regulated and describe how Scaffold Attachment Factor B (SAFB) blocks oligodendrocyte production to enable neuron generation. We found that SAFB prevents NSC expression of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor I/B (NFIB) by binding to sequences in the <i>Nfib</i> mRNA and enhancing Drosha-dependent cleavage of the transcripts. We show that increasing SAFB expression prevents oligodendrocyte production by multipotent adult NSCs, and conditional deletion of <i>Safb</i> increases NFIB expression and oligodendrocyte formation in the adult hippocampus. Our results provide novel insights into a mechanism that controls Drosha functions for selective regulation of NSC fate by modulating the post-transcriptional destabilization of <i>Nfib</i> mRNA in a lineage-specific manner.

">Neurocomputational Mechanisms Underlying Maladaptive Self-Belief Formation in Depression</a></h4>

              
                A core symptom of major depression is maladaptive self-beliefs. These are perpetuated by negatively biased feedback processing. Understanding the neurocomputational mechanisms of biased belief updating may help to counteract maladaptive beliefs. The present study uses functional neuroimaging to examine neural activity associated with prediction error-based learning in depression and healthy controls. We hypothesized that increasing symptom burden is associated with negatively biased self-belief formation and altered neural tracking of social feedback. Results showed that a higher symptom burden was associated with forming more negative self-beliefs and more positive beliefs about others. This bias was driven by reduced learning from positive prediction errors in depression. Neural reactivity of the insula showed increased tracking of more negative self-related prediction errors. The interplay of increased neural responsiveness to negative feedback and reduced learning from positive feedback may contribute to the persistence of maladaptive self-beliefs and, thus, the maintenance of depression.

">Myosin VI controls localization of Golgi satellites at active presynaptic boutons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons, as long-living non-dividing cells with complex morphology, depend on highly elaborate secretory trafficking system which ensures the constant delivery, removal and recycling of proteins and membranes. Previously, we have shown that simplified Golgi-related structures called Golgi satellites (GS), distinct from the somatic Golgi complex, are present in dendrites of primary hippocampal neurons and are involved in glycosylation and local forward trafficking of membrane proteins. However, whether GS are also targeted to axons of principal neurons have not been explored. Here, we investigate the subcellular distribution of GS in adult hippocampal neurons and discover that mobile and stationary GS are present along the entire axonal length, extending to the distal tips of the growth cone. Live imaging experiments revealed that neuronal firing modulates the switch between long range transport mediated by kinesin and dynein and stalling. We found that GS frequently pause or stop at pre-synaptic sites in activity-dependent manner. This behavior depends on the actin cytoskeleton and the actin-based motor protein myosin VI. Overall, our study demonstrates that neuronal activity can dynamically regulate the positioning of GS in the axon, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms underlying organelle trafficking in neurons.

">Nothing but lies: improving the validity of neural predictors of deception</a></h4>

              
                Deception is a universal human behavior. Yet longstanding skepticism about the validity of measures used to understand the biological mechanisms underlying deceptive behavior has relegated such studies to the scientific periphery. Here we address these fundamental questions by applying novel machine learning methods and functional neuroimaging to signaling games capturing motivated deception in human participants. First, we develop an approach to test for the presence of confounding processes and thereby validate past skepticism by showing that much of the predictive power of neural predictors trained on deception data comes from confounding processes. Second, we show that the presence of confounding signals need not be fatal, and we improve the validity of our neural predictor via a novel machine learning procedure that identifies and removes these confounding signals. Together, these findings point to a scientific approach for studying a neglected class of behavior, with important methodological and societal implications.

">Cntnap2 loss drives striatal neuron hyperexcitability and behavioral inflexibility</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by two major diagnostic criteria - persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, and the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (RRBs). Evidence from both human and animal model studies of ASD suggest that alteration of striatal circuits, which mediate motor learning, action selection, and habit formation, may contribute to the manifestation of RRBs. CNTNAP2 is a syndromic ASD risk gene, and loss of function of Cntnap2 in mice is associated with RRBs. How loss of Cntnap2 impacts striatal neuron function is largely unknown. In this study, we utilized Cntnap2-/- mice to test whether altered striatal neuron activity contributes to aberrant motor behaviors relevant to ASD. We find that Cntnap2-/- mice exhibit increased cortical drive of striatal projection neurons (SPNs), with the most pronounced effects in direct pathway SPNs. This enhanced drive is likely due to increased intrinsic excitability of SPNs, which make them more responsive to cortical inputs. We also find that Cntnap2-/- mice exhibit spontaneous repetitive behaviors, increased motor routine learning, and cognitive inflexibility. Increased corticostriatal drive, in particular of the direct pathway, may contribute to the acquisition of repetitive, inflexible behaviors in Cntnap2 mice.

">FAM19A5 Deficiency Mitigates the Aβ Plaque Burden and Improves Cognition in Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                FAM19A5, a novel secretory protein highly expressed in the brain, is potentially associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its role in the AD brain remains unclear. Here, we investigated the potential function of FAM19A5 in the context of AD. We generated APP/PS1 mice with partial FAM19A5 deficiency, termed APP/PS1/FAM19A5LacZ+/-. Compared to control APP/PS1 mice, APP/PS1/FAM19A5LacZ+/- mice exhibited significantly lower A{beta} plaque density, suggesting that FAM19A5 reduction mitigates A{beta} plaque formation. Notably, FAM19A5 partial depletion also prolonged the lifespan of APP/PS1 mice. To further explore the therapeutic potential of FAM19A5 targeting, we developed an anti-FAM19A5 antibody. Administration of this antibody to APP/PS1 mice significantly improved their performance in the novel object recognition test, demonstrating enhanced cognitive function. This effect was reproduced in 5XFAD mice, a model of early-onset AD with rapid A{beta} accumulation. Additionally, anti-FAM19A5 antibody treatment in 5XFAD mice led to increased spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze test, indicating improved spatial working memory. These findings suggest that anti-FAM19A5 antibodies may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD by reducing A{beta} plaques and improving cognitive function.

">A mismatch between striatal cholinergic pauses and dopaminergic reward prediction errors</a></h4>

              
                Movement, motivation and reward-related learning depend strongly on striatal dopamine and acetylcholine. These neuromodulators each regulate the other, and disturbances to their coordinated signals contribute to human disorders ranging from Parkinson's Disease to depression and addiction. Pauses in the firing of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are thought to coincide with pulses in dopamine release that encode reward prediction errors (RPEs), together shaping synaptic plasticity and thereby learning. However, such models are based upon recordings from unidentified neurons, and do not incorporate the distinct characteristics of striatal subregions. Here we compare the firing of identified, individual CINs to dopamine release as unrestrained rats performed a probabilistic decision-making task. The relationships between CIN spiking, dopamine release, and behavior varied strongly by subregion. In dorsal-lateral striatum a Go! cue evoked burst-pause CIN spiking, quickly followed by a very brief (~150ms) dopamine pulse that was unrelated to RPE. In dorsal-medial striatum the same cue evoked only a CIN pause; this pause was curtailed by a movement-selective rebound in firing. Finally in ventral striatum a reward cue evoked slower, RPE-coding increases in both dopamine and CIN firing, without any distinct pause. Our results demonstrate a spatial and temporal dissociation between CIN pauses and dopamine RPE signals, and will inform new models of striatal microcircuits and their contributions to behavior.

                Transmembrane protein 135 (TMEM135) is a 52 kDa protein with five predicted transmembrane domains that is highly conserved across species. Previous studies have shown that TMEM135 is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, thermogenesis, and lipid metabolism in multiple tissues; however, its role in the inner ear or the auditory system is unknown. We investigated the function of TMEM135 in hearing using wild-type (WT) and Tmem135FUN025/FUN025 (FUN025) mutant mice on a CBA/CaJ background, a normal-hearing mouse strain. Although FUN025 mice displayed normal auditory brainstem response (ABR) at 1 month, we observed significantly elevated ABR thresholds at 8, 16, and 64 kHz by 3 months, which progressed to profound hearing loss by 12 months. Consistent with our auditory testing, 13-month-old FUN025 mice exhibited a severe loss of outer hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea. Our results using BaseScope in situ hybridization indicate that TMEM135 is expressed in the inner hair cells, outer hair cells, and supporting cells. Together, these results demonstrate that the FUN025 mutation in Tmem135 causes progressive sensorineural hearing loss, and suggest that TMEM135 is crucial for maintaining key cochlear cell types and normal sensory function in the aging cochlea.

">Spatial modulation of facial expression: enhanced recognition of faces behind the observer</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to recognize facial expressions is crucial for understanding others' emotions and facilitating smooth communication. Numerous studies have explored how we perceive these cues, considering factors such as health, social signals and personality traits. However, most of this research involves observers facing a monitor and assessing facial stimuli presented directly in front of them. Real-life scenarios offer more diverse spatial dynamics, such as conversing with someone at a table or glancing back at a passerby. Thus, faces behind the observer might trigger heightened recognition, akin to reacting swiftly to a perceived threat. Herein, we demonstrate that facial expression recognition is influenced by spatial relationships, i.e., faces in front of versus behind the observer. Participants judged the expressions of faces appearing in front of or behind them in virtual space. The findings of three experiments reveal an enhanced level of recognition for faces behind the participant. Interestingly, this effect varies with emotional valence; anger is amplified merely by the presence of a face behind the observer, while happiness requires actively turning to the rear for enhancement to occur. These findings suggest a biological instinct for perceiving threats behind us, potentially influencing subsequent actions. Hence, spatial relationships may modulate facial expression recognition.

How learners adapt to changing environments is a central issue in both reinforcement learning theory and psychology. For example, learners may adapt to changes in volatility by increasing learning if volatility increases, and reducing it if volatility decreases. Computational neuroscience and neural network modeling work suggests that this adaptive capacity may result from a meta-reinforcement learning process (implemented for example in the prefrontal cortex), where past experience endows the system with the capacity to rapidly adapt to environmental conditions in new situations. Here we provide direct evidence for a meta-reinforcement learning account of adaptation to environmental volatility. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were trained on a restless four-armed bandit reinforcement learning problem under three different training regimes (low volatility training only, medium volatility training only, or meta-volatility training across a range of volatilities). We show that, in contrast to RNNs trained in the low volatility regime, RNNs trained under the medium or meta-volatility regimes exhibited a superior adaption to environmental volatility. This was reflected in a better performance, and computational modeling of the networks behavior revealed a more adaptive adjustment of learning and exploration to varying levels of volatility during test. Results extend the meta-RL account to volatility adaptation and confirm past experience as a crucial factor of adaptive decision-making.

">Hypergraph Cortical Cytoarchitectonic Parcellation with Multimodal Canine Brain Atlas</a></h4>

              
                Brain atlases are vital tools in exploring the brain structure-function relationship. The burgeoning cross-species atlases have significantly accelerated our understanding of human brain development, evolution, function, and diseases. However, the existing coarse-grained macroscopic canine brain atlases greatly constrain their utility as an animal model for neurocognition research. Finer-grained brain atlas and partitions are crucial for decoding brain spatial heterogeneity and topology at different scales. Therefore, we conduct macroscopic and microscopic brain imaging to construct an interactive online dataset of multimodal canine brain atlas. Additionally, we develop a pioneering method for cortical cytoarchitectonic partitioning based on hypergraph learning. By integrating high-dimensional cytoarchitectonic features and spatial connections between cortical columns, the method leads to fine-grained partitioning patterns. This innovative approach aims to decode the biological heterogeneity of cortical microstructures, contributing to the structural annotation of canine atlas as well as public human brain atlases. The study not only offers valuable resources but also presents a novel zonation approach to investigate the cellular organization pattern and topology of the cortex.

">Cell type- and layer-specific plasticity of olfactory bulb interneurons following olfactory sensory neuron ablation</a></h4>

              
                Lifelong neurogenesis endows the mouse olfactory system with a capacity for regeneration that is unique in the mammalian nervous system. Throughout life, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are generated from olfactory epithelium (OE) stem cells in the nose, while the subventricular zone generates neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB) and differentiate into multiple populations of inhibitory interneurons. Methimazole (MMZ) selectively ablates OSNs, but OE neurogenesis enables OSN repopulation and gradual recovery of OSN input to the OB within six weeks. However, it is not known how OB interneurons are affected by this loss and subsequent regeneration of OSN input following MMZ treatment. We found that dopaminergic neuron density was significantly reduced 7-14 days post-MMZ but recovered substantially at 35 days. The density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons was unaffected by MMZ; however, their soma size was significantly reduced at 7-14 days post-MMZ, recovering by 35 days. Surprisingly, we found a transient increase in the density of calretinin-expressing neurons in the glomerular and external plexiform layers, but not the granule cell layer, 7 days post- MMZ. This could not be accounted for by increased neurogenesis but may result from increased calretinin expression. At subsequent time points, calretinin neurons in all three layers showed reduced density at 14 days but recovered to baseline by 35 days. Together, our data demonstrate cell type- and layer-specific changes in OB interneuron density and morphology after MMZ treatment, providing new insight into the range of plasticity mechanisms employed by OB circuits during loss and regeneration of sensory input.

">Reward perseveration is shaped by GABAA-mediated dopamine pauses</a></h4>

              
                Extinction learning is an essential form of cognitive flexibility, which enables obsolete reward associations to be discarded. Its downregulation can lead to perseveration, a symptom seen in several neuropsychiatric disorders. This balance is regulated by dopamine from VTADA (ventral tegmental area dopamine) neurons, which in turn are largely controlled by GABA (gamma amino-butyric acid) synapses. However, the causal relationship of these circuit elements to extinction and perseveration remain incompletely understood. Here, we employ an innovative drug targeting technology, DART (drug acutely restricted by tethering), to selectively block GABAA receptors on VTADA neurons as mice engage in Pavlovian learning. DART eliminated GABAA mediated pauses; brief decrements in VTADA activity canonically thought to drive extinction learning. However, contrary to the hypothesis that blocking VTADA pauses should eliminate extinction learning, we observed the opposite: accelerated extinction learning. Specifically, DART eliminated the naturally occurring perseveration seen in half of control mice. We saw no impact on Pavlovian conditioning, nor on other aspects of VTADA neural firing. These findings challenge canonical theories, recasting GABAA-mediated VTADA pauses from presumed facilitators of extinction to drivers of perseveration. More broadly, this study showcases the merits of targeted synaptic pharmacology, while hinting at circuit interventions for pathological perseveration.

">Single cell RNA sequencing reveals immunomodulatory mechanism of stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment in the brains of aged APP/PS1 mice</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease leads to progressive neurodegeneration and dementia. Alzheimers disease primarily affects older adults with neuropathological changes including amyloid beta deposition, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. We have previously demonstrated that systemic treatment with stem cell factor, SCF, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor, GCSF, reduces amyloid beta load, increases amyloid beta uptake by activated microglia and macrophages, reduces neuroinflammation, and restores dendrites and synapses in the brains of aged APP-PS1 mice. However, the mechanisms underlying SCF-GCSF-enhanced brain repair in aged APP-PS1 mice remain unclear. This study used a transcriptomic approach to explore the mechanisms by which SCF-GCSF treatment alters the functions of microglia and macrophages in the brains of 28-month-old APP-PS1 mice. After 5-day injections of SCF-GCSF, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on CD11b positive microglia and macrophages isolated from the brain. Flow cytometry was used for identifying CD11b positive microglia and macrophages in the brain. Both transcriptional profiling and flow cytometry data demonstrated dramatic increases in the population of macrophages in the brain following SCF-GCSF treatment. SCF-GCSF treatment robustly increased the transcription of genes implicated in activated immune cells, including gene sets that regulate inflammatory processes and cell migration. SCF-GCSF treatment also increased a cell population coexpressing microglial and macrophage marker genes. This cell cluster aligned with a disease-associated microglial profile linked with amyloid beta restriction and phagocytosis. S100a8 and S100a9 were the most robustly enhanced genes in both microglial and macrophage clusters following SCF-GCSF treatment. Furthermore, the topmost genes differentially expressed after SCF-GCSF treatment were largely upregulated in S100a8-9 positive microglia and macrophages, suggesting a largely well-conserved transcriptional profile related to SCF-GCSF treatment in cerebral immune cells. This S100a8-9-associated transcriptional profile contained genes related to pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, neuroprotection, and amyloid beta plaque inhibition or clearance. This study sheds new light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SCF-GCSF-mitigated Alzheimers disease neuropathology in the aged brain.

">Selective agonism of GPR34 stimulates microglial uptake and clearance of amyloid β fibrils</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis through phagocytosis of various substrates, including amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) fibrils, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating microglial A{beta} uptake remain poorly understood. Here, we identified GPR34, a Gi/o-coupled receptor highly expressed in microglia, as a novel regulator of fibrillar A{beta} phagocytosis. Treatment with a selective GPR34 agonist, M1, specifically enhanced uptake of A{beta} fibrils, but not its monomer or oligomer, in both mouse and human microglia. Mechanistically, M1 reduced intracellular cAMP levels, which inversely correlated with A{beta} uptake activity. Importantly, a single intrahippocampal injection of M1 in an AD mouse model significantly increased microglial A{beta} uptake in vivo. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of Japanese AD patient samples revealed a significant reduction of GPR34 expression in microglia from AD patients compared to controls. We also observed an age-dependent decline in microglial GPR34 expression in both human and mouse datasets, suggesting a potential contribution of GPR34 downregulation to age-related A{beta} accumulation and AD risk. Collectively, our findings identify GPR34 as a promising target for modulating microglial A{beta} clearance and highlight the therapeutic potential of GPR34 agonists in AD.

">Limited cognitive resources reduce the language predictability benefit across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                In everyday communication, humans predict upcoming language seemingly effortlessly. However, it remains unclear to what extent the formation of such predictions taxes executive resources. Our study set out to investigate how a limitation of executive resources impacts natural language prediction on multiple timescales in a novel dual-task paradigm, and how this impact is modulated by age. Participants (N = 175; 18-85 years) read short newspaper articles, presented word by word in varying font colours. This self-paced reading task was either performed in isolation or paired with a competing n-back task (1-back or 2-back) on the words' font colour. We measured word-level reading time and block-level reading comprehension as well as n-back performance. To quantify word predictability, we estimated word surprisal on four distinct timescales (i.e., context lengths ranging from words to paragraphs) using a large language model. Under high cognitive load, adults aged 60 and over benefited most from high word predictability. Our results show that independent of timescale, higher cognitive load diminishes the benefits of high word predictability on reading time, suggesting language predictions draw on executive resources.

                Linking sensory-evoked traveling waves to underlying circuit patterns is critical to understanding the neural basis of sensory perception. To form this link, we performed simultaneous electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging through transparent NeuroGrids and mapped touch-evoked cortical traveling waves and their underlying microcircuit dynamics. In awake mice, both passive and active whisker touch elicited traveling waves within and across barrels, with a fast early component followed by a variable late wave that lasted hundreds of milliseconds post-stimulus. Strikingly, late-wave dynamics were modulated by stimulus value and correlated with task performance. Mechanistically, the late wave component was i) modulated by motor feedback, ii) complemented by a sparse ensemble pattern across layer 2/3, which a balanced-state network model reconciled via inhibitory stabilization, and iii) aligned to regenerative Layer-5 apical dendritic Ca2+ events. Our results reveal a translaminar spacetime pattern organized by cortical feedback in the sensory cortex that supports touch-evoked traveling waves.

">Dataset factors influencing age-related changes in brain structure and function in neurodevelopmental conditions</a></h4>

              
                With brain structure and function undergoing complex changes throughout childhood and adolescence, age is a critical consideration in neuroimaging studies, particularly for those of individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions. However, despite the increasing use of large, consortium-based datasets to examine brain structure and function in neurotypical and neurodivergent populations, it is unclear whether age-related changes are consistent between datasets, and whether inconsistencies related to differences in sample characteristics, such as demographics and phenotypic features, exist. To address this, we built models of age-related changes of brain structure (cortical thickness and surface area; N=1,579) and function (resting-state functional connectivity strength; N=1,792) in two neurodiverse datasets: the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental network (POND) and the Healthy Brain Network (HBN). We examined whether deviations from these models differed between the datasets, and explored whether these deviations were associated with demographic and clinical variables. We found significant differences between the two datasets for measures of cortical surface area and functional connectivity strength throughout the brain. For cortical surface area, the patterns of differences were associated with intelligence, while for functional connectivity strength, positive associations were observed with head motion. Our findings highlight that patterns of age-related changes in the brain may be influenced by demographic and phenotypic characteristics, and thus future studies should consider these when examining or controlling forage effects in analyses.

">Discovery and characterization of stereodefined PMO-gapmers targeting tau</a></h4>

              
                Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are an important class of therapeutics to treat genetic diseases, and expansion of this modality to neurodegenerative disorders has been an active area of research. To realize chronic administration of ASO therapeutics to treat neurogenerative diseases, new chemical modifications improving activity and safety profile are still needed. Furthermore, it is highly desirable to develop a single stereopure ASO with defined activity and safety profile to avoid any efficacy and safety concerns due to the batch-to-batch variation in the composition of diastereomers. Herein, a stereopure PMO-gapmer was developed as a new construct to improve safety and stability by installing charge-neutral PMOs at the wing region and by fully controlling phosphorus stereochemistries. The developed stereopure PMO-gapmer construct was applied to the discovery of ASO candidates for the reduction of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, tau). Sequence screening targeting MAPT followed by screening of optimal phosphorus stereochemistry identified stereopure development candidates. While evaluating the stereopure PMO-gapmers, we observed a dramatic difference in safety profile among stereoisomers in which only one phosphorus stereochemistry differs. These results further highlight the benefits of developing stereopure ASOs as safe and well-characterized candidates for clinical studies.

">Phylogeny of neocortical-hippocampal projections provides insight in the nature of human memory</a></h4>

              
                Throughout mammalian evolution, the hippocampal region, unlike the neocortex, largely preserved its cytoarchitectural organization and its role in mnemonic functions. This contrast raises the possibility that the hippocampal region receives different types of cortical input across species, which may be reflected in species-specific memory-related differences. To test this hypothesis, we examined differences in unimodal and transmodal cortical input to the hippocampal region in the rat, marmoset, macaque and human. Our results demonstrate that unlike unimodal cortical input, transmodal cortical input to the hippocampal region was selectively preserved during mammalian evolution. These findings suggest that memory-related processes in different species likely operate on different types of sensory information. Our observations provide a comparative anatomical framework elucidating the process of dimensionality reduction underlying the formation of human memory.

">USP14 regulates pS129 α-synuclein levels and oxidative stress in human SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells</a></h4>

              
                Ubiquitin specific protease-14 (USP14) is critical for controlling protein homeostasis disturbed in human disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we investigated the role of USP14 in regulating proteasome and autophagy pathways, and their influence on -synuclein (-syn) degradation. Data showed that -syn and phosphorylated serine129 -syn (pS129 -syn) were elevated in USP14 gene deleted SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells with concomitant reduction in proteasome activity. Inhibition of proteasomes using MG132 particularly elevated pS129 -syn in these cells, but the levels were not influenced by inhibiting autophagy using chloroquine. In contrast, autophagy and the CLEAR (Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation) pathways were elevated in USP14 lacking cells with an upregulation of the transcription factor TFEB. USP14-ablated cells also exhibited increases in reactive oxidative species (ROS) and elongation of mitochondria. The addition of N-Acetylcysteine amide (NACA) to counteract oxidative stress, reduced pS129 -syn and -syn levels in USP14 deficient cells. Phospho-proteomic analyses revealed that USP14 is phosphorylated at S143 affecting its function and structure as shown by molecular modeling, and protein interaction studies. Re-expression of wild-type and the phospho-mimetic S143D-USP14 mutant decreased ROS, pS129 -syn, and -syn in USP14 lacking cells. These results demonstrate that pS129 -syn levels are sensitive to oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells. USP14 by stimulating the proteasome activity and reducing oxidative stress is a promising factor for targeting -syn and its pathogenic variants in PD.

">Mechanical Properties of White Matter Tracts in Aging Assessed via Anisotropic MR Elastography</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a promising neuroimaging technique to probe tissue microstructure, which has revealed widespread softening with loss of structural integrity in the aging brain. Traditional MRE approaches assume mechanical isotropy. However, white matter is known to be anisotropic from aligned, myelinated axonal bundles, which can lead to uncertainty in mechanical property estimates in these areas when using isotropic MRE. Recent advances in anisotropic MRE now allow for estimation of shear and tensile anisotropy, along with substrate shear modulus, in white matter tracts. The objective of this study was to investigate age-related differences in anisotropic mechanical properties in human brain white matter tracts for the first time. Anisotropic mechanical properties in all tracts were found to be significantly lower in older adults compared to young adults, with average property differences ranging between 0.028-0.107 for shear anisotropy and between 0.139-0.347 for tensile anisotropy. Stiffness perpendicular to the axonal fiber direction was also significantly lower in older age, but only in certain tracts. When compared with fractional anisotropy measures from diffusion tensor imaging, we found that anisotropic MRE measures provided additional, complementary information in describing differences between the white matter integrity of young and older populations. Anisotropic MRE provides a new tool for studying white matter structural integrity in aging and neurodegeneration.

                Student-teacher interactions are fundamental to educational success. Leveraging advancements in hyperscanning technology, this study employs longitudinal EEG data to examine the causal effects of student-teacher inter-brain coupling on academic achievements. The findings indicate that enhanced coupling in the high-beta frequency band can positively predict improved academic performance in both Chinese and math subjects. Our analysis also suggests that student-teacher coupling has a unique and significant predictive advantage for Chinese achievement compared to inter-brain coupling among students. This study underscores the causal impact of student-teacher inter-brain coupling on learning based on robust evidence from real classroom settings, confirming its ecological validity.

">Intracranial neurophysiological correlates of rumination</a></h4>

              
                Rumination is a transdiagnostic psychological process that plays a prominent role in many common psychiatric disorders, albeit its neurophysiological basis remains elusive. Existing neuroimaging studies have highlighted the precuneus and hippocampus as two essential brain regions in rumination's neural underpinnings. Here, we examined the intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings from 21 patients with epilepsy during a naturalistic, continuous, active rumination state and measured the slow frequency (1-8 Hz) and high gamma (70-150 Hz) band oscillation powers. We observed enhanced slow frequency power in the precuneus and reduced high gamma power in the hippocampus during the rumination condition compared to the control condition. The hippocampal high gamma power reduction was associated with the self-reported reflection tendency. Our findings provided the first empirical evidence of the neurophysiological underpinnings of rumination and implicated a precuneus-hippocampus coupling across neural oscillation bands during an active rumination state.

">Neural correlates of rapid familiarization to novel taste</a></h4>

              
                The gustatory cortex (GC) plays a pivotal role in taste perception, with neural ensemble responses reflecting taste quality and influencing behavior. Recent work, however, has shown that GC taste responses change across sessions of novel taste exposure in taste-naive rats. Here, we use single-trial analyses to explore changes in the cortical taste-code on the scale of individual trials. Contrary to the traditional view of taste perception as innate, our findings suggest rapid, experience-dependent changes in GC responses during initial taste exposure trials. Specifically, we find that early responses to novel taste are less "stereotyped" and encode taste identity less reliably compared to later responses. These changes underscore the dynamic nature of sensory processing and provides novel insights into the real-time dynamics of sensory processing across novel-taste familiarization.

">Ability to monitor deviations of own movement without visual feedback</a></h4>

              
                How conscious sensations of movement relates to signals essential for movement control remains under investigation. This question is typically investigated using visuomotor tasks, in which sensation of movement is disturbed by conflicting visual feedback. The present study uses metacognitive judgements to investigate conscious access to movement signals, unchallenged by visual signals, in an index finger force task. We found that some participants can correctly assign metacognitive judgements (MCJs) to their own force, suggesting that participants do indeed have metacognitive access to sensorimotor signals. We found no correlation between metacognitive access to sensorimotor signal and variance in motor performance. Further, we found that in this purely sensorimotor task, internal focus of attention reduces variability in force compared to external focus of attention. Our results indicate that not only is it possible to access sensorimotor information, it is also possible to use focus of attention to reduce variability in force performance.

">Prediction of pathological subthalamic nucleus beta burst occurrence in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The cortico-basal ganglia network in Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by the emergence of transient episodes of exaggerated beta frequency oscillatory synchrony known as bursts. Although beta bursts of prolonged duration and amplitude are well recognised to have a detrimental effect on motor function in PD, the neurophysiological mechanisms leading to burst initiation remain poorly understood. Related to this is the question of whether there exist features of basal ganglia activity which can reliably predict the onset of beta bursts. Current state-of-the-art adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (aDBS) algorithms for PD involve the reactive delivery of stimulation following burst detection and are unable to stimulate proactively so as to prevent burst onset. The discovery of a predictive biomarker would allow for such proactive stimulation, thereby offering further potential for improvements in both the efficacy and side effect profile of aDBS. Here we use deep neural networks to address the hypothesis that beta bursts can be predicted from invasive subthalamic nucleus (STN) recordings in PD patients. We developed a neural network which was able to predict bursts 31.6ms prior to their onset, with a high sensitivity and a low false positive rate (mean performance metrics: sensitivity = 84.8%, precision = 91.5%, area under precision recall curve = 0.87 and false positive rate = 7.6 per minute). Furthermore, by considering data segments that our network labelled as being predictive, we show that a dip in the beta amplitude (a fall followed by a subsequent rise) is a predictive biomarker for subsequent burst occurrence. Our findings demonstrate proof-of-principle for the feasibility of beta burst prediction and inform the development of a new type of intelligent DBS approach with the capability of stimulating proactively to prevent beta burst occurrence.

                The intricate process of -synuclein aggregation and fibrillization hold pivotal roles in Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). While mouse -synuclein can fibrillize in vitro, whether these fibrils commonly used in research to induce this process or form can reproduce structures in the human brain remains unknown. Here we report the first atomic structure of mouse -synuclein fibrils, which was solved in parallel by two independent teams. The structure shows striking similarity to MSA-amplified and PD-associated E46K fibrils. However, mouse -synuclein fibrils display altered packing arrangements, reduced hydrophobicity, heightened fragmentation sensitivity, and evoke only weak immunological responses. Furthermore, mouse -synuclein fibrils exhibit exacerbated pathological spread in neurons and humanized -synuclein mice. These findings provide new insights into the structural underpinnings of -synuclein pathogenicity and emphasize a need to reassess the role of mouse -synuclein fibrils in the development of related diagnostic probes and therapeutic interventions.

">Paradoxical replay can protect contextual task representations from destructive interference when experience is unbalanced</a></h4>

              
                Experience replay is a powerful mechanism to learn efficiently from limited experience. Despite several decades of compelling experimental results, the factors that determine which experiences are selected for replay remain unclear. A particular challenge for current theories is that on tasks that feature unbalanced experience, rats paradoxically replay the less-experienced trajectory. To understand why, we simulated a feedforward neural network with two regimes: rich learning (structured representations tailored to task demands) and lazy learning (unstructured, task-agnostic representations). Rich, but not lazy, representations degraded following unbalanced experience, an effect that could be reversed with paradoxical replay. To test if this computational principle can account for the experimental data, we examined the relationship between paradoxical replay and learned task representations in the rat hippocampus. Strikingly, we found a strong association between the richness of learned task representations and the paradoxicality of replay. Taken together, these results suggest that paradoxical replay specifically serves to protect rich representations from the destructive effects of unbalanced experience, and more generally demonstrate a novel interaction between the nature of task representations and the function of replay in artificial and biological systems.

">3-nitrotyrosine shortens axons of a non-dopaminergic neuron by inhibiting mitochondrial motility</a></h4>

              
                3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), a byproduct of oxidative/nitrosative stress, is implicated in age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Existing literature indicates that free 3-NT becomes integrated into the carboxy-terminal domain of -tubulin through the tyrosination/detyrosination cycle. Independently of this integration, 3-NT has been linked to the cell death of dopaminergic neurons. Given the critical role of tyrosination/detyrosination in governing axonal morphology and function, the substitution of tyrosine with 3-NT in this process may potentially disrupt axonal homeostasis, although this aspect remains underexplored. In this study, we examined the impact of 3-NT on the axons of cerebellar granule neurons, representing non-dopaminergic neurons. Our observations revealed axonal shortening, which correlated with the incorporation of 3-NT into -tubulin. Importantly, this axonal effect was observed prior to the onset of cellular death. Furthermore, 3-NT was found to diminish mitochondrial motility within the axon, resulting in a subsequent reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. The suppression of syntaphilin, a protein responsible for anchoring mitochondria to microtubules, reversed the 3-NT-induced decrease in mitochondrial motility, consequently restoring axonal elongation. These findings underscore the inhibitory role of 3-NT in axonal elongation by impeding mitochondrial movement, implying its potential involvement in axonal dysfunction within non-dopaminergic neurons.

	<p>In patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a lower level of cognitive function is associated with a higher likelihood of progression to dementia. In addition, gait disturbances and structural changes on brain MRI scans reflect cognitive levels. Therefore, we aimed to classify MCI based on cognitive level using gait parameters and brain MRI data. Eighty patients diagnosed with MCI from three dementia centres in Gangwon-do, Korea, were recruited for this study. We defined MCI as a Clinical Dementia Rating global score of &amp;amp;ge;0.5, with a memory domain score of &amp;amp;ge;0.5. Patients were classified as early-stage or late-stage MCI based on their mini-mental status examination (MMSE) z-scores. We trained a machine learning model using gait and MRI data parameters. The convolutional neural network (CNN) resulted in the best classifier performance in separating late-stage MCI from early-stage MCI; its performance was maximised when feature patterns that included multimodal features (GAIT + white matter dataset) were used. The single support time was the strongest predictor. Machine learning that incorporated gait and white matter parameters achieved the highest accuracy in distinguishing between late-stage MCI and early-stage MCI.</p>

	<p>The Michelangelo effect is a phenomenon that shows a reduction in perceived effort and an improvement in performance among both healthy subjects and patients when completing a motor task related to artistic stimuli, compared to performing the same task with non-artistic stimuli. It could contribute to the efficacy of art therapy in neurorehabilitation. In this study, the possible occurrence of this effect was tested in a cognitive task by asking 15 healthy subjects and 17 patients with a history of stroke to solve a digital version of the classical memory card game. Three different types of images were used in a randomized order: French cards, artistic portraits, and photos of famous people (to compensate for the possible effects of face recognition). Healthy subjects were involved to test the usability and the load demand of the developed system, reporting no statistically significant differences among the three sessions (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conversely, patients had a better performance in terms of time (p = 0.014) and the number of attempts (p = 0.007) needed to complete the task in the presence of artistic stimuli, accompanied by a reduction in the perceived effort (p = 0.033). Furthermore, artistic stimuli, with respect to the other two types of images, seemed more associated with visuospatial control than linguistic functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-972/v2?src=rss">Online food delivery services: cross-sectional study of consumers’ attitude in Malaysia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysian consumers were more likely to purchase food online and have it delivered to their doorstep. To stay afloat, many restaurants were pushed to provide online food delivery services (OFDS), and this sector has grown tremendously. However, will the trend persist after the pandemic? This study aims to look into how consumers’ perceptions of OFDS affect their attitude towards them. It investigates the relationship between convenience motivation, perceived ease of use, time-saving orientation and price-saving orientation in terms of future intent to use OFDS. Method Primary data was collected from 307 respondents in Malaysia using convenience sampling method through an online survey. Respondents’ demographic background was presented statistically in cross tabulation tables to study the ratio comparison implicitly. Consistent Partial Least Square approach and bootstrapping techniques with 5,000 subsamples was employed, with the aid of SmartPLS.V3 software, to identify the significant factors influencing consumers’ continuance intention after the pandemic. Result Perceived ease of use does not contribute significantly to continuance intention as most consumers have prior online purchase experience. Nevertheless, time-saving orientation has a positive correlation with perceived ease of use due to the simplicity of placing an order with just a click. It is also found that price-saving orientation is related to convenience motivation, particularly when prices can be compared on the websites or online ordering platforms. Consumers’ intention to continue using OFDS even after the COVID-19 pandemic is positively influenced by all the parameters studied, except for perceived ease of use. Conclusion Limited work has been done on the continuance intention to use OFDS beyond the pandemic. This study provides insight for food retailers on how to enhance their business and retain their customers with the support of technology, even after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Introduction HIV affects over 38 million people worldwide, affecting the immune system and leading to symptoms like fever, lymphadenopathy, and sore throat. High viral loads can lead to opportunistic infections and tumors. The life expectancy of HIV patients has increased due to high-efficiency combination anti-retroviral therapy. Urothelial carcinoma, a malignant development, damages the urinary canal lining. The connection between HIV and urinary cancers is unclear, the aims of this study to report a case of urethral urothelial Carcinoma in HIV patient who underwent total urethrectomy and perineal urethrostomy. Case presentation A 34-year-old male patient with a papilliferous lump on the glans penis for over six months was admitted to the hospital. Preoperative screening revealed HIV and a urethral mass was found. A partial urethrectomy was performed, revealing high grade papillary urothelial Carcinoma. Five months after surgery, the patient developed a recurrent lump, requiring a total urethrectomy, TUR (transurethral resection) of the mass in the prostatic urethra, and perineal urethrostomy. Conclusion Primary carcinoma of the urethra in HIV patient is an extremely rare case. To date, there is no consensus on the primary urethral carcinoma therapy. The treatment of primary urethral carcinoma is tailored specifically to the patient based on the location, histology, and stage of the carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-460/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Branch retinal vein occlusion following COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection while taking oral contraceptives [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Oral contraceptive use, vaccination for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) generally develops mid-60s patients. Herein, we present a case of BRVO caused by the above mentioned risk factors in a young woman. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about BRVO associated with oral contraceptives, COVID-19 vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2. A 21-year-old woman presented with loss of visual acuity in her right eye for 10 days. She had been receiving oral contraceptives for 2 years for oligomenorrhea before noticing ophthalmological symptoms. Despite having received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, she contracted COVID-19 and developed fever, sore throat, cough, low back pain, and general malaise about 40 days before the initial visit. However, only cough persisted for more than a month. The right eye showed BRVO with macular edema (ME). She did not smoke nor had diabetes or hypertension. Blood test results, including cardiolipin antibody IgG, were normal. She was treated with an intravitreal aflibercept injection. ME in the fundus showed rapid improvement and resolution. Although more than 20 months have passed since the first injection, there has been no relapse of ME. The combination of oral contraceptive use, COVID-19 vaccination, and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce the development of venous thromboembolism, thereby leading to BRVO. Given that cases of COVID-19 have increased globally, patients with retinal vein occlusion who use oral contraceptives are likely to be encountered more frequently.

                <p>A classic example of experience-dependent plasticity is ocular dominance (OD) shift, in which the responsiveness of neurons in the visual cortex is profoundly altered following monocular deprivation (MD). It has been postulated that OD shifts also modify global neural networks, but such effects have never been demonstrated. Here, we use wide-field fluorescence optical imaging (WFOI) to characterize calcium-based resting-state functional connectivity during acute (3&nbsp;d) MD in female and male mice with genetically encoded calcium indicators (<I>Thy1</I>-GCaMP6f). We first establish the fundamental performance of WFOI by computing signal to noise properties throughout our data processing pipeline. Following MD, we found that  band (0.4&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) GCaMP6 activity in the deprived visual cortex decreased, suggesting that excitatory activity in this region was reduced by MD. In addition, interhemispheric visual homotopic functional connectivity decreased following MD, which was accompanied by a reduction in parietal and motor homotopic connectivity. Finally, we observed enhanced internetwork connectivity between the visual and parietal cortex that peaked 2&nbsp;d after MD. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that early MD induces dynamic reorganization of disparate functional networks including the association cortices.</p>

                <p>GPR37L1 is an orphan receptor that couples through heterotrimeric G-proteins to regulate physiological functions. Since its role in humans is not fully defined, we used an unbiased computational approach to assess the clinical significance of rare <I>G-protein-coupled receptor 37-like 1</I> (<I>GPR37L1</I>) genetic variants found among 51,289 whole-exome sequences from the DiscovEHR cohort. Rare <I>GPR37L1</I> coding variants were binned according to predicted pathogenicity and analyzed by sequence kernel association testing to reveal significant associations with disease diagnostic codes for epilepsy and migraine, among others. Since associations do not prove causality, rare <I>GPR37L1</I> variants were functionally analyzed in SK-N-MC cells to evaluate potential signaling differences and pathogenicity. Notably, receptor variants exhibited varying abilities to reduce cAMP levels, activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and/or upregulate receptor expression in response to the agonist prosaptide (TX14(A)), as compared with the wild-type receptor. In addition to signaling changes, knock-out (KO) of <I>GPR37L1</I> or expression of certain rare variants altered cellular cholesterol levels, which were also acutely regulated by administration of the agonist TX14(A) via activation of the MAPK pathway. Finally, to simulate the impact of rare nonsense variants found in the large patient cohort, a KO mouse line lacking <I>Gpr37l1</I> was generated. Although KO animals did not recapitulate an acute migraine phenotype, the loss of this receptor produced sex-specific changes in anxiety-related disorders often seen in chronic migraineurs. Collectively, these observations define the existence of rare <I>GPR37L1</I> variants associated with neuropsychiatric conditions in the human population and identify the signaling changes contributing to pathological processes.</p>

                <p>In the study of bodily awareness, the predictive coding theory has revealed that our brain continuously modulates sensory experiences to integrate them into a unitary body representation. Indeed, during multisensory illusions (e.g., the rubber hand illusion, RHI), the synchronous stroking of the participant&rsquo;s concealed hand and a fake visible one creates a visuotactile conflict, generating a prediction error. Within the predictive coding framework, through sensory processing modulation, prediction errors are solved, inducing participants to feel as if touches originated from the fake hand, thus ascribing the fake hand to their own body. Here, we aimed to address sensory processing modulation under multisensory conflict, by disentangling somatosensory and visual stimuli processing that are intrinsically associated during the illusion induction. To this aim, we designed two EEG experiments, in which somatosensory- (SEPs; Experiment 1; <I>N</I> = 18; <I>F</I> = 10) and visual-evoked potentials (VEPs; Experiment 2; <I>N</I> = 18; <I>F</I> = 9) were recorded in human males and females following the RHI. Our results show that, in both experiments, ERP amplitude is significantly modulated in the illusion as compared with both control and baseline conditions, with a modality-dependent diametrical pattern showing decreased SEP amplitude and increased VEP amplitude. Importantly, both somatosensory and visual modulations occur in long-latency time windows previously associated with tactile and visual awareness, thus explaining the illusion of perceiving touch at the sight location. In conclusion, we describe a diametrical modulation of somatosensory and visual processing as the neural mechanism that allows maintaining a stable body representation, by restoring visuotactile congruency under the occurrence of multisensory conflicts.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/19/e1475232024?rss=1">A Neural Decision Signal during Internal Sampling from Working Memory in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>How humans transform sensory information into decisions that steer purposeful behavior is a central question in psychology and neuroscience that is traditionally investigated during the sampling of external environmental signals. The decision-making framework of gradual information sampling toward a decision has also been proposed to apply when sampling internal sensory evidence from working memory. However, neural evidence for this proposal remains scarce. Here we show (using scalp EEG in male and female human volunteers) that sampling internal visual representations from working memory elicits a scalp EEG potential associated with gradual evidence accumulation&mdash;the central parietal positivity. Consistent with an evolving decision process, we show how this signal (1) scales with the time participants require to reach a decision about the cued memory content and (2) is amplified when having to decide among multiple contents in working memory. These results bring the electrophysiology of decision-making into the domain of working memory and suggest that variability in memory-guided behavior may be driven (at least in part) by variations in the sampling of our inner mental contents.</p>

                <p>The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B is implicated in recessive intellectual disability disorders, and heterozygous, protein-truncating variants in <I>KDM5B</I> are associated with reduced cognitive function in the population. The KDM5 family of lysine demethylases has developmental and homeostatic functions in the brain, some of which appear to be independent of lysine demethylase activity. To determine the functions of KDM5B in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we first studied male and female mice homozygous for a <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> allele that lacks demethylase activity. <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID/</I><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> mice exhibited hyperactivity and long-term memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks. The expression of immediate early, activity-dependent genes was downregulated in these mice and hyperactivated upon a learning stimulus compared with wild-type (WT) mice. A number of other learning-associated genes were also significantly dysregulated in the <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID/</I><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> hippocampus. Next, we knocked down <I>Kdm5b</I> specifically in the adult, WT mouse hippocampus with shRNA. <I>Kdm5b</I> knockdown resulted in spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and long-term potentiation deficits. These findings identify KDM5B as a critical regulator of gene expression and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus and suggest that at least some of the cognitive phenotypes associated with <I>KDM5B</I> gene variants are caused by direct effects on memory consolidation mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Glycinergic neurons regulate nociceptive and pruriceptive signaling in the spinal cord, but the identity and role of the glycine-regulated neurons are not fully known. Herein, we have characterized spinal glycine receptor alpha 3 (<I>Glra3</I>) subunit-expressing neurons in <I>Glra3</I>-Cre female and male mice. <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons express <I>Glra3</I>, are located mainly in laminae III&ndash;VI, and respond to glycine. Chemogenetic activation of spinal <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons induced biting/licking, stomping, and guarding behaviors, indicative of both a nociceptive and pruriceptive role for this population. Chemogenetic inhibition did not affect mechanical or thermal responses but reduced behaviors evoked by compound 48/80 and chloroquine, revealing a pruriceptive role for these neurons. Spinal cells activated by compound 48/80 or chloroquine express <I>Glra3</I>, further supporting the phenotype. Retrograde tracing revealed that spinal <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons receive input from afferents associated with pain and itch, and dorsal root stimulation validated the monosynaptic input. In conclusion, these results show that spinal <I>Glra3</I>(+) neurons contribute to acute communication of compound 48/80- and chloroquine-induced itch in hairy skin.</p>

                <p>Coordinated neuronal activity has been identified to play an important role in information processing and transmission in the brain. However, current research predominantly focuses on understanding the properties and functions of neuronal coordination in hippocampal and cortical areas, leaving subcortical regions relatively unexplored. In this study, we use single-unit recordings in female Sprague Dawley rats to investigate the properties and functions of groups of neurons exhibiting coordinated activity in the auditory thalamus&mdash;the medial geniculate body (MGB). We reliably identify coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs), which are groups of neurons that fire synchronously, in the MGB. cNEs are shown not to be the result of false-positive detections or by-products of slow-state oscillations in anesthetized animals. We demonstrate that cNEs in the MGB have enhanced information-encoding properties over individual neurons. Their neuronal composition is stable between spontaneous and evoked activity, suggesting limited stimulus-induced ensemble dynamics. These MGB cNE properties are similar to what is observed in cNEs in the primary auditory cortex (A1), suggesting that ensembles serve as a ubiquitous mechanism for organizing local networks and play a fundamental role in sensory processing within the brain.</p>

                <p>Excitotoxicity and the concurrent loss of inhibition are well-defined mechanisms driving acute elevation in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and neuronal cell death following an ischemic insult to the brain. Despite the high prevalence of long-term disability in survivors of global cerebral ischemia (GCI) as a consequence of cardiac arrest, it remains unclear whether E/I imbalance persists beyond the acute phase and negatively affects functional recovery. We previously demonstrated sustained impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons correlating with deficits in learning and memory tasks in a murine model of cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Here, we use CA/CPR and an in vitro ischemia model to elucidate mechanisms by which E/I imbalance contributes to ongoing hippocampal dysfunction in male mice. We reveal increased postsynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) clustering and function in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that reduces the E/I ratio. Importantly, reduced GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R clustering observed in the first 24&nbsp;h rebounds to an elevation of GABAergic clustering by 3&nbsp;d postischemia. This increase in GABAergic inhibition required activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ion channel transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2), previously implicated in persistent LTP and memory deficits following CA/CPR. Furthermore, we find Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling, likely downstream of TRPM2 activation, upregulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity, thereby driving the elevation of postsynaptic inhibitory function. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism by which inhibitory synaptic strength is upregulated in the context of ischemia and identify TRPM2 and CaMKII as potential pharmacological targets to restore perturbed synaptic plasticity and ameliorate cognitive function.</p>

                <p>BMAL2 (ARNTL2) is a paralog of BMAL1 that can form heterodimers with the other circadian factors CLOCK and NPAS2 to activate transcription of clock and clock-controlled genes. To assess a possible role of <I>Bmal2</I> in the circadian regulation of metabolism, we investigated daily variations of energy metabolism, feeding behavior, and locomotor behavior, as well as ability to anticipate restricted food access in male mice knock-out for <I>Bmal2</I> (B2KO). While their amount of food intake and locomotor activity were normal compared with wild-type mice, B2KO mice displayed increased adiposity (1.5-fold higher) and fasted hyperinsulinemia (fourfold higher) and tended to have lower energy expenditure at night. Impairment of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei was evidenced by the shorter free-running period (&ndash;14&nbsp;min/cycle) of B2KO mice compared with wild-type controls and by a loss of daily rhythmicity in expression of intracellular metabolic regulators (e.g., <I>Lipoprotein lipase</I> and <I>Uncoupling protein 2</I>). The circadian window of eating was longer in B2KO mice. The circadian patterns of food intake and meal numbers were bimodal in control mice but not in B2KO mice. In response to restricted feeding, food-anticipatory activity was almost prevented in B2KO mice, suggesting altered food clock that controls anticipation of food availability. In the mediobasal hypothalamus of B2KO mice, expression of genes coding orexigenic neuropeptides (including <I>Neuropeptide y</I> and <I>Agouti-Related Peptide</I>) was downregulated, while <I>Lipoprotein lipase</I> expression lost its rhythmicity. Together, these data highlight that BMAL2 has major impacts on brain regulation of metabolic rhythms, sleep&ndash;wake cycle, and food anticipation.</p>

                <p>Perception is a probabilistic process dependent on external stimulus properties and one's internal state. However, which internal states influence perception and via what mechanisms remain debated. We studied how spontaneous alpha-band activity (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) and pupil fluctuations impact visual detection and confidence across stimulus contrast levels (i.e., the contrast response function, CRF). In human subjects of both sexes, we found that low prestimulus alpha power induced an "additive" shift in the CRF, whereby stimuli were reported present more frequently at all contrast levels, including contrast of zero (i.e., false alarms). Conversely, prestimulus pupil size had a "multiplicative" effect on detection such that stimuli occurring during large pupil states (putatively corresponding to higher arousal) were perceived more frequently as contrast increased. Signal detection modeling reveals that alpha power changes detection criteria equally across the CRF but not detection sensitivity (<I>d</I>'), whereas pupil-linked arousal modulated sensitivity, particularly for higher contrasts. Interestingly, pupil size and alpha power were positively correlated, meaning that some of the effect of alpha on detection may be mediated by pupil fluctuations. However, pupil-independent alpha still induced an additive shift in the CRF corresponding to a criterion effect. Our data imply that low alpha boosts detection and confidence by an additive factor, rather than by a multiplicative scaling of contrast responses, a profile which captures the effect of pupil-linked arousal. We suggest that alpha power and arousal fluctuations have dissociable effects on behavior. Alpha reflects the baseline level of visual excitability, which can vary independent of arousal.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus receives powerful synaptic inputs from corticotectal neurons in the visual cortex. The function of these corticotectal neurons remains largely unknown due to a limited understanding of their response properties and connectivity. Here, we use antidromic methods to identify corticotectal neurons in awake male and female rabbits, and measure their axonal conduction times, thalamic inputs and receptive field properties. All corticotectal neurons responded to sinusoidal drifting gratings with a nonlinear (nonsinusoidal) increase in mean firing rate but showed pronounced differences in their ON&ndash;OFF receptive field structures that we classified into three groups, Cx, S2, and S1. Cx receptive fields had highly overlapping ON and OFF subfields as classical complex cells, S2 had largely separated ON and OFF subfields as classical simple cells, and S1 had a single ON or OFF subfield. Thus, all corticotectal neurons are homogeneous in their nonlinear spatial summation but very heterogeneous in their spatial integration of ON and OFF inputs. The Cx type had the fastest conducting axons, the highest spontaneous activity, and the strongest and fastest visual responses. The S2 type had the highest orientation selectivity, and the S1 type had the slowest conducting axons. Moreover, our cross-correlation analyses found that a subpopulation of corticotectal neurons with very fast conducting axons and high spontaneous firing rates (largely "Cx" type) receives monosynaptic input from retinotopically aligned thalamic neurons. This previously unrecognized fast-conducting thalamic-mediated corticotectal pathway may provide specialized information to superior colliculus and prime recipient neurons for subsequent corticotectal or retinal synaptic input.</p>

                <p>Elevated iron deposition in the brain has been observed in older adult humans and persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has been associated with lower cognitive performance. We investigated the impact of iron deposition, and its topographical distribution across hippocampal subfields and segments (anterior, posterior) measured along its longitudinal axis, on episodic memory in a sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults at elevated familial risk for AD (<I>N</I> = 172, 120 females, 52 males; mean age = 68.8 &plusmn; 5.4 years). MRI-based quantitative susceptibility maps were acquired to derive estimates of hippocampal iron deposition. The Mnemonic Similarity Task was used to measure pattern separation and pattern completion, two hippocampally mediated episodic memory processes. Greater hippocampal iron load was associated with lower pattern separation and higher pattern completion scores, both indicators of poorer episodic memory. Examination of iron levels within hippocampal subfields across its long axis revealed topographic specificity. Among the subfields and segments investigated here, iron deposition in the posterior hippocampal CA1 was the most robustly and negatively associated with the fidelity memory representations. This association remained after controlling for hippocampal volume and was observed in the context of normal performance on standard neuropsychological memory measures. These findings reveal that the impact of iron load on episodic memory performance is not uniform across the hippocampus. Both iron deposition levels as well as its spatial distribution, must be taken into account when examining the relationship between hippocampal iron and episodic memory in older adults at elevated risk for AD.</p>

                <p>Exercise is known to benefit motor skill learning in health and neurological disease. Evidence from brain stimulation, genotyping, and Parkinson's disease studies converge to suggest that the dopamine D2 receptor, and shifts in the cortical excitation and inhibition (E:I) balance, are prime candidates for the drivers of exercise-enhanced motor learning. However, causal evidence using experimental pharmacological challenge is lacking. We hypothesized that the modulatory effect of the dopamine D2 receptor on exercise-induced changes in the E:I balance would determine the magnitude of motor skill acquisition. To test this, we measured exercise-induced changes in excitation and inhibition using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 22 healthy female and male humans, and then had participants learn a novel motor skill&mdash;the sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT). We examined the effect of D2 receptor blockade (800&nbsp;mg sulpiride) on these measures within a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our key result was that motor skill acquisition was driven by an interaction between the D2 receptor and E:I balance. Specifically, poorer skill learning was related to an attenuated shift in the E:I balance in the sulpiride condition, whereas this interaction was not evident in placebo. Our results demonstrate that exercise-primed motor skill acquisition is causally influenced by D2 receptor activity on motor cortical circuits.</p>

                <p>Animals must distinguish the sensory consequences of self-generated movements (reafference) from those of other-generated movements (exafference). Only self-generated movements entail the production of motor copies (i.e., corollary discharges), which are compared with reafference in the cerebellum to compute predictive or internal models of movement. Internal models emerge gradually over the first three postnatal weeks in rats through a process that is not yet fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated in postnatal day (P) 8 and P12 rats that precerebellar nuclei convey corollary discharge and reafference to the cerebellum during active (REM) sleep when pups produce limb twitches. Here, recording from a deep cerebellar nucleus (interpositus, IP) in P12 rats of both sexes, we compared reafferent and exafferent responses with twitches and limb stimulations, respectively. As expected, most IP units showed robust responses to twitches. However, in contrast with other sensory structures throughout the brain, relatively few IP units showed exafferent responses. Upon finding that exafferent responses occurred in pups under urethane anesthesia, we hypothesized that urethane inhibits cerebellar cortical cells, thereby disinhibiting exafferent responses in IP. In support of this hypothesis, ablating cortical tissue dorsal to IP mimicked the effects of urethane on exafference. Finally, the results suggest that twitch-related corollary discharge and reafference are conveyed simultaneously and in parallel to cerebellar cortex and IP. Based on these results, we propose that twitches provide opportunities for the nascent cerebellum to integrate somatotopically organized corollary discharge and reafference, thereby enabling the development of closed-loop circuits and, subsequently, internal models.</p>

                <p>Forebrain neurons deprived of activity become hyperactive when activity is restored. Rebound activity has been linked to spontaneous seizures in vivo following prolonged activity blockade. Here, we measured the time course of rebound activity and the contributing circuit mechanisms using calcium imaging, synaptic staining, and whole-cell patch clamp in organotypic slice cultures of mouse neocortex. Calcium imaging revealed hypersynchronous activity increasing in intensity with longer periods of deprivation. While activity partially recovered 3&nbsp;d after slices were released from 5&nbsp;d of deprivation, they were less able to recover after 10&nbsp;d of deprivation. However, even after the longer period of deprivation, activity patterns eventually returned to baseline levels. The degree of deprivation-induced rebound was age-dependent, with the greatest effects occurring when silencing began in the second week. Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors indicated that hypersynchronous rebound activity did not require activation of Hebbian plasticity. In single-neuron recordings, input resistance roughly doubled with a concomitant increase in intrinsic excitability. Synaptic imaging of pre- and postsynaptic proteins revealed dramatic reductions in the number of presumptive synapses with a larger effect on inhibitory than excitatory synapses. Putative excitatory synapses colocalizing PSD-95 and Bassoon declined by 39 and 56% following 5 and 10&nbsp;d of deprivation, but presumptive inhibitory synapses colocalizing gephyrin and VGAT declined by 55 and 73%, respectively. The results suggest that with prolonged deprivation, a progressive reduction in synapse number is accompanied by a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition and increased cellular excitability.</p>

                Background Relationship age, hemoglobin, and physical frailty have all been investigated in older people with more than one chronic disease. There has been little analysis of the relationship between hemoglobin, age, physical frailty, plasma levels of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), and the gene polymorphism (SNP) rs7895833 A>G. The goal of this study was to find out how SIRT1 level, SNP rs7895833, hemoglobin, age, and physical frailty (frail score) are related in older Indonesian adults with comorbid chronic diseases. Methods This was an observational study. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from the electronic health records of Universitas Sumatera Utara Hospital, Medan, Indonesia. Physical frailty, SIRT1 level, and SNP rs7895833 were measured using an appropriate and valid method. Purposive sampling was used to determine the eligibility of 132 elderly adults from November 2022 to February 2023. Results The indirect effect of hemoglobin on the frail score (FS) through age was negative and significant, according to a conditional mediation analysis (β=-0.0731; p=0.023). Meanwhile, the direct effect of hemoglobin on the FS was negative and not significant (β=0.1632; p=0.052). According to the conditional moderated mediation analysis, the size of the direct effect of age on FS was increased by genotype AG-GG and SIRT1 level (βlow=0.2647; p=0.002, βmiddle=0.2956; p<0.001, and βhigh=0.319; p<0.001). The size of the conditional indirect effect of Hemoglobin on FS through age was negative and significantly increased by SNP genotype AG-GG and SIRT1 level (βlow=-0.0647; p=0.032, βmiddle=-0.0723; p=0.024, and βhigh=-0.078; p=0.02). Conclusions Higher plasma levels of SIRT1 and the SNP genotype AG-GG may both contribute to physical frailty in the elderly population. Hemoglobin levels in the blood fall with age, which can negatively impact older persons who already have chronic diseases. However, the interactions between these factors are intricate, requiring more study to completely understand the processes underlying development.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-441/v2?src=rss">The interaction between brain-based learning strategies and patterns of infographics and its influence on the development of information concepts among Saudi undergraduate cybersecurity students [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The study reported in this paper investigates the impact of the interaction between brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments and its impact on the development of informational concepts among cybersecurity students. The quantitative data were collected by means of Information Concept Test to determine the levels of information concepts according to the Frayer model (1969). The research sample consists of 80 male and female undergraduate students in Qassim University, who were classified into four quasi-experimental groups according to their preferred patterns in the infographic. Quantitative analysis of findings from this study shows an effect for the interaction between the variables of brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments in the test scores of information concepts in the post-administration, where the significance level (.011) is less than the significance level (0.05). Findings also revealed that the repetition of information at increasing intervals of time using the infographics is effective to learning concepts in an organized manner and to improving short memory. Furthermore, the mental model’s strategy also helped to retain information. The study recommends encouraging the use of brain-based learning strategies and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments to explore the relationships between different scientific concepts, to expand students’ knowledge, and to discover inter-relationships between different subject elements. The study provides a platform for further research to employ different brain-based learning strategies within e-learning environments to acquire higher-order thinking skills and improve students’ memory and mental capacity with the use of modern technological techniques that achieve learning quality.

The activation levels of biologically significant gene sets are emerging tumor molecular markers and play an irreplaceable role in the tumor research field; however, web-based tools for prognostic analyses using it as a tumor molecular marker remain scarce. We developed a web-based tool PESSA for survival analysis using gene set activation levels. All data analyses were implemented via R. Activation levels of The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets were assessed using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method based on data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and supplementary tables of articles. PESSA was used to perform median and optimal cut-off dichotomous grouping of ssGSEA scores for each dataset, relying on the survival and survminer packages for survival analysis and visualisation. PESSA is an open-access web tool for visualizing the results of tumor prognostic analyses using gene set activation levels. A total of 238 datasets from the GEO, TCGA, EGA, and supplementary tables of articles; covering 51 cancer types and 13 survival outcome types; and 13,434 tumor-related gene sets are obtained from MSigDB for pre-grouping. Users can obtain the results, including Kaplan–Meier analyses based on the median and optimal cut-off values and accompanying visualization plots and the Cox regression analyses of dichotomous and continuous variables, by selecting the gene set markers of interest. PESSA (https://smuonco.shinyapps.io/PESSA/ OR http://robinl-lab.com/PESSA) is a large-scale web-based tumor survival analysis tool covering a large amount of data that creatively uses predefined gene set activation levels as molecular markers of tumors.

                <p>by Ryeonghwa Kang, Kyungdeok Kim, Yewon Jung, Sang-Han Choi, Chanhee Lee, Geun Ho Im, Miram Shin, Kwangmin Ryu, Subin Choi, Esther Yang, Wangyong Shin, Seungjoon Lee, Suho Lee, Zachary Papadopoulos, Ji Hoon Ahn, Gou-Young Koh, Jonathan Kipnis, Hyojin Kang, Hyun Kim, Won-Ki Cho, Soochul Park, Seong-Gi Kim, Eunjoon Kim</p>

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently accompany macrocephaly, which often involves hydrocephalic enlargement of brain ventricles. Katnal2 is a microtubule-regulatory protein strongly linked to ASD, but it remains unclear whether Katnal2 knockout (KO) in mice leads to microtubule- and ASD-related molecular, synaptic, brain, and behavioral phenotypes. We found that Katnal2-KO mice display ASD-like social communication deficits and age-dependent progressive ventricular enlargements. The latter involves increased length and beating frequency of motile cilia on ependymal cells lining ventricles. Katnal2-KO hippocampal neurons surrounded by enlarged lateral ventricles show progressive synaptic deficits that correlate with ASD-like transcriptomic changes involving synaptic gene down-regulation. Importantly, early postnatal Katnal2 re-expression prevents ciliary, ventricular, and behavioral phenotypes in Katnal2-KO adults, suggesting a causal relationship and a potential treatment. Therefore, Katnal2 negatively regulates ependymal ciliary function and its deletion in mice leads to ependymal ciliary hyperfunction and hydrocephalus accompanying ASD-related behavioral, synaptic, and transcriptomic changes.

                In statistical analyses, a common practice for enhancing the validity of variance analysis is the application of data transformation to convert measurements into a different mathematical scale. This technique was first employed in 1898 by Edgeworth and remains relevant in current scientific publications despite the proliferation of more modern and advanced techniques that obviate the need for certain assumptions. Data transformations, when appropriately used, can make the model error terms approximate a normal distribution. It is also possible to use the technique to correct the heterogeneity of variances or to render an additive model, ensuring the validity of the analysis of variances. Given that this technique can be hastily applied, potentially leading to erroneous or invalid results, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies in the field of agrarian sciences that utilized data transformations for the validation of analysis of variances. The aim was to check the transformations employed by the scientific community, the motivation behind their use, and to identify possible errors and inconsistencies in applying the technique in publications. In this study, we identified shortcomings and misconceptions associated with using this method, and we observed incomplete and inadequate utilization of the technique in 94.28% of the analysed sample, resulting in misguided and erroneous conclusions in scientific research outcomes.

This pathway controls in vivo physiological oscillatory activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89999">Early acquisition of S-specific Tfh clonotypes after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is associated with the longevity of anti-S antibodies</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been used worldwide to combat COVID-19 pandemic. To elucidate the factors that determine the longevity of spike (S)-specific antibodies, we traced the characteristics of S-specific T cell clonotypes together with their epitopes and anti-S antibody titers before and after BNT162b2 vaccination over time. T cell receptor (TCR) αβ sequences and mRNA expression of the S-responded T cells were investigated using single-cell TCR- and RNA-sequencing. Highly expanded 199 TCR clonotypes upon stimulation with S peptide pools were reconstituted into a reporter T cell line for the determination of epitopes and restricting HLAs. Among them, we could determine 78 S epitopes, most of which were conserved in variants of concern (VOCs). After the 2nd vaccination, T cell clonotypes highly responsive to recall S stimulation were polarized to follicular helper T (Tfh)-like cells in donors exhibiting sustained anti-S antibody titers (designated as ‘sustainers’), but not in ‘decliners’. Even before vaccination, S-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clonotypes did exist, most of which cross-reacted with environmental or symbiotic microbes. However, these clonotypes contracted after vaccination. Conversely, S-reactive clonotypes dominated after vaccination were undetectable in pre-vaccinated T cell pool, suggesting that highly responding S-reactive T cells were established by vaccination from rare clonotypes. These results suggest that de novo acquisition of memory Tfh-like cells upon vaccination may contribute to the longevity of anti-S antibody titers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95718">The role of RNA in the maintenance of chromatin domains as revealed by antibody mediated proximity labelling coupled to mass spectrometry</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic chromatin is organized into functional domains, that are characterized by distinct proteomic compositions and specific nuclear positions. In contrast to cellular organelles surrounded by lipid membranes, the composition of distinct chromatin domains is rather ill described and highly dynamic. To gain molecular insight into these domains and explore their composition, we developed an antibody-based proximity-biotinylation method targeting the RNA and proteins constituents. The method that we termed Antibody-Mediated-Proximity-Labelling-coupled to Mass Spectrometry (AMPL-MS) does not require the expression of fusion proteins and therefore constitutes a versatile and very sensitive method to characterize the composition of chromatin domains based on specific signature proteins or histone modifications. To demonstrate the utility of our approach we used AMPL-MS to characterize the molecular features of the chromocenter as well as the chromosome territory containing the hyperactive X-chromosome in <i>Drosophila</i>. This analysis identified a number of known RNA binding proteins in proximity of the hyperactive X and the centromere, supporting the accuracy of our method. In addition, it enabled us to characterize the role of RNA in the formation of these nuclear bodies. Furthermore, our method identified a new set of RNA molecules associated with the Drosophila centromere. Characterization of these novel molecules suggested the formation of R-loops in centromeres, which we validated using a novel probe for R-loops in Drosophila. Taken together, AMPL-MS improves the selectivity and specificity of proximity ligation allowing for novel discoveries of weak protein-RNA interactions in biologically diverse domains.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92093">Heritable epigenetic changes are constrained by the dynamics of regulatory architectures</a></h4>

              
                Interacting molecules create regulatory architectures that can persist despite turnover of molecules. Although epigenetic changes occur within the context of such architectures, there is limited understanding of how they can influence the heritability of changes. Here, I develop criteria for the heritability of regulatory architectures and use quantitative simulations of interacting regulators parsed as entities, their sensors, and the sensed properties to analyze how architectures influence heritable epigenetic changes. Information contained in regulatory architectures grows rapidly with the number of interacting molecules and its transmission requires positive feedback loops. While these architectures can recover after many epigenetic perturbations, some resulting changes can become permanently heritable. Architectures that are otherwise unstable can become heritable through periodic interactions with external regulators, which suggests that mortal somatic lineages with cells that reproducibly interact with the immortal germ lineage could make a wider variety of architectures heritable. Differential inhibition of the positive feedback loops that transmit regulatory architectures across generations can explain the gene-specific differences in heritable RNA silencing observed in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. More broadly, these results provide a foundation for analyzing the inheritance of epigenetic changes within the context of the regulatory architectures implemented using diverse molecules in different living systems.

	<p>The generation of images from electroencephalography (EEG) signals has become a popular research topic in recent research because it can bridge the gap between brain signals and visual stimuli and has wide application prospects in neuroscience and computer vision. However, due to the high complexity of EEG signals, the reconstruction of visual stimuli through EEG signals continues to pose a challenge. In this work, we propose an EEG-ConDiffusion framework that involves three stages: feature extraction, fine-tuning of the pretrained model, and image generation. In the EEG-ConDiffusion framework, classification features of EEG signals are first obtained through the feature extraction block. Then, the classification features are taken as conditions to fine-tune the stable diffusion model in the image generation block to generate images with corresponding semantics. This framework combines EEG classification and image generation means to enhance the quality of generated images. Our proposed framework was tested on an EEG-based visual classification dataset. The performance of our framework is measured by classification accuracy, 50-way top-k accuracy, and inception score. The results indicate that the proposed EEG-Condiffusion framework can extract effective classification features and generate high-quality images from EEG signals to realize EEG-to-image conversion.</p>

	<p>The psychological refractory period (PRP) effect occurs when two stimuli that require separate responses are presented sequentially, particularly with a short and variable time interval between them. Fatigue is a suboptimal psycho-physiological state that leads to changes in strategies. In recent years, numerous studies have investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on motor control. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of two tDCS methods, anodal and cathodal, on PRP in ten different conditions of stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs) under non-fatigue and mental fatigue conditions. The participants involved 39 male university students aged 19 to 25 years. In the pre-test, they were assessed using the PRP measurement tool under both non-fatigue and mental fatigue conditions. The mental fatigue was induced by a 30-min Stroop task. The test consisted of two stimuli with different SOAs (50, 75, 100, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 ms). The first was a visual stimulus with three choices (letters A, B, and C). After a random SOA, the second stimulus, a visual stimulus with three choices (colors red, yellow, and blue), was presented. Subsequently, participants were randomly assigned to the anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation groups and underwent four consecutive sessions of tDCS stimulation. In the anodal and cathodal stimulation groups, 20 min of tDCS stimulation were applied to the PLPFC area in each session, while in the sham group, the stimulation was artificially applied. All participants were assessed using the same measurement tools as in the pre-test phase, in a post-test phase one day after the last stimulation session, and in a follow-up phase four days after that. Inferential statistics include mixed ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, independent, and dependent t-tests. The findings indicated that the response time to the second stimulus was longer at lower SOAs. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in this regard. Additionally, there was no significant difference in response time to the second stimulus between the fatigue and non-fatigue conditions, or between the groups. Therefore, tDCS had no significant effect. There was a significant difference between mental fatigue and non-fatigue conditions in the psychological refractory period. Moreover, at lower SOAs, the PRP was longer than at higher SOAs. In conditions of fatigue, the active stimulation groups (anodal and cathodal) performed better than the sham stimulation group at higher SOAs. Considering the difference in response to both stimuli at different SOAs, some central aspects of the response can be simultaneously parallel. Fatigue also affects parallel processing. This study supports the response integration phenomenon in PRP, which predicts that there will be an increase in response time to the first stimulus as the interval between the presentation of the two stimuli increases. This finding contradicts the bottleneck model. In this study, the effectiveness of cathodal and anodal tDCS on response time to the second stimulus and PRP was found to be very small.</p>

	<p>Rotenone is a pesticide used in research for its ability to induce changes similar, in vivo and in vitro, to those observed in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). This includes a selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism through which rotenone modifies structure and function of neurons remains unclear. The PC12 cells closely resemble dopamine terminal neurons. This makes it a preferred model for studying the morphology of central dopamine neurons and predicting neurotoxicity. In this paper, we investigated the effects of 0.5 &amp;amp;micro;M rotenone for 24&amp;amp;ndash;48 h on PC12 cell viability and ultrastructure (TEM), trying to identify primary and more evident alterations that can be related to neuronal damages similar to that seen in animal PD models. Cell viability decreased after 24 h rotenone treatment, with a further decrease after 48 h. Ultrastructural changes included vacuolar degeneration, mitochondrial mild swelling, decrease in the number of neuropeptide granules, and the loss of cell-to-cell adhesion. These findings are in agreement with previous research suggesting that rotenone, by inhibiting energy production and increasing ROS generation, is responsible for significant alterations of the ultrastructure and cell death of PC12 cells. Our data confirm the link between rotenone exposure, neuronal damage, and changes in dopamine metabolism, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>

	<p>Infant attention is a cognitive function that underlines sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor integration processes at the interface between the baby and the surrounding physical and socio-relational environment, mainly with the caregivers. The investigation of the role of non-visual inputs (i.e., vocal and tactile) provided by the caregivers in shaping infants&amp;amp;rsquo; attention in the context of visual impairment is relevant from both a theoretical and clinical point of view. This study investigated the social attention (i.e., gaze orientation) skills in a group of visually impaired (VI) and age-matched sighted controls (SCs) between 9 and 12 months of age. Moreover, the role of VI severity and maternal vocalizations and touch in shaping the social attention were investigated. Overall, 45 infants and their mothers participated in a video-recorded 4 min interaction procedure, including a play and a still-face episode. The infants&amp;amp;rsquo; gaze orientation (i.e., mother-directed, object-directed, or unfocused) and the types of maternal vocalizations and touch (i.e., socio-cognitive, affective) were micro-analytically coded. Maternal vocalizations and touch were found to influence gaze orientation differently in VI infants compared SCs. Moreover, the group comparisons during the play episode showed that controls were predominantly oriented to the mothers, while VI infants were less socially oriented. Visual impairment severity did not emerge as linked with social attention. These findings contribute to our understanding of socio-cognitive developmental trajectories in VI infants and highlight the need for tailored interventions to promote optimal outcomes for VI populations.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases. Epileptic seizures very often result in head injuries that may lead to many adverse consequences, both acute and chronic. They contribute to the need for hospitalization, modification of treatment, and a general decline in social productivity. The objective of our review is to characterize and assess management aspects of seizure-related head injuries (SRHIs) as an important and frequent clinical problem present in emergency department settings. PubMed and other relevant databases and websites were systematically searched for articles on traumatic brain injuries connected with the occurrence of seizures published from inception to 9 April 2024; then, we reviewed the available literature. Our review showed that SRHIs can lead to various acute complications, in some cases requiring hospitalization and neurosurgical intervention. Long-term complications and cognitive decline after injury might be present, eventually implying a negative impact on a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life. Despite being frequent and clinically important, there are still no widely accepted, uniform recommendations for the management of patients with SRHIs. As such, a concise and standardized protocol for the management of seizure-related head injuries in emergency departments is worth consideration.</p>

                Background Sexual violence is prevalent in higher education institutions in Nigeria and stakeholders have encouraged staff and students to blow the whistle whenever they fall victim to or are aware of any sexual violence case. However, there is lack of data about whether the staff and students of these institutions have the intention to blow the whistle internally (within the institution) or not. There is also a lack of data on the existing reporting mechanisms or preferred whistleblowing mechanisms in these institutions. These have hindered the analysis of stakeholders’ opinions on this topic. Methods This data note presents a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data set collected from staff and students of three categories of government owned higher education institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education) in Nigeria. Data collection was between February and December, 2021, during which quantitative data were collected from 21,937 students and 3,108 staff. Qualitatively, 138 students and 111 staff participated in a total of 35 focus group discussion sessions. The study provides unique information on respondents’ attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norm to sexual violence whistleblowing. It also provides information on self-reported sexual violence experiences, whistleblowing intention, reporting systems in higher institutions and the preferred sexual violence whistleblowing mechanisms. Conclusions In this data note, we provide a detailed account of the variables in the dataset and then highlight the potential of this study to contribute to improved sexual violence reporting in higher education institutions, thereby reducing the occurrence of the social menace.

                Background Smartphone use has grown in providing healthcare for patients with low back pain (LBP), but the literature lacks an analysis of the use of smartphone apps. This scoping review aimed to identify current areas of smartphone apps use for managing LBP. We also aimed to evaluate the current status of the effectiveness or scientific validity of such use and determine perspectives for their potential development. Methods We searched PubMed, PEDro and Embase for articles published in English up to May 3rd, 2021 that investigated smartphone use for LBP healthcare and their purpose. All types of study design were accepted. Studies concerning telemedicine or telerehabilitation but without use of a smartphone were not included. The same search strategy was performed by two researchers independently and a third researcher validated the synthesis of the included studies. Results We included 43 articles: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n=12), study protocols (n=6), reliability/validity studies (n=6), systematic reviews (n=7), cohort studies (n=4), qualitative studies (n=6), and case series (n=1). The purposes of the smartphone app were for 1) evaluation, 2) telerehabilitation, 3) self-management, and 4) data collection. Self-management was the most-studied use, showing promising results derived from moderate- to good-quality RCTs for patients with chronic LBP and patients after spinal surgery. Promising results exist regarding evaluation and data collection use and contradictory results regarding measurement use. Conclusions This scoping review revealed a notable interest in the scientific literatures regarding the use of smartphone apps for LBP patients. The identified purposes point to current scientific status and perspectives for further studies including RCTs and systematic reviews targeting specific usage.

                Background There are insufficient in vitro bone models that accommodate long-term culture of osteoblasts and support their differentiation to osteocytes. The increased demand for effective therapies for bone diseases, and the ethical requirement to replace animals in research, warrants the development of such models. Here we present an in-depth protocol to prepare, create and maintain three-dimensional, in vitro, self-structuring bone models that support osteocytogenesis and long-term osteoblast survival (>1 year). Methods Osteoblastic cells are seeded on a fibrin hydrogel, cast between two beta-tricalcium phosphate anchors. Analytical methods optimised for these self-structuring bone model (SSBM) constructs, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining and XRF, are described in detail. Results Over time, the cells restructure and replace the initial matrix with a collagen-rich, mineralising one; and demonstrate differentiation towards osteocytes within 12 weeks of culture. Conclusions Whilst optimised using a secondary human cell line (hFOB 1.19), this protocol readily accommodates osteoblasts from other species (rat and mouse) and origins (primary and secondary). This simple, straightforward method creates reproducible in vitro bone models that are responsive to exogenous stimuli, offering a versatile platform for conducting preclinical translatable research studies.

                Background This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride varnish (CPP-ACPFV) in preventing caries development, enamel breakdown, and sensitivity on molars affected by molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) in children. Methods A total of 100 children aged 6 to 9 years were enrolled in the study with two contralateral permanent molars mildly affected by MIH. Affected molars were randomly and equally assigned to receive either SDF or CPP-ACPFV treatment. The interventions were applied at four different time points (baseline, 3, 6, 9 months), and the incidence of caries, caries progression, enamel breakdown, and sensitivity were assessed. Results The findings of this study revealed significant differences in the incidence of caries between the groups treated with SDF and CPP-ACPFV (P-value < 0.05). Similarly, there was a significant difference in caries progression between the two groups (P-value < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in enamel breakdown scores between the treatment groups, as the majority of teeth in both groups exhibited a score of 0. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in sensitivity between the treatment groups throughout the study period. Conclusions In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that molars treated with SDF demonstrated a lower incidence of caries and a higher rate of caries arrest compared to those treated with CPP-ACPFV. Both interventions showed promise in preventing enamel breakdown and improving sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of SDF and CPP-ACPFV as effective treatments for caries prevention and management, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and appropriate dental care strategies in maintaining oral health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-474/v2?src=rss">Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis presenting in a tertiary care unit in central Nepal [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis, though rare, harbingers a high risk of mortality as well as permanent and disabling neurological deficits. They invariably become socially aloof and marginalized in most parts of our subcontinent owing to the lack of dedicated rehabilitation units amid their poor economic status. There is a paucity of studies pertaining to such rare epiphenomenon within our region. Materials ad Methods A retrospective study of 16 patients presenting with spinal spondyloptosis in a tertiary care center in Nepal was undertaken. The clinical records of the patients were retrieved from the hospital record section to study the demographic variables, modes of injury, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grades, salient radiological characteristics, management strategies, and the resultant clinical outcomes. Result The mean age of the cohorts in our study was 40 years with an age range of 25-80 years. Most of the patients presented in ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade (75%). The cervical spine was involved in the majority (68.75%) of cases. 8 (50%) patients left against medical advice, 2 (12.5%) were managed conservatively, and 6 (37.5%) were operated. The posterior-only approach was undertaken in 4(66.67%) cases. Tracheo-oesophageal fistula occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. And cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. The overall hospital mortality was 3(37.5%). Conclusion Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis on our center mostly involved cervical spine (68.75%). 75% of the patients presented with ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade. 50% of them left against medical advice. 37.5% were operated. The overall hospital mortality was 37.5%. This study emphasizes the implementation of a national spinal trauma data bank and the systematic implementation of dedicated neuro-rehabilitation units. This will thereby help improve the clinical outcome among these ‘socially aloof’ and marginalized subsets of neurosurgical patients.

                Background By conducting an in-depth study of the publications, a review was conducted with the goal of evaluating the sample size in educational research. The sample size, represented by the letter “n,” is a key factor in this research because it specifies the number of participants who represent the target population. Although various studies have been published in the literature defining the processes for calculating sample sizes, there is still much uncertainty. It is vital to understand that there is no single all-encompassing method for determining sample sizes for different study designs. Instead, different study designs call for different approaches to determine sample numbers. Methods Information was retrieved from the databases in accordance with updated PRISMA recommendations. The keywords used for the retrieval of the relevant articles from two databases (Google Scholar and PubMed). The articles were selected by thorough scrutiny and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results Seven articles were selected and the comparison was made among the studies in the relation to methods, objective, and outcome from the enrolled studies. Conclusions The evaluation of the seven studies as a whole concluded that the sample size for testing any novel approach essentially required 24.24 participants in each group. The median sample size for the simulation-based educational research was 30. Further research is required to determine the proper sample size based on a single universal formula for all types of designs.

                Background Machine learning and AI promise to revolutionize the way we leverage medical imaging data for improving care but require large datasets to train computational models that can be implemented in clinical practice. However, processing large and complex medical imaging datasets remains an open challenge. Methods To address this issue, we developed Med-ImageTools, a new Python open-source software package to automate data curation and processing while allowing researchers to share their data processing configurations more easily, lowering the barrier for other researchers to reproduce published works. Use cases We have demonstrated the efficiency of Med-ImageTools across three different datasets, resulting in significantly reduced processing times. Conclusions The AutoPipeline feature will improve the accessibility of raw clinical datasets on public archives, such as the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), the largest public repository of cancer imaging, allowing machine learning researchers to process analysis-ready formats without requiring deep domain knowledge.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic affected stakeholder engagement in sustainability research projects in many ways. But which effects appear permanent today, after the pandemic ended? Methods To address this, we interviewed researchers and stakeholders and carried out a survey among European sustainability research projects in 2022. Results We find that the pandemic years disrupted stakeholder-based research, also with lasting effects. The forced shift to online modes showed how digital engagement can bring benefits in terms of easier and more efficient stakeholder engagement, but also that important aspects are lost, particularly regarding intensity of collaboration and depth of insights. Whether to go online or stay offline depends largely on the research objective, which stakeholders to involve, and how well researchers and stakeholders already know each other. Most researchers and stakeholders want to continue online collaboration in the long term, especially those with positive online collaboration experiences from the pandemic years. Conclusions The pandemic has a long-term impact on stakeholder engagement in research; online engagement cannot replace all benefit of previous in-person interactions with stakeholders, but it has led to digital innovations and expanded the engagement portfolio. Our research has provided qualitative insights into the impact of the pandemic on stakeholder engagement in various sustainability research projects and the implications for the long-term future that are relevant to researchers and funding agencies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-104/v2?src=rss">Hepatocellular carcinoma: Advances in systemic therapies [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is traditionally associated with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Sorafenib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was introduced in 2007 as a first-in-class systemic agent for advanced HCC. After sorafenib, a range of targeted therapies and immunotherapies have demonstrated survival benefits in the past 5 years, revolutionizing the treatment landscape of advanced HCC. More recently, evidence of novel combinations of systemic agents with distinct mechanisms has emerged. In particular, combination trials on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab have shown encouraging efficacy. Hence, international societies have revamped their guidelines to incorporate new recommendations for these novel systemic agents. Aside from treatment in advanced HCC, the indications for systemic therapy are expanding. For example, the combination of systemic therapeutics with locoregional therapy (trans-arterial chemoembolization or stereotactic body radiation therapy) has demonstrated promising early results in downstaging HCC. Recent trials have also explored the role of systemic therapy as neoadjuvant treatment for borderline-resectable HCC or as adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence risk after curative resection. Despite encouraging results from clinical trials, the real-world efficacy of systemic agents in specific patient subgroups (such as patients with advanced cirrhosis, high bleeding risk, renal impairment, or cardiometabolic diseases) remains uncertain. The effect of liver disease etiology on systemic treatment efficacy warrants further research. With an increased understanding of the pathophysiological pathways and accumulation of clinical data, personalized treatment decisions will be possible, and the field of systemic treatment for HCC will continue to evolve.

                Prediabetes has attracted considerable attention because it increases the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Prediabetes is also associated with obesity and dyslipidemia. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a crucial element in the clinical course of metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation that tends to increase in patients with diabetes and prediabetes. Most serological markers of diabetes are detected using invasive techniques that cause anxiety and pain. Therefore, the use of noninvasive techniques for frequent biomarker monitoring is necessary. Salivary diagnostics is an upcoming field for sensitive biomarker detection, such as hs-CRP. HbA1C is a valuable glycemic risk marker and has proven to be a reliable test of time. Both HbA1C and CRP play pivotal roles in diabetes and prediabetes. hs-CRP is a measure of CRP level with greater accuracy. The lower limit of its measurement is 0.01 mg/L and the measurement is more than100 times as sensitive than the CRP measurement (lower limit 5 mg/L). Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate and establish a relationship between these factors in prediabetics. Since metabolic syndrome and prediabetes are the cause and effect of each other, correlating anthropometric measurements and lipid profile with HbA1C and hs-CRP will be our focus.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and arrhythmias significantly surge during laryngoscopy and intubation. Anesthesiologists constantly look for ways to minimize these unwanted reactions. Several medicinal interventions have been suggested to mitigate these side effects; intravenous magnesium sulphate injection is one such intervention. Magnesium sulphate is a divalent salt widely recognized for its capacity to lower sympathetic nervous system muscle cell excitability, which lowers blood pressure and causes vasodilation. It is approved as a medicine to treat preeclampsia and control blood pressure. Moreover, there is growing recognition of its benefits on hemodynamic parameters in patients suffering from ischemic infective endocarditis and heart disease. Magnesium is an asset for reducing negative cardiovascular reactions occurring at the time of laryngoscopy and intubation because of its capacity to reduce catecholamine synthesis from adrenergic nerve ends and the adrenal medulla. Intravenous magnesium sulphate will be used in this trial to assess its effect on reducing adverse hemodynamic responses in candidates for elective laryngoscopy and intubation for ENT surgeries.

                Background Many males encounter the condition of erectile dysfunction (ED), particularly individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Stem cell therapy is a burgeoning treatment modality being explored for individuals with erectile dysfunction in the context of type 2 DM. Nevertheless, the available body of clinical evidence supporting its efficacy remains limited. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in managing erectile dysfunction (ED) resulting from type 2 DM. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Indonesia from October 2020 to January 2023. A total of 26 eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving intracavernosal injections of MSC and the other receiving a placebo. Follow-up assessments were conducted at baseline, month one, and month three. The primary outcomes were measured using the IIEF-5 questionnaire and dorsal artery peak systolic velocity (PSV). Metabolic markers were used as secondary outcomes. Results The IIEF-5 scores for both groups showed a significant increase (p < 0.001) from baseline to month three. There was no significant difference observed between the MSC and placebo groups. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the PSV of the dorsal artery between the two groups (p>0.05). There were no significant differences in metabolic markers between the groups. The incidence of mild post-injection pain was reported by only 11% of individuals, indicating a low occurrence of adverse events. Conclusions Intracavernous administration of MSC did not demonstrate superior efficacy compared to a placebo in improving metabolic or erectile function in diabetic males with erectile dysfunction. Additional research utilizing larger sample sizes and more extended follow-up periods is necessary.

                Background Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the skin, joints, and nails (2-3% worldwide), significantly affects quality of life. Genetic and environmental factors also play key roles. Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral corticosteroids help to manage plaque psoriasis symptoms, but combination therapies might offer greater effectiveness and improved safety profiles. These combinations could potentially reduce medication dosages and side effects in patients. Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of various drug combinations over conventional monotherapies in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, which incorporates palmoplantar psoriasis and psoriasis vulgaris, by discovering and utilizing research articles comprising the same or similar variables as PASI 75 and evaluating the information using RevMan v5.4.1. Method We reviewed the efficacy and safety of combination therapy vs. monotherapy/placebo for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (palmoplantar and vulgaris) using PASI 75 via RevMan v5.4.1. Risk of bias assessment and funnel plots were employed to assess the heterogeneity of each paper. Inclusion criteria – Publications < 20yrs, RCTs, plaque/palmoplantar/psoriasis vulgaris; exclusion criteria – Guttate/arthritic psoriasis, pediatric and pregnant individuals, publications > 20 yrs. Results Seventeen studies were analyzed, comprising a total of 2291 patients (n=1147 with combination regimens and n=1144 with control regimen in the analysis). A significant PASI 75- response was observed in the pioglitazone combination subgroup as compared to placebo (OR=4.92,95% CI 2.19-11.05, P = 0.0001); methotrexate combination subgroup as compared to placebo (OR=2.56, 95% CI 1.67-3.94, P< 0.0001) test of subgroup differences showed P= 0.14, I2= 34%. Incidence rate of abnormality in levels of liver enzymes (OR=1.89,9.5% CI 6.69-5.22, P=0.22), nausea (OR=1.28,95% CI 0.77-2.14, P=0.34), headache (OR=1.28,95% CI 0.77-2.14, P=0.58), fatigue (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.41-1.90, P=0.45).] Conclusion This study showed that combination therapy is very effective for plaque psoriasis, with promising combinations of pioglitazone. While safety seems similar between the groups, larger studies are needed to determine the long-term effects. These findings suggest that personalized treatment plans could improve outcomes; however, confirmation through larger trials is crucial before wider use. This opens doors to research on optimal combinations for individual patients.

                Cell-to-cell gene expression variability is an inherent feature of complex biological systems, such as immunity and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool to quantify this heterogeneity, but it is prone to strong technical noise. In this article, we describe a step-by-step computational workflow that uses the BASiCS Bioconductor package to robustly quantify expression variability within and between known groups of cells (such as experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS uses an integrated framework for data normalisation, technical noise quantification and downstream analyses, propagating statistical uncertainty across these steps. Within a single seemingly homogeneous cell population, BASiCS can identify highly variable genes that exhibit strong heterogeneity as well as lowly variable genes with stable expression. BASiCS also uses a probabilistic decision rule to identify changes in expression variability between cell populations, whilst avoiding confounding effects related to differences in technical noise or in overall abundance. Using a publicly available dataset, we guide users through a complete pipeline that includes preliminary steps for quality control, as well as data exploration using the scater and scran Bioconductor packages. The workflow is accompanied by a Docker image that ensures the reproducibility of our results.

                <p>by István Oszoli, István Zachar</p>

The emergence of multicellularity is one of the major transitions in evolution that happened multiple times independently. During aggregative multicellularity, genetically potentially unrelated lineages cooperate to form transient multicellular groups. Unlike clonal multicellularity, aggregative multicellular organisms do not rely on kin selection instead other mechanisms maintain cooperation against cheater phenotypes that benefit from cooperators but do not contribute to groups. Spatiality with limited diffusion can facilitate group selection, as interactions among individuals are restricted to local neighbourhoods only. Selection for larger size (e.g. avoiding predation) may facilitate the emergence of aggregation, though it is unknown, whether and how much role such selection played during the evolution of aggregative multicellularity. We have investigated the effect of spatiality and the necessity of predation on the stability of aggregative multicellularity via individual-based modelling on the ecological timescale. We have examined whether aggregation facilitates the survival of cooperators in a temporally heterogeneous environment against cheaters, where only a subset of the population is allowed to periodically colonize a new, resource-rich habitat. Cooperators constitutively produce adhesive molecules to promote aggregation and propagule-formation while cheaters spare this expense to grow faster but cannot aggregate on their own, hence depending on cooperators for long-term survival. We have compared different population-level reproduction modes with and without individual selection (predation) to evaluate the different hypotheses. In a temporally homogeneous environment without propagule-based colonization, cheaters always win. Predation can benefit cooperators, but it is not enough to maintain the necessary cooperator amount in successive dispersals, either randomly or by fragmentation. Aggregation-based propagation however can ensure the adequate ratio of cooperators-to-cheaters in the propagule and is sufficient to do so even without predation. Spatiality combined with temporal heterogeneity helps cooperators via group selection, thus facilitating aggregative multicellularity. External stress selecting for larger size (e.g. predation) may facilitate aggregation, however, according to our results, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for aggregative multicellularity to be maintained when there is effective group-selection.

                <p>by Luke Trinity, Ulrike Stege, Hosna Jabbari</p>

Understanding and targeting functional RNA structures towards treatment of coronavirus infection can help us to prepare for novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19), and any other coronaviruses that could emerge via human-to-human transmission or potential zoonotic (inter-species) events. Leveraging the fact that all coronaviruses use a mechanism known as −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to replicate, we apply algorithms to predict the most energetically favourable secondary structures (each nucleotide involved in at most one pairing) that may be involved in regulating the −1 PRF event in coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. We compute previously unknown most stable structure predictions for the frameshift site of coronaviruses via hierarchical folding, a biologically motivated framework where initial non-crossing structure folds first, followed by subsequent, possibly crossing (pseudoknotted), structures. Using mutual information from 181 coronavirus sequences, in conjunction with the algorithm KnotAli, we compute secondary structure predictions for the frameshift site of different coronaviruses. We then utilize the Shapify algorithm to obtain most stable SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure predictions guided by frameshift sequence-specific and genome-wide experimental data. We build on our previous secondary structure investigation of the singular SARS-CoV-2 68 nt frameshift element sequence, by using Shapify to obtain predictions for 132 extended sequences and including covariation information. Previous investigations have not applied hierarchical folding to extended length SARS-CoV-2 frameshift sequences. By doing so, we simulate the effects of ribosome interaction with the frameshift site, providing insight to biological function. We contribute in-depth discussion to contextualize secondary structure dual-graph motifs for SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the energetic stability of the previously identified 3_8 motif alongside the known dominant 3_3 and 3_6 (native-type) −1 PRF structures. Using a combination of thermodynamic methods and sequence covariation, our novel predictions suggest function of the attenuator hairpin via previously unknown pseudoknotted base pairing. While certain initial RNA folding is consistent, other pseudoknotted base pairs form which indicate potential conformational switching between the two structures.

                <p>by Justin J. Quan, Lachezar A. Nikolov, Jihui Sha, James A. Wohlschlegel, Isabelle Coppens, Peter J. Bradley</p>

<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> resides in its intracellular niche by employing a series of specialized secretory organelles that play roles in invasion, host cell manipulation, and parasite replication. Rab GTPases are major regulators of the parasite’s secretory traffic that function as nucleotide-dependent molecular switches to control vesicle trafficking. While many of the Rab proteins have been characterized in <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>, precisely how these Rabs are regulated remains poorly understood. To better understand the parasite’s secretory traffic, we investigated the entire family of Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing proteins, which are known to be involved in vesicle fusion and secretory protein trafficking. We first determined the localization of all 18 TBC domain-containing proteins to discrete regions of the secretory pathway or other vesicles in the parasite. Second, we use an auxin-inducible degron approach to demonstrate that the protozoan-specific TgTBC9 protein, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is essential for parasite survival. Knockdown of TgTBC9 results in parasite growth arrest and affects the organization of the ER and mitochondrial morphology. TgTBC9 knockdown also results in the formation of large lipid droplets (LDs) and multi-membranous structures surrounded by ER membranes, further indicating a disruption of ER functions. We show that the conserved dual-finger active site in the TBC domain of the protein is critical for its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) function and that the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> orthologue of TgTBC9 can rescue the lethal knockdown. We additionally show by immunoprecipitation and yeast 2 hybrid analyses that TgTBC9 preferentially binds Rab2, indicating that the TBC9-Rab2 pair controls ER morphology and vesicular trafficking in the parasite. Together, these studies identify the first essential TBC protein described in any protozoan and provide new insight into intracellular vesicle trafficking in <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>.

                <p>by Mathieu Malherbe, Liran Samuni, Sonja J. Ebel, Kathrin S. Kopp, Catherine Crockford, Roman M. Wittig</p>

Tool use is considered a driving force behind the evolution of brain expansion and prolonged juvenile dependency in the hominin lineage. However, it remains rare across animals, possibly due to inherent constraints related to manual dexterity and cognitive abilities. In our study, we investigated the ontogeny of tool use in chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), a species known for its extensive and flexible tool use behavior. We observed 70 wild chimpanzees across all ages and analyzed 1,460 stick use events filmed in the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire during the chimpanzee attempts to retrieve high-nutrient, but difficult-to-access, foods. We found that chimpanzees increasingly utilized hand grips employing more than 1 independent digit as they matured. Such hand grips emerged at the age of 2, became predominant and fully functional at the age of 6, and ubiquitous at the age of 15, enhancing task accuracy. Adults adjusted their hand grip based on the specific task at hand, favoring power grips for pounding actions and intermediate grips that combine power and precision, for others. Highly protracted development of suitable actions to acquire hidden (i.e., larvae) compared to non-hidden (i.e., nut kernel) food was evident, with adult skill levels achieved only after 15 years, suggesting a pronounced cognitive learning component to task success. The prolonged time required for cognitive assimilation compared to neuromotor control points to selection pressure favoring the retention of learning capacities into adulthood.
