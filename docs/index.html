                arXiv:2501.17891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency response function (FRF) is an established way to describe the outcome of experiments in posture control literature. The FRF is an empirical transfer function between an input stimulus and the induced body segment sway profile, represented as a vector of complex values associated with a vector of frequencies. Having obtained an FRF from a trial with a subject, it can be useful to quantify the likelihood it belongs to a certain population, e.g., to diagnose a condition or to evaluate the human likeliness of a humanoid robot or a wearable device. In this work, a recently proposed method for FRF statistics based on confidence bands computed with bootstrap will be summarized, and, on its basis, possible ways to quantify the likelihood of FRFs belonging to a given set will be proposed. Furthermore, a statistical test to compare groups of unpaired samples is presented.

                arXiv:2501.18009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have emerged many intellectual capacities. While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore, an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with those traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.

                arXiv:2501.18013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being an example for a relaxation oscillator, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model has been widely employed for describing the generation of action potentials. In this paper, we begin with a biological interpretation of what the subsequent mathematical and numerical analyses of the model entail. The interaction between action potential variable and recovery variable is then revisited through linear stability analysis around the equilibrium and local stability conditions are determined. Analytical results are compared with numerical simulations. The study aims to show an alternative approach regarding Taylor polynomials and constructed difference scheme which play a key role in the numerical approach for the problem. The robustness of the schemes is investigated in terms of convergency and stability of the techniques. This systematic approach by the combination of numerical techniques provides beneficial results which are uniquely designed for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. We describe the matrix representations with the collocation points. Then the method is applied in order to acquire a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. On the other hand, we apply finite difference scheme and its stability is also performed. Moreover, the numerical simulations are shown. Consequently, a comprehensive investigation of the related model is examined.

                arXiv:2412.07783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain development in the first few months of human life is a critical phase characterized by rapid structural growth and functional organization. Accurately predicting developmental outcomes during this time is crucial for identifying delays and enabling timely interventions. This study introduces the SwiFT (Swin 4D fMRI Transformer) model, designed to predict Bayley-III composite scores using neonatal fMRI from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). To enhance predictive accuracy, we apply dimensionality reduction via group independent component analysis (ICA) and pretrain SwiFT on large adult fMRI datasets to address the challenges of limited neonatal data. Our analysis shows that SwiFT significantly outperforms baseline models in predicting cognitive, motor, and language outcomes, leveraging both single-label and multi-label prediction strategies. The model's attention-based architecture processes spatiotemporal data end-to-end, delivering superior predictive performance. Additionally, we use Integrated Gradients with Smoothgrad sQuare (IG-SQ) to interpret predictions, identifying neural spatial representations linked to early cognitive and behavioral development. These findings underscore the potential of Transformer models to advance neurodevelopmental research and clinical practice.

                arXiv:2412.00405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a stochastic SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered) epidemic model with a generalized incidence function. Using the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the model, ensuring that it remains well-defined over time. Through the application of Young's inequality and Chebyshev's inequality, we demonstrate the concepts of stochastic ultimate boundedness and stochastic permanence, providing insights into the long-term behavior of the epidemic dynamics under random perturbations. Furthermore, we derive conditions for stochastic extinction, which describe scenarios where the epidemic may eventually die out, and V-geometric ergodicity, which indicates the rate at which the system's state converges to its equilibrium. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our theoretical results and assess the model's behavior under different parameters.

                arXiv:2501.11409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.

                arXiv:2501.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neurons of artificial neural networks were originally invented when much less was known about biological neurons than is known today. Our work explores a modification to the core neuron unit to make it more parallel to a biological neuron. The modification is made with the knowledge that biological dendrites are not simply passive activation funnels, but also compute complex non-linear functions as they transmit activation to the cell body. The paper explores a novel system of "Perforated" backpropagation empowering the artificial neurons of deep neural networks to achieve better performance coding for the same features they coded for in the original architecture. After an initial network training phase, additional "Dendrite Nodes" are added to the network and separately trained with a different objective: to correlate their output with the remaining error of the original neurons. The trained Dendrite Nodes are then frozen, and the original neurons are further trained, now taking into account the additional error signals provided by the Dendrite Nodes. The cycle of training the original neurons and then adding and training Dendrite Nodes can be repeated several times until satisfactory performance is achieved. Our algorithm was successfully added to modern state-of-the-art PyTorch networks across multiple domains, improving upon original accuracies and allowing for significant model compression without a loss in accuracy.

                arXiv:2501.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-subject variability in EEG degrades performance of current deep learning models, limiting the development of brain-computer interface (BCI). This paper proposes ISAM-MTL, which is a multi-task learning (MTL) EEG classification model based on identifiable spiking (IS) representations and associative memory (AM) networks. The proposed model treats EEG classification of each subject as an independent task and leverages cross-subject data training to facilitate feature sharing across subjects. ISAM-MTL consists of a spiking feature extractor that captures shared features across subjects and a subject-specific bidirectional associative memory network that is trained by Hebbian learning for efficient and fast within-subject EEG classification. ISAM-MTL integrates learned spiking neural representations with bidirectional associative memory for cross-subject EEG classification. The model employs label-guided variational inference to construct identifiable spike representations, enhancing classification accuracy. Experimental results on two BCI Competition datasets demonstrate that ISAM-MTL improves the average accuracy of cross-subject EEG classification while reducing performance variability among subjects. The model further exhibits the characteristics of few-shot learning and identifiable neural activity beneath EEG, enabling rapid and interpretable calibration for BCI systems.

                arXiv:2408.05798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.

Abstract: Boolean functions with good cryptographic properties like high nonlinearity and algebraic degree play an important in the security of stream and block ciphers. Such functions may be designed, for instance, by algebraic constructions or metaheuristics. This paper investigates the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to design homogeneous bent Boolean functions, i.e., functions that are maximally nonlinear and whose algebraic normal form contains only monomials of the same degree. In our work, we evaluate three genotype encodings and four fitness functions. Our results show that while EAs manage to find quadratic homogeneous bent functions (with the best method being a GA leveraging a restricted encoding), none of the approaches result in cubic homogeneous bent functions.

                arXiv:2501.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard genetic programming (stdGP), solutions are varied by modifying their syntax, with uncertain effects on their semantics. Geometric-semantic genetic programming (GSGP), a popular variant of GP, effectively searches the semantic solution space using variation operations based on linear combinations, although it results in significantly larger solutions. This paper presents Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP), a novel and flexible semantic approach that uses a generative transformer model as search operator. The transformer is trained on synthetic test problems and learns semantic similarities between solutions. Once the model is trained, it can be used to create offspring solutions with high semantic similarity also for unseen and unknown problems. Experiments on several symbolic regression problems show that TSGP generates solutions with comparable or even significantly better prediction quality than stdGP, SLIM_GSGP, DSR, and DAE-GP. Like SLIM_GSGP, TSGP is able to create new solutions that are semantically similar without creating solutions of large size. An analysis of the search dynamic reveals that the solutions generated by TSGP are semantically more similar than the solutions generated by the benchmark approaches allowing a better exploration of the semantic solution space.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to improving Genetic Algorithms (GA) in large or complex problem spaces by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process through border trade activities. These strategies increase chromosome diversity, preventing premature convergence and enhancing the GA's ability to explore the solution space more effectively. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in convergence behavior. This approach offers a promising pathway to addressing challenges in optimizing large or complex problem domains.

                arXiv:2501.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained significant attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful outputs, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.

                arXiv:2501.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the energy constraints in autonomous mobile agents (AMAs), such as unmanned vehicles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly favored as a more efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. AMAs employ multi-object detection (MOD) from multiple cameras to identify nearby objects while ensuring two essential objectives, (R1) timing guarantee and (R2) high accuracy for safety. In this paper, we propose RT-SNN, the first system design, aiming at achieving R1 and R2 in SNN-based MOD systems on AMAs. Leveraging the characteristic that SNNs gather feature data of input image termed as membrane potential, through iterative computation over multiple timesteps, RT-SNN provides multiple execution options with adjustable timesteps and a novel method for reusing membrane potential to support R1. Then, it captures how these execution strategies influence R2 by introducing a novel notion of mean absolute error and membrane confidence. Further, RT-SNN develops a new scheduling framework consisting of offline schedulability analysis for R1 and a run-time scheduling algorithm for R2 using the notion of membrane confidence. We deployed RT-SNN to Spiking-YOLO, the SNN-based MOD model derived from ANN-to-SNN conversion, and our experimental evaluation confirms its effectiveness in meeting the R1 and R2 requirements while providing significant energy efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have demonstrated their ability to understand natural language and generate complex code snippets. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel black-box metaheuristic optimization algorithms automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy and Differential Evolution) on the five dimensional black box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-dimensional instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs.

                arXiv:2501.17168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a key evolutionary algorithm widely used in symbolic regression, feature engineering, and scientific modeling. Its high computational demands make GPU acceleration essential for scalable and high-performance evolutionary computation. However, GPU acceleration of TGP faces three key challenges: inefficient tree encoding, highly heterogeneous genetic operations, and limited parallelism in fitness evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce EvoGP, a comprehensive GPU-accelerated TGP framework. First, we design a tensorized encoding scheme to represent tree with different structures as tensors with the same shape, optimizing memory access and enabling efficient parallel execution. Second, we propose a unified parallel framework for genetic operations by leveraging shared computational primitives and implementing dedicated CUDA kernels for scalable performance. Third, we present a fully parallel fitness evaluation strategy for symbolic regression, exploiting both population-level and data-level parallelism to maximize GPU utilization. Moreover, we implement a comprehensive library to provide rich algorithm operators and benchmark problems. EvoGP is extensively tested on various tasks, including symbolic regression, classification, and robotics control, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse application scenarios. Experimental results show that EvoGP achieves up to a 140.89x speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementation, while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of baseline methods. EvoGP is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.

Abstract: Low-rank decomposition has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing parameter efficiency in neural network architectures, gaining traction across diverse applications in machine learning. These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.

Abstract: We consider the problem of team selection within multiagent adversarial team games. We propose BERTeam, a novel algorithm that uses a transformer-based deep neural network with Masked Language Model training to select the best team of players from a trained population. We integrate this with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which trains a diverse set of individual players to choose from. We test our algorithm in the multiagent adversarial game Marine Capture-The-Flag, and find that BERTeam learns non-trivial team compositions that perform well against unseen opponents. For this game, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, an algorithm that similarly optimizes team selection.

This process occurs prior to pyroptotic cell death and is independent of NINJ1-dependent cell lysis. The released ATP drives monocyte recruitment. Other N-terminal GSDMs also increase ATP permeability, highlighting their potential role in immune modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100268">Supralinear dendritic integration in murine dendrite-targeting interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Non-linear summation of synaptic inputs to the dendrites of pyramidal neurons has been proposed to increase the computation capacity of neurons through coincidence detection, signal amplification, and additional logic operations such as XOR. Supralinear dendritic integration has been documented extensively in principal neurons, mediated by several voltage-dependent conductances. It has also been reported in parvalbumin-positive hippocampal basket cells, in dendrites innervated by feedback excitatory synapses. Whether other interneurons, which support feed-forward or feedback inhibition of principal neuron dendrites, also exhibit local non-linear integration of synaptic excitation is not known. Here, we use patch-clamp electrophysiology, and two-photon calcium imaging and glutamate uncaging, to show that supralinear dendritic integration of near-synchronous spatially clustered glutamate-receptor mediated depolarization occurs in NDNF-positive neurogliaform cells and oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons in the mouse hippocampus. Supralinear summation was detected via recordings of somatic depolarizations elicited by uncaging of glutamate on dendritic fragments, and, in neurogliaform cells, by concurrent imaging of dendritic calcium transients. Supralinearity was abolished by blocking NMDA receptors (NMDARs) but resisted blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Blocking L-type calcium channels abolished supralinear calcium signalling but only had a minor effect on voltage supralinearity. Dendritic boosting of spatially clustered synaptic signals argues for previously unappreciated computational complexity in dendrite-projecting inhibitory cells of the hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96798">Role of hepatocyte RIPK1 in maintaining liver homeostasis during metabolic challenges</a></h4>

              
                As a central hub for metabolism, the liver exhibits strong adaptability to maintain homeostasis in response to food fluctuations throughout evolution. However, the mechanisms governing this resilience remain incompletely understood. In this study, we identified Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) in hepatocytes as a critical regulator in preserving hepatic homeostasis during metabolic challenges, such as short-term fasting or high-fat dieting. Our results demonstrated that hepatocyte-specific deficiency of RIPK1 sensitized the liver to short-term fasting-induced liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis in both male and female mice. Despite being a common physiological stressor that typically does not induce liver inflammation, short-term fasting triggered hepatic inflammation and compensatory proliferation in hepatocyte-specific RIPK1-deficient (<i>Ripk1</i>-hepKO) mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that short-term fasting oriented the hepatic microenvironment into an inflammatory state in <i>Ripk1</i>-hepKO mice, with up-regulated expression of inflammation and immune cell recruitment-associated genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing further confirmed the altered cellular composition in the liver of <i>Ripk1</i>-hepKO mice during fasting, highlighting the increased recruitment of macrophages to the liver. Mechanically, our results indicated that ER stress was involved in fasting-induced liver injury in <i>Ripk1</i>-hepKO mice. Overall, our findings revealed the role of RIPK1 in maintaining liver homeostasis during metabolic fluctuations and shed light on the intricate interplay between cell death, inflammation, and metabolism.

	<p>Purpose: Over the past decade, tele-neurorehabilitation (TNR) has emerged as a vital and effective tool for delivering continuous care to stroke patients, playing a key role in enhancing functional recovery and ensuring consistent access to rehabilitation services. In the field of TNR, various protocols are utilized to ensure effective cognitive stimulation at home. Recent preliminary studies highlight the employment of multidomain cognitive interventions, which would seem to induce more stable and relevant cognitive recovery in stroke patients. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of a TNR multidomain cognitive approach to conventional face-to-face cognitive treatment. Methods: A total of 30 patients with stroke were equally enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, patients received sessions of home-based cognitive virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) training. The control group underwent traditional face-to-face cognitive multidomain treatment at the hospital. The therapy was given for one hour every day for four weeks in both groups. Specific cognitive domains, including memory, praxis skills, executive functions, and speech therapy, were stimulated in the procedure. Neuropsychological evaluations were performed at three timepoints: at baseline (T0), at the end of TNR (T1), and six months later (T2). Results: The TNR group demonstrated significant improvements in working memory and language abilities, as well as in depressive symptoms and caregiver burden, with an average decrease of 2.07. Most of this improvement persisted 6 months after treatment. The group that received face-to-face cognitive treatment showed improvements (not persisting at T2) after treatment in a task measuring constructive apraxia and alternating attention with the cognitive skill of set-shifting. Conclusions: According to our findings, multidomain cognitive TNR may be useful in enhancing cognitive outcomes in stroke populations (even six months after treatment concludes). TNR may also be a viable way to deliver these interventions since it boosts people&amp;amp;rsquo;s motivation to train and, consequently, their adherence to treatment while also having a positive effect on caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; distress management.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition in which degeneration mostly occurs in the dopamine (DA)-producing neurons within the substantia nigra in the midbrain. As a result, individuals with this condition suffer from progressively worsening motor impairment because of the resulting DA deficiency, along with an array of other symptoms that, over time, force them into a completely debilitating state. As an age-related disease, PD has only risen in prevalence over the years; thus, an emphasis has recently been placed on discovering a new treatment for this condition that is capable of attenuating its progression. The gut microbiota has become an area of intrigue among PD studies, as research into this topic has shown that imbalances in the gut microbiota (colloquially known as gut dysbiosis) seemingly promote the primary etiologic factors that have been found to be associated with PD and its pathologic progression. With this knowledge, research into PD treatment has begun to expand beyond synthetic pharmaceutical compounds, as a growing emphasis has been placed on studying plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, namely flavonoids, as a new potential therapeutic approach. Due to their capacity to promote a state of homeostasis in the gut microbiota and their long-standing history as powerful medicinal agents, flavonoids have begun to be looked at as promising therapeutic agents capable of attenuating several of the pathologic states seen amidst PD through indirect and direct means. This review article focuses on three flavonoids, specifically epigallocatechin-3-gallate, quercetin, and kaempferol, discussing the mechanisms through which these powerful flavonoids can potentially prevent gut dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, and other molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of PD, while also exploring their real-world application and how issues of bioavailability and potential drug interactions can be circumvented or exploited.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: To examine if head injury (HI) is associated with age at ALS diagnosis in the United States. Methods: In this cross-sectional populationf-based analysis, we identified patients with ALS who were registered from 2015 to 2023 who completed the Registry&amp;amp;rsquo;s head trauma survey module. The association between HI and age at ALS diagnosis was assessed using multivariate analysis. Results: Of the 3424 respondents, 56.6% had experienced a HI. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for an ALS diagnosis before age 60 years for patients with a HI was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.07&amp;amp;ndash;1.45). One or two HIs had an aOR of 1.15 (95% CI, 0.97&amp;amp;ndash;1.36), and five or more HIs had an aOR of 1.58 (95% CI, 1.19&amp;amp;ndash;2.09). HI before age 18 years yielded an aOR of 2.03 (95% CI, 1.53&amp;amp;ndash;2.70) as well as HI between the ages of 18 and 30 years (aOR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.06&amp;amp;ndash;2.06)). When narrowing the analysis to patients with HI before age 18 compared with patients with no HI, we found an association with HI that led to an emergency department or hospital visit (aOR = 1.50 (95% CI: 1.21&amp;amp;ndash;1.86)). Conclusions: In this cross-sectional analysis of ALS patients, HIs occurring in childhood and early adulthood and the number of HIs increased the odds of being diagnosed before age 60 years. These results suggest that HI continues to be a risk factor for ALS and could be associated with a younger age of diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Many prison-sentenced individuals exhibit symptoms of mental dysfunctions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The presence of co-occurring mental disorders further complicates their rehabilitation and social reintegration efforts. Given these challenges, understanding the role of specific disorders, such as ADHD, is critical for developing targeted interventions tailored to the needs of incarcerated individuals and improving their outcomes. This research aimed to clarify the relationships among hyperactivity, criminal behavior, and psychological functioning to inform preventative and therapeutic strategies. Methods: This study investigated the complex interplay among attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, criminal behavior, and various psychological factors in a sample of 391 male inmates from low-security Polish prisons and a control group of non-offending men. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Spearman&amp;amp;rsquo;s rank correlation were used to analyze the relationships among ADHD severity, type of crime (no crime, property crime, crime involving aggression), family functioning, childhood trauma, early maladaptive schemas, and mental health disorders. Results: The results revealed that while traumatic experiences were present across all groups, stronger family cohesion and support were associated with the absence of ADHD symptoms and criminal behavior. As ADHD severity and criminal behavior escalated, particularly in cases involving aggression, family support diminished, and maladaptive schemas, including &amp;amp;ldquo;disconnection and rejection&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;excessive vigilance and inhibition&amp;amp;rdquo;, became more prominent, alongside increased correlations with mental health issues (anxiety and depression). Conclusions: The findings underscore the crucial role of family environment and early intervention in mitigating the risks associated with ADHD and criminal behavior, highlighting the need for comprehensive interventions targeting maladaptive schemas and providing support for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Limitations include the retrospective nature of data collection and the exclusive focus on male inmates in low-security facilities.</p>

                <p>The anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) is a key brain region for orchestrating defensive behaviors. Using in vivo calcium imaging in mice, we observed that AHA neuronal activity increases during footshock delivery and footshock-associated auditory cues. We found that following shock-induced increases in AHA activity, a decrease in activity coincides with the onset of grooming behavior. Next, we optogenetically activated the projections from the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) to the AHA and observed that photoactivation of the VMH-&gt;AHA pathway drives avoidance. Interestingly, repetitive grooming behavior occurs following cessation of stimulation. To identify changes in brain-wide activity patterns that occur due to optogenetic VMH-&gt;AHA stimulation, we combined optogenetic stimulation with positron emission tomography (PET)-based metabolic mapping. This approach revealed the amygdala as a downstream area activated by the stimulation of this pathway. Our findings show that the rise and fall of AHA neuronal activity triggers repetitive grooming behavior following learned fear and optogenetic stimulation. In addition, activation of the VMH-&gt;AHA pathway triggers changes in the activity patterns of downstream brain regions that are reported to be associated with displacement grooming.</p>

                Introduction Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is the material of choice for pulp therapy. However, Ca(OH)2 has drawbacks such as toxicity, poor sealing, and tunnel defect formation. Alternative materials have been developed to provide more biocompatible materials with better dentin formation ability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of composites containing gelatin (G), chitosan (CH), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and Ca(OH)2, namely G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 (Extended data) on inflammation of the dental pulp (expression of COX-2, PGP 9.5, TNF-α, and neutrophil number). Materials and methods A total of 16 Wistar rat models of acute pulp injury were prepared and divided into two groups, treatment and control, 8 with each. In the treatment group, we applied a pulp-capping material using G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 and Ca(OH)2. On the 1st and 3rd days, rats were sacrificed. Tissue samples from 4 rats in each group were processed for histological preparation. COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α were observed using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and neutrophil numbers were observed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Image analysis of COX-2, PGP 9.5, and TNF-α expression was performed using ImageJ software. Results The results showed a decrease in COX-2 expression, but not significantly while PGP 9.5 and TNF-α expression were significantly higher than those in the control group. Neutrophil numbers were lower in the treatment group than in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion The G-CH-TEOS-Ca (OH)2 composite material may have potential as an exposed pulp medicament by reducing inflammation (COX-2 expression and number of neutrophils) and increasing the regeneration factor (TNF-α expression) and nerve (PGP 9.5 expression).

                Background Pediatric myopia is a growing global public health concern, exacerbated by the increasing screen time among children, who spend more time on devices for both entertainment and education. Understanding the link between myopia and screen media use is crucial for promoting children’s long-term eye health and mitigating the burden of myopia. Methods The study was a retrospective study design that investigated 94 complete medical records of myopic patients who had attended pediatric ophthalmology clinic at King Fahad University Hospital (KFUH) in Saudi Arabia between November 2021 and November 2023. Data was cleaned, coded and analyzed using SPSS version 20 to obtain important insights. Results The results revealed a statistically significant difference in total screen time between age groups (4–6 years, 7–9 years, and 10–12 years), with a p-value of 0.021. The most commonly used screen media devices among myopic children were smartphones (98.9%) and laptops (87.2%). Regression analysis indicated that the differences in screen time based on the children’s age at first use of screen media devices (smartphones, tablets, and laptops) were not statistically significant (p =0.196). Additionally, the study found a statistically significant association between patients’ age, the age at which they were first diagnosed with myopia, and their myopia category (p = 0.030 and p = 0.005, respectively). Conclusion The study established a significant association between myopia and screen use in pediatric patients, with total screen time increasing significantly with age. Smartphones and laptops were the most commonly used devices among myopic children. These findings highlight the need to understand the relationship between myopia and screen time in order to develop evidence-based guidelines for managing screen time, protecting children from the adverse effects of screen media exposure, and promoting their eye health and overall well-being.

                Objective To evaluate the effect of local application of Sodium Alendronate incorporated in Carbapol gel together with LLLT on peri-implant tissue healing in Wistar rat femurs. Methods Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: Group 1 (the control group), Group 2 (the Sodium Alendronate group), Group 3 (the Sodium Alendronate and LLLT group), and Group 4 (the LLLT group). Mini implants were placed in right and left femur bones in all the four groups. Implants of groups 2 and 3 were coated in 1mg Carbapol gel incorporated with 1 mg Sodium alendronate. Groups 3 and 4 were exposed to LLLT (CO2 laser, wavelength 830nm; 2.1J/cm2) on 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st day. Animals were sacrificed on the 28th day, following which the femurs were dissected out and stored in 10% buffered formaldehyde for histopathological analysis. Results Groups 3 and 4 showed bony union and formation of reorganized spongiosa whereas Groups 1 and 2 showed fibrous union. The bone marrow from Group 3 had an adult-type fatty marrow, while that from Group 2 and 4 was occupied by red blood cells. Group 1 showed initial stages of bone healing in which the defect occupied more than half of the bone marrow. Conclusion LLLT given using CO2 laser therapy, together with a one-time application of Sodium Alendronate in Carbapol gel at the time of implant placement optimally enhances healing of peri-implant tissues.

                Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a widely distributed bacterium that is Gram-positive and serves as the primary cause of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) episodes. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a sequela resulting from repeated ARF attacks which are also caused by repeated GAS infections. ARF/RHD morbidity and mortality rates are incredibly high in low- and middle-income countries. This is closely related to poor levels of sanitation which causes the enhanced incidence of GAS infections. Management of carditis in RHD cases is quite challenging, particularly in developing countries, considering that medical treatment is only palliative, while definitive treatment often requires more invasive procedures with high costs. Preventive action through vaccination against GAS infection is one of the most effective steps as a solution in reducing RHD morbidity and mortality due to curative treatments are expensive. Various developments of M-protein-based GAS vaccines have been carried out over the last few decades and have recently begun to enter the clinical stage. Nevertheless, this vaccination generates cross-reactive antibodies that might trigger ARF assaults as a result of the resemblance between the M-protein structure and proteins found in many human tissues. Consequently, the development of a vaccine utilizing L-Rhamnose derived from the poly-rhamnose backbone of Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) commenced. The L-Rhamnose-based vaccine was chosen due to the absence of the Rhamnose biosynthesis pathway in mammalian cells including humans thus this molecule is not found in any body tissue. Recent pre-clinical studies reveal that L-Rhamnose-based vaccines provide a protective effect by increasing IgG antibody titers without causing cross-reactive antibodies in test animal tissue. These findings demonstrate that the L-Rhamnose-based vaccine possesses strong immunogenicity, which effectively protects against GAS infection while maintaining a significantly higher degree of safety.

                Background The growing incidence of chronic diseases such as cancer and the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms constitute one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, it is critical to search for new therapeutic alternatives. Moringa oleifera is a plant well known for the properties of its phytocomponents and its role has been analyzed in a variety of fields, from medicine to biotechnology. Methods In this work, the biological activity of Moringa oleifera in human health was explored through a review of 129 original articles published between 2010 and 2021 related to antitumor activity and its potential uses against chronic and infectious diseases. Results Moringa oleifera extracts showed antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antihypertensive and cytoprotective properties at neuronal, hepatic, renal and cardiac levels. Besides, cytotoxic effects, apoptotic and antiploriferative activity against several cancer cell lines has been demonstrated. On the other hand, the antimicrobial potential of M. oleifera was also evidenced, especially against multidrug-resistant strains. Conclusions Hence, it is supported that there is a wide range of clinical entities in which Moringa oleifera exhibits significant biological activity that could contribute to counteracting metabolic, infectious and chronic diseases in a similar or improved way to the drugs traditionally used.

                Background Dual-task assessments, including Walking While Talking (WWT) and Stops Walking While Talking (SWWT) tests, predict fall risk in stroke survivors. However, their effectiveness relative to established predictors, such as the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), remains unclear. This study evaluated the comparative predictive value of WWT and SWWT tests alongside BBS and FES among stroke survivors. Methods This cross-sectional study included 68 stroke survivors who completed WWT-Simple (WWT-S), WWT-Complex (WWT-C), and SWWT, as well as the BBS and FES. Spearman correlations assessed relationships between balance, fear of falling, and dual-task performance. Logistic regression identified fall risk predictors, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated predictive accuracy. The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. Results BBS scores were strongly negatively correlated with WWT-S (r = -0.734, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C (r = -0.737, p < 0.0001), indicating poorer balance with slower dual-task completion. Positive correlations were found between WWT-S and FES (r = 0.668, p < 0.0001) and WWT-C and FES (r = 0.610, p < 0.0001), linking slower completion times with higher fear of falling. SWWT was significantly negatively correlated with BBS (r = -0.625, p < 0.0001). WWT tests had higher sensitivity (97.8%) and specificity (99%) than SWWT (sensitivity = 68.9%; specificity = 91.3%). Logistic regression identified SWWT (Positive) as a significant predictor of fall risk (p = 0.009), and ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.911, indicating excellent predictive power. Conclusions Findings highlight the superior predictive value of WWT tests over SWWT in assessing fall risk among stroke survivors. Incorporating dual-task measures into clinical practice may enhance fall risk evaluation, supporting targeted stroke rehabilitation.

                Background The “all-on-four” concept represents a significant advancement in dental implantology. particularly beneficial in cases of extensive jaw bone loss where invasive bone regeneration procedures are typically required. However, the successful implementation of this technique necessitates meticulous planning concerning implant selection, materials, and prosthesis design. The recent introduction of PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) in dentistry, especially in all-on-four prosthetics, prompts questions regarding its clinical efficacy and comparative biomechanical and biological advantages over conventional materials such as titanium and zirconia. While some studies have compared PEEK with other materials, systematic reviews evaluating its efficacy are scarce. This systematic review protocol intends to assess the evidence regarding the viability of PEEK as a potential alternative within the all-on-four approach in dental implantology. Methods This systematic review protocol will adhere to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions and align with the Methodological Expectations of the Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) guidelines. Utilizing a comprehensive search strategy, multiple databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and registries of clinical trials, will be explored. The search aims to identify randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies investigating the application of PEEK in the all-on-four approach for dental procedures. Emphasizing clinically relevant outcomes such as implant survival, prosthesis success, peri-implant complications, and patient satisfaction, this review aims to provide insights into the effectiveness and potential benefits of using PEEK in all-on-four prosthetics. Non-randomized studies will be assessed for bias using ROBINS-I, while randomized controlled trials will undergo evaluation with the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool, ROB II. Discussion The outcomes derived from this systematic review hold great significance for dental practitioners exploring the all-on-four concept. Understanding PEEK’s advantages and limitations compared to titanium and zirconia facilitates tailored treatment plans, enhancing success and satisfaction, ultimately improving dental care quality.

                <p>by Yunyun Dong, Yuanrong Zhang, Yuhua Qian, Yiming Zhao, Ziting Yang, Xiufang Feng</p>

Personalized cancer drug treatment is emerging as a frontier issue in modern medical research. Considering the genomic differences among cancer patients, determining the most effective drug treatment plan is a complex and crucial task. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the Adaptive Sparse Graph Contrastive Learning Network (ASGCL), an innovative approach to unraveling latent interactions in the complex context of cancer cell lines and drugs. The core of ASGCL is the GraphMorpher module, an innovative component that enhances the input graph structure via strategic node attribute masking and topological pruning. By contrasting the augmented graph with the original input, the model delineates distinct positive and negative sample sets at both node and graph levels. This dual-level contrastive approach significantly amplifies the model’s discriminatory prowess in identifying nuanced drug responses. Leveraging a synergistic combination of supervised and contrastive loss, ASGCL accomplishes end-to-end learning of feature representations, substantially outperforming existing methodologies. Comprehensive ablation studies underscore the efficacy of each component, corroborating the model’s robustness. Experimental evaluations further illuminate ASGCL’s proficiency in predicting drug responses, offering a potent tool for guiding clinical decision-making in cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003027">Interaction of cardiac leiomodin with the native cardiac thin filament</a></h4>

Every heartbeat depends on cyclical contraction-relaxation produced by the interactions between myosin-containing thick and actin-based thin filaments (TFs) arranged into a crystalline-like lattice in the cardiac sarcomere. Therefore, the maintenance of thin filament length is crucial for myocardium function. The thin filament is comprised of an actin backbone, the regulatory troponin complex and tropomyosin that controls interactions between thick and thin filaments. Thin filament length is controlled by the tropomodulin family of proteins; tropomodulin caps pointed ends of thin filaments, and leiomodin (Lmod) promotes elongation of thin filaments by a “leaky-cap” mechanism. The broader distribution of Lmod on the thin filament implied to the possibility of its interaction with the sides of thin filaments. Here, we use biochemical and structural approaches to show that cardiac Lmod (Lmod2) binds to a specific region on the native cardiac thin filament in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We demonstrate that Lmod2’s unique C-terminal extension is required for binding to the thin filament actin backbone and suggest that interactions with the troponin complex assist Lmod2’s localization on the surface of thin filaments. We propose that Lmod2 regulates the length of cardiac thin filaments in a working myocardium by protecting newly formed thin filament units during systole and promoting actin polymerization at thin filament pointed ends during diastole.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003022">Pilin antigenic variants impact gonococcal lifestyle and antibiotic tolerance by modulating interbacterial forces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Isabelle Wielert, Sebastian Kraus-Römer, Thorsten E. Volkmann, Lisa Craig, Paul G. Higgins, Berenike Maier</p>

Type 4 pili (T4P) are multifunctional filaments involved in adhesion, surface motility, biofilm formation, and horizontal gene transfer. These extracellular polymers are surface-exposed and, therefore, act as antigens. The human pathogen <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> uses pilin antigenic variation to escape immune surveillance, yet it is unclear how antigenic variation impacts most other functions of T4P. Here, we addressed this question by replacing the major pilin of a laboratory strain with pilins from clinical isolates. We reveal that the resulting strains vary substantially in their attractive forces. Strongly interacting bacteria form microcolonies while weakly interacting bacteria retain a planktonic lifestyle. In mixed microcolonies, different variant strains segregate in agreement with the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis. By combining structural predictions and laser tweezers experiments, we show that the C-terminal region of the pilin is crucial for attraction. Lifestyle affects growth kinetics and antibiotic tolerance. In the presence of ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin, the killing kinetics indicate strongly increased tolerance of aggregating strains. We propose that pilin antigenic variation produces a mixed population containing variants optimized for growth, colonization, or survivability under external stress. Different environments select different variants, ensuring the survival and reproduction of the population as a whole.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002999">Linking citation and retraction data reveals the demographics of scientific retractions among highly cited authors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John P. A. Ioannidis, Angelo Maria Pezzullo, Antonio Cristiano, Stefania Boccia, Jeroen Baas</p>

Retractions are becoming increasingly common but still account for a small minority of published papers. It would be useful to generate databases where the presence of retractions can be linked to impact metrics of each scientist. We have thus incorporated retraction data in an updated Scopus-based database of highly cited scientists (top 2% in each scientific subfield according to a composite citation indicator). Using data from the Retraction Watch database (RWDB), retraction records were linked to Scopus citation data. Of 55,237 items in RWDB as of August 15, 2024, we excluded non-retractions, retractions clearly not due to any author error, retractions where the paper had been republished, and items not linkable to Scopus records. Eventually, 39,468 eligible retractions were linked to Scopus. Among 217,097 top-cited scientists in career-long impact and 223,152 in single recent year (2023) impact, 7,083 (3.3%) and 8,747 (4.0%), respectively, had at least 1 retraction. Scientists with retracted publications had younger publication age, higher self-citation rates, and larger publication volume than those without any retracted publications. Retractions were more common in the life sciences and rare or nonexistent in several other disciplines. In several developing countries, very high proportions of top-cited scientists had retractions (highest in Senegal (66.7%), Ecuador (28.6%), and Pakistan (27.8%) in career-long citation impact lists). Variability in retraction rates across fields and countries suggests differences in research practices, scrutiny, and ease of retraction. Addition of retraction data enhances the granularity of top-cited scientists’ profiles, aiding in responsible research evaluation. However, caution is needed when interpreting retractions, as they do not always signify misconduct; further analysis on a case-by-case basis is essential. The database should hopefully provide a resource for meta-research and deeper insights into scientific practices.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002975">Oxygen-binding proteins aid oxygen diffusion to enhance fitness of a yeast model of multicellularity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Whitney Wong, Pablo Bravo, Peter J. Yunker, William C. Ratcliff, Anthony J. Burnetti</p>

Oxygen availability is a key factor in the evolution of multicellularity, as larger and more sophisticated organisms often require mechanisms allowing efficient oxygen delivery to their tissues. One such mechanism is the presence of oxygen-binding proteins, such as globins and hemerythrins, which arose in the ancestor of bilaterian animals. Despite their importance, the precise mechanisms by which oxygen-binding proteins influenced the early stages of multicellular evolution under varying environmental oxygen levels are not yet clear. We address this knowledge gap by heterologously expressing the oxygen-binding proteins myoglobin and myohemerythrin in snowflake yeast, a model system of simple, undifferentiated multicellularity. These proteins increased the depth and rate of oxygen diffusion, increasing the fitness of snowflake yeast growing aerobically. Experiments show that, paradoxically, oxygen-binding proteins confer a greater fitness benefit for larger organisms when O<sub>2</sub> is least limiting. We show via biophysical modeling that this is because facilitated diffusion is more efficient when oxygen is abundant, transporting a greater quantity of O<sub>2</sub> which can be used for metabolism. By alleviating anatomical diffusion limitations to oxygen consumption, the evolution of oxygen-binding proteins in the oxygen-rich Neoproterozoic may have been a key breakthrough enabling the evolution of increasingly large, complex multicellular metazoan lineages.

Body size declines are a common response to warming via both plasticity and evolution, but variable size responses have been observed for terrestrial ectotherms. We investigate how temperature-dependent development and growth rates in ectothermic organisms induce variation in size responses. Leveraging long-term data for six montane grasshopper species spanning 1,768–3 901 m, we detect size shifts since ~1960 that depend on elevation and species’ seasonal timing. Size shifts have been concentrated at low elevations, with the early emerging species (those that overwinter as juveniles) increasing in size, while later season species are becoming smaller. Interannual temperature variation accounts for the size shifts. The earliest season species may be able to take advantage of warmer conditions accelerating growth during early spring development, whereas warm temperatures may adversely impact later season species via mechanisms such as increased rates of energy use or thermal stress. Grasshoppers tend to capitalize on warm conditions by both getting bigger and reaching adulthood earlier. Our analysis further reinforces the need to move beyond expectations of universal responses to climate change to consider how environmental exposure and sensitivity vary across elevations and life histories.

                <p>by Nikita Komarov, Cornelia Fritsch, G. Larisa Maier, Johannes Bues, Marjan Biočanin, Clarisse Brunet Avalos, Andrea Dodero, Jae Young Kwon, Bart Deplancke, Simon G. Sprecher</p>

Food presents a multisensory experience, with visual, taste, and olfactory cues being important in allowing an animal to determine the safety and nutritional value of a given substance. Texture, however, remains a surprisingly unexplored aspect, despite providing key information about the state of the food through properties such as hardness, liquidity, and granularity. Food perception is achieved by specialised sensory neurons, which themselves are defined by the receptor genes they express. While it was assumed that sensory neurons respond to one or few closely related stimuli, more recent findings challenge this notion and support evidence that certain sensory neurons are more broadly tuned. In the <i>Drosophila</i> taste system, gustatory neurons respond to cues of opposing hedonic valence or to olfactory cues. Here, we identified that larvae ingest and navigate towards specific food substrate hardnesses and probed the role of gustatory organs in this behaviour. By developing a genetic tool targeting specifically gustatory organs, we show that these organs are major contributors for evaluation of food hardness and ingestion decision-making. We find that ablation of gustatory organs not only results in loss of chemosensation, but also navigation and ingestion preference to varied substrate hardnesses. Furthermore, we show that certain neurons in the primary taste organ exhibit varied and concurrent physiological responses to mechanical and multimodal stimulation. We show that individual neurons house independent mechanisms for multiple sensory modalities, challenging assumptions about capabilities of sensory neurons. We propose that further investigations, across the animal kingdom, may reveal higher sensory complexity than currently anticipated.

                Introduction Asthma imposes a substantial economic burden on health systems. By understanding the economic burden and its projections, public health officials and governments can design more effective asthma management and prevention strategies. This study aimed to estimate the global economic burden of asthma. Methods We projected future year DALYs lost to Asthma based on DALYs and annual rate of change 1990-2021 from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s (IHME) Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study. We applied the concept of value of a statistical life year (VSLY) to estimate the value of a year of life lost to asthma. Results Our study reveals a disparity between high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The economic burden in low-income countries is expected to increase from 1,090 million dollars in 2023 to 1,265 million dollars in 2050, reflecting both population growth and increased prevalence of asthma. Meanwhile, high-income countries face a much higher burden, with costs rising from 130,290 million dollars in 2023 to 133,370 million dollars in 2050 Conclusion Our study reveal that the economic impact of asthma is projected to increase significantly globally, with a greater growth in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income countries. Our results show a consistent rise in the economic burden of asthma from 2023 to 2050, both in absolute terms and per capita.

                Cities play a dominant and expanding role in human lives and civilization. As such, urban health is an increasingly important facet of public, global, and planetary health, and its profound links to other areas of sustainable development make it an important nexus issue. However, there is considerable variation in how urban health is conceived and understood, including different ideas about its scope and boundaries, proper remit, subjects, protagonists, locus and sources of authority, and relationships to other rubrics. These differences derive from the complexity of urban environments and the emergence and evolution of the field of urban health from actions and perspectives spanning multiple sectors, scales, and domains. Recognizing the value of diverse viewpoints and usages, we explore and clarify several conceptual issues and debates and propose a definition of urban health as a shared basis for strategic action.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic dystonia is a complex movement disorder with diverse clinical manifestations resulting from pathogenic mutations in associated genes. A recent paradigm shift emphasizes the functional convergence among dystonia genes, hinting at a shared pathomechanism. However, the neural dynamics supporting this convergence remain largely unexplored.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Herein, we analyzed microelectrode recordings acquired during pallidal deep brain stimulation surgery from 31 dystonia patients with pathogenic mutations in the <i>AOPEP</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, <i>PANK2</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>SGCE</i>, <i>THAP1</i>, <i>TOR1A</i>, and <i>VPS16</i> genes. We identified 1,694 single units whose activity was characterized by a broad set of neural features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>AOPEP</i>, <i>PANK2</i>, and <i>THAP1</i> displayed higher firing regularity, whereas <i>GNAL</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, and <i>SGCE</i> shared a large fraction of bursting neurons (&gt; 26.6%), significantly exceeding the rate in other genes. <i>TOR1A</i> and <i>VPS16</i> genes constituted an intermediate group, bridging these 2 groups, due to having the highest degree of spiking irregularity. Hierarchical clustering algorithms based on these dynamics confirmed the results obtained with first-order comparisons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Despite lacking common molecular pathways, dystonia genes share largely overlapping structures of neural patterns, in particular the degree of pallidal spiking regularity and bursting activity. We propose that the degree of desynchronization facilitated by pallidal neural bursts may explain the variability in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) surgery outcomes across genetic dystonia syndromes. Lastly, investigating the effects of genetic mutations on low-frequency pallidal activity could optimize personalized adaptive DBS treatments in patients with genetic dystonia.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10738584241309850?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R">Sleep Patterns and Human Brain Health</a></h4>

              
                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>It is a widely held opinion that sleep is important for human brain health. Here we examine the evidence for this view, focusing on normal variations in sleep patterns. We discuss the functions of sleep and highlight the paradoxical implications of theories seeing sleep as an adaptive capacity versus the theory that sleep benefits clearance of metabolic waste from the brain. We also evaluate the proposition that sleep plays an active role in consolidation of memories. Finally, we review research on possible effects of chronic sleep deprivation on brain health. We find that the evidence for a causal role of sleep in human brain health is surprisingly weak relative to the amount of attention to sleep in science and society. While there are well-established associations between sleep parameters and aspects of brain health, results are generally not consistent across studies and measures, and it is not clear to what extent alterations in sleep patterns represent symptoms or causes. Especially, the proposition that long sleep (&gt;8 hours) in general is beneficial for long-term brain health in humans seems to lack empirical support. We suggest directions for future research to establish a solid foundation of knowledge about a role of sleep in brain health based on longitudinal studies with frequent sampling, attention to individual differences, and more ecologically valid intervention studies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100989">Glia control experience-dependent plasticity in an olfactory critical period</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience during developmental critical periods has lifelong consequences for circuit function and behavior, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which experience causes these changes are not well understood. The <i>Drosophila</i> antennal lobe houses synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and downstream projection neurons (PNs) in stereotyped glomeruli. Many glomeruli exhibit structural plasticity in response to early-life odor exposure, indicating a general sensitivity of the fly olfactory circuitry to early sensory experience. We recently found that glia shape antennal lobe development in young adults, leading us to ask if glia also drive experience-dependent plasticity during this period. Here, we define a critical period for structural and functional plasticity of OSN-PN synapses in the ethyl butyrate (EB)-sensitive glomerulus VM7. EB exposure for the first 2 days post-eclosion drives large-scale reductions in glomerular volume, presynapse number, and post- synaptic activity. Crucially, pruning during the critical period has long-term consequences for circuit function since both OSN-PN synapse number and spontaneous activity of PNs remain persistently decreased following early-life odor exposure. The highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper is required for this critical period plasticity as ensheathing glia upregulate Draper, invade the VM7 glomerulus, and phagocytose OSN presynaptic terminals in response to critical-period EB exposure. Loss of Draper fully suppresses the morphological and physiological consequences of critical period odor exposure, arguing that phagocytic glia engulf intact synaptic terminals. These data demonstrate experience-dependent pruning of synapses and argue that <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory circuitry is a powerful model for defining the function of glia in critical period plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85999">A hierarchical pathway for assembly of the distal appendages that organize primary cilia</a></h4>

              
                Distal appendages are nine-fold symmetric blade-like structures attached to the distal end of the mother centriole. These structures are critical for formation of the primary cilium, by regulating at least four critical steps: ciliary vesicle recruitment, recruitment and initiation of intraflagellar transport (IFT), and removal of CP110. While specific proteins that localize to the distal appendages have been identified, how exactly each protein functions to achieve the multiple roles of the distal appendages is poorly understood. Here we comprehensively analyze known and newly discovered distal appendage proteins (CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, TTBK2, FBF1, CEP89, KIZ, ANKRD26, PIDD1, LRRC45, NCS1, CEP15) for their precise localization, order of recruitment, and their roles in each step of cilia formation. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we show that the order of the recruitment of the distal appendage proteins is highly interconnected and a more complex hierarchy. Our analysis highlights two protein modules, CEP83-SCLT1 and CEP164-TTBK2, as critical for structural assembly of distal appendages. Functional assays revealed that CEP89 selectively functions in RAB34<sup>+</sup> ciliary vesicle recruitment, while deletion of the integral components, CEP83-SCLT1-CEP164-TTBK2, severely compromised all four steps of cilium formation. Collectively, our analyses provide a more comprehensive view of the organization and the function of the distal appendage, paving the way for molecular understanding of ciliary assembly.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85998">Myristoylated Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 captures the ciliary vesicle at distal appendages</a></h4>

              
                The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that cycles through assembly and disassembly. In many cell types, formation of the cilium is initiated by recruitment of ciliary vesicles to the distal appendage of the mother centriole. However, the distal appendage mechanism that directly captures ciliary vesicles is yet to be identified. In an accompanying paper, we show that the distal appendage protein, CEP89, is important for the ciliary vesicle recruitment, but not for other steps of cilium formation (Tomoharu Kanie, Love, Fisher, Gustavsson, &amp; Jackson, 2023). The lack of a membrane binding motif in CEP89 suggests that it may indirectly recruit ciliary vesicles via another binding partner. Here, we identify Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) as a stoichiometric interactor of CEP89. NCS1 localizes to the position between CEP89 and a ciliary vesicle marker, RAB34, at the distal appendage. This localization was completely abolished in <i>CEP89</i> knockouts, suggesting that CEP89 recruits NCS1 to the distal appendage. Similarly to <i>CEP89</i> knockouts, ciliary vesicle recruitment as well as subsequent cilium formation was perturbed in <i>NCS1</i> knockout cells. The ability of NCS1 to recruit the ciliary vesicle is dependent on its myristoylation motif and <i>NCS1</i> knockout cells expressing a myristoylation defective mutant failed to rescue the vesicle recruitment defect despite localizing properly to the centriole. In sum, our analysis reveals the first known mechanism for how the distal appendage recruits the ciliary vesicles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98358">Synaptic enrichment and dynamic regulation of the two opposing dopamine receptors within the same neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine can play opposing physiological roles depending on the receptor subtype. In the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, <i>Dop1R1</i> and <i>Dop2R</i> encode the D<sub>1</sub>- and D<sub>2</sub>-like receptors, respectively, and are reported to oppositely regulate intracellular cAMP levels. Here, we profiled the expression and subcellular localization of endogenous Dop1R1 and Dop2R in specific cell types in the mushroom body circuit. For cell-type-specific visualization of endogenous proteins, we employed reconstitution of split-GFP tagged to the receptor proteins. We detected dopamine receptors at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites in multiple cell types. Quantitative analysis revealed enrichment of both receptors at the presynaptic sites, with Dop2R showing a greater degree of localization than Dop1R1. The presynaptic localization of Dop1R1 and Dop2R in dopamine neurons suggests dual feedback regulation as autoreceptors. Furthermore, we discovered a starvation-dependent, bidirectional modulation of the presynaptic receptor expression in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) and posterior lateral 1 (PPL1) clusters, two distinct subsets of dopamine neurons, suggesting their roles in regulating appetitive behaviors. Our results highlight the significance of the co-expression of the two opposing dopamine receptors in the spatial and conditional regulation of dopamine responses in neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98353">Cold induces brain region-selective cell activity-dependent lipid metabolism</a></h4>

              
                It has been well documented that cold is an enhancer of lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues, yet its effect on central nervous system lipid dynamics is underexplored. It is well recognized that cold acclimations enhance adipocyte functions, including white adipose tissue lipid lipolysis and beiging, and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in mammals. However, it remains unclear whether and how lipid metabolism in the brain is also under the control of ambient temperature. Here, we show that cold exposure predominantly increases the expressions of the lipid lipolysis genes and proteins within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) in male mice. Mechanistically, by using innovatively combined brain-region selective pharmacology and in vivo time-lapse photometry monitoring of lipid metabolism, we find that cold activates cells within the PVH and pharmacological inactivation of cells blunts cold-induced effects on lipid peroxidation, accumulation of lipid droplets, and lipid lipolysis in the PVH. Together, these findings suggest that PVH lipid metabolism is cold sensitive and integral to cold-induced broader regulatory responses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96144">Volume electron microscopy reveals unique laminar synaptic characteristics in the human entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays a pivotal role in memory function and spatial navigation, connecting the hippocampus with the neocortex. The EC integrates a wide range of cortical and subcortical inputs, but its synaptic organization in the human brain is largely unknown. We used volume electron microscopy to perform a 3D analysis of the microanatomical features of synapses in all layers of the medial EC (MEC) from the human brain. Using this technology, 12,974 synapses were fully 3D reconstructed at the ultrastructural level. The MEC presented a distinct set of synaptic features, differentiating this region from other human cortical areas. Furthermore, ultrastructural synaptic characteristics within the MEC was predominantly similar, although layers I and VI exhibited several synaptic characteristics that were distinct from other layers. The present study constitutes an extensive description of the synaptic characteristics of the neuropil of all layers of the EC, a crucial step to better understand the connectivity of this cortical region, in both health and disease.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Body representations (BRs) are essential for guiding movements, maintaining spatial awareness, and achieving effective interactions with the environment. Several studies suggest that BRs are frequently impaired following unilateral brain damage, emphasising the need for tailored rehabilitation interventions; however, there is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of training specifically designed to improve different kinds of functional BRs after stroke. Therefore, the present study aimed to present and implement a specific rehabilitation training program for BR alterations and evaluate its effectiveness in a sample of adults with unilateral brain damage. Methods: Nine adults with unilateral brain damage and seven age- and education-matched healthy controls were recruited. Both groups underwent a neuropsychological assessment to evaluate BR (action- and nonaction-oriented). Additionally, functional autonomy and motor functioning were assessed in the patient group. Following an initial assessment (T0), the patients participated in a BR-specific rehabilitation intervention. At the end of the rehabilitation program (T1), both groups were re-evaluated with the same tasks used at T0. Results: At T0, the patient group performed worse on BR tasks than the controls. At T1, a significant improvement in the nonaction-oriented BR and functional autonomy was observed in the patient group. Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests the effectiveness of a targeted rehabilitation intervention for BR in promoting enhanced body boundary awareness and greater accuracy in the perception of body part positions, possibly leading to increased functional autonomy. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating BR training in rehabilitation programs for adults with acquired brain damage, alongside motor rehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Developmental language disorders (DLD) are often associated with co-occurring neurodevelopmental difficulties, including attentional or social&amp;amp;ndash;emotional problems. Another nonverbal domain, i.e., visual cognition and its relationship to DLD, is virtually unexplored. However, learning visuospatial regularities &amp;amp;ndash; a scene-grammar - is crucial for navigating our daily environment. These regularities show certain similarities to the structure of language and there is preliminary evidence for a relationship between scene processing and language competence in preschoolers with and without DLD. This study compared implicit and explicit visuospatial knowledge of everyday indoor scenes in older children, aged 6 to 10 years, of both groups. Methods: We measured &amp;amp;lsquo;dwell times&amp;amp;rsquo; on semantic and syntactic object &amp;amp;ndash; scene inconsistencies via eye-tracking and performance in an object-placement task, and their associations with children&amp;amp;rsquo;s language, visual, and cognitive skills. Results: Visual attention towards object-scene inconsistencies was highly comparable between groups, but children with DLD scored lower in a visual perception test and higher language skills were associated with higher visuo-cognitive performance in both tasks. In the explicit scene-grammar measurement, this relationship only existed for children with DLD and disappeared when nonverbal cognitive performance was controlled. Conclusions: Our study suggests the existence of mild problems in visuospatial processing co-occurring with DLD, which is partly influenced by age and nonverbal cognitive ability. The acquisition of visual cognition and linguistic knowledge is an interactive, multimodal process where the perception of objects in scenes might affect how the words for these objects are learned and vice versa. A better understanding of this interplay could eventually have impact on the diagnosis and treatment of DLD.</p>

	<p>The plantar surfaces of the feet are important for balance control during walking, specifically by allowing for the perception of pressure movements during stance. Background/Objectives: The current study aimed to perturb CoP movement perception in healthy individuals by applying vibrations to the soles of the feet in different stimulation sequences: a natural pattern that followed CoP movement (gait-like) and a perturbing pattern that did not follow the CoP (random) during walking. We hypothesized that the gait-like stimulation sequence would be similar to walking without any stimulation and therefore have no effect on balance measures and that the random sequence would negatively affect balance measures such as the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) margins of stability (MoSs) and foot placement area. Methods: Subjects walked at a level angle and 5.0 and 8.0 degrees of incline and with low visual conditions to increase reliance on tactile sensations from the feet. Results: No significant effect of the stimulation sequence was found at any incline, while there was a significant effect of incline. As the incline increased from level to 5 deg, subjects reduced their AP MoS measured at heel strikes from 4.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.56 cm to 1.95 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.07 cm and increased their foot placement area from 24.04 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.13 cm2 to 38.98 &amp;amp;plusmn; 17.47 cm2. However, the AP MoS measured at midstance did not significantly change as the incline increased. Conclusions: The stimulation sequence had no effect on the dependent measures, but the subjects could still feel the vibrations on the plantar surfaces during walking; this implies that similar stimulation techniques could be a useful method for applying directive biofeedback without negatively impacting gait. Overall, this study demonstrates the detailed control of our tactile system and the adaptability of healthy individuals while walking with a perturbing stimulation.</p>

	<p>Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare progressive cerebrovascular disorder characterized by the stenosis or occlusion of the terminal segments of the internal carotid arteries, leading to the development of abnormal collateral vascular networks. These networks are a compensatory mechanism for reduced blood flow to the brain. Despite extensive research, the exact etiology of MMD remains unknown, although recent studies suggest that immune system dysfunction plays a critical role in its pathogenesis. In particular, the involvement of immune cells such as T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells has been increasingly recognized. These immune cells contribute to the inflammatory process and vascular remodeling observed in MMD patients, further complicating the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s progression. Inflammation and immune-mediated damage to the vessel walls may accelerate the narrowing and occlusion of arteries, exacerbating ischemic events in the brain. Additionally, studies have revealed that certain genetic and environmental factors can influence immune system activation in MMD, linking these pathways to disease development. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the immune mechanisms at play in MMD, focusing on how immune cells participate in vascular injury and remodeling. Understanding these immunological processes may offer new therapeutic targets to halt or reverse disease progression, potentially leading to more effective treatment strategies for MMD.</p>

	<p>(1) Background/Objectives: Primary and secondary brain tumours often hold devastating prognoses and low survival rates despite the application of maximal neurosurgical resection, and state-of-the-art radiotherapy and chemotherapy. One limiting factor in their management is that several antineoplastic agents are unable to cross the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) to reach the tumour microenvironment. Nanomedicine could hold the potential to become an effective means of drug delivery to overcome previous hurdles towards effective neuro-oncological treatments. (2) Methods: A scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and checklist was conducted using key terms input into PubMed to find articles that reflect emerging trends in the utilisation of nanomedicine in drug delivery for primary and secondary brain tumours. (3) Results: The review highlights various strategies by which different nanoparticles can be exploited to bypass the BBB; we provide a synthesis of the literature on the ongoing contributions to therapeutic protocols based on chemotherapy, immunotherapy, focused ultrasound, radiotherapy/radiosurgery, and radio-immunotherapy. (4) Conclusions: The emerging trends summarised in this scoping review indicate encouraging advantageous properties of nanoparticles as potential effective drug delivery mechanisms; however, there are still nanotoxicity issues that largely remain to be addressed before the translation of these innovations from laboratory to clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a terminal complex neurodegenerative disease, with 10&amp;amp;ndash;15% of cases being familial and the majority being sporadic with no known cause. There are no animal models for the 85&amp;amp;ndash;90% of sporadic ALS cases. More creative, sophisticated models of ALS disease are required to unravel the mysteries of this complicated disease. While ALS patients urgently require new medications and treatments, suitable preclinical in vitro models for drug screening are lacking. Therefore, human-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology offers the opportunity to model diverse and unreachable cell types in a culture dish. In this review, we focus on recent hiPSC-derived ALS neuronal and non-neuronal models to examine the research progress of current ALS 2D monocultures, co-cultures, and more complex 3D-model organoids. Despite the challenges inherent to hiPSC-based models, their application to preclinical drug studies is enormous.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: When attempting to study neurocognitive mechanisms with electroencephalography (EEG) in applied ecologically valid settings, responses to stimuli may differ in time, which presents challenges to traditional EEG averaging methods. In this proof-of-concept paper, we present a method to normalize time over unequal trial lengths while preserving frequency content. Methods: Epochs are converted to time-frequency space where they are resampled to contain an equal number of timepoints representing the proportion of trial complete rather than true time. To validate this method, we used EEG data recorded from 8 novices and 4 experts in veterinary medicine while completing decision-making tasks using two question types: multiple-choice and script concordance questions used in veterinary school exams. Results: The resulting resampled time-frequency data were analyzed with partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate technique that extracts patterns of data that support a contrast between conditions and groups while controlling for Type I error. We found a significant latent variable representing a difference between question types for experts only. Conclusions: Despite within and between subject differences in timing, we found consistent differences between question types in experts in gamma and beta bands that are consistent with changes resulting from increased information load and decision-making. This novel analysis method may be a viable path forward to preserve ecological validity in EEG studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0166-24.2025?rss=1">Failed Stopping Transiently Suppresses the Electromyogram in Task-Irrelevant Muscles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Selectively stopping individual parts of planned or ongoing movements is an everyday motor skill. For example, while walking in public, you may stop yourself from waving at a stranger who you mistook for a friend while continuing to walk. Despite its ubiquity, our ability to selectively stop actions is limited. Canceling one action can delay the execution of other simultaneous actions. This stopping-interference effect on continuing actions during selective stopping may be attributed to a global inhibitory mechanism with widespread effects on the motor system. Previous studies have characterized a transient global reduction in corticomotor excitability by combining brain stimulation with electromyography (EMG). Here, we examined whether global motor inhibition during selective stopping can be measured peripherally and with high temporal resolution using EMG alone. Eighteen participants performed a bimanual anticipatory response inhibition task with their index fingers while maintaining a tonic contraction of the task-irrelevant abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles. A time series analysis of the ADM EMG signal revealed transient inhibition during failed stopping compared with go response trials 150 to 203&nbsp;ms following the stop signal. The pattern was observed in both hands during bimanual stop-all trials as well as selective stop-left and stop-right trials of either hand. These results indicate that tonic muscle activity is sensitive to the effects of global motor suppression even when stopping fails. Therefore, EMG can provide a physiological marker of global motor inhibition to probe the time course and extent of stopping processes.</p>

                <p>Cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) signaling in the dorsal striatum regulates the shift from flexible to habitual behavior in instrumental outcome devaluation. Based on prior work establishing individual-, sex-, and experience-dependent differences in pavlovian behaviors, we predicted a role for dorsomedial striatum (DMS) CB1R signaling in driving rigid responding in pavlovian autoshaping and outcome devaluation. We trained male and female Long Evans rats in pavlovian lever autoshaping (PLA). We gave intra-DMS infusions of the CB1R inverse agonist, rimonabant, before satiety-induced outcome devaluation test sessions, where we sated rats on training pellets or home cage chow and tested them in brief nonreinforced PLA sessions. Overall, inhibition of DMS CB1R signaling prevented pavlovian outcome devaluation but did not affect behavior in reinforced PLA sessions. Males were sensitive to devaluation while females were not, and DMS CB1R blockade impaired devaluation sensitivity in males. Because these results suggest DMS CB1R signaling supports flexible responding, we investigated how DMS CB1R signaling impacts local inhibitory synaptic transmission in male and female Long Evans rats. We recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) from DMS neurons at baseline and after application of a CB1R agonist, WIN 55,212-2. We found that male rats showed decreased sIPSC frequency compared with females and that CB1R activation reduced DMS inhibitory transmission independent of sex. Altogether our results demonstrate that DMS CB1Rs regulate pavlovian devaluation sensitivity and DMS inhibitory synaptic transmission and suggest that basal sex differences in inhibitory synaptic transmission may underly sex differences in DMS function and behavioral flexibility.</p>

                <p>The study of the neural circuitry underlying complex mammalian decision-making, particularly cognitive flexibility, is critical for understanding psychiatric disorders. To test cognitive flexibility, as well as potentially other decision-making paradigms involving multimodal sensory perception, we developed FlexRig, an open-source, modular behavioral platform for use in head-fixed mice. FlexRig enables the administration of tasks relying upon olfactory, somatosensory, and/or auditory cues and employing left and right licking as a behavior readout and reward delivery mechanism. The platform includes hardware and software components that are customizable, scalable, and portable, supporting a variety of behavioral assays. Using FlexRig, we established a head-fixed task to model attentional set-shifting, offering a new tool for neuroscience research that enhances the capacity for investigation of cognitive processes and their neural substrates, with broad applications in translational neuroscience.</p>

                <p>When individuals make a movement that produces an unexpected outcome, they learn from the resulting error. This process, essential in both acquiring new motor skills and adapting to changing environments, critically relies on error sensitivity, which governs how much behavioral change results from a given error. Although behavioral and computational evidence suggests error sensitivity can change in response to task demands, neural evidence regarding the flexibility of error sensitivity in the human brain is lacking. Here, we tested whether the nervous system's sensitivity to errors, as measured by prediction-driven suppression of auditory cortical activity, can be modulated by altering participants&rsquo; (both males and females) perceived variability during speech. Our results showed that error sensitivity, as measured by this suppression, was increased after exposure to an auditory perturbation that increased speakers&rsquo; perceived variability. The current study establishes the validity of behaviorally modulating the nervous system's sensitivity to errors, which has significant potential to enhance motor learning and rehabilitation.</p>

                <p>The subiculum represents a crucial brain pivot in regulating seizure generalization in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), primarily through a synergy of local GABAergic and long-projecting glutamatergic signaling. However, little is known about how subicular GABAergic interneurons are involved in a cell-type&ndash;specific way. Here, employing Ca<sup>2+</sup> fiber photometry, retrograde monosynaptic viral tracing, and chemogenetics in epilepsy models of both male and female mice, we elucidate circuit reorganization patterns mediated by subicular cell-type&ndash;specific interneurons and delineate their functional disparities in seizure modulation in TLE. We reveal distinct functional dynamics of subicular parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneurons during secondary generalized seizure. These interneuron subtypes have their biased circuit organizations in terms of both input and output patterns, which undergo distinct reorganization in chronic epileptic condition. Notably, somatostatin+ interneurons exert more effective feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal neurons compared with parvalbumin+ interneurons, which engenders consistent antiseizure effects in TLE. These findings provide an improved understanding of different subtypes of subicular interneurons in circuit reorganization in TLE and supplement compelling proofs for precise treatment of epilepsy by targeting subicular somatostatin+ interneurons.</p>

                <p>The cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is required for regulation of daily sleep amount, whereas gain of function of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) causes severe insomnia in mice. However, the physiological functions of CRTCs and their downstream target genes in the regulation of sleep amount remain unclear. Here, we use an adult brain chimeric (ABC)-expression/knock-out platform for somatic genetic analysis of sleep in adult male mice. ABC expression of constitutively active mutant CRTC1/2<sup>CA</sup> in the mouse brain neurons significantly reduces the amount of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and/or rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Consistent with the fact that SIK3 phosphorylates and inhibits CRTCs, ABC expression of CRTC1/2/3<sup>CA</sup> rescues the hypersomnia phenotype of <I>Sleepy</I> (<I>Sik3<sup>Slp</sup></I>) mice. While ABC-<I>Crtc2<sup>KO</sup></I> or <I>Crtc3<sup>KO</sup></I> causes no sleep phenotype, ABC-<I>Crtc1<sup>KO</sup></I> or ABC expression of dominant-negative CRTC (dnCRTC) results in a modest reduction of NREMS amount accompanied with elevated NREMS delta power. Moreover, ABC expression of CRTC1<sup>CA</sup> or dnCRTC in the excitatory neurons causes bidirectional changes of NREMS/REMS amount and/or NREMS delta power. The ability of CRTC1<sup>CA</sup> to regulate sleep requires its transactivation domain and CREB-binding domain and is dependent on CREB. Furthermore, we showed that inducible ABC expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (<I>Crh</I>) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<I>Bdnf</I>)&mdash;two target genes of CRTCs&mdash;significantly reduces daily sleep amount. Notably, ABC-<I>Crh<sup>KO</sup></I>, but not <I>Bdnf<sup>KO</sup></I>, rescues the insomnia phenotype of ABC-CRTC1<sup>CA</sup> mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the CREB-CRTC1 complex regulates daily sleep amount by modulating the transcription of <I>Crh</I> in the mouse brain neurons.</p>

                <p>Predictive coding mechanisms facilitate detection and perceptual recognition, thereby influencing recognition judgements, and, broadly, perceptual decision-making. The anterior insula (AI) has been shown to be involved in reaching a decision about discrimination and recognition, as well as to coordinate brain circuits related to reward-based learning. Yet, experimental studies in the context of recognition and decision-making, targeting this area and based on formal trial-by-trial predictive coding computational quantities, are sparse. The present study goes beyond previous investigations and provides a predictive coding computational account of the role of the AI in recognition-related decision-making, by leveraging <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B79">Zaragoza-Jimenez et al. (2023)</cross-ref> open fMRI dataset (17 female, 10 male participants) and computational modeling, characterized by a combination of view-independent familiarity learning and contextual learning. Using model-based fMRI, we show that, in the context a two-option forced&ndash;choice identity recognition task, the AI engages in feature-level (i.e., view-independent familiarity) updating and error signaling processes and context-level familiarity updating to reach a recognition judgment. Our findings highlight that an important functional property of the AI is to update the level of familiarity of a given stimulus while also adapting to task-relevant, contextual information. Ultimately, these expectations, combined with input visual signals through reciprocally interconnected feedback and feedforward processes, facilitate recognition judgments, thereby guiding perceptual decision-making.</p>

                <p>Risk is a fundamental factor affecting individual and social economic decisions, but its neural correlates are largely unexplored in the social domain. The amygdala, together with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), is thought to play a central role in risk-taking. Here, we investigated in human volunteers (<I>n</I> = 20; 11 females) how risk (defined as the variance of reward probability distributions) in a social situation affects decisions and concomitant neural activity as measured with fMRI. We found separate variance-risk signals for social and nonsocial outcomes in the amygdala. Specifically, amygdala activity increased parametrically with social reward variance of presented choice options and on separate trials with nonsocial reward variance. Behaviorally, 75% of participants were averse to social risk as estimated in a Becker&ndash;DeGroot&ndash;Marschak auction-like procedure. The stronger this aversion, the more negative the coupling between risk-related amygdala regions and dACC. This negative relation was significant for social risk attitude but not for the attitude toward variance-risk in juice outcomes. Our results indicate that the amygdala and its coupling with dACC process objective and subjectively evaluated social risk. Moreover, while social risk can be captured with a framework originally established by finance theory for nonsocial risk, the amygdala appears to process social risk largely separately from nonsocial risk.</p>

                <p>Corticocortical (CC) projections in the visual system facilitate hierarchical processing of sensory information. In addition to direct CC connections, indirect cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathways through the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus can relay sensory signals and mediate cortical interactions according to behavioral demands. While the pulvinar connects extensively to the entire visual cortex, it is unknown whether transthalamic pathways link all cortical areas or whether they follow systematic organizational rules. Because mouse pulvinar neurons projecting to different areas are spatially intermingled, their input/output relationships have been difficult to characterize using traditional anatomical methods. To determine the organization of CTC circuits, we mapped the higher visual areas (HVAs) of male and female mice with intrinsic signal imaging and targeted five pulvinar-&gt;HVA pathways for projection-specific rabies tracing. We aligned postmortem cortical tissue to in vivo maps for precise quantification of the areas and cell types projecting to each pulvinar-&gt;HVA population. Layer 5 corticothalamic (L5CT) "driver" inputs to the pulvinar originate predominantly from primary visual cortex (V1), consistent with the CC hierarchy. L5CT inputs from lateral HVAs specifically avoid driving reciprocal connections, consistent with the "no-strong-loops" hypothesis. Conversely, layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) "modulator" inputs are distributed across areas and are biased toward reciprocal connections. Unlike previous studies in primates, we find that every HVA receives disynaptic input from the superior colliculus. CTC circuits in the pulvinar thus depend on both target HVA and input cell type, such that driving and modulating higher-order pathways follow complementary connection rules similar to those governing first-order CT circuits.</p>

                <p>Gamma rhythm (30&ndash;70&nbsp;Hz), thought to represent the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory populations, can be induced by presenting achromatic gratings in the primary visual cortex (V1) and is sensitive to stimulus properties such as size and contrast. In addition, gamma occurs in short bursts and shows a "frequency falloff" effect where its peak frequency is high after stimulus onset and slowly decreases to a steady state. Recently, these size-contrast properties and temporal characteristics were replicated in a self-oscillating Wilson&ndash;Cowan (WC) model operating as an inhibition stabilized network (ISN), stimulated by Ornstein&ndash;Uhlenbeck (OU) type inputs. In particular, frequency falloff was explained by delayed and slowly accumulated inputs arriving at local inhibitory populations. We hypothesized that if the stimulus is preceded by another higher contrast stimulus, frequency falloff could be abolished or reversed, since the excessive inhibition will now take more time to dissipate. We presented gratings at different contrasts consecutively to two female monkeys while recording gamma using microelectrode arrays in V1 and confirmed this prediction. Further, this model also replicated a characteristic pattern of gamma frequency modulation to counter-phasing stimuli as reported previously. These phenomena were also replicated by an ISN model subject to slow adaptation in feedforward excitatory input. Thus, ISN model with delayed surround input or adapted feedforward input replicates gamma frequency responses to time-varying contrasts.</p>

                <p>Predictive processing in the parietal, temporal, frontal, and sensory cortex allows us to anticipate future meanings to maximize the efficiency of language comprehension, with the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) thought to be situated toward the top of a predictive hierarchy. Although the regions underpinning this fundamental brain function are well-documented, it remains unclear how they interact to achieve efficient comprehension. To this end, we recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 22 participants (11 males) while they comprehended sentences presented part by part, in which we manipulated the constraint provided by sentential contexts on upcoming semantic information. Using this paradigm, we examined the connectivity patterns of bilateral TPJ and IFG during anticipatory phases (i.e., before the onset of targets) and integration phases (i.e., after the onset of targets). When upcoming semantic content was highly predictable in strong constraint contexts, both the left TPJ and bilateral IFG showed stronger visual coupling, while the right TPJ showed stronger connectivity with regions within control, default mode, and visual networks, including the IFG, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and fusiform gyrus. These connectivity patterns were weaker when predicted semantic content appeared, in line with predictive coding theory. Conversely, for less-predictable content, these connectivity patterns were stronger during the integration phase. Overall, these results suggest that both top-down semantic prediction and bottom-up integration during predictive processing are supported by flexible coupling of frontoparietal regions with control, memory, and sensory systems.</p>

                <p>Anti-A&beta; immunotherapy use to treat Alzheimer's disease is on the rise. While anti-A&beta; antibodies provide hope in targeting A&beta; plaques in the brain, there still remains a lack of understanding regarding the cellular responses to these antibodies in the brain. In this study, we sought to identify the acute effects of anti-A&beta; antibodies on immune responses. To determine cellular changes due to anti-A&beta; antibody exposure, we intracranially injected 14&nbsp;mo APP male and female mice with anti-A&beta; IgG1 (6E10) or control IgG1 into the cortex. After 24&nbsp;h or 3&nbsp;d, we harvested the cortex and performed a glial cell-enriched preparation for single-cell sequencing. Cell types, proportions, and cell-to-cell signaling were evaluated between the two injection conditions and two acute timepoints. We identified 23 unique cell clusters including microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, neurons, oligos/OPCs, immune cells, and unknown. The anti-A&beta; antibody-injected cortices revealed more ligand&ndash;receptor (L&ndash;R) communications between cell types, as well as stronger communications at only 24&nbsp;h. At 3&nbsp;d, while there were more L&ndash;R communications for the anti-A&beta; antibody condition, the strength of these connections was stronger in the control IgG condition. We also found evidence of an initial and strong communication emphasis in microglia-to-nonparenchymal immune cells at 24&nbsp;h, specifically in the TGF&beta; signaling pathway. We identify several pathways that are specific to anti-A&beta; antibody exposure at acute timepoints. These data lay the groundwork for understanding the brain's unique response to anti-A&beta; antibodies.</p>

                <p>GlyT2-positive interneurons, Golgi and Lugaro cells, reside in the input layer of the cerebellar cortex in a key position to influence information processing. Here, we examine the contribution of GlyT2-positive interneurons to network dynamics in Crus 1 of mouse lateral cerebellar cortex during free whisking. We recorded neuronal population activity using Neuropixels probes before and after chemogenetic downregulation of GlyT2-positive interneurons in male and female mice. Under resting conditions, cerebellar population activity reliably encoded whisker movements. Reductions in the activity of GlyT2-positive cells produced mild increases in neural activity which did not significantly impair these sensorimotor representations. However, reduced Golgi and Lugaro cell inhibition did increase the temporal alignment of local population network activity at the initiation of movement. These network alterations had variable impacts on behavior, producing both increases and decreases in whisking velocity. Our results suggest that inhibition mediated by GlyT2-positive interneurons primarily governs the temporal patterning of population activity, which in turn is required to support downstream cerebellar dynamics and behavioral coordination.</p>

                <p>Macaque area V4 includes neurons that exhibit exquisite selectivity for visual form and surface texture, but their functional organization across laminae is unknown. We used high-density Neuropixels probes in two awake monkeys (one female and one male) to characterize the shape and texture tuning of dozens of neurons simultaneously across layers. We found sporadic clusters of neurons that exhibit similar tuning for shape and texture: ~20% exhibited similar tuning with their neighbors. Importantly, these clusters were confined to a few layers, seldom "columnar" in structure. This was the case even when neurons were strongly driven and exhibited robust contrast invariance for shape and texture tuning. We conclude that functional organization in area V4 is not columnar for shape and texture stimulus features and in general organization may be at a coarser stimulus category scale (e.g., selectivity for stimuli with vs without 3D cues) and a coarser spatial scale (assessed by optical imaging), rather than at a fine scale in terms of similarity in single-neuron tuning for specific features. We speculate that this may be a direct consequence of the great diversity of inputs integrated by V4 neurons to build variegated tuning manifolds in a high-dimensional space.</p>

                <p>The human brain exhibits a high degree of individual variability in both its structure and function, which underlies intersubject differences in cognition and behavior. It was previously shown that functional connectivity is more variable in the heteromodal association cortex but less variable in the unimodal cortices. Structural connectivity (SC) is the anatomical substrate of functional connectivity, but the spatial and temporal patterns of individual variability in SC (IVSC) remain largely unknown. In the present study, we discovered a detailed and robust chart of IVSC obtained by applying diffusion MRI and tractography techniques to 1,724 adults (770 males and 954 females) from multiple imaging datasets. Our results showed that the SC exhibited the highest and lowest variability in the limbic regions and the unimodal sensorimotor regions, respectively. With increased age, higher IVSC was observed across most brain regions. Moreover, the specific spatial distribution of IVSC is related to the cortical laminar differentiation and myelination content. Finally, we proposed a modified ridge regression model to predict individual cognition and generated idiographic brain mapping, which was significantly correlated with the spatial pattern of IVSC. Overall, our findings further contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of individual variability in brain SC and link to the prediction of individual cognitive function in adult subjects.</p>

                <p>Despite significant strides in gender equity, the Nobel Prizes in STEM fields continue to exhibit glaring disparities in the recognition of women's contributions to science. Thirty years ago, only 3% of Nobel laureates in science were women; today, that number has increased marginally to 4%, raising the critical question: Why "still" so few? This opinion piece examines systemic inequities and structural barriers that hinder the equitable acknowledgment of women's and underrepresented groups&rsquo; contributions to science. Data reveal that while women now comprise a significant proportion of degree recipients and workforce entrants in fields such as biomedical research and chemistry, their representation among Nobel laureates remains disproportionately low. Furthermore, racial inequities exacerbate the lack of diversity, with no Black individuals receiving a Nobel Prize in STEM fields to date. The article advocates for transformative changes in academic and research ecosystems to dismantle the power structures and biases that sustain these inequities. It calls for intentional strategies to support, empower, and recognize women and underrepresented scientists, emphasizing the need for inclusive metrics of success. Drawing on personal experiences and the inspirational achievements of past women laureates, the author underscores the urgency of creating equitable pathways to scientific recognition. The piece concludes with a hopeful vision of a future where diversity and inclusion in Nobel recognitions reflect the rich talent and innovation present across all demographics in STEM.</p>

                Background The closure of universities due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic significantly affected students’ behaviours, particularly regarding physical activity, sitting time, and screen use. This study aimed to determine the effect of active transportation duration, uninterrupted sitting time, and screen time to study on physical activity and sitting time during the confinement. Methods This was a cross-sectional study based on data collected via an online questionnaire for university students during the second confinement in France (between October and December 2020). The questionnaire assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and contained questions about modes of transport, and perception of uninterrupted sitting time and screen time to study prior to confinement and during confinement. Participants (N=2873) completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) in an average time of around 15 minutes, after providing digital informed consent. Multiple regression models assessed how time duration of active transportation, uninterrupted sitting time, and screen time studying increased or reduced confinement effects on physical activity and sitting time. Results The regression models showed that physical activity decreased during confinement for students who engaged in more prolonged periods of active transportation prior to confinement. Moreover, the perception of long, uninterrupted sitting time and high screen time prior to confinement significantly increased sitting time during confinement. Students who adopted the most active transport time prior to confinement were the least likely to increase their screen time during confinement. Conclusions Confinement reduced physical activity levels and increased sitting time, mainly among students who adopted active transport and accumulated longer uninterrupted sitting time prior to confinement. Students who combined-long periods of uninterrupted sitting time with high screen use could be a riskier profile for health. Analysis of physical activity time and sitting position should include its accumulation patterns.

                Background Alteration in the central vascular hemodynamics is speculated to influence cognitive functions, including executive functions in young adults. Prolonged sitting is associated with compromised central vascular functions, which activity micro-breaks could mitigate. However, the association between the carotid vascular hemodynamic alteration and the executive functions is yet to be explored. Methods We administered a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of various intensities' micro-breaks on central vascular and cognitive functions during simulated work conditions for four hours. The carotid artery hemodynamics and cognitive functions were measured by Duplex ultrasound at 0th, 2nd and 4th  hour and computer-based Flanker tests at 0th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th hour of visit days, respectively. From the randomised controlled trial, we extracted the secondary data of carotid artery hemodynamics and cognitive functions change at the 4th hour from the baseline and analysed for any relation. Results Though we observed linear relation between the carotid artery hemodynamics and the executive functions, the relation was not statistically significant. we found a significant reduction in carotid artery diameter during prolonged sitting (0.03 cm [95%CI 0.01, 0.05]), velocity (10.35 cm/s [95%CI -2.85, 17.86]) and shear rate during interrupted sitting (174.39 [95%CI 65.67, 283.11]) We found increased accuracy during prolonged sitting (12.7% [95%CI 0.66, 24.81]) and sitting with light-intensity activity breaks (6.92% [95%CI 1.39, 12.44]). We did not find any significant relation between the change in central vascular functions (carotid artery diameter, velocity, shear rate and blood flow) and the cognitive functions during three different work conditions. Conclusion Though a significant relation between carotid artery function and cognitive function could not be established, microbreaks can mitigate the vascular and cognitive risks associated with prolonged sitting.

                Background The increasing popularity of green cosmetic products among consumers who prioritize skin health, quality, and beauty has driven the production of these products. Growing awareness of harmful toxins in traditional cosmetics is leading consumers to prefer natural alternatives. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing Indian consumers’ buying behaviour and purchase intentions toward green cosmetics, focusing on both male and female consumers. Methods To achieve this, a thorough evaluation of the literature from Scopus-indexed journals was conducted, employing the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. The study used Smart PLS 3.0’s structural equation modeling to analyze data and performed a multi-group analysis to explore variations in purchasing intentions and actions between male and female consumers. Results The research indicated an increasing demand for green cosmetics among males in North India. Findings revealed that subjective norms significantly influenced both purchase behaviour and purchase intention. Additionally, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms positively impacted purchase intention, which in turn indirectly affected purchase behaviour. Interestingly, environmental concerns did not influence consumers’ actual purchasing intentions or behaviour. The analysis also demonstrated no significant differences between male and female consumers regarding the impact of various factors on their purchase intentions and behaviours. Conclusion These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and marketing managers aiming to promote green cosmetic product purchase behaviour. Recognizing that subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are crucial drivers of purchase intention and behaviour can help in devising effective marketing strategies. Despite the absence of significant gender differences in the factors influencing purchase behaviour, the increasing interest in green cosmetics, especially among males, highlights a broader market potential for these products. This research underscores the importance of focusing on social and behavioural influences to encourage the adoption of green cosmetics

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012776">The role of oscillations in grid cells’ toroidal topology</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giovanni di Sarra, Siddharth Jha, Yasser Roudi</p>

Persistent homology applied to the activity of grid cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex suggests that this activity lies on a toroidal manifold. By analyzing real data and a simple model, we show that neural oscillations play a key role in the appearance of this toroidal topology. To quantitatively monitor how changes in spike trains influence the topology of the data, we first define a robust measure for the degree of toroidality of a dataset. Using this measure, we find that small perturbations ( ~ 100 ms) of spike times have little influence on both the toroidality and the hexagonality of the ratemaps. Jittering spikes by  ~ 100-500 ms, however, destroys the toroidal topology, while still having little impact on grid scores. These critical jittering time scales fall in the range of the periods of oscillations between the theta and eta bands. We thus hypothesized that these oscillatory modulations of neuronal spiking play a key role in the appearance and robustness of toroidal topology and the hexagonal spatial selectivity is not sufficient. We confirmed this hypothesis using a simple model for the activity of grid cells, consisting of an ensemble of independent rate-modulated Poisson processes. When these rates were modulated by oscillations, the network behaved similarly to the real data in exhibiting toroidal topology, even when the position of the fields were perturbed. In the absence of oscillations, this similarity was substantially lower. Furthermore, we find that the experimentally recorded spike trains indeed exhibit temporal modulations at the eta and theta bands, and that the ratio of the power in the eta band to that of the theta band, Aη∕Aθ, correlates with the critical jittering time at which the toroidal topology disappears.

                <p>by Toviah Moldwin, Li Shay Azran, Idan Segev</p>

Theoretical neuroscientists and machine learning researchers have proposed a variety of learning rules to enable artificial neural networks to effectively perform both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. It is not always clear, however, how these theoretically-derived rules relate to biological mechanisms of plasticity in the brain, or how these different rules might be mechanistically implemented in different contexts and brain regions. This study shows that the calcium control hypothesis, which relates synaptic plasticity in the brain to the calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) in dendritic spines, can produce a diverse array of learning rules. We propose a simple, perceptron-like neuron model that has four sources of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]: <i>local</i> (following the activation of an excitatory synapse and confined to that synapse), <i>heterosynaptic</i> (resulting from the activity of other synapses), <i>postsynaptic spike-dependent</i>, and <i>supervisor-dependent</i>. We demonstrate that by modulating the plasticity thresholds and calcium influx from each calcium source, we can reproduce a wide range of learning and plasticity protocols, such as Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning, frequency-dependent plasticity, and unsupervised recognition of frequently repeating input patterns. Moreover, by devising simple neural circuits to provide supervisory signals, we show how the calcitron can implement homeostatic plasticity, perceptron learning, and BTSP-inspired one-shot learning. Our study bridges the gap between theoretical learning algorithms and their biological counterparts, not only replicating established learning paradigms but also introducing novel rules.

The characterization of phenotypes in cells or organisms from microscopy data largely depends on differences in the spatial distribution of image intensity. Multiple methods exist for quantifying the intensity distribution - or image texture - across objects in natural images. However, many of these texture extraction methods do not directly adapt to 3D microscopy data. Here, we present <i>Spherical Texture</i> extraction, which measures the variance in intensity per angular wavelength by calculating the Spherical Harmonics or Fourier power spectrum of a spherical or circular projection of the angular mean intensity of the object. This method provides a 20-value characterization that quantifies the scale of features in the spherical projection of the intensity distribution, giving a different signal if the intensity is, for example, clustered in parts of the volume or spread across the entire volume. We apply this method to different systems and demonstrate its ability to describe various biological problems through feature extraction. The <i>Spherical Texture</i> extraction characterizes biologically defined gene expression patterns in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> embryos, giving a quantitative read-out for pattern formation. Our method can also quantify morphological differences in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> germline nuclei, which lack a predefined pattern. We show that the classification of germline nuclei using their <i>Spherical Texture</i> outperforms a convolutional neural net when training data is limited. Additionally, we use a similar pipeline on 2D cell migration data to extract polarization direction, quantifying the alignment of fluorescent markers to the migration direction. We implemented the <i>Spherical Texture</i> method as a plugin in <i>ilastik</i> to provide a parameter-free and data-agnostic application to any segmented 3D or 2D dataset. Additionally, this technique can also be applied through a Python package to provide extra feature extraction for any object classification pipeline or downstream analysis.

                <p>by Liam C. Hunt, Michelle Curley, Kudzai Nyamkondiwa, Anna Stephan, Jianqin Jiao, Kanisha Kavdia, Vishwajeeth R. Pagala, Junmin Peng, Fabio Demontis</p>

Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) are key for protein turnover and quality control via ubiquitination. Some E2s also physically interact with the proteasome, but it remains undetermined which E2s maintain proteostasis during aging. Here, we find that E2s have diverse roles in handling a model aggregation-prone protein (huntingtin-polyQ) in the <i>Drosophila</i> retina: while some E2s mediate aggregate assembly, UBE2D/effete (eff) and other E2s are required for huntingtin-polyQ degradation. UBE2D/eff is key for proteostasis also in skeletal muscle: eff protein levels decline with aging, and muscle-specific eff knockdown causes an accelerated buildup in insoluble poly-ubiquitinated proteins (which progressively accumulate with aging) and shortens lifespan. Mechanistically, UBE2D/eff is necessary to maintain optimal proteasome function: UBE2D/eff knockdown reduces the proteolytic activity of the proteasome, and this is rescued by transgenic expression of human UBE2D2, an eff homolog. Likewise, human UBE2D2 partially rescues the lifespan and proteostasis deficits caused by muscle-specific eff<sup>RNAi</sup> and re-establishes the physiological levels of eff<sup>RNAi</sup>-regulated proteins. Interestingly, UBE2D/eff knockdown in young age reproduces part of the proteomic changes that normally occur in old muscles, suggesting that the decrease in UBE2D/eff protein levels that occurs with aging contributes to reshaping the composition of the muscle proteome. However, some of the proteins that are concertedly up-regulated by aging and eff<sup>RNAi</sup> are proteostasis regulators (e.g., chaperones and Pomp) that are transcriptionally induced presumably as part of an adaptive stress response to the loss of proteostasis. Altogether, these findings indicate that UBE2D/eff is a key E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that ensures protein quality control and helps maintain a youthful proteome composition during aging.

                <p>by Juliana Sánchez-Posada, Christopher J. Derrick, Emily S. Noël</p>

Heart development involves the complex structural remodelling of a linear heart tube into an asymmetrically looped and ballooned organ. Previous studies have associated regional expansion of extracellular matrix (ECM) space with tissue morphogenesis during development. We have developed <i>morphoHeart</i>, a 3D tissue segmentation and morphometry software with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) that delivers the first integrated 3D visualisation and multiparametric analysis of both heart and ECM morphology in live embryos. <i>morphoHeart</i> reveals that the ECM undergoes regional dynamic expansion and reduction during cardiac development, concomitant with chamber-specific morphological maturation. We use <i>morphoHeart</i> to demonstrate that regionalised ECM expansion driven by the ECM crosslinker Hapln1a promotes atrial lumen expansion during heart development. Finally, <i>morphoHeart</i>’s GUI expands its use beyond that of cardiac tissue, allowing its segmentation and morphometric analysis tools to be applied to <i>z</i>-stack images of any fluorescently labelled tissue.

                <p>by Ashwin Seetharaman, Himani Galagali, Elizabeth Linarte, Mona H. X. Liu, Jennifer D. Cohen, Kashish Chetal, Ruslan Sadreyev, Alex J. Tate, Taiowa A. Montgomery, Gary Ruvkun</p>

RNA interference (RNAi) mediates antiviral defense in many eukaryotes. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> mutants that disable RNAi are more sensitive to viral infection. Many mutants that enhance RNAi have also been identified; these mutations may reveal genes that are normally down-regulated in antiviral defense. About one-third of the score of mutants that enhance RNAi are in synMuv B genes, identified 30 years ago in unrelated screens for increased growth factor signaling. Many synMuv B genes encode dREAM complex chromatin-regulatory proteins found in nearly all animals and plants. We show that mRNAs which are highly induced in synMuv B mutants are congruent with those induced by Orsay RNA virus infection, suggesting that the enhanced RNAi of synMuv B mutants may also be triggered by down-regulation of synMuvB gene activity in an Orsay virus infection of wild type. The multivulval (Muv) phenotype of synMuv B mutants requires the presence of a second nematode-specific synMuv A gene mutation, but the enhanced RNAi of synMuv B mutants does not require a second synMuv A mutation. To test if Orsay viral infection down-regulates synMuv B gene activity, we infected a single synMuv A mutant with Orsay virus and found that a Muv phenotype could be induced. Thus, decreased synMuv B gene activity is part of the normal <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> viral defense response. In support of the model that decreased syn- Muv B gene activity enhances antiviral response, we found that synMuv B mutants have 50 to 100× lower viral RNA levels during an Orsay virus infection than wild type. Thus down-regulation of synMuv B activity to enhance RNAi is a key component in the defense response to viral infection. Small RNA deep sequencing analysis of dREAM complex mutants revealed siRNA profiles indicative of such a response. Thus, the pan-eukaryotic synMuv B genes constitute an element in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> antiviral defense which is conserved across many eukaryotes where it also may act in viral defense. The enhanced RNAi and conservation of the dREAM complex mutants suggests new therapeutic avenues to boost antiviral defenses.

     alt="Modeling Sporadic Progressive Supranuclear Palsy in 3D Midbrain Organoids: Recapitulating Disease Features for In Vitro Diagnosis and Drug Discovery"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and tufted astrocytes. Developing treatments for PSP is challenging due to the lack of disease models reproducing its key pathological features. This study aimed to model sporadic PSP-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) using multi-donor midbrain organoids (MOs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The MOs were generated by pooling induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 4 patients with sporadic probable PSP-RS and compared them with MOs from 3 healthy control (HC) subjects. We performed comprehensive analyses of MOs over 120 days to assess neuronal death, reactive gliosis, and the accumulation of 4R-tau and hyperphosphorylated tau forms (pThr231, pSer396, pThr181, and pSer202/pThr205 [AT8]) using immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. On day 90, immunohistochemical analysis using pSer396 and AT8 antibodies was conducted to assess disease pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PSP-derived MOs showed progressive size reduction compared with HC-derived MOs, linked to upregulated apoptosis-related mRNA markers. Dopaminergic neuron degeneration was marked by decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and increased neurofilament light chain (NfL). Immunofluorescence and Western blot revealed accumulation of all investigated tau forms with a peak at 90 days, along with a significant rise in GFAP-positive cells in PSP-derived MOs. Immunochemistry confirmed typical PSP histological alterations, such as neurofibrillary tangles and tufted-shaped astrocytes, absent in HC-derived organoids.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We developed a robust in vitro PSP model reproducing the key molecular and histologic features of the disease. This result holds promise for advancing basic and clinical research in PSP, paving the way for in vitro molecular diagnosis and identification of novel therapeutic targets.

                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a significant source of morbidity, especially with an aging population. Gait problems, particularly freezing of gait (FOG), remain a persistent issue, causing falls and reduced quality of life without consistent responses to therapies. PD and related symptoms have classically been attributed to dopamine deficiency secondary to substantia nigra degeneration from Lewy body (LB) and Lewy neurite (LN) infiltration. However, Lewy-related pathology is present in other areas of the brainstem and spinal cord that control gait function, yet these other circuits have not been routinely considered in the design of current therapeutic options. In this review, we summarize changes in brainstem and spinal cord circuits in individuals affected by PD and the implications for understanding of gait dysfunction in PD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94168">Driver lines for studying associative learning in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The mushroom body (MB) is the center for associative learning in insects. In <i>Drosophila</i>, intersectional split-GAL4 drivers and electron microscopy (EM) connectomes have laid the foundation for precise interrogation of the MB neural circuits. However, investigation of many cell types upstream and downstream of the MB has been hindered due to lack of specific driver lines. Here we describe a new collection of over 800 split-GAL4 and split-LexA drivers that cover approximately 300 cell types, including sugar sensory neurons, putative nociceptive ascending neurons, olfactory and thermo-/hygro-sensory projection neurons, interneurons connected with the MB-extrinsic neurons, and various other cell types. We characterized activation phenotypes for a subset of these lines and identified a sugar sensory neuron line most suitable for reward substitution. Leveraging the thousands of confocal microscopy images associated with the collection, we analyzed neuronal morphological stereotypy and discovered that one set of mushroom body output neurons, MBON08/MBON09, exhibits striking individuality and asymmetry across animals. In conjunction with the EM connectome maps, the driver lines reported here offer a powerful resource for functional dissection of neural circuits for associative learning in adult <i>Drosophila</i>.

                Several areas of the world suffer a notably high incidence of Shiga toxin-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i>. To assess the impact of persistent cross-species transmission systems on the epidemiology of <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 in Alberta, Canada, we sequenced and assembled <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 isolates originating from collocated cattle and human populations, 2007–2015. We constructed a timed phylogeny using BEAST2 using a structured coalescent model. We then extended the tree with human isolates through 2019 to assess the long-term disease impact of locally persistent lineages. During 2007–2015, we estimated that 88.5% of human lineages arose from cattle lineages. We identified 11 persistent lineages local to Alberta, which were associated with 38.0% (95% CI 29.3%, 47.3%) of human isolates. During the later period, six locally persistent lineages continued to be associated with human illness, including 74.7% (95% CI 68.3%, 80.3%) of reported cases in 2018 and 2019. Our study identified multiple locally evolving lineages transmitted between cattle and humans persistently associated with <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 illnesses for up to 13 y. Locally persistent lineages may be a principal cause of the high incidence of <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 in locations such as Alberta and provide opportunities for focused control efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101142">The multifaceted role of the inferior colliculus in sensory prediction, reward processing, and decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The inferior colliculus (IC) has traditionally been regarded as an important relay in the auditory pathway, primarily involved in relaying auditory information from the brainstem to the thalamus. However, this study uncovers the multifaceted role of the IC in bridging auditory processing, sensory prediction, and reward prediction. Through extracellular recordings in monkeys engaged in a sound duration-based deviation detection task, we observed a 'climbing effect' in neuronal firing rates, indicative of an enhanced response over sound sequences linked to sensory prediction rather than reward anticipation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate reward prediction errors within the IC, highlighting its complex integration in auditory and reward processing. Further analysis revealed a direct correlation between IC neuronal activity and behavioral choices, suggesting its involvement in decision-making processes. This research highlights a more complex role for the IC than traditionally understood, showcasing its integral role in cognitive and sensory processing and emphasizing its importance in integrated brain functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102977">eIF3 engages with 3’-UTR termini of highly translated mRNAs</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell differentiation involves a global increase in protein synthesis to meet the demands of specialized cell types. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this translational burst and the involvement of initiation factors remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) in early differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Using Quick-irCLIP and alternative polyadenylation (APA) Seq, we show eIF3 crosslinks predominantly with 3’ untranslated region (3’-UTR) termini of multiple mRNA isoforms, adjacent to the poly(A) tail. Furthermore, we find that eIF3 engagement at 3’-UTR ends is dependent on polyadenylation. High eIF3 crosslinking at 3’-UTR termini of mRNAs correlates with high translational activity, as determined by ribosome profiling, but not with translational efficiency. The results presented here show that eIF3 engages with 3’-UTR termini of highly translated mRNAs, likely reflecting a general rather than specific regulatory function of eIF3, and supporting a role of mRNA circularization in the mechanisms governing mRNA translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98514">Nutritional state-dependent modulation of insulin-producing cells in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Insulin plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis. <i>Drosophila</i> insulin-producing cells (IPCs) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into circulation. To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity, we quantified the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs using electrophysiological recordings. We found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity. IPC activity decreased with increasing periods of starvation. Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, significantly increased IPC activity, whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect. In contrast to feeding, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity. This was reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application. Contrary to IPCs, Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (DH44<sup>PI</sup>Ns) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44<sup>PI</sup>Ns do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. Hence, populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Accordingly, activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity. Taken together, we demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100525">Post-retrieval noradrenergic activation impairs subsequent memory depending on cortico-hippocampal reactivation</a></h4>

              
                When retrieved, seemingly stable memories can become sensitive to significant events, such as acute stress. The mechanisms underlying these memory dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we show that noradrenergic stimulation after memory retrieval impairs subsequent remembering, depending on hippocampal and cortical signals emerging during retrieval. In a three-day study, we measured brain activity using fMRI during initial encoding, 24 hr-delayed memory cueing followed by pharmacological elevations of glucocorticoid or noradrenergic activity, and final recall. While post-retrieval glucocorticoids did not affect subsequent memory, the impairing effect of noradrenergic arousal on final recall depended on hippocampal reactivation and category-level reinstatement in the ventral temporal cortex during memory cueing. These effects did not require a reactivation of the original memory trace and did not interact with offline reinstatement during rest. Our findings demonstrate that, depending on the retrieval-related neural reactivation of memories, noradrenergic arousal after retrieval can alter the future accessibility of consolidated memories.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97559">MftG is crucial for ethanol metabolism of mycobacteria by linking mycofactocin oxidation to respiration</a></h4>

              
                Mycofactocin is a redox cofactor essential for the alcohol metabolism of mycobacteria. While the biosynthesis of mycofactocin is well established, the gene <i>mftG</i>, which encodes an oxidoreductase of the glucose-methanol-choline superfamily, remained functionally uncharacterized. Here, we show that MftG enzymes are almost exclusively found in genomes containing mycofactocin biosynthetic genes and are present in 75% of organisms harboring these genes. Gene deletion experiments in <i>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</i> demonstrated a growth defect of the ∆<i>mftG</i> mutant on ethanol as a carbon source, accompanied by an arrest of cell division reminiscent of mild starvation. Investigation of carbon and cofactor metabolism implied a defect in mycofactocin reoxidation. Cell-free enzyme assays and respirometry using isolated cell membranes indicated that MftG acts as a mycofactocin dehydrogenase shuttling electrons toward the respiratory chain. Transcriptomics studies also indicated remodeling of redox metabolism to compensate for a shortage of redox equivalents. In conclusion, this work closes an important knowledge gap concerning the mycofactocin system and adds a new pathway to the intricate web of redox reactions governing the metabolism of mycobacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102852">PEBP1 amplifies mitochondrial dysfunction-induced integrated stress response</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in numerous diseases and the aging process. The integrated stress response (ISR) serves as a critical adaptation mechanism to a variety of stresses, including those originating from mitochondria. By utilizing mass spectrometry-based cellular thermal shift assay (MS-CETSA), we uncovered that phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), also known as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), is thermally stabilized by stresses which induce mitochondrial ISR. Depletion of PEBP1 impaired mitochondrial ISR activation by reducing eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation and subsequent ISR gene expression, which was independent of PEBP1’s role in inhibiting the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Consistently, overexpression of PEBP1 potentiated ISR activation by heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, the principal eIF2α kinase in the mitochondrial ISR pathway. Real-time interaction analysis using luminescence complementation in live cells revealed an interaction between PEBP1 and eIF2α, which was disrupted by eIF2α S51 phosphorylation. These findings suggest a role for PEBP1 in amplifying mitochondrial stress signals, thereby facilitating an effective cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, PEBP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The literature highlights the importance of parental involvement in autism treatment. However, much research has predominantly focused on child outcomes and cognitive dimensions. This study explores the impact of an early intensive intervention with parental involvement, focusing on changes in parents&amp;amp;rsquo; affective exchanges. Notably, given the paucity of studies on fathers in the intervention context, this study examines the comparative trajectory of change considering both caregivers. Methods: Twenty autistic preschoolers were monitored for one year during a parental-based intervention. Child&amp;amp;ndash;mother and child&amp;amp;ndash;father play interactions were coded with the Emotional Availability Scales at baseline and at 12 months. Repeated measures linear mixed-effect models were employed to investigate time and caregiver effects and their interaction. Results: Results highlighted both similarities and differences in change trajectories between caregivers. Parental sensitivity, structuring, and non-intrusiveness significantly increased for both parents with fathers showing more prominent gains in structuring the interaction while being non-intrusive. Child responsiveness and involvement significantly increased, showing similar trajectories with both caregivers. Children were generally more involved while interacting with their fathers. Conclusion: Parent&amp;amp;ndash;child interactions with caregivers evolved toward more adaptive exchanges regarding emotional availability for children&amp;amp;rsquo;s and parents&amp;amp;rsquo; dimensions. Fathers appeared to be particularly receptive regarding acquiring structuring abilities and non-intrusive behaviors. Our results underscore the importance of investigating parental features as well as the importance of actively involving caregivers to support distal outcomes and generalization.</p>

	<p>Central nervous system (CNS) tumors involve a large and diverse group of malignancies that arise from various cell types within the brain tissue. Although there are advances in treatments, CNS tumors still remain challenging, due to their complex biology and the delicate nature of the surrounding tissue. NAD(P)H O=oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the detoxification of quinones, protecting cells from oxidative stress. In CNS tumors this enzyme is often overexpressed, which contributes to the resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy by enhancing their antioxidant defenses. NQO1 influences the progression of CNS tumors by affecting downstream signaling pathways, such as those involving the transcription factor SNAIL, as well as others that are associated with tumor behavior. Plants represent a valuable source of numerous constituents with different chemical structures known to affect different molecular signaling pathways associated with different pathologies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Experimental studies show that when an individual makes choices, they affect future decisions. Future choices tend to be consistent with past ones. This tendency matters in the context of ambivalent situations because they may not lead to clear choices, often leading people to make &amp;amp;ldquo;arbitrary&amp;amp;rdquo; decisions. Thus, because of choice consistency with the past, people&amp;amp;rsquo;s decision-making values diverge. Thus, hard choices may contribute to the individuation of values. Methods: Here, we develop a Bayesian framework for the effects of cognitive choice consistency on decision-making. This framework thus extends earlier cognitive-science Bayesian theories, which focus on other tasks, such as inference. The minimization of total surprisals considering the history of stimuli and chosen actions implements choice consistency in our framework. We then use a computational model based on this framework to study the effect of hard choices on decision-making values. Results: The results for action selection based on sensory stimuli show that hard choices can cause the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the decision-making space. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is different across individuals, leading to individuation. If in addition, rewards are given to certain choices, then the direction of the symmetry breaking can be guided by these incentives. Finally, we explore the effects of the parametric complexity of the model, the number of choices, and the length of choice memory. Conclusions: Considering the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s mechanism of choice consistency and the number of hard choices made in life, we hypothesize that they contribute to individuality. We assess this hypothesis by placing our study in the context of the cognition-of-individuality literature and proposing experimental tests of our computational results.</p>

                <p>Human face categorization has been extensively studied using event-related potentials (ERPs), positing the N170 ERP component as a robust neural marker of face categorization. Recently, the fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) approach relying on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) has also been used to investigate face categorization. FPVS studies consistently report strong bilateral SSVEP face categorization responses over the occipitotemporal cortex, with a right hemispheric dominance, closely mirroring the N170 scalp topography. However, it remains unclear whether SSVEP responses can be considered a proxy for the N170 or are driven by different components. To address this question, we recorded electrophysiological signals from observers viewing face and object images during FPVS and ERP paradigms. We quantified the FPVS response in the frequency domain and extracted ERP components, including the P1, N170, and P2, from both the FPVS time domain and ERP paradigms. Our results revealed little relationship between any single ERP component and the FPVS frequency response. Only the peak-to-peak differences between N170 and P2 components consistently explained the FPVS frequency response. Our data show that the FPVS frequency response reflects a later complex neural integration rather than any isolated ERP component, such as the N170. These findings raise important methodological and theoretical considerations regarding the relationship between SSVEPs and transient ERPs. While both markers are indicative of human face categorization, they appear to capture different stages of this cognitive process.</p>

                Background The purpose of this study was to evaluate arterial perforators in the lower limb using Doppler of the vascular territories in the lower extremity. Methods This study was conducted at Government Hospitals. This observational study was performed prospectively over a period of 2 years. One hundred healthy volunteers underwent Doppler evaluation of the lower limbs for perforator mapping. Continuous wave Doppler using a Huntleigh Doppler DMX handheld device and pulse wave and color Doppler evaluations were performed using a Samsung HS 40 machine. Results In our study, out of a total of 100 participants, 77 were male and 23 were female participants. Most commonly, four perforators were picked up by the pulse wave and color Doppler machine from the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Data were recorded for analysis by sound engineers using a custom-made recording cable to meet the requirements of the audio output port of both Doppler Machines. A total of 189 sets of recordings were analyzed. Seventy percent of the recordings matched both Continuous Wave and Pulsed wave Doppler. Continuous wave Doppler correctly identified the better perforator, as suggested by the doctor, based on a blinded study. The echoes obtained from Continuous Wave Doppler supported the quality of the perforators. Conclusions The presence of a metallic intra- operative probe in Continuous Wave Doppler, which can be sterilized, allows intra-operative Doppler to confirm the dominant perforator for surgical flap planning.

                <p>by Edoardo Saccenti, Cristina Furlan</p>

The thesis project is an essential step to obtain an MSc degree. Within STEM and Life Sciences disciplines, computational theses have specific characteristics that differentiate them from wet laboratory ones. In this article, we present <i>Ten simple rules</i> to direct and support Master students who are about to start a computational research project for their Master thesis. We begin by recommending defining the personal learning goals for the project; we then highlight specific pitfalls that computational students might encounter during their work, such as procrastination by computation or wasting time while attempting to reinvent computational tools. We provide the students a series of suggestions on how to work following FAIR principles, learn new computing languages, and think ahead for computational challenges. We hope that these 10 simple rules will provide Master students with a framework for the successful completion of their computational thesis.

                <p>by Chunhong Long, Hongqiong Liang, Biao Wan</p>

In eukaryotes, DNA achieves a highly compact structure primarily due to its winding around the histone cores. The nature wrapping of DNA around histone core form a 1.7 left-handed superhelical turns, contributing to negative supercoiling in chromatin. During transcription, negative supercoils generated behind the polymerase during transcription may play a role in triggering nucleosome reassembly. To elucidate how supercoils influence the dynamics of wrapping of DNA around the histone cores, we developed a novel model to simulate the intricate interplay between DNA and histone. Our simulations reveal that both positively and negatively supercoiled DNAs are capable of wrapping around histone cores to adopt the nucleosome conformation. Notably, our findings confirm a strong preference for negative supercoiled DNA during nucleosome wrapping, and reveal that the both of the negative writhe and twist are beneficial to the formation of the DNA wrapping around histone. Additionally, the simulations of the multiple nucleosomes on the same DNA template indicate that the nucleosome tends to assemble in proximity to the original nucleosome. This advancement in understanding the spontaneous formation of nucleosomes may offer insights into the complex dynamics of chromatin assembly and the fundamental mechanisms governing the structure and function of chromatin.

                <p>by Xiaowen Chen, Joanna Tober, Martin Dominguez, Alan T. Tang, Jenna Bockman, Jisheng Yang, Sneha Mani, Chin Nien Lee, Mei Chen, Triloshan Thillaikumaran, Patricia Mericko-Ishizuka, Monica Mainigi, Nancy A. Speck, Mark L. Kahn</p>

Definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) arise from a small number of hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) within the developing embryo. Understanding the origin and ontogeny of HSPCs is of considerable interest and potential therapeutic value. It has been proposed that the murine placenta contains HECs that differentiate into HSPCs. However, during human gestation HSPCs arise in the aorta considerably earlier than when they can first be detected in the placenta, suggesting that the placenta may primarily serve as a niche. We found that the Runx1 transcription factor, which is required to generate HSPCs from HECs, is not expressed by mouse placental ECs. To definitively determine whether the mouse placenta is a site of HSPC emergence, we performed lineage tracing experiments with a Hoxa13<sup>Cre</sup> allele that specifically labels ECs in the placenta and umbilical cord (UC), but not in the yolk sac or embryo. Immunostaining revealed Hoxa13<sup>Cre</sup> lineage-traced HECs and HSPCs in the UC, a known site of HECs, but not the placenta. Consistent with these findings, ECs harvested from the E10.5 aorta and UC, but not the placenta, gave rise to hematopoietic cells ex vivo, while colony forming assays using E14.5 fetal liver revealed only 2% of HSPCs arose from Hoxa13-expressing precursors. In contrast, the pan-EC Cdh5-CreER<sup>T2</sup> allele labeled most HSPCs in the mouse placenta. Lastly, we found that RUNX1 and other HEC genes were not expressed in first-trimester human placenta villous ECs, suggesting that human placenta is not hemogenic. Our findings demonstrate that the placenta functions as a site for expansion of HSPCs that arise within the embryo proper and is not a primary site of HSPC emergence.

                <p>by Tania Veuthey, Jeremy T. Florman, Sebastián Giunti, Stefano Romussi, María José De Rosa, Mark J. Alkema, Diego Rayes</p>

The DAF-2/insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway plays an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating reproductive development, life span, and stress resistance. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, DAF-2/IIS signaling is modulated by an extensive array of insulin-like peptides (ILPs) with diverse spatial and temporal expression patterns. However, the release dynamics and specific functions of these ILPs in adapting to different environmental conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the ILP, insulin-3 (INS-3), plays a crucial role in modulating the response to various environmental stressors in <i>C. elegans</i>. <i>ins-3</i> mutants display increased resistance to heat, oxidative stress, and starvation; however, this advantage is countered by slower reproductive development under favorable conditions. We find that <i>ins-3</i> expression is downregulated in response to environmental stressors, whereas, the neurohormone tyramine, which is released during the acute flight response, increases <i>ins-3</i> expression. We show that tyramine induces intestinal calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients through the activation of the TYRA-3 receptor. Our data support a model in which tyramine negatively impacts environmental stress resistance by stimulating the release of INS-3 from the intestine via the activation of a TYRA-3-G<sub>α</sub><sub>q</sub>-IP3 pathway. The release of INS-3 systemically activates the DAF-2 pathway, resulting in the inhibition of cytoprotective mechanisms mediated by DAF-16/FOXO. These studies offer mechanistic insights into a brain–gut communication pathway that weighs adaptive strategies to respond to acute and long-term stressors.

                Background Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the skin, joints, and nails (2-3% worldwide), significantly affects quality of life. Genetic and environmental factors also play key roles. Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral corticosteroids help to manage plaque psoriasis symptoms, but combination therapies might offer greater effectiveness and improved safety profiles. These combinations could potentially reduce medication dosages and side effects in patients. Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of various drug combinations over conventional monotherapies in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, which incorporates palmoplantar psoriasis and psoriasis vulgaris, by discovering and utilizing research articles comprising the same or similar variables as PASI 75 and evaluating the information using RevMan v5.4.1. Method We reviewed the efficacy and safety of combination therapy vs. monotherapy/placebo for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (palmoplantar and vulgaris) using PASI 75 via RevMan v5.4.1. Risk of bias assessment and funnel plots were employed to assess the heterogeneity of each paper. Inclusion criteria – Publications < 20yrs, RCTs, plaque/palmoplantar/psoriasis vulgaris; exclusion criteria – Guttate/arthritic psoriasis, pediatric and pregnant individuals, publications > 20 yrs. Results Seventeen studies were analyzed, comprising a total of 2291 patients (n=1147 with combination regimens and n=1144 with control regimen in the analysis). A significant PASI 75- response was observed in the pioglitazone combination subgroup as compared to placebo (OR=4.92,95% CI 2.19-11.05, P = 0.0001); methotrexate combination subgroup as compared to placebo (OR=2.56, 95% CI 1.67-3.94, P< 0.0001) test of subgroup differences showed P= 0.14, I2= 34%. Incidence rate of abnormality in levels of liver enzymes (OR=1.89,9.5% CI 6.69-5.22, P=0.22), nausea (OR=1.28,95% CI 0.77-2.14, P=0.34), headache (OR=1.28,95% CI 0.77-2.14, P=0.58), fatigue (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.41-1.90, P=0.45).] Conclusion This study showed that combination therapy is very effective for plaque psoriasis, with promising combinations of pioglitazone. While safety seems similar between the groups, larger studies are needed to determine the long-term effects. These findings suggest that personalized treatment plans could improve outcomes; however, confirmation through larger trials is crucial before wider use. This opens doors to research on optimal combinations for individual patients.

                Background A multifaceted and interactive teaching approach is recommended for achieving proficiency in evidence-based practice, with critical thinking considered vital for connecting theory and practice. In this context, we advocate the strategic use of health claims in media to promote critical thinking and provide an accessible entry point to evidence-based practice for early-stage university healthcare students. Method We conducted a convergent mixed methods study, including a cross-sectional survey with structured and open-ended questions as well as focus group interviews, at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Oslo Metropolitan University, during the 2020-2021 academic year. Participants were bachelor’s students in bioengineering, physiotherapy, social education, and occupational therapy. We employed a blended learning approach, combining digital learning resources, teaching in critical assessment of health claims and evidence-based practice, and a concurrent group exam assignment centered around health news. The outcome measures included students’ experiences integrating health claims into evidence-based practice teaching and their experiences with teaching approaches, including the group exam. Results Out of 446 participants, 136 (30.5%) responded to the structured questions in the survey. In response to the open-ended questions within the survey, 109 (80.1%) of the respondents shared positive experiences about the course, while 98 (72%) suggested improvements. Additionally, 25 students participated in focus group interviews. Synthesizing the results, we found that students viewed the inclusion of health claim assessment as a useful entry point for learning evidence-based practice. In addition, both the blended learning design and the group exam were identified as contributors to a positive perception of learning outcomes from the course. Conclusions Integrating critical reflection on media health claims into evidence-based practice education, alongside a blended learning approach and a group exam, may be beneficial for educating bachelor’s healthcare students. However, further rigorous study designs are needed to assess the effect of the course on learning outcomes. Registration DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6985449

                Introduction Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects approximately 40% of men; however, the true prevalence remains uncertain owing to various factors. Diagnosing ED is challenging, and tools like the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and its shorter version, the IIEF-5, are commonly used to assess its severity. Although nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR) monitoring, as an objective test, can help diagnose ED, it is complex and not economical. Therefore, this study aimed to compare NPTR with the IIEF to assess the IIEF’s potential as a cost-effective diagnostic tool for ED. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed on 138 men with ED between August 2017 and March 2023 who had undergone NPTR assessment in Jakarta, Indonesia. ED was assessed using detailed evaluations and IIEF-5 questionnaires. NPTR data was collected using a Rigiscan® device. Serum testosterone, total cholesterol, HbA1c, and vitamin D-25(OH) from blood samples were also evaluated. Bivariate analysis was used to explore the correlations between IIEF-5 scores, NPTR measurements, and blood parameters. Results In total, 139 men with ED (median age: 42 years) were included. The median IIEF-5 score was 11, and comorbidities included dyslipidemia (20%) and diabetes (12%). There are significant correlations between IIEF scores and NPTR variables (number of erections recorded, base tumescence increment, average base tumescence, and duration of base erection with ˃ 60% rigidity). Significant correlations were also found between HbA1c and various NPTR variables. Conclusion This study underscores the value of subjective questionnaires such as the IIEF-5 in diagnosing ED, especially in the absence of advanced tests like the NPTR assessment. We found correlations between IIEF scores and nocturnal erection frequency, as well as specific erection characteristics. Our findings highlight the importance of a personalized approach to ED diagnosis. Although IIEF aids in cost-effective assessments, it should not replace objective testing.

                Background UAV-based power line inspections offer a safer, more efficient alternative to traditional methods, but insulator detection presents key challenges: multiscale object detection and intra-class variance. Insulators vary in size due to UAV altitude and perspective changes, while their visual similarities across types (e.g., glass, porcelain, composite) complicate classification. Methods To address these issues, we introduce APF-YOLO, an enhanced YOLOv8-based model integrating the Adaptive Path Fusion (APF) neck and the Adaptive Feature Alignment Module (AFAM). AFAM balances fine-grained detail extraction for small objects with semantic context for larger ones through local and global pathways by integrating advanced attention mechanisms. This work also introduces the Merged Public Insulator Dataset (MPID), a comprehensive dataset designed for insulator detection, representing diverse real-world conditions such as occlusions, varying scales, and environmental challenges. Results Evaluations on MPID demonstrate that APF-YOLO surpasses state-of-the-art models with different neck configurations, achieving at least a +2.71% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.9 and a +1.24% increase in recall, while maintaining real-time performance in server-grade environments. Although APF-YOLO adds computational requirements, these remain within acceptable limits for real-world applications. Future work will optimize APF-YOLO for edge devices through techniques such as model pruning and lightweight feature extractors, enhancing its adaptability and efficiency. Conclusion Combined with MPID, APF-YOLO establishes a strong foundation for advancing UAV-based insulator detection, contributing to safer and more effective power line monitoring.

                Introduction OOPE for healthcare services is a major concern within the Indian healthcare system. 30% of the population remains uninsured despite increasing health insurance coverage. For obstetrics and gynaecology (OBG) patients financial obstacles like OOPE can delay access to health care, evaluating spending patterns can inform policies to enhance accessibility, affordability and equitable health. Methodology A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Karnataka state of India to analyze OOPE for 905 OBG patients who underwent Cesarean Section(C-Section), Laparoscopic Hysterectomy, Laparoscopic Cystectomy, Laparoscopic Myomectomy and Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy (LAVH). These were the top five most performed obstetrics and gynecology surgeries in the tertiary care teaching hospital between January 2023 and July 2023. Data was collected across AB-PMJAY, private health insurance, uninsured patients and analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, median) and the Shapiro-Wilk test for data normality. Results The study analyzed OOPE across 905 OBG patients. Findings show AB-PMJAY provided full coverage with zero OOPE for all surgeries. Though private health insurance reduced OOPE compared to uninsured patients under private health insurance still faced significant financial burden. Variations existed in minimum and maximum OOPE and percentage of OOPE across different private insurances. All the uninsured patients incurred 100% OOPE, with a median OOPE of Rs. 33,257 (405.67 USD) to Rs. 57,053 (695.76 USD) and a mean OOPE of Rs. 39,848 (485.95 USD) to Rs. 60,687 (740 USD) across the surgeries. Discussion Findings of the study show that AB-PMJAY is highly effective in reducing OOPE and enhancing financial risk protection for OBG patients. Patients covered by private health insurance incurred less OOPE, yet the burden remained considerable. High OOPE rates for uninsured patients (100%) and private health insurance (38.15%) compared to 0% OOPE in AB-PMJAY emphasizes the need for the continued expansion of AB-PMJAY.

                Background Corruption, a multifaceted governance issue, impacts public well-being globally. The recent trends reveal a rise in suicide rates across the Americas, while all other regions show declines over twenty years of time. This study investigates corruption’s effect on suicide in 26 American countries, considering moderating factors of unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Methods This study analysed latest two decades of available data, using stepwise panel regression method to investigate the effects of corruption and economic variables on suicide across income levels. Data were sourced from Transparency International, World Bank and the World Health Organization. Initially, unit root tests and CUSUM plots were used to ensure the stability and stationarity of the dataset, and model specification were validated through F test, LM test and Hausman test to select the ideal econometric model - POLS, REM, or FEM for the study. Results A strong suicide rate persistence revealed, particularly in high-income countries, where the lagged suicide variable showed a coefficient of 0.8063 (p < 0.001). Corruption significantly impacted suicide rates in upper-middle-income countries (coefficient = -0.0268, p < 0.05), with higher corruption perceptions scores correlating with lower suicide rates. Additionally, unemployment acted as a significant moderator, intensifying the corruption’s adverse impact on suicide with a coefficient of 0.0022 (p < 0.001) in upper-middle income nations. Economic growth demonstrated a minor protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, with an interaction coefficient of -0.0005 (p < 0.1), suggesting slight suicide reduction linked to economic stability. Conclusion This study found that corruption, unemployment, and economic growth significantly influence suicide rates across the Americas. Corruption exacerbates suicide risks in upper-middle-income countries, while unemployment amplifies this effect. Economic growth offers a slight protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, suggesting that economic stability may help mitigate suicide rates.

                Background Diabetes mellitus type II is expected to impact large number of population worldwide. Among the available theraputic options, Metformin hydrochloride is a key medication, particularly for those who cannot effectively manage the condition through changes in diet and lifestyle alone. This research aimed to formulate floating Metformin HCl beads and developed a physiological based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model by using Gastroplus® software to predict their in vivo parameters from in vitro release study. Methods Sodium alginate-based MH floating beads were prepared by dissolving different concentrations of sodium alginate in deionized water, incorporating MH (1 g) and calcium carbonate (1.5 mg) as a gas-forming agent, and mixing at 200 rpm. The air-free dispersion, achieved through 30 minutes of sonication, was dropped into a 5% w/v calcium chloride solution containing 5% v/v isopropyl alcohol via a syringe for cross-linking and bead formation. Beads were cured in the solution for 30 minutes to enhance mechanical strength, then filtered, washed, and air-dried for 24 hours, ensuring uniformity and stability for controlled drug delivery and the prepared beads wereevaluated for their entrapment efficiency %, morphology, floating property and in vitro releasUltimately, using Gastroplus® software, to predict the pharmacokinetic profile of in vitro release results. Results Entrapment efficiency exhibited acceptable values and the beads were smooth rounded in shape for all formulations. The beads remained afloat during the release study; the release study revealed that F1 to F5 showed asymptotic slow-release, while F6 and F7 gave shorter release times. The prediction of absorption indicated highest MH absorption was in jejunum, then duodenum. Conclusion The prepared Beads had promising pharmacokinetic parameters and C max was close to MH modified released tablet.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite diagnostic criteria refinements, Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical diagnosis still suffers from a not satisfying accuracy, with the post-mortem examination as the gold standard for diagnosis. Seminal clinicopathological series highlighted that a relevant number of patients alive-diagnosed with idiopathic PD have an alternative post-mortem diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PD comparing the in-vivo clinical diagnosis with the post-mortem diagnosis performed through the pathological examination in 2 groups.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective case–control study, patients and healthy subjects who consented to the post-mortem pathological diagnosis at the UK Brain Bank were consecutively enrolled from the UK Brain Bank. Medical records were reviewed to classify participants and performance metrics were further calculated using neuropathological diagnosis as the gold standard.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four thousand five hundred seventy one subjects were eligible for the study. The clinical diagnosis group was: 1,048 Parkinson's patients and 1,242 healthy subjects. Pathology diagnosis group were: 996 Parkinson's patients and 1,288 subjects with no post-mortem abnormality. For the group of clinical diagnosis, PD diagnosis showed: sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, accuracy of 90.96%, F1-Score 0.89, and a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.925 (SE ± 0.006) [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.913, 0.937], 𝑝&lt;0.001. In this group, the most frequent pathology diagnosis among clinically misdiagnosed PD (false positive) patients was dementia with Lewy bodies (19.4%). Conversely, the most frequent clinical diagnosis among PD missed clinical diagnosis (false negative) patients was Alzheimer's disease (18.5%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings confirm a still significant diagnostic error and emphasize the need for more fine and homogeneous criteria to classify idiopathic Parkinson's patients correctly. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
