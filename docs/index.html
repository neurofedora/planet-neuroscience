              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05305">Predicting Brain Morphogenesis via Physics-Transfer Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain morphology is shaped by genetic and mechanical factors and is linked to biological development and diseases. Its fractal-like features, regional anisotropy, and complex curvature distributions hinder quantitative insights in medical inspections. Recognizing that the underlying elastic instability and bifurcation share the same physics as simple geometries such as spheres and ellipses, we developed a physics-transfer learning framework to address the geometrical complexity. To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we constructed a digital library of high-fidelity continuum mechanics modeling that both describes and predicts the developmental processes of brain growth and disease. The physics of nonlinear elasticity from simple geometries is embedded into a neural network and applied to brain models. This physics-transfer approach demonstrates remarkable performance in feature characterization and morphogenesis prediction, highlighting the pivotal role of localized deformation in dominating over the background geometry. The data-driven framework also provides a library of reduced-dimensional evolutionary representations that capture the essential physics of the highly folded cerebral cortex. Validation through medical images and domain expertise underscores the deployment of digital-twin technology in comprehending the morphological complexity of the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06426">Musculoskeletal simulation of limb movement biomechanics in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational models are critical to advance our understanding of how neural, biomechanical, and physical systems interact to orchestrate animal behaviors. Despite the availability of near-complete reconstructions of the Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system, musculature, and exoskeleton, anatomically and physically grounded models of fly leg muscles are still missing. These models provide an indispensable bridge between motor neuron activity and joint movements. Here, we introduce the first 3D, data-driven musculoskeletal model of Drosophila legs, implemented in both OpenSim and MuJoCo simulation environments. Our model incorporates a Hill-type muscle representation based on high-resolution X-ray scans from multiple fixed specimens. We present a pipeline for constructing muscle models using morphological imaging data and for optimizing unknown muscle parameters specific to the fly. We then combine our musculoskeletal models with detailed 3D pose estimation data from behaving flies to achieve muscle-actuated behavioral replay in OpenSim. Simulations of muscle activity across diverse walking and grooming behaviors predict coordinated muscle synergies that can be tested experimentally. Furthermore, by training imitation learning policies in MuJoCo, we test the effect of different passive joint properties on learning speed and find that damping and stiffness facilitate learning. Overall, our model enables the investigation of motor control in an experimentally tractable model organism, providing insights into how biomechanics contribute to generation of complex limb movements. Moreover, our model can be used to control embodied artificial agents to generate naturalistic and compliant locomotion in simulated environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06810">Reward function compression facilitates goal-dependent reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely assign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However, this flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here, we propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a capacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners create a "compressed" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal) which is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon receiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting learning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent with our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically impaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space structure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to correlate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal valuation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We leverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work suggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex goal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the neuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral techniques that support people in achieving their goals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08209">Modeling Visual Hallucination: A Generative Adversarial Network Framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2102.08209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual hallucination refers to the perception of recognizable things that are not present. These phenomena are commonly linked to a range of neurological/psychiatric disorders. Despite ongoing research, the mechanisms through which the visual system generates hallucinations from real-world environments are still not well understood. Abnormal interactions between different regions of the brain responsible for perception are known to contribute to the occurrence of visual hallucinations. In this study, we propose and extend a generative neural network-based framework to address challenges within the visual system, aiming to create goal-driven models inspired by neurobiological mechanisms of visual hallucinations. We focus on the adversarial interactions between the visual system and the frontal lobe regions, proposing the Hallu-GAN model to suggest how these interactions can give rise to visual hallucinations. The architecture of the Hallu-GAN model is based on generative adversarial networks. Our simulation results indicate that disturbances in the ventral stream can lead to visual hallucinations. To further analyze the impact of other brain regions on the visual system, we extend the Hallu-GAN model by adding EEG data from individuals. This extended model, referred to as Hallu-GAN+, enables the examination of both hallucinating and non-hallucinating states. By training the Hallu-GAN+ model with EEG data from an individual with Charles Bonnet syndrome, we demonstrated its utility in analyzing the behavior of those experiencing hallucinations. Our simulation results confirmed the capability of the proposed model in resembling the visual system in both healthy and hallucinating states.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18333">A Framework for Standardizing Similarity Measures in a Rapidly Evolving Field</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.18333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarity measures are fundamental tools for quantifying the alignment between artificial and biological systems. However, the diversity of similarity measures and their varied naming and implementation conventions makes it challenging to compare across studies. To facilitate comparisons and make explicit the implementation choices underlying a given code package, we have created and are continuing to develop a Python repository that benchmarks and standardizes similarity measures. The goal of creating a consistent naming convention that uniquely and efficiently specifies a similarity measure is not trivial as, for example, even commonly used methods like Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) have at least 12 different variations, and this number will likely continue to grow as the field evolves. For this reason, we do not advocate for a fixed, definitive naming convention. The landscape of similarity measures and best practices will continue to change and so we see our current repository, which incorporates approximately 100 different similarity measures from 14 packages, as providing a useful tool at this snapshot in time. To accommodate the evolution of the field we present a framework for developing, validating, and refining naming conventions with the goal of uniquely and efficiently specifying similarity measures, ultimately making it easier for the community to make comparisons across studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13669">Theta and/or alpha? Neural oscillational substrates for dynamic inter-brain synchrony during mother-child cooperation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mother-child interaction is a highly dynamic process neurally characterized by inter-brain synchrony (IBS) at {\theta} and/or {\alpha} rhythms. However, their establishment, dynamic changes, and roles in mother-child interactions remain unknown. Through dynamic analysis of dual-EEG from 40 mother-child dyads during turn-taking cooperation, we uncover that {\theta}-IBS and {\alpha}-IBS alternated with interactive behaviors, with EEG frequency-shift as a prerequisite for IBS transitions. When mothers attempt to track their children's attention and/or predict their intentions, they will adjust their EEG frequencies to align with their children's {\theta} oscillations, leading to a higher occurrence of the {\theta}-IBS state. Conversely, the {\alpha}-IBS state, accompanied by the EEG frequency-shift to the {\alpha} range, is more prominent during mother-led interactions. Further exploratory analysis reveals greater presence and stability of the {\theta}-IBS state during cooperative than non-cooperative conditions, particularly in dyads with stronger emotional attachments and more frequent interactions in their daily lives. Our findings shed light on the neural oscillational substrates underlying the IBS dynamics during mother-child interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06255">Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.06255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01307">Patterns of imbalance states between sub-brain regimes during development in the resting state</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.01307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The functional brain network emerges from the complex, coordinated activity of distinct yet connected regions, which underlie the diverse repertoire of human cognitive functions. Structural Balance Theory (SBT) has been successfully applied to model such nontrivial connections through the analysis of balance and unbalance triadic configurations. In this study, using SBT, we examine the network of imbalanced triads in the resting-state brain subnetworks, which undergo dynamic changes during development. We demonstrate that anticorrelation patterns evolve across the lifespan, reflecting a developmental trajectory from a locally modular organization in childhood to a flexible and reconfigurable architecture during adolescence and finally to a highly segregated and functionally specialized network system in adulthood. This developmental trajectory indicates that the spread of anticorrelations is not an inherent feature of brain organization. This mature organization facilitates a balance between self-referential, internally generated cognitive processes and externally oriented, goal-directed cognition, enabling efficient and adaptive cognitive control. This balance is underpinned by prominent anticorrelations between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Frontoparietal Network (FPN) in adulthood. This is while during adolescence these anticorrelations are substantially weaker, suggesting that the maturation of these network connections from adolescence to adulthood establishes a functional architecture that supports the segregation of internal and external cognitive processes. These findings elucidate how the dynamic evolution of anticorrelation patterns in brain networks supports cognitive development across the lifespan, offering new insights into the neural basis of adaptive cognitive control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12134">Chaotic Dynamics and Fractal Geometry in Ring Lattice Systems of Nonchaotic Rulkov Neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.12134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that arise in a 60-dimensional ring lattice system of electrically coupled nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. While networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons have been widely studied, systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the nonchaotic Rulkov map. Here, we find that rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular-spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. By systematically varying the electrical coupling strength between neurons, we also uncover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent across the system's dynamical regimes. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we examine the fractal geometry of the ring system's high-dimensional chaotic attractors and find that these attractors can occupy as many as 45 of the 60 dimensions of state space. We further explore how variations in chaotic behavior - quantified by the full Lyapunov spectra - correspond to changes in the attractors' fractal dimensions. This analysis advances our understanding of how complex collective behavior can emerge from the interaction of multiple simple neuron models and highlights the deep interplay between dynamics and geometry in high-dimensional systems.

                arXiv:2402.07242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing consensus among neuroscientists that neural circuits critical for survival are the result of genomic decompression processes. We introduce SynaptoGen, a novel computational framework--member of the Connectome Models family--bringing synthetic biological intelligence closer, facilitating neural biological agent development through precise genetic control of synaptogenesis. SynaptoGen is the first model of its kind offering mechanistic explanation of synaptic multiplicity based on genetic expression and protein interaction probabilities. The framework connects genetic factors through a differentiable function, working as a neural network where synaptic weights equal average numbers of synapses between neurons, multiplied by conductance, derived from genetic profiles. Differentiability enables gradient-based optimization, allowing generation of genetic expression patterns producing pre-wired biological agents for specific tasks. Validation in simulated synaptogenesis scenarios shows agents successfully solving four reinforcement learning benchmarks, consistently surpassing control baselines. Despite gaps in biological realism requiring mitigation, this framework has potential to accelerate synthetic biological intelligence research.

                arXiv:2502.13729v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) have been developed to offer more persistent memory retention than traditional recurrent neural networks, while maintaining real-time inference capabilities and addressing the time-complexity limitations of Transformers. Despite this intended persistence, the memory mechanism of canonical SSMs is theoretically designed to decay monotonically over time, meaning that more recent inputs are expected to be retained more accurately than earlier ones. Contrary to this theoretical expectation, however, the present study reveals a counterintuitive finding: when trained and evaluated on a synthetic, statistically balanced memorization task, SSMs predominantly preserve the *initially* presented data in memory. This pattern of memory bias, known as the *primacy effect* in psychology, presents a non-trivial challenge to the current theoretical understanding of SSMs and opens new avenues for future research.

                arXiv:2509.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the robustness and structural invariance of hybrid population-based metaheuristics under various objective space transformations. A lightweight plug-and-play hybridization operator is applied to nineteen state-of-the-art algorithms-including differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and recent bio-inspired methods-without modifying their internal logic. Benchmarking on the CEC-2017 suite across four dimensions (10, 30, 50, 100) is performed under five transformation types: baseline, translation, scaling, rotation, and constant shift. Statistical comparisons based on Wilcoxon and Friedman tests, Bayesian dominance analysis, and convergence trajectory profiling consistently show that differential-based hybrids (e.g., hIMODE, hSHADE, hDMSSA) maintain high accuracy, stability, and invariance under all tested deformations. In contrast, classical algorithms-especially PSO- and HHO-based variants-exhibit significant performance degradation under non-separable or distorted landscapes. The findings confirm the superiority of adaptive, structurally resilient hybrids for real-world optimization tasks subject to domain-specific transformations.

                arXiv:2509.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning, the ability to acquire and transfer knowledge through a models lifetime, is critical for artificial agents that interact in real-world environments. Biological brains inherently demonstrate these capabilities while operating within limited energy and resource budgets. Achieving continual learning capability in artificial systems considerably increases memory and computational demands, and even more so when deploying on platforms with limited resources. In this work, Genesis, a spiking continual learning accelerator, is proposed to address this gap. The architecture supports neurally inspired mechanisms, such as activity-dependent metaplasticity, to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. It integrates low-precision continual learning parametersand employs a custom data movement strategy to accommodate the sparsely distributed spikes. Furthermore, the architecture features a memory mapping technique that places metaplasticity parameters and synaptic weights in a single address location for faster memory access. Results show that the mean classification accuracy for Genesis is 74.6% on a task-agnostic split-MNIST benchmark with power consumption of 17.08mW in a 65nm technology node.

                arXiv:2509.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarm intelligence algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex optimization problems across diverse domains. However, their widespread adoption is often hindered by limited transparency in how algorithmic components influence performance. This work presents a multi-faceted investigation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to further understand the key role of different topologies for better interpretability and explainability. To achieve this objective, we first develop a comprehensive landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features affecting the optimization performance of PSO. Next, we conduct a rigorous empirical study comparing three fundamental swarm communication architectures -- Ring, Star, and Von Neumann topologies -- analysing their distinct impacts on exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behaviour, and solution quality and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO, to decode how swarm topologies affects information flow, diversity, and convergence. Based on this, a novel machine learning approach for automated algorithm configuration is introduced for training predictive models on extensive Area over the Convergence Curve (AOCC) data to recommend optimal settings based on problem characteristics. Through systematic experimentation across twenty four benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings advance the development of more transparent and reliable swarm intelligence systems.

                arXiv:2509.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for neuromorphic computing due to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency. However, training methods like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) remain computationally intensive. This work introduces an integer-only, online training algorithm using a mixed-precision approach to improve efficiency and reduce memory usage by over 60%. The method replaces floating-point operations with integer arithmetic to enable hardware-friendly implementation. It generalizes to Convolutional and Recurrent SNNs (CSNNs, RSNNs), showing versatility across architectures. Evaluations on MNIST and the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset demonstrate that mixed-precision models achieve accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision baselines using 16-bit shadow and 8- or 12-bit inference weights. Despite some limitations in low-precision and deeper models, performance remains robust. In conclusion, the proposed integer-only online learning algorithm presents an effective solution for efficiently training SNNs, enabling deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware without sacrificing accuracy.

                arXiv:2509.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators for color images.

                arXiv:2501.14539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central feature of biological intelligence is the ability to learn to learn, enabling rapid adaptation to novel tasks and environments. Yet its neural basis remains elusive, particularly regarding intrinsic properties, as conventional models rely on simplified point-neuron approximations that neglect their dynamics. Inspired by astrocyte-mediated neuromodulation, we propose a hierarchically modulated recurrent spiking neural network (HM-RSNN) that models learning-to-learn with regulation of intrinsic neuronal properties at two spatiotemporal scales. Global modulation captures task-dependent gating of plasticity driven by wide-field calcium waves, whereas local adaptation simulates microdomain calcium-mediated fine-tuning of intrinsic properties within task-relevant subspaces. We evaluate HM-RSNN on four cognitive tasks, demonstrating its computational advantages over standard RSNNs and artificial neural networks, and revealing task-dependent adaptations across multiple scales, including intrinsic properties, neuronal specialization, membrane potential dynamics, and network modularity. Converging evidence and biological consistency position HM-RSNN as a biologically grounded framework, providing testable insights into how astrocyte-mediated hierarchical modulation of intrinsic properties shapes multi-scale neural dynamics that support learning-to-learn.

                arXiv:2502.12174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flood risk managers seek to optimise Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) designs to maximise return on investment. Current systems often use optimisation algorithms and detailed flood models to maximise benefit-cost ratios for single rainstorm return periods. However, these schemes may lack robustness in mitigating flood risks across different storm magnitudes. For example, a BGI scheme optimised for a 100-year return period may differ from one optimised for a 10-year return period. This study introduces a novel methodology incorporating five return periods (T = 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 years) into a multi-objective BGI optimisation framework. The framework combines a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with a fully distributed hydrodynamic model to optimise the spatial placement and combined size of BGI features. For the first time, direct damage cost (DDC) and expected annual damage (EAD), calculated for various building types, are used as risk objective functions, transforming a many-objective problem into a multi-objective one. Performance metrics such as Median Risk Difference (MedRD), Maximum Risk Difference (MaxRD), and Area Under Pareto Front (AUPF) reveal that a 100-year optimised BGI design performs poorly when evaluated for other return periods, particularly shorter ones. In contrast, a BGI design optimised using composite return periods enhances performance metrics across all return periods, with the greatest improvements observed in MedRD (22%) and AUPF (73%) for the 20-year return period, and MaxRD (23%) for the 50-year return period. Furthermore, climate uplift stress testing confirms the robustness of the proposed design to future rainfall extremes. This study advocates a paradigm shift in flood risk management, moving from single maximum to multiple rainstorm return period-based designs to enhance resilience and adaptability to future climate extremes.

                Humans order numerosity along a left-to-right mental number line (MNL), traditionally considered culturally rooted. Yet, some species at birth show spatial-numerical associations (SNA), suggesting neural origins. Various accounts link SNA to brain lateralization but lack evidence. We investigated brain lateralization effects on numerical spatialization in 100 newborn domestic chicks. In ovo light exposure yielded strongly lateralized brains in half the chicks and weakly lateralized in the other half. Chicks learned to select the 4th item in a sagittal array. At the test, the array was rotated 90°, with left and right 4th items correct. Strongly lateralized chicks outperformed weakly lateralized ones when ordinal and spatial cues were reliable (experiment 1), but not with unreliable spatial cues (experiment 2). Moreover, only strongly lateralized chicks showed left-to-right directionality, suggesting the right hemisphere’s key role in integrating spatial and numerical cues. We demonstrate that brain lateralization is fundamental for developing a left-to-right oriented SNA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106239">Genetic parallels in biomineralization of the calcareous sponge Sycon ciliatum and stony corals</a></h4>

              
                The rapid emergence of mineralized structures in diverse animal groups during the late Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods likely resulted from modifications of pre-adapted biomineralization genes inherited from a common ancestor. As the oldest extant phylum with mineralized structures, sponges are key to understanding animal biomineralization. Yet, the biomineralization process in sponges, particularly in forming spicules, is not well understood. To address this, we conducted transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic analyses on the calcareous sponge <i>Sycon ciliatum</i>, supplemented by <i>in situ</i> hybridization. We identified 829 genes overexpressed in regions of increased calcite spicule formation, including 17 calcarins—proteins analogous to corals’ galaxins localized in the spicule matrix and expressed in sclerocytes. Their expression varied temporally and spatially, specific to certain spicule types, indicating that fine-tuned gene regulation is crucial for biomineralization control. Similar subtle expression changes are also relevant in stony coral biomineralization. Tandem gene arrangements and expression changes suggest that gene duplication and neofunctionalization have significantly shaped <i>S. ciliatum</i>’s biomineralization, similar to that in corals. These findings suggest a parallel evolution of carbonate biomineralization in the calcitic <i>S. ciliatum</i> and aragonitic corals, exemplifying the evolution of mechanisms crucial for animals to act as ecosystem engineers and form reef structures.

">Human-specific features of the cerebellum and ZP2-regulated synapse development</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the unique features of the human brain compared to non-human primates has long intrigued humankind. The cerebellum refines motor coordination and cognitive functions, contributing to the evolutionary development of human adaptability and dexterity. To identify shared and divergent features across primates, we conducted single-nucleus transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling of the adult cerebellar cortex in humans, chimpanzees, macaques, and marmosets. We revealed human-specific transcriptomic and regulatory features, particularly those involved in synaptogenesis. Notably, we identified an enrichment of the sperm receptor zona pellucida glycoprotein 2 (ZP2) and its potential interactors, known for their roles in gamete interaction, in human granule cells. Experimental data show that ZP2 expression in human granule cells is induced by pontine mossy fibers, reducing synaptic proteins at pontocerebellar glomerular synapses, and decreasing cerebellar neuron electrophysiological activity. This unexpected co-option of ZP2 in human-specific synapse regulation provides insights into the evolutionary specialization of the human cerebellum.

">Developmental and Stress-Induced Effects on 5-HT3R-Expressing Interneurons within Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Early life stress (ELS) is a well-known predictor of neuropsychiatric disease and contributes to the development of sensory processing deficits that persist throughout life. Organisms are particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of stress during critical periods, when neuroplasticity is heightened, and initial representations of the sensory environment are mapped to cortex. When ELS is induced during the auditory cortical (ACx) critical period, it impairs both neural and behavioral responses to a variety of auditory stimuli that rely on temporal processing. Mechanisms by which ELS may alter critical period plasticity are of particular interest in understanding ELS-related pathology, including the 5-HT3R interneuron system, which has been implicated in regulating neural activity during critical periods. Here we examined two principal subpopulations of interneurons in primary ACx: VIP and NDNF cells, which account for a majority of cortical neurons expressing 5-HT3R. The expression of the Htr3a gene during normal development and under ELS conditions was quantified using multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization. We show that densities of cells expressing NDNF and VIP decrease following ear opening and across the ACx critical period, and that ELS results in the maintenance of elevated cell densities compared to age-matched controls. Further, Htr3a in VIP neurons is developmentally upregulated, and its expression is further increased by ELS beyond normal physiologic levels. Stress-induced shifts in these serotonergic interneurons may contribute to deficits that arise in auditory cortical and perceptual responses via effects on local cortical circuitry.

">A common cross-species atlas of cortical gray matter</a></h4>

              
                Comparative neuroscience requires a framework that enables consistent anatomical comparison across species with widely differing brain size, folding, and specialization. We introduce a cross-species hierarchical atlas spanning rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans, built upon population-averaged minimal deformation templates (MDTs) to ensure anatomically consistent alignment. The atlas defines homologous cortical and subcortical regions through landmark-guided boundaries and multimodal nonlinear registration. By aligning each species to its MDT and harmonizing anatomical definitions across species, the framework supports robust comparisons of brain organization at multiple levels of granularity. Validation against species-specific atlases confirmed strong regional correspondence and systematic scaling across species. Released as a freely available resource, this common atlas provides a unified coordinate system to support comparative imaging, developmental studies, and cross-species connectomics.

">Saturation, Task Error, and Feedback Timing Shape Early Implicit Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Motor adaptation is essential for maintaining coordination and precision in daily activities. Implicit motor adaptation - adaptation that occurs without conscious awareness - is thought to be primarily driven by sensory prediction errors. Here, we investigated how rapidly these unconscious changes in reaching behavior emerge as a function of error magnitude and the availability of task error signals. To this end, we employed a single-trial learning (STL) paradigm within a classical visuomotor rotation task. Participants made center-out reaching movements to either small (dot) or large (arc) targets while experiencing single perturbation trials with cursor rotations ranging from 1 to 90 deg, each followed by an aligned washout trial. By manipulating target size, we systematically modulated the presence of task error while holding sensory prediction error constant. We further compared these early implicit changes with those observed during standard prolonged adaptation to a fixed 20-deg rotation across >100 trials. Our results show that implicit adaptation emerges rapidly, even after a single exposure to small perturbations, and follows a saturating, fixed-rate response profile. Importantly, the magnitude of single-trial adaptation was greater when task error was present (small targets) compared with conditions in which only sensory prediction error was available (large targets). Moreover, STL-derived parameters moderately predicted the initial phase of adaptation during prolonged learning, suggesting that STL captures core dynamics of early implicit processes. These findings provide new insight into the mechanistic principles governing implicit motor adaptation. By identifying the parameters that drive early-stage error-based learning, this work refines current models of sensorimotor learning and highlights potential strategies for designing targeted training or rehabilitation protocols that leverage rapid adaptation processes to enhance motor performance and recovery.

">Layer-specific glutamatergic inputs and Parvalbumin interneurons modulate early life stress induced alterations in prefrontal glutamate release during fear conditioning in pre-adolescent rats</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to early life stress (ELS) can exert long-lasting impacts on emotional regulation. The corticolimbic system including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), ventral hippocampus (vHIP), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in fear learning. Using the limited bedding paradigm (LB), we examined the functional consequences of ELS on excitatory and inhibitory tone in the prelimbic (PL) mPFC after fear conditioning in rats. In adults, LB exposure enhanced in vivo glutamate release in the PL mPFC during fear conditioning in male, but not female offspring. In contrast, the glutamate response to fear conditioning was diminished in LB-exposed pre-adolescent males, but not females. We investigated whether reduced glutamatergic inputs and/or elevated inhibitory tone might contribute to the diminished glutamate response in the mPFC following LB in pre-adolescent male rats. Indeed, we found that LB exposure specifically increased the activation of PV, but not SST interneurons in layer V, but not layer II/III of the PL mPFC in fear-exposed pre-adolescent males. Presynaptic glutamate release probability was reduced by LB exposure in layer V, but increased in layer II/III of the PL mPFC. These functional changes might be related to the LB-induced alterations in the bilaminar distribution of BLA and vHIP projections to the PL mPFC we observed in pre-adolescent males. Overall, our findings suggest that ELS modifies glutamate release and PL mPFC function during fear conditioning in a sex- and age- dependent fashion, likely through layer-specific shifts in excitation/inhibition balance.

">ALCOHOL AUGMENTS SPONTANEOUS GABAERGIC TRANSMISSION AND ACTION POTENTIAL FIRING IN IMMATURE MURINE CEREBELLAR GOLGI CELLS, LEADING TO ENHANCED INHIBITORY INPUT ONTO CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELLS</a></h4>

              
                Golgi cells (GoCs) are cerebellar inhibitory interneurons that provide both phasic and tonic GABAergic input to cerebellar granule cells. They receive inhibitory control from Lugaro cells, other GoCs, and cerebellar nuclear inhibitory neurons via GABAergic and glycinergic inputs. Although fetal alcohol exposure is known to impair cerebellar function, its impact on developing GoC physiology remains unclear. We investigated the acute effects of ethanol on GABA-A receptor-mediated transmission in GoCs during the mouse equivalent of the human third trimester, a critical window for inhibitory circuit formation. To identify GoCs, we used VGAT-Venus transgenic mice, in which the vesicular GABA transporter promoter drives expression of the Venus fluorescent protein. Whole-cell patch-clamp and loose-patch recordings from postnatal day (P) 6-10 mice revealed that ethanol exposure dose-dependently increased the frequency of action potential-dependent GABA-A receptor-mediated spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs) in GoCs. While ethanol produced variable effects on GoC firing rates, it more consistently enhanced GABA-A-sPSC frequency in granule cells. We also examined expression of the K+-Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a chloride exporter whose developmental upregulation drives the shift in GABAA receptor signaling from excitatory to inhibitory. Immunohistochemical analysis at P6 showed that GoCs express low levels of KCC2, suggesting that GABA-A receptor-mediated currents may remain depolarizing in a subset of GoCs. This property could contribute to ethanol-induced disruption of cerebellar circuit maturation. Together, these findings provide new insight into the cellular mechanisms by which ethanol perturbs inhibitory circuit development in the cerebellum.

                <p>The corticospinal tract (CST) facilitates skilled, precise movements, which necessitates that subcerebral projection neurons (SCPNs) establish segmentally specific connectivity with brainstem and spinal circuits. Developmental molecular delineation enables prospective identification of corticospinal neurons (CSNs) projecting to thoraco-lumbar spinal segments; however, it remains unclear whether other SCPN subpopulations in developing sensorimotor cortex can be prospectively identified in this manner. Such molecular tools could enable investigations of SCPN circuitry with precision and specificity. During development, Kelch-like 14 (<I>Klhl14</I>) is specifically expressed by a specific SCPN subpopulation, CSN<SUB>BC-lat</SUB>, that reside in lateral sensorimotor cortex with axonal projections exclusively to bulbar-cervical targets. In this study, we generated Klhl14-T2A-Cre knock-in mice to investigate SCPN that are <I>Klhl14+</I> during development into maturity. Using conditional anterograde and retrograde labeling in mice of either sex, we find that Klhl14-Cre is specifically expressed by CSN<SUB>BC-lat</SUB> only at specific developmental time points. We establish conditional viral labeling in Klhl14-T2A-Cre mice as a new approach to reliably investigate CSN<SUB>BC-lat</SUB> axon targeting and confirm that this identifies known molecular regulators of CSN axon targeting. Therefore, Klhl14-T2A-Cre mice can be used as a novel tool for identifying molecular regulators of CST axon guidance in a relatively high-throughput manner in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that intersectional viral labeling enables precise targeting of only Klhl14-Cre+ CSN<SUB>BC-lat</SUB> in the adult central nervous system. Together, our results establish that developmental molecular delineation of SCPN subpopulations can be used to selectively and specifically investigate their development, as well as anatomical and functional organization into maturity.</p>

                <p>by Peng Tao, Yunda Si, Jie Xia, Yi Xiao</p>

The divergence in folding pathways between RNA co-transcriptional folding (CTF) and free folding (FF) is crucial for understanding dynamic functional regulation of RNAs. Here, we developed a simplified all-atom molecular dynamics framework to systematically compare the folding kinetics of an RNA hairpin (PDB:1ZIH) under CTF and FF conditions. By analyzing over 800 microseconds of simulated trajectory, we found that despite convergence to identical native conformations across CTF simulations (with varied transcription rates) and FF simulations, they exhibit distinct preferences for the folding pathways defined by the order of base-pair formation. Conformational space analysis shows that CTF biases the folding pathway by adopting more compact conformations than FF. Our findings provide atomic-scale insights into how temporal-spatial coupling of transcription and folding diversifies RNA folding dynamics.

Understanding acute infectious disease dynamics at individual and population levels is critical for informing public health preparedness and response. Serological assays, which measure a range of biomarkers relating to humoral immunity, can provide a valuable window into immune responses generated by past infections and vaccinations. However, traditional methods for interpreting serological data, such as binary seropositivity and seroconversion thresholds, often rely on heuristics that fail to account for individual variability in antibody kinetics and timing of infection, potentially leading to biased estimates of infection rates and post-exposure immune responses. To address these limitations, we developed <i>serojump</i>, a novel probabilistic framework and software package that uses individual-level serological data to infer infection status, timing, and subsequent antibody kinetics. We validated <i>serojump</i> using simulated serological data and real-world SARS-CoV-2 datasets from The Gambia. In simulation studies, the model accurately recovered individual infection status, population-level antibody kinetics, and the relationship between biomarkers and immunity against infection, demonstrating robustness under observational noise. Benchmarking against standard serological heuristics in real-world data revealed that <i>serojump</i> achieves higher sensitivity in identifying infections, outperforming static threshold-based methods and precision in inferred infection timing. Application of <i>serojump</i> to longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 serological data taken during the Delta wave provided additional insights into i) missed infections based on sub-threshold rises in antibody level and ii) antibody responses to multiple biomarkers post-vaccination and infection. Our findings highlight the utility of <i>serojump</i> as a pathogen-agnostic, flexible tool for serological inference, enabling deeper insights into infection dynamics, immune responses, and correlates of protection. The open-source framework offers researchers a platform for extracting information from serological datasets, with potential applications across various infectious diseases and study designs.

Understanding cerebral circulation is crucial for early diagnosis and patient-oriented therapies for brain conditions. However, blood flow simulations at the organ scale have been limited. This work introduces a framework for modeling extensive vascular networks in the human cerebral cortex and conducting pulsatile blood flow simulations. Using a patient-specific cerebral geometry, we applied a parallelized adaptive constrained constructive optimization algorithm to create a comprehensive pial vascular network in the left hemisphere, starting from the main cerebral arteries. The resulting network included over 75 000, 103 000, and 55 000 vessels for the anterior, middle, and posterior territories, respectively. Pial vessel diameters featured a median [interquartile range, IQR] value of 62.8[49.3,89.3]μm. We integrated the pial vascular network model with the Anatomically-Detailed Arterial Network (ADAN) model to conduct one-dimensional (1D) blood flow simulations under normotensive and hypertensive conditions. Viscoelastic dissipation proved to be a key ingredient in the characterization of the hemodynamic environments in the pial circulation. In the normotensive scenario, mean blood pressure in the pial vessels resulted in a median [IQR] value of 56.7[49.8,63.5]mmHg. The flow pulsatility index and its corresponding damping factor were effective descriptors of the hypertensive state. The median [IQR] pulsatility index in the normotensive state was 0.39[0.38,0.40], and in hypertension it increased up to 0.84[0.83,0.85], while its corresponding damping factor in the normotensive state was 2.07[1.78,2.48], and in the hypertensive state it was reduced to 1.20[1.16,1.39]. We observed large regional pressure gradients in terminal vessels, with pressure levels ranging from 50mmHg in normotension to 70mmHg in hypertension. Additionally, the pulsatility index at terminal vessels increased with distance from the Circle of Willis in the hypertensive case, contrasting with the decreasing pattern seen in normotension. This approach provides a unique characterization of hemodynamics in the pial vascular network of the human cerebral cortex, paving the way for research into microcirculatory environments, the link between hemodynamics and neural function, and their roles in conditions like stroke and dementia.

                <p>by Mintu Nandi, Shashank Shekhar, Sandeep Choubey</p>

The length of actin filaments is regulated by the combined action of hundreds of actin-binding proteins. While the roles of individual proteins are well understood, how they combine to regulate actin dynamics <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear. Recent advances in microscopy have enabled precise, high-throughput measurements of filament lengths over time. However, the absence of a unified theoretical framework has hindered a mechanistic understanding of the multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics. To address this, we propose a general kinetic model that incorporates the combined effects of an arbitrary number of regulatory proteins on actin dynamics. We derive exact closed-form expressions for the moments of (1) the distribution of filament lengths over time and (2) the long-time distribution of changes in filament lengths within a fixed time window. We show that these moments allow us to distinguish between different regulatory mechanisms of multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics. Our theoretical framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting existing data and guiding future experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013427">An efficient and flexible framework for inferring global sensitivity of agent-based model parameters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel R. Bergman, Trachette Jackson, Harsh Vardhan Jain, Kerri-Ann Norton</p>

Agent-based models (ABMs) have become essential tools for simulating complex biological, ecological, and social systems where emergent behaviors arise from the interactions among individual agents. Quantifying uncertainty through global sensitivity analysis is crucial for assessing the robustness and reliability of ABM predictions. However, most global sensitivity methods demand substantial computational resources, making them impractical for highly complex models. Here, we introduce SMoRe GloS (Surrogate Modeling for Recapitulating Global Sensitivity), a novel, computationally efficient method for performing global sensitivity analysis of ABMs. By leveraging explicitly formulated surrogate models, SMoRe GloS allows for comprehensive parameter space exploration and uncertainty quantification without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate our method’s flexibility by applying it to two biological ABMs: a simple 2D <i>in vitro</i> cell proliferation model and a complex 3D vascular tumor growth model. Our results show that SMoRe GloS is compatible with simpler methods like the Morris one-at-a-time method, and more computationally intensive variance-based methods like eFAST. SMoRe GloS accurately recovered global sensitivity indices in each case while achieving substantial speedups, completing analyses in minutes. In contrast, direct implementation of eFAST amounted to several days of CPU time for the complex ABM. Remarkably, our method also estimates sensitivities for ABM parameters representing processes not explicitly included in the surrogate model, further enhancing its utility. By making global sensitivity analysis feasible for computationally expensive models, SMoRe GloS opens up new opportunities for uncertainty quantification in complex systems, allowing for more in depth exploration of model behavior, thereby increasing confidence in model predictions.

                <p>by Lucy Goodfellow, Carl A. B. Pearson, Simon R. Procter</p>

Compartmental infectious disease models are used to calculate disease transmission, estimate underlying rates, forecast future burden, and compare benefits across intervention scenarios. These models aggregate individuals into compartments, often stratified by characteristics to represent groups that might be intervention targets or otherwise of particular concern. Ideally, model calculation could occur at the most demanding resolution for the overall analysis, but this may be infeasible due to availability of computational resources or empirical data. Instead, detailed population age structure might be consolidated into broad categories such as children, working-age adults, and seniors. Researchers must then discretise key epidemic parameters, like the infection-fatality ratio, for these lower resolution groups. After estimating outcomes for those crude groups, follow-on analyses, such as calculating years of life lost (YLLs), may need to distribute or weight those low-resolution outcomes back to the high resolution. The specific calculation for these aggregation and disaggregation steps can substantially influence outcomes. To assist researchers with these tasks, we developed <i>paramix</i>, an R package which simplifies the transformations between high and low resolution. We demonstrate applying <i>paramix</i> to a common discretisation analysis: using age structured models for health economic calculations comparing YLLs. We compare how estimates vary between <i>paramix</i> and several alternatives for an archetypal model, including comparison to a high resolution benchmark. We consistently found that <i>paramix</i> yielded the most similar estimates to the high-resolution model, for the same computational burden of low-resolution models. In our illustrative analysis, the non-<i>paramix</i> methods estimated up to twice as many YLLs averted as the <i>paramix</i> approach, which would likely lead to a similarly large impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios used in economic evaluations.

                <p>by Maxime Calka, Pierre Badin, Mohammad Ali Nazari, Michel Rochette, Pascal Perrier, Yohan Payan</p>

<i>Background and objectives:</i> We present a new Finite Element (FE) tongue model that was designed to precisely account for 3D tongue shapes produced during isolated French speech sounds by a male individual (RS). Such a high degree of realism will enable scientists to precisely and quantitatively assess, in a speaker-specific manner, hypotheses about speech motor control and the impact of tongue anatomy, muscle arrangements, and tongue dynamics in this context.
<i>Methods:</i> The shape and topology of the FE model were generated from 3D high resolution orofacial MR images of RS having his tongue in “neutral” posture. Mesh density was determined with convergence and mesh quality analyses. In a first step, muscle anatomy in the tongue was determined based on existing literature, and, in a second step, it was refined and evaluated by comparing actual and simulated 3D tongue shapes for various French speech sounds.
<i>Results:</i> Results are twofold. Firstly, a functional organization of the Genioglossus muscle into 4 parts is proposed which, on the one hand, is compatible with anatomical observations of the human tongue, and, on the other hand, goes beyond this anatomical account to faithfully reproduce the 3D tongue shape observed for RS in vowel /i/. Secondly, the realism of this implementation is demonstrated by the good match obtained for other isolated French sounds between actual and simulated tongue shapes. These simulations also inform us about the recruitment of tongue muscles for the main French speech sounds. Recruitment patterns are consistent with findings from the literature including both EMG measurements and model-based simulations.
<i>Conclusion:</i> The new model is made freely available, along with the data. Combined with mathematical tools that transform the tongue model cloning RS tongue into other models that account for the morphology of various individuals, the model can be a powerful tool to investigate healthy and pathological speech from various perspectives.

                <p>by Ben Kawam, Julia Ostner, Richard McElreath, Oliver Schülke, Daniel Redhead</p>

A major goal of behavioural ecology is to explain how phenotypic and ecological factors shape the networks of social relationships that animals form with one another. This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood—and addressed—as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our <i>estimands</i>. Second, we develop <i>estimators</i> for these effects—namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal <i>estimates</i> from the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.

                <p>by Marco Saltini, Eva E. Deinum</p>

Many plant cell functions, including cell morphogenesis and anisotropic growth, rely on the self-organisation of cortical microtubules into aligned arrays with the correct orientation. An important ongoing debate is how cell geometry, wall mechanical stresses, and other internal and external cues are integrated to determine the orientation of the cortical array. Here, we demonstrate that microtubule-based nucleation can markedly shift the balance between these often competing directional cues. For this, we developed a novel, more realistic model for microtubule-based nucleation in the simulation platform CorticalSim, which avoids the longstanding inhomogeneity problem stemming from previous, less realistic models for microtubule-based nucleation. We show that microtubule-based nucleation increases the sensitivity of the array to cell geometry, and extends the regime of spontaneous alignment compared to isotropic nucleation. In the case of cylindrical cell shapes, we show that this translates into a strong tendency to align in the transverse direction rather than along the vertical axis, and this is robust against small directional cues favouring the longitudinal direction. Comparing various cylinders and boxes, we show that different nucleation mechanisms result in different preferred array orientations, with the largest differences on cylinders. Our model provides a powerful tool for investigating how plant cells integrate multiple biases to orient their cortical arrays, offering new insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying cell shape and growth.

                <p>by Ricardo Roopnarinesingh, Neel D. Jani, Michelle Leppert, Debanjan Mukherjee</p>

Deciphering the source of an embolism is a common challenge encountered in stroke treatment. Carotid stenosis is a key source of embolic strokes. Carotid interventions can be indicated when a patient has greater than 50% stenosis in the carotid ipsilateral to the cerebral infarction, which is designated as the symptomatic carotid. However, there are often significant number of cases where carotid emboli travel contralaterally leading to ambiguity regarding which carotid is symptomatic. We use a patient-specific computational embolus-hemodynamics interaction model developed in prior works to conduct an in silico experiment spanning 30 heart-to-brain arterial models with differing combinations of bilateral severe and mild stenosis degrees. We used these models to study source-to-destination transport of thromboemboli released from left/right carotid disease sites, and cardiogenic sources. Across all cases considered, thromboemboli from left and right carotid sources showed non-zero contralateral transport. We also found that cardiogenic thromboemboli do not have an altered hemisphere distribution or distinct transport preference dependent on stenosis degree, thus potentially making the underlying etiology more cryptic. In patients with carotid stenosis or chronic occlusion ipsilateral to the area affected by stroke, we have demonstrated that the presence of contralateral stenosis can cause emboli that travel across the Circle of Willis (CoW) which can potentially lead to ambiguity when deciding which carotid is truly symptomatic.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.

Inter-laboratory replicability is crucial yet challenging in microbiome research. Leveraging microbiomes to promote soil health and plant growth requires understanding underlying molecular mechanisms using reproducible experimental systems. In a global collaborative effort involving five laboratories, we aimed to help advance reproducibility in microbiome studies by testing our ability to replicate synthetic community assembly experiments. Our study compared fabricated ecosystems constructed using two different synthetic bacterial communities, the model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, and sterile EcoFAB 2.0 devices. All participating laboratories observed consistent inoculum-dependent changes in plant phenotype, root exudate composition, and final bacterial community structure, where <i>Paraburkholderia</i> sp. OAS925 could dramatically shift microbiome composition. Comparative genomics and exudate utilization linked the pH-dependent colonization ability of <i>Paraburkholderia</i>, which was further confirmed with motility assays. The study provides detailed protocols, benchmarking datasets, and best practices to help advance replicable science and inform future multi-laboratory reproducibility studies.

Investigating social and independent behavior structure in early life is critical for understanding development and brain maturation in social mammals. However, this investigation necessitates monitoring animals over weeks to months often with subsecond time resolution creating challenges for both lab studies focused on brief observation periods and field studies in which animal tracking can be imprecise. Here we used machine vision and two-week long continuous behavior recordings of families of gerbils, a highly social rodent, in large, undisturbed home environments to quantify the behavioral development of individual pups. We discovered that individual pups exhibited complex social behaviors from the first day they left the nest including a preference for interactions with siblings over parents. Critically, independent behaviors such as foraging for food and water emerged several days later, each with a stereotyped temporal trajectory. Analysis of individual animal development confirmed the quality of our tracking methods and the stability and distinctness of each behavioral measure. Our work supports a model in which early and sustained social interactions may be supportive of solitary exploration for physiological needs. This model suggests that understanding the development of behavioral independence as well as maturation of sensory and motor systems in social rodents such as gerbils may require integration of social behavioral knowledge earlier than typically considered.

                <p>by Sallieu Jalloh, Ivy K. Hughes, Hisashi Akiyama, Aldana D. Gojanovich, Andres A. Quiñones-Molina, Mengwei Yang, Andrew J. Henderson, Gustavo Mostoslavsky, Suryaram Gummuluru</p>

Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy in suppressing plasma viremia in people living with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), persistent viral RNA expression in tissue reservoirs is observed and can contribute to HIV-1-induced immunopathology and comorbidities. Infection of long-lived innate immune cells, such as tissue-resident macrophages and microglia may contribute to persistent viral RNA production and chronic inflammation. We recently reported that de novo cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA) in macrophages and microglia leads to MDA5 and MAVS-dependent innate immune sensing and induction of type I IFN responses, demonstrating that HIV icRNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this report, we show that cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 icRNA also induces NLRP1 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages and microglia in an RLR- and endosomal TLR-independent manner. Infection of both macrophages and microglia with either replication-competent or single-cycle HIV-1 induced IL-1β secretion, which was attenuated when cytoplasmic expression of viral icRNA was prevented. While IL-1β secretion was blocked by treatment with caspase-1 inhibitors or knockdown of NLRP1 or caspase-1 expression in HIV-infected macrophages, overexpression of NLRP1 significantly enhanced IL-1β secretion in an HIV-icRNA-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed interaction of HIV-1 icRNA, but not multiply-spliced HIV-1 RNA, with NLRP1, suggesting that HIV-1 icRNA sensing by NLRP1 is sufficient to trigger inflammasome activation. Together, these findings reveal a pathway of NLRP1 inflammasome activation induced by de novo expressed HIV icRNA in HIV-infected myeloid cells.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Our understanding of how the medial temporal lobe (MTL) contributes to human cognition has advanced enormously over the past half a century. My work in the 1990s characterizing the role of recollection and familiarity processes in episodic memory led me to study the MTL's role in these two memory processes. In the current paper, I provide a personal commentary in which I describe the motivating ideas, as well as the invaluable impact of mentors, colleagues, and students that led to a series of studies showing that conscious recollection is critically dependent on the hippocampus, whereas familiarity-based judgments are dependent on regions such as the perirhinal cortex.</p>

                Using a well-defined model of direct conversion, Lende-Dorn et al. demonstrate that an optimal “Goldilocks” level of MAPK signaling efficiently drives cell-fate programming. Chemogenetic tuning of MAPK activity balances proliferation and transcription factor levels to support high rates of conversion to motor neurons.

                Virlogeux et al. identify and validate a neural population code for touch in the gracile nucleus (GrN) that is altered by inflammation and neuropathic injury. Transmission of this altered neural population code to the thalamus by somatostatin-expressing neurons in the GrN is required for the expression of mechanical allodynia.

                Liang et al. reveal that the G protein γ subunit GGC1 was under selection during tomato domestication. GGC1 negatively regulates plant vigor by inhibiting CPK28-mediated phosphorylation of PIP1;2, offering a novel target for high-yield crop breeding with enhanced CO2 assimilation and photosynthetic efficiency.

                Zhou et al. show that BBX10 promotes greening during de-etiolation in Arabidopsis. BBX10 interacts with PIF1 to form a transcriptional module that regulates GUN5 and APX2 expression, thereby inhibiting protochlorophyllide biosynthesis in darkness and suppressing ROS accumulation upon light exposure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105895">Atomistic simulation of voltage activation of a truncated BK channel</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-dependence gating of ion channels underlies numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, and disruption of normal voltage gating is the cause of many channelopathies. Here, long timescale atomistic simulations were performed to directly probe voltage-induced gating transitions of the big potassium (BK) channels, where the voltage sensor domain (VSD) movement has been suggested to be distinct from that of canonical Kv channels but remains poorly understood. Using a Core-MT construct without the gating ring, multiple voltage activation transitions were observed at 750 mV, allowing detailed analysis of the activated state of BK VSD and key mechanistic features. Even though the S4 helix remains the principal voltage sensor in BK, its vertical displacement is only ~3 Å and accompanied by significant lateral movements. The nature of the predicted VSD movement is in strong agreement with recent Cryo-EM structural studies of mutant BK channels with constitutively activated VSD. Free energy analysis based on the predicted activation transition yielded a total gating charge of 0.44 <i>e</i> per VSD, consistent with the experimental range of 0.48–0.65 <i>e</i>. We further show that the ability of modest physical movements with a small total gating charge to drive effective voltage gating of BK can be attributed to large gradients in the local electric field as reshaped by the protein. Furthermore, the S4 movement is coupled to the pore opening through a non-canonical pathway that involves the tightly packed S4-S5-S6 interface. These distinct mechanistic features may be relevant to voltage gating of other ion channels where VSDs are not domain-swapped with respect to the pore-gate domain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104138">Aurora kinase A promotes trained immunity via regulation of endogenous S-adenosylmethionine metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Innate immune cells can acquire a memory phenotype, termed trained immunity, but the mechanism underlying the regulation of trained immunity remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora kinase A (AurA) dampens trained immunity induced by β-glucan. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis reveal that AurA inhibition restricts chromatin accessibility of genes associated with inflammatory pathways such as JAK-STAT, TNF, and NF-κB pathways. Specifically, AurA inhibition promotes nuclear localization of FOXO3 and the expression of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a key enzyme responsible for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption. Metabolomic analysis confirms a reduction in SAM level upon AurA inhibition. As a result of SAM deficiency, trained mouse macrophages exhibit decreased H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on gene regions of <i>Il6 and Tnf</i>. Additionally, the tumor inhibition effect of β-glucan is notably abolished by AurA inhibition. Together, our findings identify an essential role of AurA in regulating trained immunity via a methylation-dependent manner by maintaining endogenous SAM levels through the mTOR-FOXO3-GNMT axis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101717">Sld3CBD–Cdc45 structural insights into Cdc45 recruitment for CMG complex formation during DNA replication</a></h4>

              
                DNA replication requires recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS into the MCM double hexamer by initiation factors to form an active helicase, the Cdc45–MCM–GINS (CMG) complex, at the replication origins. The initiation factor Sld3 is a central regulator of Cdc45 and GINS recruitment, working with Sld7 together. However, the mechanism through which Sld3 regulates CMG complex formation remains unclear. Here, we present the structure of the Sld3 Cdc45-binding domain in complex with Cdc45 (Sld3CBD–Cdc45), showing detailed interactions and conformational changes required for binding to each other. The mutant analysis indicated that the binding between Sld3CBD and Cdc45 could be broken easily. We also revealed that Sld3CBD, GINS, and MCM bind to different sites on Cdc45 in the Sld3CBD–CMG model, indicating that after recruitment of Cdc45, Sld7–Sld3 could remain in Cdc45–MCM until CMG formation. The consistency between the particle size of Sld7–Sld3–Cdc45 and the distance between Sld3CBDs in the Cdc45–MCM dimer indicated the binding manner of the Cdc45–Sld3–[Sld7]<sub>2</sub>–Sld3–Cdc45 off/on MCM double hexamer. A DNA-binding assay of Sld3 and its complexes with single-stranded ARS1 (autonomously replicating sequence 1) fragments revealed a relationship between the dissociation of Sld7–Sld3 from CMG and the unwound single-stranded DNA. These findings help to further our understanding of the molecular basis of the regulation of CMG complex formation by Sld3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104041">Preparatory attentional templates in prefrontal and sensory cortex encode target-associated information</a></h4>

              
                Visual search relies on the ability to use information about the target in working memory to guide attention and make target-match decisions. The ‘attentional’ or ‘target’ template is thought to be encoded within an inferior frontal junction (IFJ)-visual attentional network. While this template typically contains veridical target features, behavioral studies have shown that target-associated information, such as statistically co-occurring object pairs, can also guide attention. However, preparatory activation of associated information within the IFJ-visual attentional network has never been demonstrated. We used fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to test if target-associated information is explicitly represented in advance of visual search. Participants learned four face-scene category pairings and then completed a cued visual search task for a face. Face information was decoded in the fusiform face area, superior parietal lobule, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the cue period, but was absent during the delay period. In contrast, associated scene information was decoded in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the cue period, and most importantly, in the IFJ and the parahippocampal place area during the delay period. These results are a novel demonstration of how target-associated information from memory can supplant the veridical target in the brain’s ‘target template’ in anticipation of difficult visual search.

">An Innate Immune Receptor Toll-1 converts chronic light stress into glial phagocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress can cause progressive neuronal degeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms linking stress sensing to neuroimmune responses remain elusive. In this study, a Drosophila model of chronic light-induced stress, we show that photoreceptor neurons accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exhibit Toll-1 activation, in association with Spz ligands and receptor endocytosis. Toll-1 activation in neurons promotes axonal degeneration by inducing expression of the glial phagocytic receptor Draper (Drpr), leading to the engulfment of stressed axons. Genetic interaction analyses indicate that Toll-1 functions upstream of Drpr in a stress-responsive signaling cascade. Importantly, blocking either Toll-1 or Drpr attenuates axon loss under light stress, highlighting their essential roles. Our findings reveal a neuron-glia communication axis in which neuronal innate immune signaling instructs glial phagocytosis, converting sustained environmental stress into structural degeneration. This study provides a mechanistic framework for sterile neurodegeneration and offers insights into how immune receptors regulate nervous system integrity under non-infectious conditions.

">Modeling neurodegenerative diseases in Drosophila is conditioned by stress resistance and gut microbiome composition of the reference line</a></h4>

              
                Drosophila is widely used to study the pathological mechanisms of human diseases in vivo, including metabolic and neurological disorders. In these models, disease-induced alterations in locomotion and stress resistance are generally monitored in comparison to healthy control flies, such the white-eyed strain w1118, used as a reference for normal physiology and behavior. Here we compared two independent w1118 lines and found that they differed strikingly in their susceptibility to oxidative stress and nutrient starvation, and less markedly in their locomotor performance. Interestingly, modulating the gut microbiome by rearing these flies under axenic conditions increased oxidative stress resistance of the more susceptible, but not the more resistant line, while it had no effect on starvation resistance for both lines. We also found that the stress-sensitive line had higher levels of Clostridiales bacteria and of the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia in the gut microbiota, as well as lower expression levels of immune effectors (antimicrobial peptides and lysozymes) in the head and gut. Both lines nevertheless showed similar susceptibility to pathogenic bacterial infections. In a transgenic Parkinson's disease model, the stress-resistant background strongly attenuated the progressive locomotor defects induced by pan-neuronal expression of human mutant -synuclein, but intriguingly not when -synuclein expression was restricted to a subset of brain dopaminergic neurons in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster. These results suggest that taking into account unapparent features of the reference lines could improve the reproducibility and consistency of neurodegenerative disease models in Drosophila.

                We present the first release of p-HCP (Prenatal Human Connectome Patterns), an imaging dataset of human fetal brain development covering the second half of gestation. This dataset was acquired ex vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra high field (11.7~teslas), and includes whole-hemisphere T2-weighted images at 100 {micro}m isotropic resolution, quantitative relaxometry (T1, T2, and T2*), and high angular resolution diffusion-weighted images for multiple b-values at 200 {micro}m. Brains larger than the workspace of the small-bore scanner were sectioned into blocks, acquired blockwise, and digitally reconstructed using a dedicated semi-automatic method. This initial data release includes three gestational ages (18, 27, and 31 post-conceptional weeks) with a complete set of anatomical images, relaxometry maps, and diffusion-based microstructure measurements. This dataset offers new opportunities to investigate neurodevelopmental processes that have not yet been explored with full three-dimensional coverage at this resolution by MRI, and may serve as a multimodal mesoscopic reference template for the fetal brain.

">REST/NRSF phosphorylation by CaMKIV regulates its transcriptional repressor activity and half-life</a></h4>

              
                REST is a repressor of a large cluster of neural genes containing RE1 motifs. In neurons, REST homeostatically regulates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, However, whether REST can be regulated by Ca2+ and Ca2+-activated kinases is unknown. Here, we investigated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) as upstream regulators of REST fate and activity. We show that REST is phosphorylated by CaMKIV at a main Ser-322 site located within the linker between the 5th and the 6th N-terminal Zn-finger domains. Phosphomimic REST mutant in Serine-322 decreased REST repressor activity and caused its transition from nucleus to cytosol, followed by degradation. Molecular dynamics simulations of the phosphomimic N-terminal REST and the DNA RE1 sequence revealed a sharp decrease in the stability of the REST-RE1 binding interface. Moreover, the homeostatic effects of CaMKIV on the amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents were inhibited by the genetic deletion of REST. The results demonstrate that REST phosphorylation by CaMKIV regulates the repressor activity of REST on neural genes and has a crucial role in the homeostatic regulation of REST levels.

">Inhibition of autophagy-lysosomal function exacerbates microglial and monocyte lipid metabolism reprograming and dysfunction after brain injury</a></h4>

              
                CNS has an overall higher level of lipids than all tissues except adipose and contains up to 25% of total body cholesterol. Recent data demonstrate a complex crosstalk between lipid metabolism and inflammation, suggesting potential contribution of the lipid-rich brain environment to neuroinflammation. While recent data support the importance of brain lipid environment to inflammatory changes observed in age related chronic neurodegenerative diseases, in vivo interactions between lipid environment, lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation in acute brain disease and injury remain poorly understood. Here we utilize a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to demonstrate that acute neurotrauma leads to widespread lipid metabolism reprograming in all microglial and brain associated and infiltrating monocyte populations. Additionally, we identify unique microglial and monocyte populations with higher degree of lipid metabolism reprograming and pronounced accumulation of neutral storage lipids, including cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. These lipids accumulate not only in lipid droplets but also in the microglial and monocyte lysosomes and are associated with lysosomal dysfunction and inhibition of autophagy after TBI. Our data indicate that lipid accumulation in these cells is the result of altered lipid handling rather than lipid synthesis and is triggered by phagocytosis of lipid-rich myelin debris generated after TBI. Finally, we use mice with autophagy defects in microglia and monocytes to demonstrate that further inhibition of autophagy leads to more pronounced lipid metabolism reprograming and exacerbated cellular lipid accumulation. Our data suggest a pathological feedback loop, where lipid phagocytosis causes inhibition of autophagy-lysosomal function, which in turn exacerbates cellular lipid retention, reprograming and inflammation.

">Adaptation of Perceived Animacy from Biological Motion: Evidence for a "Life Motion Detector"</a></h4>

              
                Humans can readily perceive animacy from biological motion (BM) - the distinctive movement patterns of living entities. However, how the human brain extracts animacy information from BM remains largely unclear. The current study investigated this issue using visual adaptation, a non-invasive tool for revealing neural mechanisms underlying the selective processing of specific properties. Results showed that prolonged exposure to intact human walkers, compared to non-BM adaptors, biased the perception of subsequent walking stimuli towards less animate. This adaptation aftereffect persisted following adaptation to local foot motions carrying diagnostic kinematic cues, but was absent after exposure to static body forms, indicating the involvement of neuronal populations encoding animacy from BM based on motion signals. Moreover, adapting to pigeon movements also biased animacy perception for human motions, revealing a shared mechanism for encoding animacy from cross-species BM signals. These results support the existence of an inherent "life detection" system in the human brain, attuned to local foot motions and kinematic features prevalent in vertebrate movements, which may lay a foundation for perceiving life from motion across terrestrial species.

">Functional connectivity is linked to symbolic BOLD patterns: replication, extension, and clinical application of the human 'complexome'</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) quantifies the temporal coherence of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across brain regions. Recently, the information-theoretic "complexome" framework has linked FC to coinciding 'complexity drops': transient moments in which regional BOLD signals simultaneously become regular. Here, we replicate this relationship in an independent dataset and extend the framework by (i) integrating it with signal cofluctuation analysis through edge-timeseries, (ii) extending the previous binary concept of simultaneous complexity drops to a continuous, threshold-free calculation, (iii) providing evidence of clinical relevance in the model disease of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis, and (iv) deriving a novel measure of pairwise dissimilarity in local BOLD patterns. This 'index of pattern incongruency' (IPI) explains clinically relevant FC reductions and maps onto novel associations with cognition. These findings show that global FC is closely related to local patterns within underlying BOLD signals, strengthening the link between complexity dynamics and the brain's functional organization as a large-scale network.

">Spatial layout of visual specialization is shaped by competing default mode and sensory networks</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain encodes information started with a map but turned into a maze: paths multiplied; boundaries blurred. Neurons tuned to specific features are not confined to single regions, but distributed across the cortex. Retinotopy, once thought limited to early visual areas, now appears in over 20 cortical regions, from the tip of the occipital cortex to the shore of the lateral frontal cortex. To describe and understand these complex mosaics of functional specialization, we focus on the spatial influences that shape their emergence across the cortical sheet. To this end, we developed Spatial Component Decomposition (SCD), a sparse dictionary learning framework that locates sources of spatial influence without relying on prior assumptions from systems neuroscience. Applied to MRI data capturing retinotopic maps, SCD reveals a dominant linear gradient extending over 60 mm from V1 and covering all the known posterior visual areas. Yet, it also revealed systematic competition from other primary sensory areas and default mode transmodal hubs. These suppressive influences shape the cortical embedding of visual information, even during purely visual tasks. Our results suggest that functional specialization emerges from spatial competition between representational systems, not just from feedforward inputs.

">Distortion rules: audibility creation in the mosquito ear</a></h4>

              
                Hearing begins when ears convert sound into neuronal excitation. The hearing organs of male Anopheles mosquitoes rank amongst the most sensitive ears evolved. Males use them to detect faint female flight tones within noisy mating swarms, but female flight tones largely lie above the male's hearing range. We report a mechanism by which inaudible higher-frequency primary tones become audible through intrinsically generated, lower-frequency distortion tones. Distortion-evoked responses show ~10-times greater sensitivity and 45% higher temporal precision than those of same-frequency primary tones. Moreover, self-sustained oscillations of the male's ear dramatically reshape auditory frequency tuning and neuronal recruitment. By one mechanism, mosquito ears thus create audible signals and isolate these from the most salient frequencies of background noise. In audiology, distortions are used for diagnostics; their biological relevance, however, is unknown. Our results suggest that distortions are not mere by-products of the auditory process, but integral to its signaling logic.

">A Novel Mechanism for Tauopathy in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: Excitotoxic Misplacement of a Mitochondrial Anchor into Dendrites Driven by Tau-hyperphosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                On April 2nd, 2025, the FDA approved a Fast Track Designation for Biogen to use Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASO) to treat tauopathy in clinical trials for Alzheimer Disease (AD) to meet an unmet medical need [1]. For Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there is a similar unmet medical need regarding tauopathy when MS transitions into the late, or Progressive MS that is currently incurable. AD and MS share commonality: there is comorbidity between AD and MS [2], and the recent awareness that progressive MS may be considered a secondary tauopathy [3]. This study lays the basic science foundation for a future repurposing of ASO tauopathy therapy from AD to MS. The central hypothesis is that in Progressive MS, tauopathy is not a passive bystander but an active contributor to synaptic degeneration through a novel toxic target known as DSI (Dendritic Syntaphilin Intrusion) discovered in our laboratory. In this hypothesis, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2B activates Tau hyperphosphorylation (p-Tau), leading to the mislocalization or intrusion of a mitochondrial anchor SNPH into neuronal dendrites (DSI). This causes mitochondrial damage and subsequent synapse/dendrite disintegration. In support of this hypothesis that tauopathy is a key driver of DSI, we demonstrated using primary neuronal cultures that inhibitors of p-Tau kinases and Tau-KO both completely abolish DSI. We propose that a therapy for Progressive MS is repurpose the existing FDA-approved ASO Tau knockdown therapy from AD to treat MS.

">NERV: A Comprehensive Framework for Rapid, Reproducible, and Hardware-Synchronized Neuroscience Experiment Design and Execution</a></h4>

              
                Background: Behavioral neuroscience experiments require precise stimulus control, millisecond timing, hardware integration, and robust data provenance. Increasing use of 3D environments and multimodal recordings adds challenges for development, accessibility, and reproducibility. Fragmented tools often separate presentation, synchronization, and logging, leading to inefficiencies. New Method: The Neuroscience Experimental Runtime by Vanderbilt (NERV) is a Unity-based framework that unifies experiment design, execution, and data logging. It enables rapid, no-code prototyping by automating scene and script generation, event timing, state management, hardware-synchronized data acquisition, and archival of code and experimental configurations. The modular, open-source framework implements a "low floor, high ceiling" design that lowers barriers for non-programmers while remaining extensible for advanced customization. Results: Across 500 trials, Unity-to-TTL delay was 2.10 +/- 1.21 ms, TTL-to-photodiode delay was 28.93 +/- 0.76 ms, and Unity-to-screen delay was 31.04 +/- 1.41 ms. These results confirm stable millisecond precision and frame-locked timing, enabling reliable alignment of neural, behavioral, and visual events. Comparison with existing methods: Existing frameworks involve trade-offs. Some achieve precise timing but require advanced coding, while others improve accessibility but struggle with hardware or 3D graphics. Commercial platforms offer polish yet remain costly, closed-source, and inflexible. NERV combines millisecond precision, modular open-source design, and provenance in a single platform, reducing workflow fragmentation and enabling reproducible, scalable experiments. Conclusion: NERV is an accessible yet extensible framework that unites rapid development, robust data provenance, and millisecond precision. It accelerates development, ensures reproducibility, and establishes a scalable foundation for next-generation neuroscience research.

">Immersive NREM dreaming preserves subjective sleep depth against declining sleep pressure</a></h4>

              
                Perceived sleep depth is a key determinant of subjective sleep quality, traditionally thought to reflect unconsciousness and reduced cortical activation. Here, we combined high-density EEG with a serial awakening paradigm during NREM sleep to examine its neural and experiential correlates. As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness. These results challenge the view that deep sleep stems solely from reduced brain activity and suggest that immersive dreaming sustains perceived sleep depth as homeostatic pressure wanes.

                We introduce the Simulated Environment for Neurocognitive State Evaluation (SENSE-42), a multimodal dataset collected during user interactions with desktop computers. It is designed for studying spontaneous fluctuations in the neurocognitive state related to the tonic alertness of computer users, with recordings from 42 participants over 2-hour sessions. Within a simulated desktop environment, participants performed real-world routine tasks, including application switching, file management, typing, and web browsing. High-resolution data were recorded across physiological (electroencephalography, electrocardiography, respiration) and subjective modalities of alertness. At five-minute intervals, alertness state was reported using seven questions, addressing sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale), mental and temporal demand, perceived performance, effort and frustration (NASA Task Load Index), as well as attentiveness. Behavioural data included keyboard, mouse and webcam inputs. Demographic information for the experience, habits, and preferences of computer usage was collected. In addition, individual differences in sleep quality were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The SENSE-42 dataset can contribute to future research in user state monitoring, behavioural analysis and physiological computing.

">Using time-resolved auditory frequency tagging to capture self-preferential processing of the own (vs other) name</a></h4>

              
                The own name is an important, salient self-related stimulus and ostensive cue. Prioritized processing of ones own name plays a key role in attention, self-awareness, and social and cognitive development. Previous studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have reported a self-preferential effect for the own name, characterized by enhanced neural responses compared to the names of (close) others. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate an EEG auditory frequency-tagging task to measure self-preferential processing of the own name, leveraging the superior signal-to-noise ratio of this technique, which is highly relevant for future studies on infants and clinical populations. To this end, we ran two separate studies (dichotic: n1 = 31, non-dichotic: n2 = 32). In contrast to previous ERP research, we did not find evidence of a self-preferential effect. We reasoned that collapsing temporal information may have led to the failure to capture the effect, which ERP research has shown to emerge at a late stage of processing, and that this effect may have been overshadowed by early brain responses. To address this issue, we applied a novel approach that we refer to as the time-resolved frequency tagging approach, which incorporates knowledge of the effect in the temporal domain. This did result in a clear self-preferential effect of the own name. Hence, we were able to develop and validate an EEG frequency-tagging task to measure the self-preferential effect of the own name. Our approach can also be used in future EEG frequency-tagging studies investigating other complex cognitive processes.

">Evidence for hierarchical representations of written and spoken words from an open-science human neuroimaging dataset</a></h4>

              
                Reading and speech recognition rely on multi-level processing that builds from basic visual or sound features to complete word representations, yet details of these processing hierarchies (in particular those for spoken words) are still poorly understood. We re-analyzed the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data provided in the Mother Of all Unification Studies (MOUS) open-science dataset by using parametric regressions of word frequency and sublexical unit (bigram or syllable) frequency during reading and speech listening tasks in order to elucidate lexical processing hierarchies in the visual and auditory modalities. We first validated our approach in the written word domain, where the technique identified significant correlations for word frequency in the left mid-fusiform cortex (at the location of the Visual Word Form Area) with a left occipital region tracking bigram frequency, compatible with prior reports. During listening, low-frequency spoken words elicited greater responses in a left mid-superior temporal region consistent with the recently-described Auditory Word Form Area (AWFA), while a more posterior region of the superior temporal gyrus was sensitive to syllable frequency. Activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with both written and spoken word frequency. These findings demonstrate parallel hierarchical organizations in the anteroventral visual and auditory streams, with modality-specific lexica and upstream sublexical representations that converge in higher-order language areas.

">Astrocytes mobilize a broader repertoire of lysosomal repair mechanisms than neurons</a></h4>

              
                Lysosomal damage impairs proteostasis and contributes to neurodegenerative diseases, yet cell-type-specific differences in lysosomal repair remain unclear. Using a neuron-astrocyte coculture system, we compared responses to lysosomal injury induced by a lysosomotropic methyl ester. Both neurons and astrocytes showed lysosomal damage, marked by galectin-3 recruitment to lumenal lysosomal beta-galactosides, elevated lysosomal pH, and engagement of lysophagy receptors TAX1BP1 and p62. However, astrocytes showed a preferential recruitment of ESCRT repair machinery to damaged lysosomes. Additionally, the lysosomal membrane reformation pathway regulated by the RAB7-GAP, TBC1D15, was more robustly activated in astrocytes. By contrast, the PITT pathway, mediating lipid transfer between the ER and damaged lysosomes, was engaged in both cell types. Our data reveal a divergence in how neurons and astrocytes mobilize repair pathways to manage lysosomal damage. These data may reflect differences in lysosomal resilience between astrocytes and neurons and inform therapeutic strategies to correct lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Developmental excitation-inhibition imbalance permanently reprograms autism-relevant social brain circuits</a></h4>

              
                An influential theory proposes that an imbalance between excitation and inhibition (E:I) plays a central role in the etiology of autism and related developmental disorders. However, controversy exists as to whether this imbalance is a direct causal mechanism for autism, or a compensatory response to other primary etiological factors. Using chemogenetic manipulations in neonatal mice, we show that a transient E:I imbalance during development is sufficient to permanently reprogram autism-relevant social brain circuits. Chemogenetically manipulated mice exhibit lifelong impairments in sociability, persistent dysregulation of multiple autism-risk synaptic genes, and sustained cortical hyperexcitability in adulthood. Importantly, these social impairments are robustly rescued by pharmacological inhibition of neuronal excitability. Developmental E:I imbalance also disrupts functional connectivity in social brain regions enriched for transcriptionally dysregulated genes, suggesting a convergence of transcriptional and circuit-level pathology. Finally, multivariate modelling shows that behavioral dysfunction in chemogenetically manipulated animals closely associates with disrupted connectivity between prefrontal and mesolimbic dopaminergic regions. Collectively, our findings reconcile conflicting theories in the field and point to activity-dependent transcriptional remodeling as a foundational mechanism by which transient E:I imbalance during development can cause lasting, autism-relevant circuit dysfunction.

">Neuronal and Astrocytic Activity Changes Induced by Acute and Chronic Stress</a></h4>

              
                Stress is a major risk factor for depression and exerts complex effects on brain function and behavior. In this study, we examined the neural mechanisms of stress responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), with particular focus on neuron/astrocyte interactions. Using dual-color fiber photometry, we simultaneously monitored neuronal and astrocytic activity during acute and chronic stress. Acute stressors, including tail pinch and immobilization, evoked coordinated increases in both neuronal and astrocytic activity. In contrast, prolonged exposure to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) produced heightened neuronal activity alongside astrocytic dysfunction. Notably, UCMS disrupted the correlation between neuronal and astrocytic signals, pointing to impaired cellular crosstalk. These findings highlight a critical role of disrupted neuron/astrocyte interactions in shaping maladaptive stress responses and suggest a potential mechanism contributing to stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Motor cortex flexibly deploys a high-dimensional repertoire of subskills</a></h4>

              
                Skilled movement often requires flexibly combining multiple subskills, each requiring dedicated control strategies and underlying computations. How the motor system achieves such versatility remains unclear. Using high-density Neuropixels recordings from primary motor cortex (M1) in macaques performing a challenging force-tracking task, we reveal that M1 activity is much higher-dimensional, and far more flexible, than traditionally assumed. Although our task employed only a single external degree of freedom, neural dynamics reflected transitions amongst many dimensions and multiple distinct computations. Different behavioral control strategies were associated with distinct neural locations and dimensions, sometimes used compositionally. Groups of population-level factors became active when a particular form of dynamics was needed, and remained silent otherwise. Neural activity was thus dominated by the engaged subskill, and could be very different even for matched motor output. These findings challenge prevailing views of M1, and reveal an unexpectedly flexible and high-dimensional neural system underlying skilled motor behavior.

">Altered excitability of dI3 neurons regulates hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury is limited in mammals. Reactivation of locomotor circuits does occur, but primarily through the activation of sensorimotor pathways in the context of locomotor training. Previous investigations have shown that dI3 neurons, a developmentally-defined population of pre-motor, glutamatergic interneurons, are indispensable for this process. However, it remains unclear how dI3 neurons are recruited during locomotor recovery, and whether they could be leveraged to improve locomotor function following spinal cord injury. Herein, we investigated how the excitability of dI3 neurons influences locomotor behaviour and recovery after spinal cord injury. In T9-T10 transected mice, we found that acute chemogenetic silencing of dI3 neurons leads to immediate loss of hindlimb motor tone, and significant reduction in stepping during treadmill locomotion. Conversely, regular chemogenetic stimulation of dI3 neurons led to transient increases in hindlimb motor tone early after injury, but ultimately reduced hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery over the long term. These chronic changes resulting from dI3 neuron stimulation were associated with the absence of expression of the constitutive 5-HT2C-R isoform, potentially representing a homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of dI3 excitability following spinal cord injury. Given these findings, we hypothesized that dI3 stimulation effects on motor tone, while insufficient to drive locomotor function alone, may promote stepping improvements when locomotor rhythm-generating circuits are active. The addition of quipazine, a serotonergic agonist known to facilitate locomotor rhythmogenesis, in combination with dI3 stimulation, significantly improved locomotor function, while also mitigating the long-term reduction in treadmill stepping associated with dI3 stimulation alone. In aggregate, our results suggest that hyper-excitable dI3 neurons are involved in the maintenance of motor tone after spinal cord injury, possibly through a 5-HT2C-R-dependent mechanism, and further show that the selective stimulation of dI3 neurons could enhance the recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury.

">Is critical brain dynamics more prevalent than previously thought?</a></h4>

              
                The hypothesis that the brain operates near criticality has far-reaching implications for brain function and is supported by growing experimental evidence. Observations of scale-invariant brain activity agree with this hypothesis, but what about when brain activity is not scale-invariant? Should we reject the criticality hypothesis When power-laws poorly fit the data or when strong oscillations occur (dominated by a specific time scale)? Here we show several ways that criticality can be hidden from traditional data analytic approaches, leading to false negative conclusions. We use a parsimonious high-dimensional model to demonstrate how neural systems may separate different dynamical modes into different subspaces, simultaneously generating non-critical dynamics, critical oscillations, and scale-invariant avalanches. Our results point to a need for new methods capable of revealing hidden criticality and suggest that criticality could be more prevalent than previously thought, hidden in subspaces not readily revealed by standard data analyses.

">Disrupted Lipid Homeostasis as a Pathogenic Mechanism in ABCA7-Associated Alzheimers Disease Risk</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: ABCA7 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 7) encodes a lipid transporter linked to Alzheimers disease (AD). While common variants confer modest risk in Europeans, a 44-base pair deletion (rs142076058; p.Arg578Alafs) is a strong risk factor in African Americans (AA). Despite this, the biological consequences of this ancestry-specific variant are not well understood. METHODS: We expressed the truncated ABCA7 protein in HEK and HepG2 cells to assess localization and lipid metabolism. Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying the deletion were compared with isogenic controls. RESULTS: The truncated ABCA7 localized to the plasma membrane similarly to wild type but induced significant lipid droplet accumulation in HepG2 cells and iPSC-derived neurons. DISCUSSION: These findings show that the AA-specific ABCA7 deletion disrupts lipid regulation despite normal localization, suggesting a mechanistic link between impaired lipid homeostasis and increased AD risk. This work underscores the importance of ancestry-specific studies in AD research.

                Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP1) has been implicated in DNA damage responses and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer disease (AD), yet its role in amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) pathology remains unclear. Here, we show that PARP1 activation drives A{beta} pathology and neurodegeneration. Using a sensitive ELISA, we observed significantly elevated PAR levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared to controls. In vitro, oligomeric A{beta} 1-42 activated PARP1 and induced DNA damage, while genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 conferred neuroprotection. In vivo, PARP1 knockout in the 5XFAD mouse model of amyloidosis led to reduced amyloid plaque burden, preserved synaptic and neuronal integrity, attenuated glial activation and neuroinflammation, and rescued cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, PARP1 deficiency decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP) and BACE1 levels, altered {gamma}-secretase complex composition, and enhanced A{beta} degradation via neprilysin. These findings position PARP1 as a critical mediator of A{beta} toxicity and neurodegeneration, suggesting its inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder involving a neuroinflammatory response, the cause of which remains unclear. Transposable elements (TE) have been linked to inflammatory states, but their potential role in PD has not been explored. Using bulk- and single nuclei RNAseq of postmortem brain tissue from four brain regions, we studied TE transcriptional activation and its correlation with neuroinflammation in PD. Over a thousand TE loci, including LINE-1s and ERVs, were highly expressed in a cell-type and region-specific manner in the human brain. Increased TE expression was found in microglia and neurons in the substantia nigra and putamen in the PD brains, but not amygdala or prefrontal cortex, compared to age-matched control tissue. This TE activation correlated with innate immune transcriptional responses, characterized by the expression of interferon-related and viral response genes, in the same brain regions. The link between an interferon response and TE activation was mechanistically confirmed using human pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia and neurons. Our findings provide a unique insight into TE transcription in the PD brain and suggests that TEs play a role in chronic neuroinflammatory processes and the progression of this neurodegenerative disorder.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 80% of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) have autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptor, and clinical characteristics may vary between early-onset (symptom onset age &lt;50 years) and late-onset MG (EOMG and LOMG), but the pathophysiological differences between EOMG and LOMG are not well established.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an exploratory in-depth proteomics analysis examining 768 inflammatory proteins utilizing the baseline serum samples from the BeatMG study (NCT02110706). We performed pathway enrichment analysis to assess the pathways involved in LOMG. A total of 15 selected proteins from the initial analysis were further examined using the UK Biobank and further quantified in a separate validation cohort.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 21 patients with EOMG (age 38.3 ± 12.1 years, 16 women [76.2%]) and 28 patients with LOMG (age 67.3 ± 8.6 years, 7 women [25%]) from the BeatMG study were included in the exploratory analysis. Several proteins involved in the regulation of leukocyte differentiation and myeloid leukocyte differentiation and migration pathways were more abundant in the LOMG group. Among them, 7 were significantly different in the UK Biobank cohort. A total of 80 participants (39 MG patients (age 54.33 ± 18.9 years, 17 women [43.6%]) and 41 healthy controls (age 49.56 ± 17.06 years, 21 women [66.1%]) were included in the validation cohort, and IL18R1, CXCL17, and CCL11 were validated to be specific for LOMG.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Growing evidence supports that LOMG has a distinct immune pathomechanism. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm the utility of these proteins as biomarkers of LOMG, and the feasibility of using them for more precise therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hummingbirds (family <i>Trochilidae</i>) are easily recognized due to their unique ability to hover. Critical to hovering flight is head and body stabilization. In birds, stabilization during flight is mediated, among other things, by the detection of optic flow, the motion that occurs across the entire retina during self-motion. Given this increased requirement for stabilization, it is not surprising that previous studies have shown that hummingbirds have neural specializations in the visual pathways involved in the detection of optic flow. Particularly, previous studies have found some structural and functional differences in the hummingbird brain, in the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM): compared to other avian species, LM shows a massive hypertrophy, and LM neurons have unique response properties to optic flow stimuli. Here, we used intraocular injections of a neural tracer, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated with a fluorescent molecule, to study the retinal projections in Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) and compare them to those of a similarly sized non-hovering species, the zebra finch (<i>Taeniopygia castanotis</i>). Retinal targets in both birds were similar and correspond closely to those reported in other birds from a variety of avian clades. Importantly, we found differences in the projections to LM between hummingbirds and zebra finches. Consistent with previous reports of specialization of LM, it was more intensely labelled compared to other retinal-recipient nuclei in hummingbirds. Moreover, this increase in intensity was most apparent in the lateral subnucleus. This study reinforces previous evidence that the LM of hummingbirds is adapted to sustain the unique flight abilities of this clade.</p>

Real-world decision-making often involves navigating large action spaces with state-dependent action values, taxing the limited cognitive resources at our disposal. While previous studies have explored cognitive constraints on generating action consideration sets or refining state-action mappings (policy complexity), their interplay remains underexplored. In this work, we present a resource-rational framework for policy compression that integrates both constraints, offering a unified perspective on decision-making under cognitive limitations. Through simulations, we characterize the suboptimality arising from reduced action consideration sets and reveal the complex interaction between policy complexity and action consideration set size in mitigating this suboptimality. We then use such normative insight to explain empirically observed phenomena in option generation, including the preferential sampling of generally valuable options and increased correlation in responses across contexts under cognitive load. We further validate the framework’s predictions through a contextual multi-armed bandit experiment, showing how humans flexibly adapt their action consideration sets and policy complexity to maintain near-optimality in a task-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for fine-grained resource constraints in understanding human cognition, and highlights the presence of adaptive metacognitive strategies even in simple tasks.

                <p>by Dongju Lim, Kyeong Tae Ko, Hyukpyo Hong, Hyojung Lee, Boseung Choi, Won Chang, Sunhwa Choi, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting complex dynamical systems, ranging from gene regulatory networks to population-level dynamics. However, model predictions are highly sensitive to initial conditions, which are often unknown. In infectious disease models, for instance, the initial number of exposed individuals (E) at the time the model simulation starts is frequently unknown. This initial condition has often been estimated using an unrealistic, history-independent assumption for simplicity: the chance that an exposed individual becomes infectious is the same regardless of the timing of their exposure (i.e., exposure history). Here, we show that this history-independent method can yield serious bias in the estimation of the initial condition. To address this, we developed a <i>history-dependent</i> initial condition estimation method derived from a master equation expressing the time-varying likelihood of becoming infectious during a latent period. Our method consistently outperformed the history-independent method across various scenarios, including those with measurement errors and abrupt shifts in epidemics, for example, due to vaccination. In particular, our method reduced estimation error by 55% compared to the previous method in real-world COVID-19 data from Seoul, Republic of Korea, which includes likely infection dates, allowing us to obtain the true initial condition. This advancement of initial condition estimation enhances the precision of epidemic modeling, ultimately supporting more effective public health policies. We also provide a user-friendly package, Hist-D, to facilitate the use of this history-dependent initial condition estimation method.

This study addresses the pressing global health burden of mosquito-borne diseases by investigating the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mosquito species identification using wing images. Conventional identification methods are hampered by the need for significant expertise and resources, while CNNs offer a promising alternative. Our research aimed to develop a reliable and applicable classification system that can be used under real-world conditions, with a focus on improving model adaptability to unencountered devices, mitigating dataset biases, and ensuring usability across different users without standardized protocols. We utilized a large, diverse dataset of mosquito wing images of 21 taxa and three image-capturing devices (N = 14,888) and a preprocessing pipeline to standardize images and remove undesirable image features. The developed CNN models demonstrated high performance, with an average balanced accuracy of 98.3% and a macro F1-score of 97.6%, effectively distinguishing between the 21 mosquito taxa, including morphologically similar pairs. The preprocessing pipeline improved the model’s robustness, reducing performance drops on unfamiliar devices effectively. However, the study also highlights the persistence of inherent dataset biases, which the preprocessing steps could only partially mitigate. The classification system’s practical usability was demonstrated through a feasibility study, showing high inter-rater reliability. The results underscore the potential of the proposed workflow to enhance vector surveillance, especially in resource-constrained settings, and suggest its applicability to other winged insect species. The classification system developed in this study is available for public use, providing a valuable tool for vector surveillance and research, supporting efforts to mitigate the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.

Drug-induced liver injury is a leading cause of high attrition rates for both candidate drugs and marketed medications. Previous in silico models may not effectively utilize biological drug property information and often lack robust model validation. In this study, we developed a graph convolutional network embedded with a biological graph learning (BioGL) module—named BioGL-GCN(Biological Graph Learning-Graph Convolutional Network)—for drug-induced liver injury prediction using toxicogenomic profiles. The BioGL module learned the optimal graph representations of gene interactions by utilizing the constructed protein-protein interaction network, which represents initial gene relationships, and gene frequency information obtained from gene enrichment analysis. Finally, the graph convolutional network was used to identify drug hepatotoxicity. Our method pays more attention to gene-gene relationships compared to previous approaches, thereby achieving more accurate predictive performance. We applied BioGL-GCN to predict DILI risk for active components in the integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) database and validated these predictions through hepatotoxicity experiments using a 3D primary human hepatocyte (PHH) model. The results showed that our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 79%, thus further validating the reliability of the constructed model.

                <p>by Jianing Yang, Gregory R. Grant, Thomas G. Brooks</p>

Simulation of realistic omics data is a key input for benchmarking studies that help users obtain optimal computational pipelines. Omics data involves large numbers of measured features on each sample and these measures are generally correlated with each other. However, simulation too often ignores these correlations, perhaps due to computational and statistical hurdles of doing so. To alleviate this, we describe three approaches for generating omics-scale data with correlated measures which mimic real datasets. These approaches are all based on a Gaussian copula approach with a covariance matrix that decomposes into a diagonal part and a low-rank part. This decomposition allows for extremely efficient simulation, overcoming a hurdle for adoption of past methods. We use these approaches to demonstrate the importance of including correlation in two benchmarking applications. First, we show that variance of results from the popular DESeq2 method increases when dependence is included. Second, we demonstrate that CYCLOPS, a method for inferring circadian time of collection from transcriptomics, improves in performance when given gene-gene dependencies in some circumstances. We provide an R package, dependentsimr, that has efficient implementations of these methods and can generate dependent data with arbitrary marginal distributions, including discrete (binary, ordered categorical, Poisson, negative binomial), continuous (normal), or with an empirical distribution.

                <p>by Pierre Orhan, Yves Boubenec, Jean-Rémi King</p>

Humans can spontaneously detect complex algebraic structures. Historically, two opposing views explain this ability, at the root of language and music acquisition. Some argue for the existence of an innate and specific mechanism. Others argue that this ability emerges from experience: i.e. when generic learning principles continuously process sensory inputs. These two views, however, remain difficult to test experimentally. Here, we use deep learning models to evaluate the factors that lead to the spontaneous detection of algebraic structures in the auditory modality. Specifically, we use self-supervised learning to train multiple deep-learning models with a variable amount of either natural (environmental sounds) and/or cultural sounds (speech or music) to evaluate the impact of these stimuli. We then expose these models to the experimental paradigms classically used to evaluate the processing of algebraic structures. Like humans, these models spontaneously detect repeated sequences, probabilistic chunks, and complex algebraic structures. Also like humans, this ability diminishes with structure complexity. Importantly, this ability can emerge from experience alone: the more the models are exposed to natural sounds, the more they spontaneously detect increasingly complex structures. Finally, this ability does not emerge in models pretrained only on speech, and emerges more rapidly in models pretrained with music than environmental sounds. Overall, our study provides an operational framework to clarify sufficient built-in and acquired principles that model human’s advanced capacity to detect algebraic structures in sounds.

                <p>by Kelsey L. Anbuhl, Alexander T. Ferber, Andrew D. Brown, Victor Benichoux, Nathaniel T. Greene, Daniel J. Tollin</p>

Early sensory experience can exert lasting perceptual consequences. For example, a brief period of auditory deprivation early in life can lead to persistent spatial hearing deficits. Some forms of hearing loss (i.e., conductive; CHL) can distort acoustical cues needed for spatial hearing, which depend on inputs from both ears. We hypothesize that asymmetric acoustic input during development disrupts auditory circuits that integrate binaural information. Here, we identify prolonged maturation of the binaural auditory brainstem in the guinea pig by tracking auditory evoked potentials across development. Using this age range, we induce a reversible unilateral CHL and ask whether behavioral and neural maturation are disrupted. We find that developmental CHL is associated with alterations in a brainstem readout of binaural function, an effect that was not observed in a separate cohort with adult-onset CHL. Startle-based behavioral measures suggest that Early CHL animals exhibit reduced spatial resolution for high-frequency sound sources. Finally, single-unit recordings of auditory midbrain neurons reveal significantly poorer neural acuity to a sound location cue that largely depends on high-frequency sounds. Thus, these findings show that unilateral deprivation can disrupt developing auditory circuits that integrate binaural information and may give rise to lingering spatial hearing deficits.

                <p>Author(s): Takumi Tagaki, Seiya Nishikawa, and Shuji Ishihara</p><p>A model of self-propelled particles that incorporates elastic energy from cyclic substrate stretching successfully reproduces experimentally observed microtubule alignment at specific angles, as well as banded aggregation patterns. It also provides insight into how general active matter systems respond to cyclic mechanical stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97870">The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex pangenome is small and shaped by sub-lineage-specific regions of difference</a></h4>

              
                The <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTBC) is a group of bacteria causing tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals. Understanding MTBC genetic diversity is crucial for insights into its adaptation and traits related to survival, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. While it is known that within-MTBC diversity is characterised by large deletions found only in certain lineages (regions of difference [RDs]), a comprehensive pangenomic analysis incorporating both coding and non-coding regions remains unexplored. We utilised a curated dataset representing various MTBC genomes, including under-represented lineages, to quantify the full diversity of the MTBC pangenome. The MTBC was found to have a small, closed pangenome with distinct genomic features and RDs both between lineages (as previously known) and between sub-lineages. The accessory genome was identified to be a product of genome reduction, showing both divergent and convergent deletions. This variation has implications for traits like virulence, drug resistance, and metabolism. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the MTBC pangenome, highlighting the importance of genome reduction in its evolution, and underlines the significance of genomic variations in determining the pathogenic traits of different MTBC lineages.

                <p>The causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and white matter injury and communication remains unclear. We aimed to scrutinize the plausible causal impact of GM on white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), white matter microstructure, white matter connectivity, and multiple neurological diseases via Mendelian randomization study. We identified four WMH-related bacterial taxa, including class <I>Melainabacteria</I>, order <I>Gastranaerophilales</I>, family <I>Alcaligenaceae</I>, and genus <I>Ruminiclostridium 6</I>. In addition, three bacterial taxa were discovered that have consistent effect on multiple aspects of white matter microstructure. Furthermore, we found 12 strong associations between genetic liability in GM and white matter connectivity. Among these bacterial taxa, the family <I>Clostridiaceae 1</I> demonstrated a protective effect against ischemic stroke (IS). The genus <I>Barnesiella</I> showed protective effect on IS and small vessel stroke while posed a risk effect on neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), as well as on aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD). The order <I>Desulfovibrionales</I> and family <I>Desulfovibrionaceae</I> showed protective effect against cardioembolic stroke, and the genus <I>Ruminococcus gnavus group</I> showed a protective effect on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In terms of the mapped genes of statistically significant bacterial taxa, genes such as <I>CPNE1</I>, <I>PIGU</I>, <I>MED22</I>, <I>SURF6</I>, <I>DOCK10</I>, and <I>COPS3</I> exhibited a significant causal correlation with the corresponding white matter connectivity. This study demonstrated a genetically predicted causal relationship between GM and WMH, white matter microstructure, white matter connectivity, and multiple neurological diseases, based on GWAS data from mixed-sex cohorts without sex-stratified summary statistics. These findings highlight the potential role of GM in influencing brain structural integrity.</p>

Network alignment (NA) is a computational methodology employed to compare biological networks across different species or conditions. By identifying conserved structures, functions, and interactions, NA provides invaluable insights into shared biological processes, evolutionary relationships, and system-level behaviors. This manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of NA methodologies, including the importance of preprocessing network data, selecting suitable input formats, and understanding diverse network types such as attributed, temporal, and multilayer networks. Additionally, it explores key challenges such as seed nodes selection, algorithm configuration, and cross-species alignment, emphasizing the necessity of integrating functional annotations, sequence similarity, and network topology for biologically meaningful results. Various NA strategies, including Local and Global Network Alignment, are discussed alongside their respective advantages and limitations. Practical recommendations for effectively documenting and visualizing NA experiments are also provided, ensuring reproducibility and clarity in research. By leveraging diverse alignment tools and adopting best practices, researchers can unlock the potential of NA to advance our understanding of complex biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003384">Should scientists be allowed to bring distant human ancestors back to life?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arthur L. Caplan</p>

Recent efforts by a private company to modify modern species with ancient DNA in the name of ‘de-extinction’ are both scientifically and morally suspect. A bright line requiring more than press releases as well as independent ethical oversight must be drawn before they are extended to distant human and hominid ancestors.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003356">Recent extinctions of plant and animal genera are rare, localized, and decelerated</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John J. Wiens, Kristen E. Saban</p>

An important aspect of the current extinction crisis is the loss of distinct clades (e.g., genera). A recent study suggested that there is rapidly accelerating extinction of genera (and other higher taxa), indicating a current mass extinction event that endangers human survival. However, that study was based only on land vertebrates, which include only about half of vertebrates and <2% of living species. Here, we examine the recent extinction (last 500 years) of higher taxa across living organisms. We find that 102 genera have gone extinct (90 animals, 12 plants), along with 10 families and two orders. Yet, the majority of these genus-level extinctions were among mammals and birds, as were all extinctions of families and orders. There were very few extinctions among the thousands of genera of ray-finned fishes (<i>n</i> = 4; 0.08%), squamate reptiles (<i>n</i> = 2; 0.17%), and amphibians (<i>n</i> = 1; 0.18%). Documented extinctions were also rare among the thousands of assessed genera of arthropods (<i>n</i> = 11; 0.32%) and plants (<i>n</i> = 12; 0.17%), which together encompass most known species. Most extinct genera were monotypic (~80%), and most were island endemics (76%). Moreover, despite the claim that extinctions of higher taxa are rapidly accelerating, the highest rates of genus-level extinctions occurred more than 100 years ago, and have declined subsequently. Overall, the recent extinctions of higher taxa are not as dire as previously suggested.
