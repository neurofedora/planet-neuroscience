              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17820">The Standard Model of the Retina</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scientific study of the retina has reached a remarkable state of completion. We can now explain many aspects of early visual processing based on a relatively simple model of neural circuitry in the retina. The same model, with different parameters, produces a great diversity of neural computations. In this article I lay out what that "standard model" is and how it accounts for such a diversity of phenomena. The emergence of such a powerful standard model is unique in systems neuroscience, and I consider what conditions made it possible. The standard model now serves as a baseline from which to organize future retinal research, either by testing the model's assumptions directly, or by identifying phenomena that remain unexplained.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17822">A Biophysical-Model-Informed Source Separation Framework For EMG Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural interfacing have enabled significant improvements in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation, and neuromuscular diagnostics. Motor unit (MU) decomposition from surface electromyography (sEMG) is a key technique for extracting neural drive information, but traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods fail to incorporate biophysical constraints, limiting their accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel Biophysical-Model-Informed Source Separation (BMISS) framework, which integrates anatomically accurate forward EMG models into the decomposition process. By leveraging MRI-based anatomical reconstructions and generative modeling, our approach enables direct inversion of a biophysically accurate forward model to estimate both neural drive and motor neuron properties in an unsupervised manner. Empirical validation in a controlled simulated setting demonstrates that BMISS achieves higher fidelity motor unit estimation while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional methods. This framework paves the way for non-invasive, personalized neuromuscular assessments, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, prosthetic control, and neurorehabilitation.

                arXiv:2510.17833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do brains and language models converge toward the same internal representations of the world? Recent years have seen a rise in studies of neural activations and model alignment. In this work, we review 25 fMRI-based studies published between 2023 and 2025 and explicitly confront their findings with two key hypotheses: (i) the Platonic Representation Hypothesis -- that as models scale and improve, they converge to a representation of the real world, and (ii) the Intermediate-Layer Advantage -- that intermediate (mid-depth) layers often encode richer, more generalizable features. Our findings provide converging evidence that models and brains may share abstract representational structures, supporting both hypotheses and motivating further research on brain-model alignment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17837">Dynamic threshold curves and response precision in forced excitable systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate here various properties of the responses of excitable systems subject to periodic forcing and noise. While the properties of intrinsic oscillators, subject to added periodic signals, are well understood, much less is known about the factors that determine the response precision of excitable units, intrinsically at rest, when activated by periodic forcing and stochastic noise. One motivation for considering this issue comes from the behavior of auditory neurons. These neurons reportedly have the ability to fire spikes in a precise range of phases in response to incoming sound waves, a behavior for which the mechanism is unknown. To account for such a response precision, we introduce the notion of dynamic threshold curve (DTC), which estimates at each time the effective likelihood that noise will subsequently generate a spike. The DTC effectively summarizes, in a single curve, a representation of the response precision of an excitable model, as we demonstrate by showing that the distribution of spike times produced in this setting is well captured by the first passage time of a simple, Gaussian stochastic process to the distance to the DTC. This result shows that peaks and troughs of the DTC, but also their slopes, convey fine information about spike timing in response to noise. In particular, it explains properties of Type 2 and Type 3 excitable cells studied previously and provides a framework to predict the DTC properties necessary to support the response precision of auditory neurons, as we illustrate in a well-established auditory neuron model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18516">Decoding Dynamic Visual Experience from Calcium Imaging via Cell-Pattern-Aware SSL</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) holds a great deal of promise for applications in neuroscience, due to the lack of large-scale, consistently labeled neural datasets. However, most neural datasets contain heterogeneous populations that mix stable, predictable cells with highly stochastic, stimulus-contingent ones, which has made it hard to identify consistent activity patterns during SSL. As a result, self-supervised pretraining has yet to show clear signs of benefits from scale on neural data. Here, we present a novel approach to self-supervised pretraining, POYO-SSL that exploits the heterogeneity of neural data to improve pre-training and achieve benefits of scale. Specifically, in POYO-SSL we pretrain only on predictable (statistically regular) neurons-identified on the pretraining split via simple higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis)-then we fine-tune on the unpredictable population for downstream tasks. On the Allen Brain Observatory dataset, this strategy yields approximately 12-13% relative gains over from-scratch training and exhibits smooth, monotonic scaling with model size. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art baselines plateau or destabilize as model size increases. By making predictability an explicit metric for crafting the data diet, POYO-SSL turns heterogeneity from a liability into an asset, providing a robust, biologically grounded recipe for scalable neural decoding and a path toward foundation models of neural dynamics.

                arXiv:2510.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to study human brain dynamics, yet its quantitative information capacity remains unclear. Here, we combine information theory and synthetic forward modeling to estimate the mutual information between latent cortical sources and EEG recordings. Using Gaussian-channel theory and empirical simulations, we find that scalp EEG conveys only tens of bits per sample about low-dimensional neural activity. Information saturates with approximately 64-128 electrodes and scales logarithmically with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Linear decoders capture nearly all variance that is linearly recoverable, but the mutual information they recover remains far below the analytic channel capacity, indicating that measurement physics - not algorithmic complexity - is the dominant limitation. These results outline the intrinsic ceiling on how much structure about brain state or thought content can be inferred from EEG.

                arXiv:2510.18037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18808">On Biologically Plausible Learning in Continuous Time</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.18808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise. Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths. Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in biological circuits.

                arXiv:2506.01508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our brain learns to update its mental model of the environment by abstracting sensory experiences for adaptation and survival. Learning to categorize sounds is one essential abstracting process for high-level human cognition, such as speech perception, but it is also challenging due to the variable nature of auditory signals and their dynamic contexts. To overcome these learning challenges and enhance learner performance, it is essential to identify the impact of learning-related factors in developing better training protocols. Here, we conducted an extensive meta-analysis of auditory category learning studies, including a total of 111 experiments and 4,521 participants, and examined to what extent three hidden factors (i.e., variability, intensity, and engagement) derived from 12 experimental variables contributed to learning success (i.e., effect sizes). Variables related to intensity and training variability outweigh others in predicting learning effect size. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of the neuroimaging studies revealed training-induced systematic changes in the frontotemporal-parietal networks. Increased brain activities in speech and motor-related auditory-frontotemporal regions and decreased activities in cuneus and precuneus areas are associated with increased learning effect sizes. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the driving forces behind speech and auditory category learning success, along with its neural changes, but also guide researchers and practitioners in designing more effective training protocols that consider the three key aspects of learning to facilitate learner success.

                arXiv:2510.14382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brain predicts the external world through an internal model refined by prediction errors. A complete prediction specifies what will happen, when it will happen, and with what probability, a construct we call the "prediction object." Existing models usually capture only what and when, omit probabilities, and rely on algorithms that are not biologically plausible. We show that a single population of spiking neurons can learn the full prediction object through a biologically grounded three factor Hebbian rule. In a heterogeneous Izhikevich reservoir, online timing learning and offline identity consolidation allow the network to fire at the correct times with amplitudes proportional to probability and to adapt instantly when the environment changes. Unlike global least squares methods such as FORCE, which require resets to relearn, our model recalibrates continuously through local error gated modulation. This single circuit provides a biologically grounded, flexible mechanism for predictive cognition.

                arXiv:2510.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.

                arXiv:2506.02813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examples of such pathways can be found in the interactions between cortical and subcortical networks during learning, or in sub-networks specializing for task characteristics such as difficulty or modality. Despite the large role these pathways play in cognition, the mechanisms through which brain regions organize into pathways remain unclear. In this work, we use an extension of the Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts architecture to show that heterogeneous regions do not form processing pathways by themselves, implying that the brain likely implements specific constraints which result in the reliable formation of pathways. We identify three biologically relevant inductive biases that encourage pathway formation: a routing cost imposed on the use of more complex regions, a scaling factor that reduces this cost when task performance is low, and randomized expert dropout. When comparing our resulting \textit{Mixture-of-Pathways} model with the brain, we observe that the artificial pathways in our model match how the brain uses cortical and subcortical systems to learn and solve tasks of varying difficulty. In summary, we introduce a novel framework for investigating how the brain forms task-specific pathways through inductive biases, and the effects these biases have on the behavior of Mixture-of-Experts models.

                arXiv:2510.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dedicated analog neurocomputing circuits are promising for high-throughput, low power consumption applications of machine learning (ML) and for applications where implementing a digital computer is unwieldy (remote locations; small, mobile, and autonomous devices, extreme conditions, etc.). Neural networks (NN) implemented in such circuits, however, must contend with circuit noise and the non-uniform shapes of the neuron activation function (NAF) due to the dispersion of performance characteristics of circuit elements (such as transistors or diodes implementing the neurons). We present a computational study of the impact of circuit noise and NAF inhomogeneity in function of NN architecture and training regimes. We focus on one application that requires high-throughput ML: materials informatics, using as representative problem ML of formation energies vs. lowest-energy isomer of peri-condensed hydrocarbons, formation energies and band gaps of double perovskites, and zero point vibrational energies of molecules from QM9 dataset. We show that NNs generally possess low noise tolerance with the model accuracy rapidly degrading with noise level. Single-hidden layer NNs, and NNs with larger-than-optimal sizes are somewhat more noise-tolerant. Models that show less overfitting (not necessarily the lowest test set error) are more noise-tolerant. Importantly, we demonstrate that the effect of activation function inhomogeneity can be palliated by retraining the NN using practically realized shapes of NAFs.

Abstract: In this paper, the branches of recursive and recurrent neural networks are classified in detail according to the network structure, training objective function and learning algorithm implementation.

Various networks cross each other and even rely on each other to form a complex network of relationships. In the context of the development and convergence of various networks, many complex sequence, speech and image problems are solved. After a detailed description of the principle and structure of the above model and model deformation, the research progress and application of each model are described, and finally the recursive and recurrent neural network models are prospected and summarized.

Abstract: EEG-based person identification enables applications in security, personalized brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and cognitive monitoring. However, existing techniques often rely on deep learning architectures at high computational cost, limiting their scope of applications. In this study, we propose a novel EEG person identification approach using spiking neural networks (SNNs) with a lightweight spiking transformer for efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed SNN model is capable of handling the temporal complexities inherent in EEG signals. On the EEG-Music Emotion Recognition Challenge dataset, the proposed model achieves 100% classification accuracy with less than 10% energy consumption of traditional deep neural networks. This study offers a promising direction for energy-efficient and high-performance BCIs. The source code is available at https://github.com/PatrickZLin/Decode-ListenerIdentity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17899">Automated Algorithm Design for Auto-Tuning Optimizers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms, annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application- and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\% improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

                arXiv:2510.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly, overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions. Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions, and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

                arXiv:2510.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math, coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled, universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust generalization of our framework.

                arXiv:2510.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and natural selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve across large populations due to natural competition and environmental pressures. In an effort to discover how complex behaviors naturally emerge, we conduct experiments in large-scale worlds that reach populations of more than 60,000 individual agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction, vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of these behaviors, finding that some appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, with larger scales increasing behavioral stability and consistency. While there is a rich history of research in evolutionary settings, our scaling results provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of abundant computational resources.

                arXiv:2510.18650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization (PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios, respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression.

Abstract: In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) streamlines the automation of optimization algorithm design through meta-learning. It typically employs a bi-level structure: the meta-level policy undergoes meta-training to reduce the manual effort required in developing algorithms for low-level optimization tasks. The original MetaBox (2023) provided the first open-source framework for reinforcement learning-based single-objective MetaBBO. However, its relatively narrow scope no longer keep pace with the swift advancement in this field. In this paper, we introduce MetaBox-v2 (https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox) as a milestone upgrade with four novel features: 1) a unified architecture supporting RL, evolutionary, and gradient-based approaches, by which we reproduce $23$ up-to-date baselines; 2) efficient parallelization schemes, which reduce the training/testing time by $10-40$x; 3) a comprehensive benchmark suite of $18$ synthetic/realistic tasks ($1900$+ instances) spanning single-objective, multi-objective, multi-model, and multi-task optimization scenarios; 4) plentiful and extensible interfaces for custom analysis/visualization and integrating to external optimization tools/benchmarks. To show the utility of MetaBox-v2, we carry out a systematic case study that evaluates the built-in baselines in terms of the optimization performance, generalization ability and learning efficiency. Valuable insights are concluded from thorough and detailed analysis for practitioners and those new to the field.

                arXiv:2509.04622v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

">Burst suppression: a default brain state associated with loss of network complexity</a></h4>

              
                Burst suppression (BS) is a highly stereotyped EEG pattern observed across a wide range of clinical contexts, from general anesthesia and postanoxic coma to neonatal encephalopathy. Despite its consistent appearance, BS comprises two distinct forms with markedly different implications. BS with identical bursts (IBS) is almost exclusively seen in patients with severe, irreversible encephalopathy and is consistently associated with poor neurological outcome. In contrast, heterogeneous BS (HBS) can appear in reversible conditions such as anesthesia. The mechanisms that give rise to these divergent forms remain elusive. Existing theories impose disease-specific processes on otherwise healthy networks, but such models fail to explain why BS emerges across diverse etiologies and disregard the clinically critical distinction between IBS and HBS. We combined clinical, experimental, and computational approaches to identify shared mechanisms underlying BS. We analyzed EEG recordings from patients with a severe postanoxic encephalopathy and from patients undergoing general anesthesia. These clinical observations were compared with activity recordings from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks and rodent cortical cultures, and simulations of biophysically grounded neuronal network models. Purely excitatory, low-complexity networks, both in vitro and in silico, spontaneously generated activity virtually indistinguishable from pathological IBS. Introducing inhibitory neurons, modular network structure, or diverse external inputs progressively increased signal complexity and produced HBS-like or continuous activity resembling physiological EEG. Our findings suggest that BS, and particularly IBS, reflects a default dynamic state of simplified excitatory networks that emerges when biological complexity is lost. Different clinical conditions may compromise distinct mechanisms--inhibition, connectivity, or afferent input--yet converge on the same underlying activity pattern. While IBS reflects near-complete loss of complexity, HBS indicates partial preservation. This unified framework explains how diverse etiologies converge on BS and highlights identical forms as signatures of severely reduced network complexity.

">Exploring the functions of JAKMIP1 in neuronal IL-6/STAT3 signaling and its relevance to chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence supports neuroinflammation as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a classical pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related phenotypes. To better understand molecular factors that modify neuronal cytokine responses in ASD, we investigated potential roles for JAKMIP1, a gene linked to chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome (Dup15q; a form of syndromic ASD), in regulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling. We observe that JAKMIP1 deficiency impairs IL-6/STAT3 signaling and IL-6-induced neuritogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells; and discover that JAKMIP1 may regulate STAT3 expression via its C-terminus, which exhibits nucleoplasmic localization. Additionally, we find that IL-6/STAT3 signaling is altered in Dup15q hiPSCs-derived cortical neurons, which display heightened responsiveness to IL-6; though it is unclear whether and how JAKMIP1 contributes to this. Overall, our findings identify JAKMIP1 as a modulator of neuronal IL-6/STAT3 signaling and support that ASD-linked genetic variants can alter the inflammatory landscape of ASD.

">The serotonin 1B receptor modulates striatal activity differentially based on behavioral context</a></h4>

              
                The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is critical for goal-directed behavior and has been implicated in both motivating and inhibiting behavioral responses. The DMS circuitry is complex as it integrates multiple inputs from the cortex, thalamus, and other subcortical structures including midbrain dopamine neurons. Though less studied, serotonin neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus also richly innervate the DMS, which expresses the majority of the 14 receptor subtypes for serotonin. In particular, slice electrophysiology shows that the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) impacts DMS physiology and plasticity, and behavioral experiments show that 5-HT1BR expression modulates impulsivity and other DMS-dependent reward-related behaviors. In these studies, our goal was to investigate the effects of 5-HT1BR on the DMS in vivo during goal-directed behavior in mice. Using a genetic 5-HT1BR loss-of-function model, we examined the calcium activity of individual medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the DMS during operant tasks of responding and waiting. We found that knockout of 5-HT1BRs resulted in a significant reduction of excitatory calcium responses and an increase in the proportion of cells with inhibitory calcium responses following receipt of a reward. This suggests that serotonin may recruit MSN activity in response to reward via actions at 5-HT1BRs. On the other hand, in a behavioral paradigm designed to test impulsivity, we found that serotonin may inhibit DMS calcium activity through 5-HT1BRs. Specifically, mice lacking 5-HT1BR expression had a larger proportion of cells showing increased calcium responses during the waiting period of the trial, compared to controls. These results point to the importance of in vivo studies to understand the functional role of DMS serotonin in reward-related behavior. Overall our results demonstrate that serotonin can modulate the DMS in a behavioral state-specific manner, potentially providing a mechanism for how serotonin effects on behavior are context-dependent.

">Elevated activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes feeding during pregnancy in mice</a></h4>

              
                The pregnancy period is accompanied by increased feeding behavior to accommodate the elevated energy demands associated with fetal growth and development. However, the underlying neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms mediating increased feeding during pregnancy are largely unknown. Here, we utilize a combination of fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and mouse behavioral assays to characterize altered feeding behavior during pregnancy in mice. We uncover that pregnancy increases the activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system during both homeostatic and hedonic feeding behavior in mice. VTA dopamine neurons are ultimately required for promoting increased hedonic feeding during pregnancy as inhibition of these cells selectively reduces acute high fat diet intake in pregnant mice. Further, pregnant mice exhibit increased sensitivity to food deprivation, an effect which requires activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Together, these findings provide a circuit basis mediating altered hedonic feeding behavior and sensitivity to negative energy balance during pregnancy in mice.

">Musicianship and active musical engagement predict facilitation of auditory-motor plasticity: evidence from auditory-motor paired associative stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Abstract: Background and Aim: Auditory motor paired associative stimulation (PAS) probes experience dependent plasticity in auditory motor circuits. We tested whether musical experience and musical sophistication modulate PAS induced facilitation when instrument tones are paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex. Method: Sixteen musicians and thirteen non-musicians completed two sessions. Session 1 estimated an individualized inter-stimulus interval (ISI) by testing seven tone TMS delays (25 to 300 ms). Session 2 applied PAS at the optimal ISI. Corticospinal excitability was assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from right first dorsal interosseus at baseline and post-intervention. Group comparisons and a stepwise multiple regression with Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold MSI) subscales evaluated predictors of the PAS effect. Results: A stepwise multiple regression model selected Group and Active Engagement (Gold MSI Factor 1) as independent predictors (F (2,26) = 4.59, p = 0.020, adjusted R2 = 0.204), without interaction: musicians exhibited smaller facilitation than non-musicians, and higher Active Engagement predicted greater facilitation across groups. Discussion: The lack of facilitation in musicians contrasts with somatosensory PAS reports of enhanced plasticity in experts. A modality specific ceiling effect may contribute, whereby long term training optimizes auditory motor transmission, reducing headroom for facilitation. The association with Active Engagement suggests motivational/reward mechanisms potentially dopaminergic gate responsiveness to auditory motor PAS. Conclusion: Under this protocol, auditory motor PAS with instrument tones facilitated corticospinal excitability in non-musicians but not in musicians. Individual differences in Active Engagement predicted facilitation, indicating that both group membership and active musical engagement shape susceptibility to auditory motor associative plasticity.

                Despite decades of research on goal-directed behavior in primates, our understanding of frontal cortical circuits in natural social contexts remains very limited. Classic studies with macaques revealed rich motor representations in both ventral premotor (PMv) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), but the limitations imposed by constrained tasks offered a limited window to investigate the complexity of natural behaviors and social interactions. Freely-moving wireless electrophysiological recordings allowed us to investigate the involvement of these areas during different spontaneous behaviors, including social affiliative interactions, and revealed a robust encoding of the social context of motor actions in both PMv and vlPFC. This provides novel evidence that the frontal lobe integrates social information in naturalistic settings, bridging motor control and social cognition, highlighting the need for ecological neuroscience approaches.

">Astrocytic PIEZO activation by heartbeat sound promotes extracellular matrix and maturation in human brain organoids</a></h4>

              
                Heartbeat sound is one of the first rhythmic stimuli encountered by the developing human brain, yet its biological role has remained unexplored. Here we show that heartbeat sound promotes structural and functional maturation of human cortical organoids with a physiological astrocyte-to-neuron ratio. Continuous stimulation with heartbeat expanded the extracellular space (ECS), visualized by super-resolution 3D STED and 2-photon shadow imaging, and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, detected by LC-MS/MS proteomics. Heartbeat sound promoted neuronal and astrocytic differentiation, synaptogenesis, and organoid maturation, as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing, synaptic marker immunohistochemistry, and high-density multielectrode electrophysiology. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated astrocyte-specific expression of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels. Using Ca2+ imaging, we confirmed that low-frequency sound stimulation, including heartbeat, activates PIEZO-mediated Ca2+ responses, which in turn upregulate astrocytic ECM synthesis. Experiments with biomimetic hydrogels demonstrated that physiological matrix stiffness attenuates PIEZO activation, suggesting a mechanoprotective mechanism. Our findings demonstrate a fundamental mechanism for inducing ECM synthesis and neural differentiation through astrocytic PIEZO activation by heartbeat sound, suggesting that interoception of the internal acoustic environment is an underappreciated driver of human brain development.

">Resolving temporal threat uncertainty by observational learning involves the amygdala, hippocampus and anterior insula</a></h4>

              
                While the neurobiological distinction between temporally predictable (cued) and unpredictable (contextual) threats has been well-characterized in direct learning using the NPU paradigm, it is poorly understood how these processes unfold during observational learning, a key mechanism of human threat-learning. In this study, we developed a novel observational paradigm based on the NPU paradigm (Experiment 1, n=20, male and female) and combined it with fMRI (Experiment 2, n=23, male and female) to investigate how the brain encodes predictable and unpredictable threat cues observed in others. Participants learned predictable (P), unpredictable (U), and no-threat (N) cues by observation and encountered the same threat cues during an expression phase. Threat expectations indicated that participants successfully learned threat contingencies, showing heightened threat expectations for predictable cues and unpredictable contexts. This converged with neural responses in the anterior insula during the expression phase. Reflecting the dynamic process of learning, the amygdala responded to predictable threat cues with a linear decrease across trials. Interestingly, we found that learning to predict threats from others pain was accompanied by enhanced neural response within the amygdala, insula and hippocampus, as compared to unpredictable conditions. Our findings suggest that humans learn to resolve temporal uncertainty relying solely on observation. The ability to learn shapes the neural response to an observed threat.

">A human brain network specialized for abstract formal reasoning</a></h4>

              
                Humans stand out in the animal kingdom for their ability to reason in highly abstract ways. Using a deep-data precision fMRI approach, we identify and richly characterize a network of frontal brain areas that support abstract formal reasoning. This 'abstract reasoning' network robustly dissociates from the domain-general Multiple Demand network--the current leading candidate substrate of fluid intelligence--as well as from three other networks supporting high-level cognition: the language network, the intuitive physical reasoning network, and the social reasoning network. Finally, the areas of this network respond robustly during both deductive and inductive reasoning, during classic matrix reasoning problems, and when solving multiplication and division problems. This network may therefore support the most abstract forms of reasoning, possibly constituting a human-specific adaptation.

                Introduction Traumatic ulcers are among the most prevalent injuries with a reported incidence of up to 95%. This study aims to evaluate Stem Cells from Human Exfoliated Deciduous Teeth Spent Medium (SHED-SM) nanoemulgel on the viability cells of NIH-3T3 and buccal mucosal ulcer wounds. Materials and methods The viability cells test of SHED-SM was analyzed on NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells using MTT. Thirty male Wistar rats, 2-3 months, were used as experimental subjects. Traumatic ulcer models were created by excising the right buccal mucosa with a 3 mm punch biopsy. Subjects were divided into 2 groups @15 rats for the treatment (SHED-SM) and control. The gel was applied on the surface once a day for 4 days. Evaluation was conducted on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) and immunohistochemical were stained to evaluate a number of neutrophils and the expression of COX-2, VEGF, and Col-1. Results The one-way ANOVA results showed significant differences in the viability test, the number of neutrophils, and the expression of COX-2, Col-1, and VEGF. The number of neutrophils and the expression of COX-2, Col-1, and VEGF were higher in the treatment group compared to the control. Conclusion SHED-SM demonstrates potential to accelerate the healing of traumatic buccal mucosal ulcers.

                Predatory bacteria are abundant in soil, but their diversity and functions remain not fully understood, especially in subarctic regions. Here, we report strain 1-FT3.2, a predatory bacterium obtained from peatland soil in Northern Finland (Pallas, 68 °N). The bacterium was cultivated on Mucilaginibacter cryoferens FT3.2 as prey. Although a pure culture of strain 1-FT3.2 was not obtained, its draft genome was assembled from sequencing reads derived from the co-culture with its prey. The draft genome of 1-FT3.2 is 7.2 Mb in length and 81% complete. Genome analyses suggested that 1-FT3.2 belongs to the family Polyangiaceae (phylum Myxococcota), which comprises predatory bacteria. The genome annotation revealed (near-)complete metabolic modules of central carbon metabolism and aerobic respiration. Two proviral regions were predicted in the draft genome, both putatively representing tailed phages of the class Caudoviricetes. Several CRISPR-Cas system proteins were also identified. The draft genome sequence could be used in future comparative studies assessing the diversity of predatory bacteria in northern soils or other environments.

                Background Pakistan experienced six COVID-19 waves with varying SARS-CoV-2 variants. Vaccination campaigns began in 2021, in an age-stratified manner starting with the older-aged individuals, yet the relationship between vaccination status and variant transmission remains unclear. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic diversity in relation to age and vaccination status, with a focus on children. Methods We analyzed 569 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected across Pakistan from May 2021 to October 2022. Metadata including age, sex, and vaccination status were retrieved from GISAID. Additional data such as viral load was available for a set of 143 pediatric samples (< 18 years) sequenced at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, and was analyzed separately to gain further insights. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the Augur pipeline and visualized via Auspice. Viral loads were inferred from Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic assays. Results Among the 569 genomes, Delta (45.2%) dominated in 2021 and Omicron (45.9%) in 2022. Of these, 71% were from individuals <18 years; 29.3% were vaccinated. Variant distribution showed no significant difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (p=0.75), nor between age groups (<18 vs ≥18 years; p=0.60). Pediatric samples from AKUH Karachi mirrored national trends, with Delta predominating in 2021 and Omicron in 2022. Omicron variants were associated with higher viral loads (p<0.001). Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 variant distribution and genomic divergence were comparable across vaccination status and age groups. In a population with high subclinical transmission and delayed pediatric vaccination, our findings highlight the stability of variant spread irrespective of host immunity status, suggesting the role of widespread prior exposure in shaping transmission dynamics.

                Background This study explores how sensory experiences within hospital environments influence the emotional responses of pediatric oncology patients, particularly those undergoing palliative chemotherapy. Pediatric journeys through healthcare spaces are not solely defined by clinical interactions but are shaped by continuous sensory exposure. This research aims to examine how visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory inputs during hospital stays affect emotional regulation, stress, and readiness for treatment among children. Methods A qualitative, exploratory design was used, applying an interpretive approach to capture nuanced emotional experiences. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews with pediatric patients and caregivers, direct environmental observation, and sensory journey mapping. Emotional responses were coded and interpreted using thematic analysis, supported by the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) emotional framework to identify patterns of engagement and disengagement across different sensory touchpoints. Result Findings show that children exposed to coherent multisensory environments—those with soft lighting, comforting textures, and calming sounds—demonstrated reduced anxiety and enhanced emotional coping. In contrast, fragmented environments with clinical noises, sterile visuals, and abrupt transitions intensified emotional distress, confusion, and behavioral withdrawal. Key friction points were not associated with medical procedures alone but often emerged from sensory overload or absence of meaningful sensory stimuli during waiting or transitional phases. Conclusion Hospital environments in pediatric oncology settings significantly contribute to the emotional quality of care. Sensory design that integrates adaptable, trauma-informed, and child-centered features can reduce stress and foster emotional resilience. This study suggests the need for multisensory design frameworks that move beyond aesthetics to support children’s agency and well-being throughout their treatment journey.

                Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat requiring effective control through Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASP). Pharmacists play a key role in ensuring rational antibiotic use, yet the effectiveness of ASP depends on institutional support and multidisciplinary collaboration. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of training on hospital pharmacists’ competence and its correlation with ASP implementation at the hospital level. Methods A quasi-experimental pre–post intervention design without a control group was conducted among 103 pharmacists from 29 hospitals in Riau Islands Province between August 2024 and January 2025. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon, McNemar, and Spearman correlation tests. Results Pharmacists’ competence significantly improved after the training (Z = -8.825, p < 0.001), with 94.2% showing improvement in competence category. However, no significant correlation was found between pharmacists’ competence improvement and hospital ASP performance (r = 0.046; p = 0.813). These findings indicate that ASP effectiveness depends not only on pharmacists’ capacity but also on hospital structural support, the role of attending physicians, and collaboration among other healthcare professionals. Conclusion ASP training effectively enhances pharmacists’ competence but is insufficient to drive systemic improvement in antimicrobial resistance control. Successful AMS implementation requires a multidisciplinary approach, managerial policy support, and strengthened human resource capacity and microbiology laboratory infrastructure within hospitals.

                While the prognosis of thyroid cancer (TC) was generally excellent, there was a long-term concern regarding the risk of subsequent second primary malignancies (SPM) following radioactive iodine (RAI). This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the pooled risk of SPM occurrence following RAI therapy. The study searched the literature across three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect), and was followed by citation searching. Original observational studies assessing the risk of SPM following RAI in TC were included. The Newcastle Ottawa scale was used for methodological assessment. STATA 17.0 was used for statistical analysis. A total of 18 studies encompassing 1,189,992 patients were included (638,275 in the RAI group and 551,717 in the non-RAI group). Pooled meta-analysis demonstrated no statistically significant increase in the risk of SPMs in the RAI-treated group, with a pooled RR of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.96 –1.21; p = 0.23). This result was deemed robust based on leave-one-out analysis. Subgroup analysis across publication year, follow-up duration (>10 years vs ≤10 years), population size, and SPM site (including breast, genitourinary, gastrointestinal-hepatobiliary, respiratory, skin, hematology, central nervous system, head and neck) consistently showed comparable results. There was no evidence of a significantly increased risk of SPM among TC survivors treated with RAI.

                Background Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid-Schiff (AB/PAS), and Giemsa stains are routinely used in the histopathological evaluation of gastric biopsies. However, comparative data on their diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness in detecting Helicobacter pylori are limited. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using H&E and AB/PAS as alternatives to Giemsa. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 816 gastric biopsy cases collected between 2019 and 2021. Three slides (H&E, Giemsa, and AB/PAS) were previously prepared from each paraffin-embedded tissue sample and blindly evaluated by three independent examiners. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall diagnostic accuracy were calculated using 2×2 contingency tables. Results H&E showed a sensitivity of 51.6%, specificity of 74.4%, and diagnostic accuracy of 66.4%, while AB/PAS had a sensitivity of 45.9%, specificity of 73.2%, and accuracy of 63.7%. H&E was the most cost-effective and fastest method; AB/PAS was the most expensive and time-consuming. Giemsa demonstrated superior diagnostic performance. Conclusions H&E offers practical benefits for screening but lacks sufficient sensitivity for definitive diagnosis. AB/PAS is less effective and less economical. Giemsa remains the most reliable stain for H. pylori detection. Combining H&E with Giemsa may optimize both efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Further prospective studies are warranted.

                Background Direct repeats in close proximity are targets of the single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway, a mutagenic DNA repair process that impacts genome integrity. Understanding the evolution and consequences of these sequences is a critical part of understanding eukaryotic genome evolution. Methods DirectRepeateR, an open-source R package that scans FASTA assemblies for exact, co-oriented repeats within a user-defined spacer window. We illustrate the utility of our software in an analysis of the Aedes aegypti genome by testing whether the distribution of direct repeats is consistent with selection acting against repeats in genic regions. Results Our results suggest that selection has acted against direct repeats that flank or overlap with protein-coding DNA sequences. Conclusion Our software provides an accurate and computationally efficient, user-friendly, and tailorable approach for detecting direct repeats.

Olivocerebellar learning is highly adaptable, unfolding over minutes to weeks depending on the task. However, the stabilizing mechanisms of the synaptic dynamics necessary for ongoing learning remain unclear. We constructed a model to examine plasticity dynamics under stochastic input and investigate the impact of inferior olive (IO) reverberations on Purkinje cell (PCs) activity and synaptic plasticity. We explored Upbound and Downbound cerebellar micromodules, which are organized loops of IO neurons, cerebellar nuclei neurons and microzones of PCs characterized by their unique molecular profiles and different levels of baseline firing. Our findings show synaptic weight convergence followed by stability of synaptic weights. In line with their relatively low and high intrinsic firing, we observed that Upbound and Downbound PCs have a propensity for potentiation and depression, respectively, with both PC types reaching stability at differential levels of overall strength of their parallel-fiber (PF) inputs. The oscillations and coupling of IO neurons participating in the Upbound and Downbound modules determine at which frequency band PFs can be stabilized optimally. Our results indicate that specific frequency components drive IO resonance and synchronicity, which, in turn, regulate temporal patterning across Upbound and Downbound zones, orchestrating their plasticity dynamics.

                <p>by Carlos Owusu-Ansah, Elan Shatoff, Ralf Bundschuh</p>

Genomic variants influence phenotypes and organismal fitness, with their effects shaped by genomic context. In 3’ untranslated regions, variants can alter phenotypes by influencing RNA-protein binding and subsequent post-transcriptional gene regulation. Here, we investigate how indel variants impact RNA-protein interactions from outside the binding site, through changes in RNA secondary structure. Our findings reveal that indels can significantly affect protein binding affinities over distances spanning tens of nucleotides, with longer indels exerting greater effects until saturation. Crucially, we find evidence that this effect is constrained by purifying selection. Naturally observed indel polymorphisms cause smaller changes in binding affinity than synthetic indels, and this signal of selection is more pronounced near HuR binding sites. We also find that the sequence context of HuR binding sites shows greater resilience to indel mutations compared to randomly selected sites. These results demonstrate that indel polymorphisms outside the binding site can modulate RNA-protein interactions through structural effects, and that purifying selection acts to filter out variants that disrupt critical interactions.

                <p>by Váleri N. Vásquez, Erin A. Mordecai, David Anthoff</p>

This paper introduces GeneDrive.jl, the first software package to optimize operational planning for the biological control of mosquito disease vectors (access: https://github.com/vnvasquez/GeneDrive.jl). Mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting a significant percentage of the global infectious disease burden, a problem being exacerbated as climate change shifts the range and alters the abundance of these temperature-sensitive arthropods. The efficacy and cost of vector control varies according to species, region, and intervention type. Meanwhile, existing computational tools lack the ability to explicitly tailor interventions for local health objectives and resource limitations. GeneDrive.jl addresses this equity and efficiency gap, which is of particular concern for the tropical regions that both bear the highest mosquito-borne disease burden and are subject to disproportionate climate impacts. The software customizes vector population reduction strategies that employ genetic biocontrol, a broad suite of technologies that alter the genotype or phenotype of mosquito disease vectors, according to specific health goals and financial constraints. It can also be used to characterize risk by analyzing the temperature-responsive dynamics of wildtype vectors. GeneDrive.jl is designed to accommodate two important realities shaping the future of vector-borne disease: first, the genetic-based tools that are defining a new era in control, and second, the uncertainty that increasingly variable and extreme temperatures bring for the climate-sensitive pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes. Written in the Julia programming language, the software provides a ‘build once, solve twice’ feature wherein users may define a problem, optimize it, and subsequently subject outcomes to scenario-based testing within a single coherent platform. We demonstrate the policy relevance of this scalable open-source framework via case studies featuring the use of Release of Insects with Dominant Lethality (RIDL) to suppress <i>Aedes aegypti</i> populations in the dengue-endemic region of Nha Trang, Vietnam. This work is intended for an interdisciplinary audience and includes a Glossary to facilitate understanding (see S1 Text).

Author summary: For a complex trait, heritability (h2) gives the genetic determination of its variation. Given the emergence of biobank-scale data, a more powerful method is needed to estimate h2. Based on the framework of Haseman-Elston regression (RHE-reg), we integrate a fast randomization algorithm to estimate h2, and RHE-reg can tackle biobank-scale data, such as UK Biobank (UKB), very efficiently. Furthermore, we present an analytical solution that balances computational cost and precision of the estimation, a property that is important in dealing with biobank-scale data. We investigated the performance of the RHE-reg in simulated data and also applied it for 81 UKB quantitative traits; as tested in UKB data of nearly 300,000 unrelated individuals, it took on average about 4.5 hours to complete an estimation when used 10 CPUs. We extended the application of RHE-reg into distributed datasets when privacy is not compromised. As shown in UKB and simulated data the performance of RHE-reg was accurate in estimating h2. The software for estimating SNP-heritability for biobank-scale data is released.

                <p>by Mehdi Ounissi, Ilias Sarbout, Jean-Pierre Hugot, Christine Martinez-Vinson, Dominique Berrebi, Daniel Racoceanu</p>

Chemical staining methods, while reliable, are time consuming and can be resource-intensive, involving costly chemical reagents and raising environmental concerns. This underscores the compelling need for alternative solutions such as virtual staining, which not only accelerates the diagnostic process but also enhances the flexibility of stain applications without the associated physical and chemical costs. Generative artificial intelligence technologies prove to be immensely useful in addressing these challenges. However, in healthcare, particularly within computational pathology, the high-stakes nature of decisions complicates the adoption of these tools due to their often opaque processes. Our work introduces an innovative approach that harnesses generative models for virtual stain transformations, improving performance, trustworthiness, scalability, and adaptability within computational pathology. The core of the proposed methodology involves a singular Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) encoder that supports multiple stain decoders. This design prioritizes critical regions in the latent space of H&E tissues, leading to a richer representation that enables precise synthetic stain generation by the decoders. Tested to simultaneously generate eight different stains from a single H&E slide, our method also offers significant scalability benefits for routine use by loading only necessary model components during production. We integrate label-free knowledge during training, using loss functions and regularization to minimize artifacts, thereby enhancing the accuracy of virtual staining in both paired and unpaired settings. To build trust in these synthetic stains, we employ a real-time self-inspection methodology using trained discriminators for each stain type, providing pathologists with confidence heatmaps to aid in their evaluations. In addition, we perform automatic quality checks on new H&E slides to ensure that they conform to the trained H&E distribution, guaranteeing the generation of high-quality synthetic stained slides. Recognizing the challenges pathologists face in adopting new technologies, we have encapsulated our method in an open-source, cloud-based proof-of-concept system. This system enables users to easily and virtually stain their H&E slides through a browser, eliminating the need for specialized technical knowledge and addressing common hardware and software challenges. It also facilitates real-time user feedback integration. Lastly, we have curated a novel dataset comprising eight different paired H&E/stains related to pediatric Crohn’s disease at diagnosis, providing 30 whole slide images (WSIs) for each stain set (total of 480 WSIs) to stimulate further research in computational pathology.

                <p>by Amjad Khalaf, Chenxi Zhou, Claudia C. Weber, Emmelien Vancaester, Ying Sims, Alex Makunin, Thomas C. Mathers, Dominic E. Absolon, Jonathan M. D. Wood, Shane A. McCarthy, Kamil S. Jaron, Mark Blaxter, Mara K. N. Lawniczak</p>

Microsporidia are single-celled, obligately intracellular parasites with growing public health, agricultural, and economic importance. Despite this, Microsporidia remain relatively enigmatic, with many aspects of their biology and evolution unexplored. Key questions include whether Microsporidia undergo sexual reproduction, and the nature of the relationship between tetraploid and diploid lineages. While few high-quality microsporidian genomes currently exist to help answer such questions, large-scale biodiversity genomics initiatives, such as the Darwin Tree of Life project, can generate high-quality genome assemblies for microsporidian parasites when sequencing infected host species. Here, we present 40 new microsporidian genome assemblies from infected arthropod hosts that were sequenced to create reference genomes. Out of the 40, 32 are complete genomes, eight of which are chromosome-level, and eight are partial microsporidian genomes. We characterized 14 of these as polyploid and five as diploid. We found that tetraploid genome haplotypes are consistent with autopolyploidy, in that they coalesce more recently than species, and that they likely recombine. Within some genomes, we found large-scale rearrangements between the homeologous genomes. We also observed a high rate of rearrangement between genomes from different microsporidian groups, and a striking tolerance for segmental duplications. Analysis of chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data indicated that tetraploid genomes are likely organized into two diploid units, similar to dikaryotic cells in fungi, with evidence of recombination within and between units. Together, our results provide evidence for the existence of a sexual cycle in Microsporidia, and suggest a model for the microsporidian lifecycle that mirrors fungal reproduction.

                <p>by Lan Xia, Guo-Liang Yin, Yu Long, Fei Sun, Bin-Bin Wang, Yun Zhu, Su-Ren Chen</p>

The assembly and physiological function of cilia and flagella depend on the stable association of A- and B-tubules, which form axonemal doublet microtubules (DMTs). However, the mechanisms underlying the connection of B-tubules to A-tubules to form DMTs in mammalian cilia/flagella are unclear. <i>CFAP77</i> encodes an outer junction (OJ) protein within DMTs that is conserved across many species and cell types. In this study, <i>Cfap77</i>-KO mice were generated to reveal that CFAP77 is essential for sperm progressive motility and male fertility. Loss of CFAP77 led to opened B-tubules specifically at the OJ regions of axonemal DMTs as revealed by conventional transmission electron microscopy. Cryo-electron tomography was used to further resolve the in situ structure of sperm axonemal DMTs directly from <i>Cfap77</i>-KO mice, which exhibited a loss of large filamentous density corresponding to the CFAP77-CCDC105-TEX43 ternary subcomplex at the OJ regions. Additionally, sperm proteomic analysis confirmed that CFAP77 knockout led to the complete loss of this ternary complex. Our work not only explores the physiological role of the OJ protein CFAP77 in axonemal A- and B-tubule connections in mammals but also combines in situ structural biology and knockout mice to reveal the underlying structural/molecular mechanism involved.

                <p>by Yi-Hsuan Cheng, Margaret S. Ho</p>

Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics have led to the identification of disease-associated microglia (DAM) as a distinct, conserved microglia state associated with mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and with aging. DAM are characterized by downregulation of homeostatic genes and upregulation of lipid metabolism and phagocytosis genes, including key risk factors for AD in humans. Although characterized in models of AD, whether DAM acts as universal sensor across all neurodegenerative diseases remains unknown. This Essay discusses the dynamics, origins, and therapeutic potential of DAM in neurodegeneration, alongside evidence supporting a protective role for them in regulating disease processes.

                <p>by Gabriel Henrique de Oliveira Caetano, Gopal Murali, Daniel Pincheira-Donoso, Reut Vardi, Lior Greenspoon, Shai Meiri, Uri Roll</p>

Human-induced environmental pressures are expected to intensify worldwide during the 21st century. Consequently, future-focused tools and approaches to anticipate pressures on biodiversity are key to effectively prioritize conservation actions and supplement existing approaches. Here, we develop a continuous conservation prioritization index, the Proactive Conservation Index (PCI), that integrates projected future extrinsic threats and traits that can predispose species’ vulnerability. We used the PCI to assess the conservation priority of 33,560 species of land vertebrates worldwide, compared our results to the extinction risk categories of these species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, and examined spatial and phylogenetic patterns in these species future conservation needs. We found that median PCI scores broadly followed the order expected under the IUCN Red List classification, but varied substantially within each IUCN Red List category. According to the PCI, reptiles will be the group of land vertebrates with highest conservation priority in the future, despite amphibians currently having the highest proportion of threatened species according to the IUCN Red List. The PCI revealed that species in the Near Threatened category will have future conservation needs more similar to species in threatened categories than to species in the Least Concern category. Arid ecoregions, tropical montane forests, and islands showed the highest differences between conservation priorities set using the PCI and the IUCN Red List, indicating possible unrecognized future conservation needs. The proportion of threatened species according to the IUCN Red List was uncorrelated with the protected area coverage of each ecoregion, while the PCI, by design, highlighted currently unprotected ecoregions with sensitive fauna that will have high exposure to threats in the future. We produced a user-friendly web application to display our results and an R package to enable users to calculate PCI scores for any taxon and region, customizing the index according to the severity of predicted threats and importance of species attributes in other systems. Our novel index can help practitioners prioritize fine-scale species conservation actions in light of future threats and different global change scenarios.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Wearable technology allows accurate measurement of turning while walking, with cross-sectional studies indicating that difficulty turning presents even in preclinical phases of Parkinson's disease. The aim of our study was to quantify rate of change of turning performance in a cohort of older adults, and test whether turning decline can predict future diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 1,051 participants from the Tübingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration (TREND) study were included for a 5-visit analysis over 10 years, with development of clinically evident Parkinson's disease tracked. Participants walked a 20-m hallway for 1 minute at their preferred pace, with a wearable device on the lower back. Longitudinal trajectories of turning performance were modelled using random effects linear mixed models to establish the interval between initial turning changes and Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Cox regression assessed whether initial turning measures could predict time to Parkinson's disease onset, controlling for age and sex.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of all participants, 23 were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease an average of 5.3 years post-baseline. Slower peak angular velocity at baseline was associated with a higher hazard of Parkinson's disease diagnosis, with deviations from controls emerging approximately 8.8 years before diagnosis. Additional analysis with a machine learning model using baseline characteristics of age, sex and peak angular velocity, identified 60% of prediagnostic Parkinson's disease (sensitivity: 0.600) and 80.5% non-prediagnostic Parkinson's disease (specificity: 0.805), with an area under the curve of 80.5%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Peak angular velocity during turning shows promise identifying and tracking motor progression in the pre-diagnostic phase of Parkinson's disease. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to test if blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, detected using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging, would predict progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) over the subsequent year in patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study included patients with a history of stroke and at least early confluence of WMH. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed at baseline (&gt; 3 months from stroke) and again 1 year later were segmented to calculate the WMH volume expressed as a fraction of the total brain volume. Change in WMH volume between the 2 timepoints and progression of WMH were the outcome measures. BBB disruption was measured using DSC imaging on the baseline MRI. WMH masks were dilated by 3 mm to create a mask of the adjacent normal appearing white matter (penumbra). BBB disruption was averaged within the WMH and the penumbra.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fifty patients were included; median age was 69 years, and 46% were women. The mean WMH fraction was 1.25% at baseline and 1.36% at 1 year. The mean baseline BBB disruption was 0.20% in the WMH and 0.22% in the penumbra. More severe BBB disruption was associated with greater WMH progression when measured in the WMH (<i>ß</i> = 0.95, confidence interval [CI] = 0.39–1.51, <i>r</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.19, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and in the penumbra (<i>ß</i> = 0.81, CI = 0.10–1.53, <i>r</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.027). The best predictor of progression was BBB disruption in the penumbra with an odds ratio (OR) of 2 (OR = 2, CI = 1.01–3.96, <i>p</i> = 0.046) for each 0.1% increase in BBB disruption.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>More severe BBB disruption was predictive of greater WMH progression in patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background This study systematically examines how behavioural biases affect investment decisions across formal and informal financial markets, with a focus on emerging economies. It aims to map the evolution of the field, highlight neglected cognitive biases, and uncover geographical and methodological gaps in current research. Methods A rigorous Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted using the PRISMA protocol, analysing 63 empirical studies from the Scopus database. Advanced bibliometric tools, VOSviewer and Biblioshiny, were employed to identify key trends, thematic clusters, and shifts in research focus in behavioural finance. Results The review reveals a heavy concentration of studies on biases such as overconfidence, herding, and loss aversion, primarily within formal market settings and South Asian contexts. Many other essential biases, including regret aversion, anchoring, and emotional influences, are still rarely studied. Very few studies test real-world solutions, such as education, digital tools, or reminders, that may help people make better financial decisions. Visual and longitudinal mapping demonstrate a rising academic interest after 2016, but expose a lack of representation from many regions and emerging behavioural dynamics. Research on informal investing and diverse cultural settings is also limited. Conclusion This review highlights that many investors, especially in emerging economies, are guided by emotions and mental shortcuts rather than careful reasoning. While interest in this topic has grown, most research still focuses on a few well-known biases and limited regions. Many significant biases, such as regret aversion and anchoring, remain underexplored. There is also very little evidence on what helps reduce these biases in real-world settings. This study advocates for more diverse, practical, and inclusive research that can help investors make informed financial decisions, particularly in informal markets where support is limited.

                Background A study within a trial (SWAT) can be used to compare the effectiveness of various recruitment aids. In this SWAT, we assessed the impact of incorporating a pictorial aid into an enhanced Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) versus utilising a standard PIL, nested within a trial comparing adjuvant therapy alone with adjuvant therapy plus axillary treatment for women with early-stage breast cancer with metastases in one or two sentinel nodes (the POSNOC trial). Methods The pictorial aid was designed to illustrate the treatment procedures in both arms of the POSNOC trial for potential participants. POSNOC recruiting sites were cluster randomised to provide potentially eligible women who were approached about taking part in the study with either the enhanced PIL or the standard PIL. Allocation was stratified by recruitment activity in the 12 months preceding the SWAT. Results Eighty sites participated in the SWAT, with 40 randomised to each arm. Between December 2019 and July 2021, 258 participants were recruited. The enhanced PIL group recruited 117 participants (mean = 2.9 per site) while the standard PIL sites recruited 141 participants (mean = 3.5 per site). There was no evidence of a between-group difference in recruitment (adjusted difference in mean in enhanced vs standard PIL = -0.68, 95% CI -1.99 to 0.63, p=0.31). Conclusion The study found no evidence that an enhanced PIL increased recruitment compared with the standard PIL. These data may contribute to future systematic reviews of randomised studies of recruitment interventions.

                Investment in education to guarantee gender equity in developing countries has often focused on pedagogy, facilities, and cultural factors. However, private schools provide examples that, if leveraged, can improve girls’ enrollment in STEM education. This quantitative comparative study examined the impact of school ownership on female enrollment in Mbeya City, Tanzania, analyzing 7936 candidates from 58 secondary schools (32 private) who sat for the 2022 Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (CSEE). Of these, 2232 candidates were from private schools. Analysis using chi-square tests and graphical methods revealed that private schools not only had higher female enrollment in STEM subjects but also showed no gender bias in performance, whereas boys outperformed girls in public schools. Among 2202 candidates who passed basic mathematics, 999 were girls, with 626 (63%) from private schools. The study concludes that collaboration with private schools can enhance female enrollment and close gender gaps in STEM performance. It recommends that policymakers engage private schools and encourage science students to take both physics and mathematics for sustainable STEM education development.

                Background The representation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is disproportionate to graduates from STEM fields. There is limited research addressing challenges facing women retention in STEM in the UAE. Methods A cross-sectional study using a validated questionnaire was conducted. A total of 165 participants were enrolled; 62% males and 35% females. Results More women believed there is gender inequality in STEM (47% versus 28%). 44% of female participants experienced gender inequality in their career. Men were significantly less likely to experience gender inequality (OR=0.06, 95% CI=0.02-0.16). Women reported lack of organizational emphasis on diversity and inclusion for promotion to leadership (44% versus 60%). Conclusion Data confirms gender-based preconceptions and biases in STEM fields. Institutional initiatives and policies to challenge stereotypes and promote gender equality are required. Governmental role is crucial in creating an inclusive environment for women scientists.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Secretagogin (scgn), a novel calcium-binding protein (CBP), regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in neurons, controls exocytosis, and serves as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor. Scgn is widely expressed in the mammalian brain and has emerged as a novel neuroendocrine regulator. Although scgn is considered as a phylogenetically conserved CBP, little is known about its significance in the brain of nonmammalian vertebrates. Herein, we characterized the scgn-encoding cDNA and mapped scgn-equipped elements in the brain and spinal cord of a gecko, <i>Hemidactylus leschenaultii</i> (<i>hl</i>). In the brain, a 1303-bp <i>hlscgn</i> transcript containing 822-bp cds and 481-bp 3′ untranslated region (UTR) was identified. The <i>hlscgn</i> transcript predicted to encode a hexa EF-hand 273-aa hlscgn showed 70%–90% similarity with scgn from other vertebrates. The EF2-motif in hlscgn showed highest Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity as compared to that in scgn from other vertebrates. The anti-scgn antiserum detected a ∼32-kDa band in the brain, and cell bodies/fibers in the cortex, dorsal ventricular ridge, amygdalae, striatum/septum, hypothalamic/thalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, interpeduncular, solitary tract, and raphe nuclei, and spinal cord. The scgn neurons in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei co-expressed either thyrotropin-releasing hormone or vasotocin, but not mesotocin. As insulin regulates the activity of PVN neurons in mammals, and scgn expression in the mammalian/teleost brains, the superfused hypothalamic slices of <i>H. leschenaultii</i> were treated with insulin, and the changes in scgn-ir/<i>hlscgn</i>-mRNA in PVN were analyzed. Compared to control, insulin treatment significantly increased scgn expression. Thus, scgn seems to be a highly conserved protein in the vertebrate hierarchy with a variety of attributes, inclusive of neuroanatomy, neuroendocrine control, and regulation by insulin.</p>

                Li et al. reported that hypothalamic FSTL1 is downregulated in obese mice. FSTL1 signaling in AgRP neurons prevents diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders. Hypothalamic FSTL1 plays a metabolic regulatory role through the insulin signaling cascade. Intranasal targeting of FSTL1 improves insulin sensitivity and promotes weight loss in diet-induced obesity.

Broad intrusions of warm subsurface water, funneled by seafloor channels along retrograde bed slopes, have driven intense basal melting of the ice, which triggered faster ice flow and ice thinning. The cumulative glacier mass loss of 131 Gt since 1996 is one of the largest in Antarctica.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92992">Asymmetric cortical projections to striatal direct and indirect pathways distinctly control actions</a></h4>

              
                The striatal direct and indirect pathways constitute the core for basal ganglia function in action control. Although both striatal D1- and D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs) receive excitatory inputs from the cerebral cortex, whether or not they share inputs from the same cortical neurons, and how pathway-specific corticostriatal projections control behavior remain largely unknown. Here using a G-deleted rabies system in mice, we found that more than two-thirds of excitatory inputs to D2-SPNs also target D1-SPNs, while only one-third do so vice versa. Optogenetic stimulation of striatal D1- vs. D2-SPN-projecting cortical neurons differently regulate locomotion, reinforcement learning, and sequence behavior, implying the functional dichotomy of pathway-specific corticostriatal subcircuits. These results reveal the partially segregated yet asymmetrically overlapping cortical projections on striatal D1- vs. D2-SPNs, and that the pathway-specific corticostriatal subcircuits distinctly control behavior. It has important implications in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric diseases affecting cortico-basal ganglia circuitry.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102941">Twist is the key to the gating of mechanosensitive ion channel NOMPC</a></h4>

              
                NOMPC, a tethered mechanosensitive ion channel belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, converts mechanical stimuli into ionic electric signals that excite neuronal cells (Yan et al., 2013). Previous investigations have demonstrated that a pushing force applied to the linker helix domain or the compression of NOMPC’s ankyrin repeat (AR) domain can trigger channel opening (Wang et al., 2021). In this study, we explored the direct mechanical causes of NOMPC channel opening as well as the torsional properties of the AR domain, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Our results indicate that a torque directed toward the extracellular side, exerted on the amphipathic TRP domain, is the primary factor driving channel opening. The coupling between compression and twisting of the AR domain ensures that both types of deformation can induce channel opening. Therefore, we propose a twist-to-open model, facilitated by the compression-twist coupling property of the AR domain, to provide further insight into the gating mechanism of the NOMPC channel.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105555">The capsule and genetic background, rather than specific individual loci, strongly influence in vitro pneumococcal growth kinetics</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial growth characteristics intrinsic to each strain can impact and influence gene expression, antibiotic susceptibility, and disease pathogenesis. However, little is known about specific genomic variations that influence these bacterial growth features. Here, we investigate the impact of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> genetics on its in vitro growth features to shed light on genes that may be important targets in the development of vaccines and therapeutics. We use statistical models to estimate growth features and demonstrate that they varied significantly across capsular serotypes and lineages, were strongly correlated with phylogeny, and showed high heritability, highlighting a strong genetic basis. Despite this, genome-wide association studies revealed no specific genomic loci statistically associated with the growth features independently of the genetic background, including those in the locus responsible for capsular polysaccharide synthesis. Our findings suggest that the serotype and lineage, as well as a combination of genomic loci, influence intrinsic pneumococcal growth kinetics, which may have implications for pneumococcal disease pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106196">TopBP1 biomolecular condensates as a new therapeutic target in advanced-stage colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                In cancer cells, ATR signaling is crucial to tolerate the intrinsically high damage levels that normally block replication fork progression. Assembly of TopBP1, a multifunctional scaffolding protein, into condensates is required to amplify ATR kinase activity to the levels needed to coordinate the DNA damage response and manage DNA replication stress. Many ATR inhibitors are tested for cancer treatment in clinical trials, but their overall effectiveness is often compromised by the emergence of resistance and toxicities. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose to disrupt the ATR pathway by targeting TopBP1 condensation. First, we screened a molecule-based library using a previously developed optogenetic approach and identified several TopBP1 condensation inhibitors. Among them, AZD2858 disrupted TopBP1 assembly induced by the clinically relevant topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38, thereby inhibiting the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway. We found that AZD2858 exerted its effects by disrupting TopBP1 self-interaction and binding to ATR in mammalian cells, and by increasing its chromatin recruitment in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts. Moreover, AZD2858 prevented S-phase checkpoint induction by SN-38, leading to increased DNA damage and apoptosis in a colorectal cancer cell line. Lastly, AZD2858 showed a synergistic effect in combination with the FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen in a spheroid model of colorectal cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101325">3D directional tuning in the orofacial sensorimotor cortex during natural feeding and drinking</a></h4>

              
                Directional tongue movements are crucial for feeding and speech, ensuring proper food positioning for chewing and swallowing, as well as accurate sound production. While directional tuning in the arm region of the sensorimotor cortex during reaching tasks is well studied, little is known about how three-dimensional (3D) tongue direction is encoded in the orofacial sensorimotor cortex (OSMCx) during natural behaviors. Understanding this neural representation has important implications for rehabilitating individuals with orolingual dysfunctions. This study examines the directional tuning and population dynamics in OSMCx during naturalistic feeding and drinking, and how these are affected by sensory loss. Using biplanar video-radiography, we tracked implanted tongue markers in behaving rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and simultaneously recorded 3D positional data with spiking activity from chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary motor (MIo) and somatosensory (SIo) areas of the orofacial cortex. In some sessions, tasks were preceded by bilateral nerve block injections to the sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve. Modulation to 3D tongue direction during feeding and drinking was found in most MIo and SIo neurons. Directional information at both individual and population levels was higher in feeding and was more robust in MIo. Following sensory loss, alterations in tongue kinematics were accompanied by changes in directional information in MIo and SIo, manifesting as modifications in both individual neuron tuning characteristics and the broader dynamics of population-level neural activity. This study advances our understanding of single-neuron and population activity in OSMCx and their potential contributions to the sensorimotor control of complex naturalistic tongue movements. By extending current knowledge of orofacial control to 3D tongue movements, our findings demonstrate the specificity and adaptability of population activity in MIo and SIo in response to different behavioral contexts, providing important insights for understanding neural mechanisms underlying skilled tongue control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103977">Exploring neurodevelopment via spatiotemporal collation of anatomical networks with NeuroSC</a></h4>

              
                Volume electron microscopy (vEM) datasets such as those generated for connectome studies allow nanoscale quantifications and comparisons of the cell biological features underpinning circuit architectures. Quantifying cell biological relationships in the connectome yields rich, multidimensional datasets that benefit from data science approaches, including dimensionality reduction and integrated graphical representations of neuronal relationships. We developed NeuroSC (<i>also known as NeuroSCAN,</i> <a href="https://neurosc.net/">https://neurosc.net/</a>) an open source online platform that bridges sophisticated graph analytics from data science approaches with the underlying cell biological features in the connectome. We analyze a series of published <i>C. elegans</i> brain neuropils and demonstrate how these integrated representations of neuronal relationships facilitate comparisons across connectomes, catalyzing new insights into the structure-function relationships of the circuits and their changes during development. NeuroSC is designed for intuitive examination and comparisons across connectomes, enabling synthesis of knowledge from high-level abstractions of neuronal relationships derived from data science techniques to the detailed identification of the cell biological features underpinning these abstractions.

">Indirect Deuterium Displacement Exchange Imaging for Non-invasive High-Resolution CSF Production Mapping</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production is central to brain homeostasis, yet existing measurement techniques are invasive, technically demanding, and confounded by intracranial perturbations. Here, we introduce indirect deuterium displacement exchange imaging (CSF-iDDxI), a noninvasive MRI approach for mapping CSF production in vivo. The method leverages intravenously infused deuterium oxide (D2O), which crosses the blood-CSF barrier, replaces existing H2O in CSF, producing concentration-dependent attenuation of proton (1H) signal within CSF spaces. Using high-resolution 3D balanced steady-state free precession MRI in rats, we demonstrate robust and spatially widespread D2O-induced CSF signal loss that is selectively suppressed by acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor known to suppress CSF production by the choroid plexus. Dynamic imaging during intravenous D2O infusion further revealed that cortical parenchymal signal changes were unaffected by acetazolamide, confirming specificity to CSF production. Exploratory kinetic modeling estimated rapid CSF water turnover (k ~ 0.09 min-1) under physiological conditions, reduced to k ~ 0.031 min-1 with acetazolamide suppression, consistent with prior isotope tracer studies. Together, these findings establish CSF-iDDxI as a sensitive, pharmacologically validated tool for quantifying CSF production and turnover.

">Imagined movement increases the segregation of brain-heart networks</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the mechanisms of motor imagery, the mental simulation of movement without execution, is key for the development of neurotechnologies. For instance, for detecting covert motor intent in noncommunicative patients or refining motor commands through brain-computer interfaces. While motor imagery engages motor-related brain regions, its precise mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in relation to cardiac dynamics. Evidence suggests heart-rate variability features have potential to enhance tasks classifications, yet the brain-heart relationship is not well understood. In this study, we examined motor imagery learning using a task involving right-hand grasping imagery. We found that motor imagery is correlated with a cardiac sympathetic uncoupling with directed connectivity within the motor cortex. Additionally, cerebellar-supplementary motor area segregation, in relation to cardiac parasympathetic activity, indexed longitudinal motor learning. These results suggest that varying patterns of heart rhythmicity and brain connectivity within the motor network actively change during motor imagery, suggesting the brain-heart axis as influencer of sensorimotor function and associated neuroplasticity of learning.

">Neuroprotective action of agonists and modulators of A 1 adenosine receptors upon hyperexcitation: mechanism of the antiepileptic activity and role of neuron-glial interaction</a></h4>

              
                Hyperexcitation of neuronal networks is believed to be the main reason for the excitotoxic death of neurons in different central nervous system pathologies, including epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. G i-coupled receptors can be considered as promising targets for the development of new neuroprotectors. Here, we studied the anticonvulsant activity of the agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of A 1 adenosine receptors (A 1 Rs). Our experiments demonstrate that A 1 R agonists, CCPA and N 6-cyclohexyladenosine (N 6-CHA), suppress hyperexcitation in three different in vitro models , including acute glutamate excitotoxicity, NH 4 Cl-and bicuculline-induced epileptiform activity. We have found that the inhibitory action of the agonists is mediated by the activation of not only the neuronal A 1 Rs but also the astrocytic receptors. In astrocytes, A 1 R agonists enhance GABA release, possibly via induction of calcium transients. Using inhibitory analysis, we have demonstrated that G{beta}{gamma}-mediated activation of phospholipase C and subsequent Ca 2+ mobilization from internal stores are essential for generating calcium transients in astrocytes following N 6-CHA application. We have shown first that Ca 2+-dependent activation of protein kinase C, which is involved in the mechanism of GABA release by astrocytes, is a pivotal step in the realization of the antiepileptic action of A 1 R agonists. Moreover, using the model of epileptiform activity induced by GABA A R blockade, we have shown that PAMs, PD81723 and VCP171, also suppress hyperexcitation. Furthermore, using the picrotoxin-induced epilepsy model in mice, we demonstrated that A 1 R agonists exhibit significant anticonvulsant effects and improve animal survival. The PAMs PD81723 and VCP171, when administered one hour before seizure induction, did not significantly affect seizure severity or survival rates. However, chronic administration of VCP171 produced a pronounced anticonvulsant effect and significantly increased survival.. Importantly, PAMs provided therapeutic benefits without significantly affecting overall activity levels in mice. Thus, our study demonstrates that both agonists and PAMs of A 1 R can be considered as potential therapeutic agents with antiepileptic and neuroprotective activity.

">Modelling Predictive Coding in the Primary Visual Cortex (V1): Layer 4 Receptive Field Properties in a Balanced Recurrent Spiking Neuronal Network</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the cortex encodes sensory input in a biologically efficient and computationally robust manner remains a central question in neuroscience. Predictive coding offers a compelling theoretical framework for such cortical processing, but existing models lack the biological detail to fully explain the function of the cortical microcircuits. This study introduces a spiking neural network model of layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1), grounded in predictive coding principles, to clarify how the thalamorecipient layer transforms feedforward input into prediction-error-like signals under realistic excitatory-inhibitory constraints and to yield testable circuit-level predictions. The model integrates structured feedforward input, distinct excitatory and inhibitory populations, and balanced lateral connectivity to simulate spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity. Network responses are systematically examined under spatially unstructured noise input and structured grating stimuli. Neural membrane potentials encode real-time reconstruction errors between external input and internal estimates, with spikes dynamically correcting these mismatches. The network reproduces hallmark in vivo features, including irregular spontaneous activity, sparse and selective responses, and emergent orientation and phase tuning. Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) balance was maintained across conditions, with inhibitory neurons exhibiting tighter input coupling than excitatory neurons. Furthermore, the network exhibited contrast-dependent modulation of firing rates and E-I balance, dynamically adjusting its activity to changes in input strength. Decoding analyses demonstrates that structured inputs can be robustly reconstructed under moderate noise levels, although decoding fidelity declines sharply under severe corruption. Together, these results suggest that cortical layer 4 may serve as a structured sensory encoding stage in a hierarchical predictive coding system, providing a biologically grounded foundation for modeling prediction error computations in higher cortical areas.

">Cardiac-neurovascular crosstalk: Cardiac rhythms reveal maladaptive cerebral autoregulation and constrained ventilatory status</a></h4>

              
                In the context of brain-heart interactions, several pathways have been proposed to mediate feedback loops between neurophysiological oscillations. However, the role of cerebrovascular dynamics in shaping this interplay remains poorly understood. In particular, the interaction between cardiac autonomic control, ventilation mechanisms, and cerebral autoregulation is not well characterized, especially in ageing and post-stroke conditions, where cerebral perfusion is often compromised. In a cohort of 57 elderly participants, including 30 stroke survivors, we investigated the relationship between cardiac sympathetic activity and both, cerebral blood flow regulation and ventilatory status. Sympathetic reflexes, assessed via cardiac sympathetic index (CSI) during sit-to-stand transitions, were preserved across all participants, with no significant group differences between stroke and non-stroke populations. However, among individuals with constrained ventilation, indexed by reduced end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) at baseline, we identified a more elevated CSI following postural change, scaling with the degree of CO2 dysregulation. Furthermore, transcranial Doppler measurements revealed exaggerated changes in mean flow velocity (MFV) within the right middle cerebral artery in most participants. These MFV shifts significantly correlated with the magnitude of cardiac sympathetic change under orthostatic stress, suggesting that CSI can capture maladaptive neurovascular responses. Together, these findings highlight a distinct cardiac-neurovascular crosstalk in elderly individuals, revealing a potential mechanism of compensatory overactivation under impaired cerebrovascular control.

">Comparative gene editing reduces dopamine receptor levels across rodent species</a></h4>

              
                Translational challenges in neuroscience originate from species-specific differences that limit the generalizability of experimental findings. Comparative approaches can help distinguish conserved from species-specific mechanisms, but their application has been limited by the lack of molecular tools beyond traditional model organisms, complicating direct comparisons of conserved and divergent mechanisms of neural function. This gap is particularly evident for the dopaminergic system, a key regulator of motivated behaviors across species and the principal pharmacological target for current psychotherapies. Building on our recent development of comparative gene editing, we here present an adeno-associated virus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to reduce in vivo dopamine receptors D1 and D2 levels across the rodent phylogeny. Using this approach, we achieved specific reduction of receptor levels in three rodent species (house mouse, prairie vole, and Syrian hamster), which we demonstrate with radioactive ligand binding assays. This toolkit expands the reach of comparative gene editing approaches, enabling functional investigation of the dopaminergic system across rodent species. Thereby, it supports comparative neuroscience by facilitating the identification of conserved versus species-specific neural mechanisms with enhanced translational potential.

">PDZD8 deficiency drives lipid accumulation in SNr and dopaminergic disinhibition</a></h4>

              
                The basal ganglia integrate cortical inputs to regulate motor, cognitive, and emotional behaviors through precisely balanced inhibitory and excitatory circuits. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) serves as a major output nucleus exerting tonic inhibition over thalamic and midbrain targets. However, how lipid metabolic disturbances affect SNr circuitry and dopaminergic regulation remains unclear. Here, we identify a crucial role for the lipid transport protein PDZD8 in maintaining basal ganglia circuit integrity. PDZD8 deficiency leads to marked lipid and lipofuscin accumulation selectively in the SNr, accompanied by enhanced striatal inhibitory inputs and reduced SNr projections to the ventromedial thalamus (VM) and midbrain dopaminergic nuclei (SNc, VTA). This circuit reorganization results in functional disinhibition and hyperactivation of dopaminergic neurons, producing maladaptive reinforcement of striatal inhibition. Our previous findings revealed that PDZD8 deficient mice exhibit hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and impaired fear memory, behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings demonstrate that lipid accumulation in the SNr disrupts inhibitory output and dopaminergic regulation, forming a maladaptive basal ganglia thalamocortical loop. Our study provides the first mechanistic link between lipid metabolic dysfunction, dopaminergic disinhibition, and ADHD like behavioral phenotypes, highlighting PDZD8 as a key regulator of metabolic circuit coupling in the basal ganglia.

">Parkinson's disease risk factors are expressed at brain barriers.</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but whether its etiology is cell autonomous remains unclear. Increasing evidence implicates the blood-central nervous system (CNS) barriers in disease development, highlighting the importance of identifying genetic risk factors linked to cells forming the cerebrovasculature to advance this emerging area of research. The objective of this study is to identify PD genetic risk factors associated with blood-brain (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSFB) barriers, and to validate protein localization in human tissue and experimental models. To do so, we integrated genome-wide association studies and single nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets from the human postmortem substantia nigra (SN), midbrain, or cortical samples from control and PD donors. An in-depth bioinformatics analysis identified genes enriched in cell types that form the multicellular architecture of brain barriers, including CAVIN2, ANXA1, ANO2, and LRP1B. We further validated whether corresponding proteins were present in cell types associated with the blood-CNS barriers in human and mouse post-mortem tissues, as well as in iPSC-differentiated cells and choroid plexus organoids. Results showed that quantifying the proportion of endothelial cells expressing PD-related genes was under-evaluated at the transcript level compared to immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, we observed that CAVIN2 and ANXA1 proteins were more abundant at the vasculature of the substantia nigra vs. cortex, and CAVIN2 protein levels were reduced in PD vs. control human postmortem tissues. In contrast, the investigation of mouse postmortem samples demonstrated that the CAVIN2 protein is only present in a subset of mouse blood vessels, compared to nearly all vessels in human tissue. Similarly, mouse ANXA1 protein localizes to dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and not at the vasculature, as seen in human tissue. The primary outcome of this study is the identification of PD-relevant risk genes specifically expressed at brain barriers and enriched in PD-relevant brain regions. The secondary outcome is the demonstration of poor transcript-protein correlation in - at least - a subset of PD risk factors, and a low interspecies conservation of protein localization for the selected candidates. In conclusion, the BBB and BCSFB may represent understudied contributors to PD, endothelial-specific proteins appear differentially regulated compared to transcripts, and experimental models require comprehensive validation to ensure relevance to the human condition.

">Voluntary Dissociation of Motor Unit Activity in the Vastii Muscles</a></h4>

              
                The CNS coordinates movement through consistent activation patterns across muscles and motor units, suggesting the presence of a relatively fixed and high-dimensional number of neural constraints on voluntary actions. In the human quadriceps, the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) control the knee extensor torque and are considered a synergistic pair largely activated by shared neural inputs. However, some evidence suggests that these muscles, or even subregions within them, can be controlled independently. In this study, we investigated whether humans can dissociate neural input to VM and VL during isometric contractions. Ten participants received real-time feedback from multiple intramuscular EMG electrodes that targeted different regions of the VM and VL while attempting to activate each muscle or sub-regions selectively. We found that nine out of ten subjects were able to clearly separate VM and VL activity based on the intramuscular EMG feedback. However, motor unit decomposition from the intramuscular EMGs revealed that selective recruitment of a unique set of motor units was possible only within the proximal region of VM. In contrast, VL and distal VM showed highly correlated activation, indicating tight functional coupling. Correlation analyses confirmed that the proximal VM exhibited distinct activation profiles compared with both distal VM and VL, supporting the existence of compartmentalized control within VM. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to dissociate the activation of motor units within this synergistic muscle group during low-force isometric contractions.

">Nuclear receptor-neurotransmitter coupling links behavior to metabolic state</a></h4>

              
                Animals must flexibly respond to environmental stimuli to survive, and optimal responses critically depend on the organism's current needs. Many organisms have evolved both cell-intrinsic and intertissue signaling pathways that integrate metabolic status. However, how this information is encoded in molecular signals is currently not well understood. Here we show that the nematode C. elegans employs lipidated neurohormones that combine the neurotransmitter octopamine and fat metabolism-derived building blocks to relay information about lipid metabolic status and drive inhibition of aversive olfactory responses during food removal. Using targeted metabolomics, we show that lipidated neurohormone synthesis requires the carboxylesterase CEST-2.1, which links octopamine-glucosides with endogenous methyl-branched or diet-derived cyclopropane fatty acids that act as agonists of the nuclear receptor and master regulator of fat metabolism, NHR-49/PPAR. Loss of cest-2.1, loss of bacterial cyclopropane fatty acid production, or loss of endogenous biosynthesis of the methyl-branched fatty acid substrates of CEST-2.1 mimics the behavioral responses of animals lacking octopamine, indicating that regulation of neurotransmitter-dependent behavior is linked to the coordination of fat metabolism via NHR-49/PPAR. Biosynthesis and subsequent neuromodulation via lipidated neurohormone relies on an intertissue trafficking pathway in which octopamine is shuttled first into the intestine where it is chemically modified, which is likely followed by neuronal import and intracellular hydrolysis to finally release free octopamine. We propose that esterase-dependent synthesis and subsequent hydrolysis of lipidated neurohormones represents a chemical encoding mechanism by which animals integrate information from neurotransmitter signaling and lipid homeostasis to direct appropriate behaviors.

">Memory recall errors reflect interacting sensory and mnemonic representations</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory (WM) enables the maintenance of information that is no longer present in the environment. Some accounts propose that WM is supported by abstract representations so that new sensory inputs do not interfere with existing memories. Others posit that early sensory representations are recruited to maintain memory precision, potentially at the cost of interference caused by new inputs. Here we tested these accounts using an orientation recall task to determine whether memory errors reflect interacting representations of sensory and mnemonic information. We found that adding noise to the memoranda and presenting feature-neutral distractors independently increased recall errors. However, distractors that shared a feature with remembered stimuli led to systematic attractive biases such that memory errors were pulled toward the orientation of the distractor. The magnitude of this bias was modulated by both stimulus noise and whether the distractor was behaviorally relevant. Our results demonstrate that while working memory can utilize abstract representations, it remains susceptible to feature-specific sensory interference, suggesting partial reliance on sensory-like codes.

">Asymmetries in hue measured behaviorally and with visual evoked potentials</a></h4>

              
                Hue percepts vary more rapidly along some directions in color space (e.g. near yellow) than others (e.g. near green) with corresponding differences in the size or stimulus range of different hue categories. The basis for these differences is not known. We examined whether the asymmetries are present in early cortical color coding by comparing the strength of hue differences using visual evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from occipital cortex. Stimuli were spatial gratings with a fixed nominal contrast in the cone-opponent plane that varied sinusoidally in hue rather than saturation. The responses to different levels of hue separation were measured by the amplitude of the frequency-tagged signals and also in behavioral measurements employing a contrast matching task. For both, the same separation in hue angle resulted in stronger responses for angular differences centered on the yellow quadrant of the cone-opponent space. Responses were also larger for the yellow than blue quadrant, ruling out a general sensitivity loss to the blue-yellow axis as the basis for the differences. The responses differences paralleled the asymmetries in the rates of change in color appearance based on analyses of previous measures of hue scaling functions. The presence of these asymmetries in the VEP responses suggests that they arise relatively early in the cortical sensory representation of color rather than emerging late as a product of inference or color category learning.

">OASIS: in vivo AAV-mediated transduction and genome editing of adult oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                New viral approaches have revolutionized neuroscience by precisely delivering genes in neurons; for example, to control or monitor activity in specific neuronal cell types. In contrast, the manipulation of oli-godendrocytes requires the Cre-LoxP system and gene-by-gene engineering, breeding, and genotyping. Here we introduce OASIS (Oligodendrocyte AAV-CRISPR mediated Specific In vivo editing System), a ver-satile platform that combines SELECTIV, an AAV-receptor-based transduction strategy, with HiUGE, an NHEJ-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in approach. We show efficient and specific oligodendrocyte trans-duction across the brain and tagging of endogenous cytoskeletal, myelin, cell adhesion, scaffolding, and junctional proteins. OASIS enables sparse yet reliable labeling, allowing direct visualization of subcellular protein localization with single-cell resolution. We successfully fused the biotin-ligase TurboID with endogenous oligodendroglial Neurofascin-155, thereby achieving targeted biotinylation of the axoglial junction. OASIS is rapidly customizable for any gene-of-interest. Together, OASIS overcomes longstand-ing barriers in oligodendrocyte biology, providing a powerful system for precise, customizable genome editing and subcellular visualization in the adult brain.

">Visual Attention in Peripersonal Space</a></h4>

              
                Bringing the hand near a visual stimulus enhances visual processing. This effect is linked to peripersonal space (PPS), the body-centered region where visual and proprioceptive information interact. Despite extensive behavioral evidence, the neural basis of this interaction in early visual cortex remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how hand proximity modulates orientation selectivity in area V2 by recording single-neuron responses from two rhesus monkeys. The monkeys performed a fixation task while their hand was positioned near a visual stimulus while either being visible or occluded, and compared with when the hand was away from the stimulus. When the near hand was visible, neural firing rates in V2 were significantly higher, accompanied by sharper orientation tuning. In contrast, occluding the hand broadened orientation tuning compared to when the hand was away. These effects emerged rapidly after stimulus onset and were coherent across the population, demonstrating that PPS is actively prioritized during visual processing. Together, the findings reveal two complementary (feedback) signals in V2: a congruence-driven enhancement when visual and proprioceptive inputs align, and a mismatch-driven suppression when they conflict, indicating that V2 integrates multisensory cues to encode PPS and support action-relevant visual processing.

">Spatial learning in multi-scale environments: Roles of hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex</a></h4>

              
                Navigation cognition involves the learning of multi-scale environments and the formation of cognitive maps. How do humans build cognitive maps in multi-scale environments? Cognitive maps are thought to be organized hierarchically, with local representations for subareas and global representations for the entire environment. However, it remains unclear how spatial learning influences the representations of multi-scale environments and their underlying neural mechanisms across different levels of representation. In the current study, we built a virtual environment (VE) with four orthogonally positioned rectangular rooms, each containing eight objects at the corners. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed a four-session spatial memory experiment conducted over two weeks. We measured their brain activity by using BOLD-fMRI at two stages: pre-learning stage and post-learning, when they were judging the relative direction between the objects within the VE. We found that with the progression of learning, the subjects shifted from relying on local, directional cues to using more global representations of the environment. At the neural level, the hippocampus (HIP), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) played distinct roles in encoding spatial information across the two learning stages. Specifically, after learning, the HIP shifted from local to global representations, while the RSC and OFC supported the integration of spatial information across these representational levels. In addition, the anterior cingulate cortex was involved in forming global representations, facilitating efficient spatial processing as learning advanced. These findings revealed how spatial learning leads to adaptive shifts in brain activity, contributing to the formation of cognitive maps in complex, multi-scale environments.

">Pro-endometriosis macrophage release of IL-33 is key for endometriosis pain and lesion formation</a></h4>

              
                Endometriosis is a painful gynecological inflammatory disease affecting up to 10% of females. When released by sensory neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) shapes immunity, a process known as neuroimmune communication. We previously showed that nociceptor-derived CGRP polarizes macrophages into pro-endometriosis macrophages (PEMs) that mediates endometrial epithelial (endo-epi) cell growth and pain. However, the key mediators involved in this PEM-induced cell growth were unknown. Using unbiased approaches, we discovered that nociceptor-derived CGRP induces IL-33 production by PEMs. IL-33 binding to its receptor ST2 is key for endometriotic lesion growth and pain during endometriosis in mice as anti-IL-33 antibody treatment reduced evoked and spontaneous pain as well as lesion size. Chemical or genetic ablation of nociceptors or macrophages also resulted in lower levels of lesion IL-33, demonstrating a neuroimmune-driven mechanism for IL-33 production during endometriosis. In humans, we found that IL-33 is correlated with increased number of glands and fibrosis in lesions and that IL-33 expression in macrophages is also associated with genetic risk of endometriosis. We also provided evidence that suggests a dual role for IL-33 in endometriosis, in which, it is initially required for lesion formation and later for lesion maintenance only, and associated pain. Therefore, targeting IL-33/ST2 signaling may effectively treat endometriosis pain.

">TDP-43 dysfunction leads to impaired proteostasis and predisposes mice to worse neurological outcomes after brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pathological TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) dysfunction is associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and neurodegeneration is poorly understood and likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. A major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease is exposure to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we investigated the synergistic interplay between TDP-43 dysfunction and TBI in a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/ frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods: A model of TDP-43 dysfunction caused by a knock-in Q331K mutation in Tardbp was combined with a mild model of TBI. Control conditions included both WT mice and mice with sham surgery. Animals were evaluated for behavioral deficits at timepoints pre- and post-surgery. Additionally, post-mortem brain tissues were examined using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics together with histological and biochemical analyses. Results: Expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 in vivo caused deficits in multiple branches of the proteostasis network, including protein folding, protein synthesis, and protein turnover. Examples include mis-expression of chaperones and genes within the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway in mutant TDP-43 versus WT mice. Further, mutant TDP-43 expression correlated with reduced thermostability of proteins associated with the ribosome and the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex. In response to TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibited significantly worse neurological outcomes relative to WT animals. Heightened neurological deficits in mutant TDP-43 mice following TBI coincided with a robust upregulation of proteostasis- and stress-related genes at the transcript level. However, this upregulation was not detected at the protein level. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 leads to deficits within the proteostasis network in vivo at baseline. Despite an upregulation of proteostasis-related genes at the transcript level in mutant TDP-43 mice after TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibit an impaired response to, and recovery from, brain trauma relative to their WT counterparts. Restoring proteostasis is expected to protect against the detrimental effects of TDP-43 dysfunction, especially under stress conditions that promote neurodegenerative disease.

">Loss of ovarian function and estrogen therapy remodel the brain's synaptic and metabolic proteome</a></h4>

              
                Menopause is linked to cognitive decline and reduced brain metabolism, while estrogen (E2) therapy has been shown to mitigate these effects. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which ovarian hormones and E2 influence neuroprotection is essential for developing strategies to maintain brain health in women. In this study, we examined how the loss of ovarian hormones, with or without E2 treatment, affects the brain proteome and mitochondrial energy production in aged female C57BL/6J mice (36-40 weeks). The mice underwent sham or ovariectomy (OVX) surgery and were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks; six weeks after surgery, OVX mice received either sesame oil or E2 treatment for four weeks. Proteomic analysis of brain homogenates revealed 4,992 proteins regulated by E2, with pathway analysis showing increased signaling proteins related to synaptogenesis. OVX reduced proteins involved in synaptic function, branched-chain amino acid and ketone metabolism, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (Complexes I, IV, and V), while E2 restored protein expression within these pathways. Despite alterations in OxPhos proteins, basal and state 3 mitochondrial respiration remained unchanged, although notable impairments to Complex IV enzymatic activity were apparent in OVX, but not following E2 replacement. Overall, these results indicate that E2 supports brain health by maintaining proteins crucial for synaptic integrity and metabolism, and by reducing the decline in mitochondrial bioenergetics associated with menopause.

">Adolescent intermittent ethanol exacerbates Aβ with age in the dorsal hippocampus of female TgF344-AD rats.</a></h4>

              
                Background Alcohol misuse increases Alzheimers disease (AD) risk, however the mechanisms linking these conditions are unknown. In rodents, chronic and acute ethanol increases amyloid-[beta] (A[beta]), however those studies have been limited to a single sex or brain region. Objective This study explored how adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE), alters A[beta] in multiple regions of the brain in female and male TgF344-AD rats as they age. Methods From P28-P58, female and male TgF344-AD rats were administered either water (CON) or 5.0 g/kg ethanol (AIE; 20% ethanol w/v) via intragastric gavage on a 2-day on/off cycle. In Experiment 1, A[beta] was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), piriform cortex (PC), entorhinal cortex (EC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) in 6- and 10-month-old rats. In Experiment 2, in vivo microdialysis was used in 3-month-old female rats to measure how ethanol directly modulates A[beta]; levels in the dHPC. Results In the OFC, PC, EC, vHPC, and dHPC, A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 was higher in 6-month-old female TgF344-AD rats compared to males. However, at 10 months A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 levels were only elevated in the dHPC of AIE-treated females, compared to all other groups. An acute ethanol challenge at 3 months selectively evoked a sustained increase in ISF A[beta]40 levels in AIE-treated females. Conclusions In aged females, the dHPC is a region sensitive to ethanol-associated A[beta] pathology. This may be due to disruptions in A{beta} clearance in early life, which may have an additive effect on A[beta] aggregation over the lifespan.

">End-to-end evaluation of white matter microstructure of the visual pathway in asymmetric glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that enables in vivo evaluation of white matter microstructure, providing sensitivity to tissue abnormalities caused by disease. Glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and axonal damage in the optic nerve, leading to degeneration along the entire visual pathway. This degeneration includes secondary effects on fiber crossings within the optic chiasm, which are challenging to characterize with conventional diffusion models. In this study, we evaluated 31 patients with asymmetric glaucoma and 31 healthy controls using advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging methods, including Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Constrained Spherical Deconvolution, multi-tensor fit via Multi-Resolution Discrete Search method, and Fixel-Based Analysis. We found significant differences of diffusion metrics in white matter tracts of the visual system, including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracts, and optic radiations. Moreover, diffusion metrics correlated with clinical ophthalmological parameters such as cup-to-disc ratio, visual field mean deviation, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. These findings support the use of advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging models as sensitive tools for detecting Wallerian degeneration and resolving complex white matter architecture in the human visual pathway, and demonstrate their utility to study other fiber-crossing regions throughout the brain.

">Neuroprotective function of astrocyte p75NTR in Alzheimer's Disease through regulation of cholesterol metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrogliosis in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) involves profound changes in the morphology, metabolism and secretion profile of astrocytes, but whether astrogliosis is beneficial or harmful, and under which conditions, remain open questions. Here we report an unexpected neuroprotective function of death receptor p75NTR in astrocytes through its ability to regulate cholesterol metabolism. AD knock-in mice expressing signaling-deficient p75NTR variants in astrocytes showed enhanced Abeta burden, brain histopathology and cognitive impairment, even when variants were introduced late in the disease process. Astrocytes expressing dysfunctional p75NTR variants showed impaired uptake of Abeta oligomers, and their conditioned medium enhanced Abeta production in AD neurons. p75NTR signaling negatively regulated astrocyte cholesterol biosynthesis and secretion, while cholesterol depletion restored Abeta uptake in mutant astrocytes and reduced Abeta production in AD neurons. In agreement with the role of astrocyte-derived cholesterol, statin treatment reverted the effects of astrocyte p75NTR mutants on AD neuropathology. Thus, although neuronal p75NTR has been widely recognized to amplify AD, astrocyte p75NTR plays a neuroprotective role.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The knowledge we have about how the world is structured is known to influence object recognition. One way this is demonstrated is through a congruency effect, where object recognition is faster and more accurate if items are presented in expected scene contexts. However, our understanding of the dynamic neural mechanisms that underlie congruency effects are under-explored. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examine how the congruency between an object and a prior scene results in changes in the oscillatory activity in the brain, which regions underpin this effect, and whether congruency results arise from top-down or bottom-up modulations of connectivity. We observed that prior scene information impacts the processing of visual objects in behavior, neural activity, and connectivity. Processing objects that were incongruent with the prior scene resulted in slower reaction times, increased low frequency activity in the ventral visual pathway, and increased top-down connectivity from the anterior temporal lobe and frontal cortex to the posterior ventral temporal cortex. Our results reveal that the recurrent dynamics within the ventral visual pathway are modulated by the prior knowledge imbued by our surrounding environment, suggesting that the way we recognize objects is fundamentally linked to their context.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Mild levels of stress may lead to compensatory changes in perceptual strategies, especially during social affective stroking. We recruited 17 healthy adults with moderate levels of psychological stress, as assessed by the PSM-25 questionnaire and clinical interviews, and 17 participants with low levels of stress. Tactile stimulation involved slow gentle stroking by the researcher’s hand of two areas: the foot and the shin. We analyzed the regions of interest signal by examining all activated clusters in 34 participants and also analyzed group-specific BOLD signals. Our findings suggest an increased sensitivity to social tactile stroking in stressed individuals, which correlated with increased activity in areas related to tactile perception, including the left parietal and central operculum, as well as the left precentral gyrus. Additionally, we observed activation in brain regions involved in inhibitory control and theory of mind, such as the left caudate nucleus, left middle cingulate cortex, left anterior insula, and left superior temporal gyrus. Sex differences were also noted: compared to women, men showed higher activation in the middle occipital gyrus, superior parietal lobe and left middle frontal gyrus.

                <p>Sensory attenuation of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), particularly N1 and P2 components, has been widely demonstrated in response to simple, repetitive stimuli sequences of isolated synthetic sounds. It remains unclear, however, whether these effects generalize to complex soundscapes where temporal and acoustic features vary more broadly and dynamically. In this study, we investigated whether the inter-onset interval (IOI), the time between successive sound events, modulates AEP amplitudes in a complex auditory scene. We derived acoustic onsets from a naturalistic soundscape and applied temporal response function (TRF) analysis to electroencephalography data recorded from normal hearing human listeners (<I>N</I> = 22, 16 females, 6 males). Our results showed that shorter IOIs are associated with attenuated N1 and P2 amplitudes, replicating classical adaptation effects in a naturalistic soundscape. These effects remained stable when controlling for other acoustic features such as intensity and envelope sharpness and across different TRF model specifications. Integrating IOI information into predictive modeling revealed that neural dynamics were captured more effectively than simpler onset models when training data were matched. These findings highlight the brain&rsquo;s sensitivity to temporal structure even in highly variable auditory environments, and show that classical lab findings generalize to naturalistic soundscapes. Our results underscore the need to include temporal features alongside acoustic ones in models of real-world auditory processing.</p>

                <p>Puerto Rico's cultural identity, shaped by Ta&iacute;no heritage, Spanish colonization, and US governance, emphasizes family, music, food, and collective participation. Drawing on these traditions, we developed NeuroBoricuas, a grassroots neuroscience education movement that reimagines outreach through cultural metaphors of parrandas and peer teaching. What began as a reflection on conventional Brain Awareness Week evolved into student-led demonstrations, the creation of the first neuroscience laboratory in a Puerto Rican high school, and a network of university chapters and high school clubs across the Island. These groups lead workshops, classroom visits, and community events, positioning students as both learners and teachers of neuroscience. A partnership with Backyard Brains provided affordable, hands-on tools that made neuroscience tangible for K-12 and university students, while events such as Explora tu Cerebro en la SanSe integrated science into Puerto Rico's most iconic cultural festival. To extend beyond outreach, the Bravo Lab Immersive Summer Program (BLISP) was launched in 2022, immersing undergraduates in advanced approaches including optogenetics, fiber photometry, and behavioral assays. BLISP emphasizes mentoring and peer-to-peer training, building confidence and scientific identity while creating pathways to graduate training. Recent collaborations, including NeuroBridges with the University of California, Irvine, have further expanded opportunities for Puerto Rican students through international partnerships. Together, NeuroBoricuas and BLISP demonstrate a scalable model of science education rooted in culture, identity, and community. Like a parranda, this movement grows as new voices join in, showing that neuroscience thrives when it is shared, celebrated, and carried forward collectively.</p>

                Background Educational initiatives could foster the adoption of open science (OS) and responsible research practices (RRPs). This single group pre-post study evaluated the impact of an educational intervention on increasing the adherence, knowledge and perceptions about adopting OS practices and RRPs among graduate researchers at a Brazilian University. Methods Graduate students from a southern Brazilian university were invited to participate in a course addressing OS and RRPs. The intervention was an online interactive course on OS and RRPs. The number of OS outputs, including Open Science Framework (OSF) accounts, study registrations, protocols, analysis plans, data sets, preprints, and the number of projects published by each participant were collected before and after the intervention. Additionally, a self-administered online questionnaire was applied before and after the intervention to evaluate participants’ perceptions on RRPs, OS practices and on the current researchers’ evaluation system. Results Eighty-four students finished the course and 80 agreed to participate in the study. The number of OSF accounts increased from 7 to 78 after the course, and the number of projects increased from 7 to 10, six months after the intervention. No registrations, protocols, analysis plans, data sets, or preprints were found after 6 and 12 months, respectively. The participants’ perceptions of the current research evaluation system and on the OS practices and RRPs changed positively with the intervention. Also, the intention to adopt practices like registration, protocol and preprint publications has noticeably increased after the course. Conclusions The number of participants’ OSF outputs showed little or no improvement after the intervention. The most important impact difference could be identified in terms of the participants’ perceptions and intentions to adhere to such practices in the future.

                Background As the field of bioinformatics continues to expand, the need for effective education and training becomes increasingly pressing. Despite global efforts to make bioinformatics education more inclusive, challenges remain in ensuring accessibility and linguistic diversity. A major barrier is the predominance of English-only resources, which can limit participation and learning outcomes among non-English-speaking communities. Methods This study investigated how linguistic accessibility affects learning outcomes in bioinformatics training. A two-day virtual and asynchronous workshop was hosted on the Gallantries platform under the Galaxy Training Network. Participants, primarily native Spanish speakers, were randomly assigned to one of three language conditions: human-translated Spanish materials, English materials, or machine-translated Spanish materials. Data were collected through pre- and post-workshop surveys focusing on demographics, English proficiency, language preference, and learning outcomes. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and associations between English proficiency and language preference were tested using Pearson’s Chi-Square. Qualitative feedback from participants was examined through thematic analysis to identify key learning and engagement patterns. Results Findings reveal that linguistic familiarity plays a critical role in learner confidence and comprehension. Participants expressed a clear preference for materials available in their native language, underscoring the need for culturally and linguistically relevant educational resources. The analysis also identified key limitations in current translation practices used in scientific education, particularly in conveying specialized terminology accurately and naturally across languages. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing multilingual and culturally adapted bioinformatics resources to foster equitable access to training. Incorporating linguistic diversity into bioinformatics education has the potential to improve learner engagement and support the growth of a more globally inclusive scientific community.

                Introduction Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a medical emergency associated with high morbidity and around 1% mortality. Left-sided colitis (LSC) is a subtype of ulcerative colitis that requires timely multidisciplinary management, often involving gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons. When corticosteroids and rescue therapies such as infliximab or cyclosporine fail, surgery is frequently indicated. Operative options include total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (TPC-IPAA), total proctocolectomy with ileostomy (TPC-I), total abdominal colectomy (TAC), and subtotal colectomy (STC). In the United Kingdom, STC is the most common emergency operation, but it may not be optimal for patients with left-sided disease. This review aimed to determine the most appropriate surgical approach for acute LSC. Methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus identified studies published between 2001 and 1 November 2023. Eligible studies involved adult patients with LSC refractory to medical therapy who underwent surgery. Primary outcomes were patient-centred measures; secondary outcomes included short- and long-term surgical results. Studies on medical management alone, isolated proctitis, rectal cancer, non-human subjects, or non-English publications were excluded. Screening and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers, with plans for GRADE assessment and meta-analysis if data permitted. Results Of 6,606 records screened, no study met full inclusion criteria. Six related studies were narratively reviewed. Outcomes were mixed: TAC was associated with higher complications in some studies but lower infection rates than TPC in others. Segmental colectomy carried a 35% reoperation rate and 4.2% mortality. Conclusion Evidence is insufficient to define the optimal emergency surgical strategy for acute LSC. While TAC remains the standard approach, its suitability for this subset is unclear. Disease-specific research is urgently needed. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42023473654.

                Cardiovascular diseases driven by hyperlipidemia are leading causes of death globally, with low- and middle-income countries carrying a disproportionate burden. Although statins continue to be the cornerstone of cholesterol therapy, unmet demands are sustained by cost, intolerance, and residual risk, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. When made as standardized extracts, Catha edulis, which has long been controversial due to its psychotropic alkaloids, is being explored more and more for its effects on metabolism. Improvements in lipid profiles (decreased low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides, and increased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol), regulation of adipokines (decreased leptin and increased adiponectin) in high-fat diet animals are reported in preclinical study with lyophilized leaf extract. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and molecular docking implicate non-alkaloid phytochemicals that bind lipid-regulating targets, showing statin-like interactions with HMG-CoA Reductase. However, regular khat chewing is also linked to hepatic and cardiovascular problems in clinical and case-series research, highlighting an important difference between recreational exposures and regulated, standardized medication formulations. Standardization of extract manufacturing, regulatory pathways that distinguish medicinal from recreational use, ethically sound clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and culturally sensitive communication are some of the policy options for African health systems that are outlined in this brief, which also summarizes the scientific evidence and clarifies the risks and benefits. With strict protections, Catha edulis may transform from a public health risk to a focused adjuvant in the treatment of dyslipidemia, particularly in areas where access to cutting-edge lipid-lowering medications is still a problem.

                The performance of women led SMEs is shaped by strategic factors that foster competitiveness and long-term sustainability, yet their effectiveness is often diminished by persistent socio-cultural barriers. This narrative review examines how such barriers influence the relationship between strategic factors including innovation, market positioning, risk management, and access to resources and the performance of women led SMEs across different cultural contexts. Drawing on peer reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2025, and using thematic analysis, the review finds that rigid gender norms, societal attitudes, levels of education, religious beliefs, family responsibilities, and institutional structures significantly reduce the impact of business strategies by limiting women’s decision-making power. These socio-cultural constraints also hinder women’s ability to engage with business networks and institutions, which are essential for driving business growth. The findings highlight the importance of developing context sensitive policies and culturally informed strategies to strengthen women’s strategic capabilities while addressing structural limitations. Embedding socio cultural awareness into enterprise development would support policy makers in crafting inclusive strategies that promote sustainable growth for women led SMEs.

                Background Despite increasing interest in changing and improving play opportunities in schools, there is lack of openly available methods for evaluating play quantitatively. Existing measures often focus on physical activity during play activities or prioritise the mapping of locations within which play occurs rather than evaluating play itself. Methods This paper introduces the Multidimensional Toolkit for the Assessment of Play in Schools (M-TAPS) and provides the results of an initial study examining the utility and reliability of the toolkit. The M-TAPS includes observations of individual children and scan observations of predefined areas of the playground; children’s activities, adventure/risk level and affect are coded. In addition, the M-TAPS includes child self-report questionnaires about emotions during playtime and playtime activities. Results The reliability study provided evidence of good reliability between coders and for children’s self-report of their emotions during playtime. There was some indication of validity between child self-report and coder observation. Conclusions The paper suggests that the M-TAPS may be useful for research focused on improving children’s play in schools where a quantitative measure is sought. The M-TAPS provides a flexible tool for supporting researchers with the results highlighting how the M-TAPS can provide insights into schools playtimes and how observation can be combined with children’s self-report. There is room for further development and refinement of the toolkit.

                Introduction Amyloidosis is a systemic disease caused by amyloid chain deposition. The thyroid is a very uncommon location. The prevalence of amyloid goiter is estimated to be 0.17. Cases presentation We report three cases of amyloid goiter (AG). Three men, aged between 30 and 42 years, were hospitalized in the medical department. Compressive signs were present in one patient. All the patients had normal thyroid hormone levels. Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) revealed amyloid deposition in one case. All the patients underwent total thyroidectomy. All patients underwent surgery without complications and were treated with L thyroxine replacement therapy. A pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of AG. A literature review was conducted using PubMed from 2019 to 2024. Conclusion Amyloid deposition is rarely associated with thyroid dysfunction. The discovery circumstance is generally thyroid enlargement and may be associated with compressive signs. Compressive and rapid enlargement of the thyroid may be an indication for surgery. FNA is generally less informative than core biopsy and surgery . Thyroidectomy is a therapeutic and diagnostic procedure. Clinicians should consider amyloid deposition in front of a growing goiter, particularly when systemic amyloidosis is known.

                Background Pilot errors and preconditions are major concerns that affected by multiple factors physiologically, psychologically and psychosocially. This study aimed to analyse the correlation between the internal and external risk factors, and pilot preconditions in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with purposive sampling, directed to male pilots who had flight duty in the past seven days, underwent medical examination at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, August 12–16, 2024. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire, Trail Making Test A and B, laboratory tests (plasma lipid, fasting blood glucose), and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure). The independent variables divided into internal factors (Age, Burnout, Metabolic Syndrome parameters); and external factors (Flight Time, Duty Time, Unscheduled Flight Duty, Number of Sectors, Sleep Duration). The dependent variables were pilot preconditions based on the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Results A total of 122 participants participated and 28.7% had an Unscheduled Flight Duty in the last 30 days. Significant correlations were found between Adverse Mental State and HDL-Cholesterol (95%CI=1.52–5.80), Adverse Physiological State and Burnout [Personal (95%CI=0.005–0,04), Work-Related (95%CI=0.009–0.042)], Physical Mental Limitation and Fasting Blood Glucose (95%CI=(-0.479)–(-0.071)), Number of Sectors (95%CI=0.022–3.001). For Personal Readiness (PR), significant correlation was found between PR-Psychological Demand and Flight-Time One Year (95%CI=(0.000–0.001), Sleep Duration (95%CI=(-0.137)–(-0.013)), Waist Circumference (95%CI=(-0.014)–(-0.002)), PR-Social Support and Sleep Duration (95%IK=0.018–0.207), Client-Related Burnout (95%IK=(-0.011)–(-0.002)). Conclusions The internal factors that correlated with pilot preconditions in Indonesia were Waist Circumference, HDL-Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Glucose, Personal Burnout, Work, and Client-related burnout. External factors that correlated with pilot preconditions were the Number of Sectors, Flight-Time One Year and Sleep duration. These findings emphasize the need to address physical and mental health aspects of pilots to enhance aviation safety.

                Background Women remain underrepresented in leadership within Uganda’s logistics sector, despite national commitments to gender equality. This study examines how national regulations and laws and social culture shape women’s engagement in decision-making, and whether regulations mediate culture’s influence. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional survey was administered to 298 logistics professionals sampled from private logistics companies, industry associations, and regulatory bodies. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), we assessed reliability/validity of constructs and tested direct and mediated relationships among social culture, national regulations and laws, and women’s engagement in decision-making (WEDM). Model fit and predictive relevance were evaluated (e.g., SRMR, R2, Q2). Results National regulations and laws had a positive, statistically significant effect on WEDM (β = 0.036, p = 0.002), underscoring the role of formal legal frameworks in advancing women’s leadership. Social culture showed no significant direct effect on WEDM (β = 0.002, p = 0.942). However, culture negatively influenced regulations (β = −0.265, p < 0.001), and a significant indirect (mediated) pathway from social culture to WEDM via regulations was detected (β = −0.008, p = 0.039), indicating full mediation. Correlations mirrored these patterns (national regulations–WEDM r = 0.377, p < 0.001; social culture–WEDM r = −0.224, p < 0.001; social culture–regulations r = −0.182, p = 0.002). The model demonstrated good fit (SRMR = 0.075) and strong explanatory power (R2 = 0.971 for WEDM; Q2 = 0.969). Conclusions Robust and enforced national legal frameworks are pivotal for increasing women’s engagement in logistics decision-making, and they can buffer or redirect the effects of restrictive cultural norms. While the direct impact of social culture on engagement was non-significant, its indirect effect through regulations highlights the importance of coupling legal reforms with consistent enforcement and organisational practices to convert rights into outcomes. Policy and practice should therefore integrate (i) targeted gender-equality regulations and monitoring, (ii) organisational interventions (e.g., transparent promotion, anti-bias systems, leadership development), and (iii) societal initiatives that progressively shift norms, to achieve durable, inclusive leadership pipelines in logistics and similar male-dominated sectors.

                The Hainan Gymnure Neohylomys hainanensis is a small-size mammal which occurs in Hainan, China and north Vietnam. Here, we report the complete mitochondrial genome of N. hainanensis. The whole mitochondrial genome is 17,337 bp, and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs and one control region. The base composition of the N. hainanensis total mitogenome is: 33.4% A, 12.2% G, 33.1% T, and C 21.3%, with an A + T content of 66.5%. The K2P genetic distance analysis supports current taxonomy that places N. hainanensis, Hylomys suillus and Neotetracus sinensis in different genera. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that N . hainanensis is closely related to Neotetracus sinensis based on the complete mitochondrial genome sequences. The mitogenomic data will contribute to molecular phylogenetics and conservation genetics of the species.

                Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a widespread and progressively debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, with its global prevalence steadily increasing. Central to its pathogenesis is the PINK1 gene (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1), which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function and protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. This review explores the complex relationship between PINK1 mutations and PD, highlighting their involvement in key pathogenic mechanisms. It discusses how these mutations contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, alterations in phosphorylation pathways, impaired autophagy, and heightened sensitivity to oxidative stress. These insights lay the groundwork for future research and therapeutic approaches, aiming to address the urgent need for effective PD interventions.

                In this perspective, Whiteley and Shepherd describe emerging studies showing a role for long terminal repeat retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses in brain function and disease. Historically ignored and difficult to study, these genetic elements perform unique functions in intercellular signaling and nervous system dysfunction.

                Golbabaei et al. explore how the contributions of projection-defined prelimbic cortex “sub-engrams” to contextual fear memory recall change with time. Sub-engrams projecting to the basal amygdala and lateral entorhinal cortex support recent memory recall, whereas sub-engrams projecting to the nucleus reuniens and nucleus accumbens are additionally recruited at remote delays.

                Han et al. show that frontal theta oscillations rhythmically control access to working memory. The theta rhythm sweeps across the mental image, shaping behavior by coordinating spikes and beta oscillations. This reveals a wave-based mechanism for how the brain reads out stored information.

                Most forkhead (FH) transcription factors (TFs) recognize either FKH or FHL DNA binding site motifs, while some FHs bind both motifs. By screening a library of naturally occurring variants and designed mutant FHs for DNA binding activity, King et al. reveal non-DNA-contacting residues that control TF DNA-binding mono-versus bispecificity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88824">The unique synaptic circuitry of specialized olfactory glomeruli in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                In the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system, most odorants are encoded in the antennal lobe in a combinatory way, activating several glomerular circuits. However, odorants of particular ecological role for the fly are encoded through activation of a single specialized olfactory pathway. Comparative analyses of densely reconstructed connectomes of one broadly tuned glomerulus (DL5) and one narrowly tuned glomerulus (DA2) gained detailed insight into the variations of synaptic circuitries of glomeruli with different computational tasks. Our approach combined laser branding of glomeruli of interest with volume-based focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy to enable precise targeting and analysis of the two glomeruli. We discovered differences in their neuronal innervation, synaptic composition, and specific circuitry of their major cell types: olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), uniglomerular projection neurons, and multiglomerular neurons. By comparing our data with a previously mapped narrowly tuned glomerulus (VA1v), we identified putative generic features of narrowly tuned glomerular circuits, including higher density of neuronal fibers and synapses, lower degree of OSN lateralization, stronger axo-axonic connections between OSNs, dendro-dendritic connections between many uPNs, and lower degree of presynaptic input on OSN axons. In addition, this work revealed that the dendrites of the single uPN in DL5 contain a substantial amount of autapses interconnecting distant regions of the dendritic tree. The comparative analysis of glomeruli allows us to formulate synaptic motifs implemented in olfactory circuits with different computational demands.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107121">Erythrocytosis-inducing PHD2 mutations implicate biological role for N-terminal prolyl-hydroxylation in HIF1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in <i>EGLN1</i>, the gene encoding for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), cause erythrocytosis and in rare cases the development of neuroendocrine tumors. In the presence of oxygen, PHD2 hydroxylates one or both conserved prolines in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIFα subunits, sufficiently marking HIFα for binding and ubiquitylation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, prolyl-hydroxylation in the C-terminal ODD appears to be the predominant and sufficient event in triggering the oxygen-dependent destruction of HIFα, rendering the biological significance of N-terminal ODD proline unclear. Here, we examined seven disease-associated <i>EGLN1</i> mutations scattered across the catalytic core and showed definitively that all PHD2 mutants have a structural and/or catalytic activity defect as measured by time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance. Notably, we identified one of the PHD2 mutants, P317R, to retain comparably wild-type capacity to hydroxylate the predominant proline in the C-terminal ODD but had uniquely compromised ability to hydroxylate the N-terminal ODD proline. These findings support the notion that deregulation of HIF ultimately underlies PHD2-driven erythrocytosis and challenge the currently held uncertainty that the N-terminal ODD prolyl-hydroxylation event is dispensable in normal hypoxic signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106549">Resident memory macrophages and trained innate immunity at barrier tissues</a></h4>

              
                Innate immune memory, or trained innate immunity (TII), represents a form of immunological adaptation in which innate immune cells, including myeloid and lymphoid cells, retain a trained state following prior exposure to immunological stimuli. This long-lasting modification either enhances or reduces the innate immune response to subsequent heterologous infections or inflammatory insults. While TII often provides protective benefits, including enhanced protection against pathogens and tumors, it can contribute to maladaptive inflammation in certain conditions. Epigenetic changes and metabolic reprogramming are key drivers of innate immune memory, but it is important to distinguish between transient acute changes and persistent modifications that define bona fide innate immune memory. Innate immune memory can be induced centrally, through systemic events that train hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow, or locally, via tissue-resident cells such as macrophages. The presence of trained tissue-resident immune cells offers significant advantages, but their responses may not always result in universally enhanced protection. This review explores recent advances in the understanding of tissue-resident memory macrophages and TII at barrier tissue sites, including the lung, skin, gut, and peritoneum, highlighting the implications for vaccine and immunotherapeutic strategies. Ongoing research promises to accelerate progress in this field and inform new clinical and vaccinology approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103481">Probing the role of synaptic adhesion molecule RTN4RL2 in setting up cochlear connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Sound encoding depends on the precise and reliable neurotransmission at the afferent synapses between the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation, as well as interplay between the pre- and postsynaptic components, remain largely unclear. Here, we tested the role of the synaptic adhesion molecule and Nogo/RTN4 receptor homolog RTN4RL2 (also referred to as NgR2) in the development and function of afferent IHC–SGN synapses. Upon deletion of RTN4RL2 in mice (RTN4RL2 KO), presynaptic IHC active zones showed enlarged synaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs were smaller and deficient of GluA2–4 AMPA receptor subunits despite maintained <i>Gria2</i> mRNA expression in SGNs. Next to synaptically engaged PSDs, we observed ‘orphan’ PSDs located away from IHCs, likely belonging to a subset of SGN peripheral neurites that do not contact the IHCs in RTN4RL2 KO cochleae, as found by volume electron microscopy reconstruction of SGN neurites. Auditory brainstem responses of RTN4RL2 KO mice showed increased sound thresholds indicating impaired hearing. Together, these findings suggest that RTN4RL2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105309">Protein language model identifies disordered, conserved motifs implicated in phase separation</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play a critical role in phase separation and are essential for the formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs). Mutations within IDRs can disrupt their multivalent interaction networks, altering phase behavior and contributing to various diseases. Therefore, examining the evolutionary constraints of IDRs provides valuable insights into the relationship between protein sequences and phase separation. In this study, we utilized the ESM2 protein language model to map the residue-level mutational tolerance landscapes of IDRs. Our findings reveal that IDRs, particularly those actively participating in phase separation, contain conserved amino acids. This conservation is evident through mutational constraints predicted by ESM2 and supported by direct analyses of multiple sequence alignments. These conserved, disordered amino acids include residues traditionally identified as ‘stickers’ as well as ‘spacers’ and frequently form continuous sequence motifs. The strong conservation, combined with their potential role in phase separation, suggests that these motifs may act as functional units under evolutionary selection to support stable MLO formation. Our findings underscore the insights into phase separation’s molecular grammar made possible through evolutionary analysis enabled by protein language models.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Using diffusion-weighted imaging, we quantified the microstructure of U-shaped fiber bundles connecting the primary motor and somatosensory cortices in chimpanzees. We tested for sex and age effects, lateralization, and associations with manual and orofacial motor functions. Manual skills were assessed with a tool-use task; orofacial communication was assessed by individual variation in attention-getting sound production. Chimpanzees showed population-level leftward asymmetries in fractional anisotropy in U-fibers connecting central and inferior cortices, especially in females. Age was inversely associated with radial, axial, and mean diffusivity in these bundles. Right-handed motor skill was linked to stronger leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetries in superior regions. In contrast, more frequent attention-getting sound production was associated with increased leftward asymmetries in inferior regions. These findings show that different motor functions in chimpanzees are linked to region-specific variation in U-fiber integrity along the dorsal–ventral axis, aligning with previous representations of the chimpanzee motor “homunculus.” The observed association between orofacial skill and leftward asymmetry in inferior sensorimotor regions suggests a potential preadaptation for the lateralized speech functions found in modern humans.</span>

Participants performed an arithmetic task of variable difficulty, choosing task difficulty in advance, which allowed us to isolate neural signatures of preparation (contingent negative variation) and task engagement (P3 amplitude). Computational modeling revealed that participants adjusted decision boundaries based on anticipated difficulty, reflecting heightened caution. Critically, subjective effort ratings tracked this increased caution, likely reflecting the cost of additional accumulation.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This manuscript covers my personal history on the search for the neural circuits supporting early developing memory in primates. A series of developmental neuropsychological studies is presented to follow the successive knowledge we gained over several decades on the timing of development of the hippocampus and hippocampal-dependent recognition memory functions in primates. The borrowing of an incidental recognition memory task measuring novelty preference to infer subjects' memory was central to assessing memory in young infant monkeys of only a few weeks old. Data revealed that the emergence of adult-like proficiency in visual recognition and spatial memory tasks sensitive to hippocampal dysfunction is a stepwise process. This progressive development was associated with the gradual maturation of different hippocampal intrinsic circuits (Entorhinal-CA1 and Entorhinal-Dentate Gyrus-CA fields) and their connections with other cortical structures (the perirhinal, parahippocampal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices). We also showed that a similar postnatal maturation of hippocampal-dependent memory is observed in human infants, suggesting important changes in the role of the hippocampus and medial temporal cortical areas in human memory development as well.</p>

<p>We used tract tracing and in vivo physiology to investigate auditory processing in the brainstem of the Tokay gecko. We found conserved patterns of connection in higher-order auditory nuclei and an apparent lack of tonotopy at the level of the auditory midbrain.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In reptiles, two taxa, lepidosaurs and archosaurs, have ears with thin tympanic membranes that permit sensitive hearing of high-frequency sounds in air. The organization of their central auditory systems may reflect this increased sensitivity to sound. To understand auditory processing in lepidosaurs further, we used tract tracing techniques to examine the organization and connections of the lemniscal and midbrain auditory nuclei in the Tokay gecko. The nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LLD) consist of anterior (LLDa), medial (LLDm), and posterior (LLDp) subdivisions and receive ascending projections from the contralateral cochlear nuclei (nucleus angularis and nucleus laminaris) and the ipsilateral dorsal superior olive (SOd). LLD projects to the ventral division of the ipsilateral torus semicircularis (TS). In the Tokay gecko, the central nucleus of the torus (TSC) is large, with two major subdivisions, ventral and dorsal. Caudally, the TSC is fused at the midline, with the dorsal divisions adjoining their contralateral homolog. More rostrally, the TSC bifurcates to form two wings below the tectal ventricles. The ventral division of the TSC receives ascending input from NA/NL, SOd, and the lateral lemniscal complex, while both the dorsal and ventral divisions send descending projections to the lateral lemniscal complex. The TSC projects to the auditory thalamic nucleus medialis through the tractus opticus lateralis. Physiological recordings from TSCv injection sites revealed a patchy distribution of best frequencies, while recordings in TSCd were characterized by broad frequency tuning. The tract tracing results revealed conserved anatomical patterns of ascending auditory connections in lizards and archosaurs.</p>

     alt="Head Color Morph- and Sex-Specific Differences in Follistatin Gene Expression in the Gouldian Finch Brain"/>
<p>Using highly sensitive and specific RNAscope in situ hybridization, we revealed that black-headed morphs displayed higher follistatin (<i>FST</i>) mRNA levels across multiple brain regions associated with aggression, stress responses, and parental care compared to red-headed morphs. Males consistently showed greater <i>FST</i> mRNA levels within the same morph type than females. These findings suggest that head color morph- and sex-specific differences in <i>FST</i> gene expression may underlie the observed morph- and sex-specific differences in aggression, stress responses, and parental care in Gouldian finches.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The Gouldian finch exhibits a head color polymorphism, which is tightly coupled to distinct differences in aggression, stress responses, and parental care. In competitive environments, red-headed birds are more aggressive, are less parental, and exhibit a heightened stress response relative to black-headed birds. The head color polymorphism has been associated with genetic variation in a small noncoding region near the follistatin (<i>FST</i>) gene. Given the regulatory nature of this gene, we hypothesized that <i>FST</i> mRNA would be differentially expressed in association with morph- and sex-specific differences in the brains of red- and black-headed morphs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed <i>FST</i> gene expression in the Gouldian finch brain using RNAscope in situ hybridization assay. Our results revealed significant differences in <i>FST</i> gene expression between morphs and sex. Specifically, black-headed morphs, regardless of sex, displayed higher <i>FST</i> mRNA levels across multiple brain regions associated with aggression, stress responses, and parental care compared to red-headed morphs. Furthermore, males consistently showed greater <i>FST</i> mRNA levels within the same morph type than females. These findings suggest that head color morph- and sex-specific differences in <i>FST</i> gene expression may underlie the observed morph- and sex-specific differences in aggression, stress responses, and parental care in Gouldian finches.</p>

                Neural processing is often categorized as externally or internally focused.

                Optineurin (OPTN) is a multifunctional cytoplasmic adaptor protein implicated in maintaining neuronal homeostasis through its roles in selective autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of inflammatory signaling. Mutations in the OPTN gene are causally linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and primary open-angle glaucoma. Here we have eight optineurin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant opportunities to improve the field of implementation science by supporting key activities such as evidence synthesis, contextual analysis, and decision-making to promote the adoption and sustainability of evidence-based practices. This living scoping review aims to: (1) map applications of AI in implementation research and practice; (2) identify evaluation approaches, reported outcomes, and potential risks; and (3) synthesize reported research gaps and opportunities for advancing the use of AI in implementation science. Methods This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the Cochrane guidance for living systematic reviews. A living scoping review is warranted to keep up with the rapid changes in AI and its growing use in implementation science. We will include empirical studies, systematic reviews, grey literature, and policy documents that describe or evaluate applications of AI to support implementation science across the steps of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Model. AI methods and models of interest include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, large language models, and related technologies and approaches. A search strategy will be applied to bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science), relevant journals, conference proceedings, and preprint servers. Two reviewers will independently screen studies and extract data on AI characteristics, specific implementation task according to the KTA Model, evaluation methods, outcome domains, risks, and research gaps. Extracted data will be analyzed descriptively and synthesized narratively using a mapping approach aligned with the KTA Model. Discussion This living review will consolidate the evidence base on how AI is applied across the spectrum of implementation science. It will inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to harness AI to improve the adoption, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, while identifying areas for methodological advancement and risk mitigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1032/v2?src=rss">Between Protection and Destruction: The Legal Tension Between Military Necessity and Cultural Heritage Protection in International Humanitarian Law [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The relationship between military necessity and the protection of cultural heritage under international humanitarian law has been and continues to be governed by a constant tension that has shaped both doctrine and practice. While the principle of military necessity, rooted in and derived from the 1863 Lieber Code and codified in later instruments such as the 1907 Hague Conventions, remains one of the most fundamental principles permitting the adoption of measures necessary to achieve legitimate military objectives, it has also been used to justify the destruction of cultural property. Conversely, cultural heritage, deserving special protection under instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention and its Protocols, represents the collective memory and identity of societies. Methods To evaluate the role of military necessity in the prosecution of crimes against cultural heritage, this paper uses a critical doctrinal and analytical approach, looking at both treaty law and international jurisprudence. It asks whether military necessity is a valid practical safeguard or a legal pretext for destruction. Results The paper contends that the incorporation of “imperative military necessity” has engendered critical legal loopholes resulting from warring parties’ exploitation of the prioritization of military interests over the preservation of cultural heritage, rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflicts. International tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), have endeavoured to restrict these justifications by criminalizing deliberate attacks and applying standards of necessity and proportionality. Conclusions The paper concludes that, despite treaties and jurisprudence limiting the scope of military necessity, the ongoing recognition of the necessity exception reveals structural weaknesses in international humanitarian law, thereby rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflict. Accordingly, it advocates for the strict limitation of the ‘imperative military necessity’ exception to provide better protection for cultural heritage during armed conflict.

                Background Academic staff performance plays a critical role in the success of higher education institutions. In Uganda’s private university sector, understanding how demographic characteristics affect academic staff performance can inform more equitable and effective human resource practices. This study investigated the extent to which demographic factors influence academic performance among academic staff in private universities in Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional quantitative research design was used, involving 386 academic staff members from selected private universities. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and analyzed using Pearson product-moment correlation to assess the relationships between demographic characteristics (gender, age, education level, position, years of teaching experience, and field of specialty) and indicators of academic performance. Results The analysis revealed several statistically significant correlations. The highest level of education attained was positively associated with years of teaching experience (r = .504, p < .01) and academic position (r = .619, p < .01). Years of teaching experience also showed a positive correlation with academic performance (r = .230, p < .01). Gender exhibited a weak but significant negative relationship with education level (r = –.123, p < .05) and teaching experience (r = –.115, p < .05), suggesting gender-related disparities in academic progression. Additionally, age group correlated moderately with education level (r = .292, p < .01) and academic position (r = .295, p < .01), reflecting career advancement over time. Beyond these statistical associations, the findings show that demographic characteristics such as gender, qualifications, academic rank, and field of specialty actively shape academic staff performance through access to opportunities, research engagement, and teaching responsibilities. Conclusions The study demonstrates that demographic factors particularly education level, experience, and academic rank significantly influence academic staff performance in private universities in Uganda. These findings highlight the need for universities to develop staff management and development policies that account for demographic diversity. Tailored interventions in recruitment, promotion, and retention can enhance institutional effectiveness and equity in academic staff development.

                Background Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is an extremely rare histiocytic neoplasm with a highly variable and often unpredictable clinical course and prognosis. Multiple organs can be affected mimicking other systemic diseases both clinically and radiologically. This makes timely diagnosis more challenging. Case Presentation We report the case of a 39-year-old male presented with a 15-day history of fever and retrosternal chest pain. Ha has a long history of diabetes insipidus, hypogonadism of unknown aetiology. On exploration, computed tomography revealed retroperitoneal fibrosis and “hairy” kidney appearance. Subsequent multimodality imaging studies showed the extensive multisystemic involvement including the skeletal system, retroperitoneum, pituitary, retroperitoneum, kidneys, heart, central nervous system, myocardium, pleura, lymph nodes and GI tract. Histopathology confirmed CD68+/CD1a- histiocytosis. Molecular analysis for BRAF mutation is currently pending. Pegylated interferon α and corticosteroids induced rapid clinical and biochemical improvement. Therapeutic response using a follow-up 18F-FDG PET scan revealed subsequent improved systemic lesions. Conclusion A prolonged history of unexplained endocrine abnormalities in the context of fever of unknown origin should evoke the diagnosis of ECD. Multimodal imaging is essential for diagnosis and for monitoring treatment response. This case highlights the importance of the multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical evaluation, histological analysis, and imaging studies for the optimal the management of this disease. Early initiation of immunomodulatory therapy can lead to better outcomes, even prior to confirmation of molecular findings.

                Background The photic sneeze reflex (PSR) is a common but underexplored phenomenon where bright light triggers sneezing, affecting ~30% of the population. This study aimed to characterise the light conditions inducing PSR. Methods One male PSR-affected participant logged sneezing events during a 30-day real-world light exposure study. An indoor setup using a multi-primary LED source and an integrating sphere delivered 30-second light stimuli while pupillometric data were collected. Results A total of 82 sneezing events were recorded, averaging 2.73 sneezes/day (range: 1–6 per event). Illuminance increased tenfold before sneezing, peaking 2 minutes prior, and returned to baseline within 10 minutes. Despite exposure to 150+ stimuli, artificial sneezing was not induced, though high illuminance consistently triggered tickling sensations. Conclusions Sudden increases in environmental lighting can provoke PSR. While artificial stimuli elicited only tickling, further refinement of the protocol could enable reliable PSR induction, thereby facilitating mechanistic research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1133/v1?src=rss">Sensory Evaluation of 3D-Printed Foods: A Systematic Literature Review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Three-dimensional (3D) food printing is an emerging technology with potential applications in personalized nutrition and sustainable food production. However, its success hinges critically on consumer acceptance, which is predominantly determined by the sensory properties of the printed products. A comprehensive synthesis of the literature on the sensory evaluation of 3D-printed foods was needed. Objective This systematic review aimed to map and critically analyse the current state of knowledge on the sensory properties of 3D-printed foods, the methodologies used for their evaluation, and the relationship between printing parameters, material properties, and sensory perception. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted, resulting in the inclusion and analysis of 65 relevant scientific studies. Results The field is experiencing exponential growth, with research focused on chocolate, meat products, and purees, often printed as simple geometric shapes for controlled study. Sensory evaluation relies heavily on affective (hedonic) and descriptive methods (e.g., QDA). A strong link exists between the rheological and textural properties of the food inks ("printability") and the sensory attributes of the final product ("liking or acceptability"). Key challenges include the limited use of existing sensory methods and the need to explore sustainable ingredients. Conclusion The future of the field lies in integrating material science with sensory science to create customized, nutritious, and appealing foods. The application of different sensory methods according to the study objective and further research into the dynamics of oral processing are essential for progress.
