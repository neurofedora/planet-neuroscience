              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10663">Optimal Transport for Brain-Image Alignment: Unveiling Redundancy and Synergy in Neural Information Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure of the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and understand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with real-world signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which solely focuses on local point-wise alignment, and ignores global matching, leading to coarse interpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.
  In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and theoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy than MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We apply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding brain siginals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11\% in single-subject training and 3.81\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We unveil the redundancy and synergy of brain information processing through region masking and data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments. We believe our approach paves the way for a more precise understanding of brain signals in the future. The code is available soon.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10896">Auto-Associative Memories for Direct Signalling of Visual Angle During Object Approaches</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being hit by a ball is usually not a pleasant experience. While a ball may not be fatal, other objects can be. To protect themselves, many organisms, from humans to insects, have developed neuronal mechanisms to signal approaching objects such as predators and obstacles. The study of these neuronal circuits is still ongoing, both experimentally and theoretically. Many computational proposals rely on temporal contrast integration, as it encodes how the visual angle of an approaching object changes with time. However, mechanisms based on contrast integration are severely limited when the observer is also moving, as it is difficult to distinguish the background-induced temporal contrast from that of an approaching object. Here, I present results of a new mechanism for signaling object approaches, based on modern content-addressable (auto-associative) memories. Auto-associative memories were first proposed by Hopfield in 1982, and are a class of simple neuronal networks which transform incomplete or noisy input patterns to complete and noise-free output patterns. The memory holds different sizes of a generic pattern template that is efficient for segregating an approaching object from irrelevant background motion. Therefore, the model's output correlates directly with angular size. Generally, the new mechanism performs on a par with previously published models. The overall performance was systematically evaluated based on the network's responses to artificial and real-world video footage.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11282">OPTIMUS: Predicting Multivariate Outcomes in Alzheimer's Disease Using Multi-modal Data amidst Missing Values</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with neural, genetic, and proteomic factors while affecting multiple cognitive and behavioral faculties. Traditional AD prediction largely focuses on univariate disease outcomes, such as disease stages and severity. Multimodal data encode broader disease information than a single modality and may, therefore, improve disease prediction; but they often contain missing values. Recent "deeper" machine learning approaches show promise in improving prediction accuracy, yet the biological relevance of these models needs to be further charted. Integrating missing data analysis, predictive modeling, multimodal data analysis, and explainable AI, we propose OPTIMUS, a predictive, modular, and explainable machine learning framework, to unveil the many-to-many predictive pathways between multimodal input data and multivariate disease outcomes amidst missing values. OPTIMUS first applies modality-specific imputation to uncover data from each modality while optimizing overall prediction accuracy. It then maps multimodal biomarkers to multivariate outcomes using machine-learning and extracts biomarkers respectively predictive of each outcome. Finally, OPTIMUS incorporates XAI to explain the identified multimodal biomarkers. Using data from 346 cognitively normal subjects, 608 persons with mild cognitive impairment, and 251 AD patients, OPTIMUS identifies neural and transcriptomic signatures that jointly but differentially predict multivariate outcomes related to executive function, language, memory, and visuospatial function. Our work demonstrates the potential of building a predictive and biologically explainable machine-learning framework to uncover multimodal biomarkers that capture disease profiles across varying cognitive landscapes. The results improve our understanding of the complex many-to-many pathways in AD.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06138">System 0/1/2/3: Quad-process theory for multi-timescale embodied collective cognitive systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.06138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.

                arXiv:2503.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do language models segment their internal experience of the world of words to progressively learn to interact with it more efficiently? This study in the neuropsychology of artificial intelligence investigates the phenomenon of synthetic categorical restructuring, a process through which each successive perceptron neural layer abstracts and combines relevant categorical sub-dimensions from the thought categories of its previous layer. This process shapes new, even more efficient categories for analyzing and processing the synthetic system's own experience of the linguistic external world to which it is exposed. Our genetic neuron viewer, associated with this study, allows visualization of the synthetic categorical restructuring phenomenon occurring during the transition from perceptron layer 0 to 1 in GPT2-XL.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10869">Evaluating a Novel Neuroevolution and Neural Architecture Search System</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of neural network features can have a large impact on both the accuracy and speed of the network. Despite the current industry shift towards large transformer models, specialized binary classifiers remain critical for numerous practical applications where computational efficiency and low latency are essential. Neural network features tend to be developed homogeneously, resulting in slower or less accurate networks when testing against multiple datasets. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of Neuvo NAS+ a novel Python implementation of an extended Neural Architecture Search (NAS+) which allows the user to optimise the training parameters of a network as well as the network's architecture. We provide an in-depth analysis of the importance of catering a network's architecture to each dataset. We also describe the design of the Neuvo NAS+ system that selects network features on a task-specific basis including network training hyper-parameters such as the number of epochs and batch size. Results show that the Neuvo NAS+ task-specific approach significantly outperforms several machine learning approaches such as Naive Bayes, C4.5, Support Vector Machine and a standard Artificial Neural Network for solving a range of binary classification problems in terms of accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate substantial diversity in evolved network architectures across different datasets, confirming the value of task-specific optimization. Additionally, Neuvo NAS+ outperforms other evolutionary algorithm optimisers in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, showing that properly optimized binary classifiers can match or exceed the performance of more complex models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.

                arXiv:2503.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activation functions play a critical role in the performance and behaviour of neural networks, significantly impacting their ability to learn and generalise. Traditional activation functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, have been widely used with considerable success. However, these functions may not always provide optimal performance for all tasks and datasets. In this paper, we introduce Neuvo GEAF - an innovative approach leveraging grammatical evolution (GE) to automatically evolve novel activation functions tailored to specific neural network architectures and datasets. Experiments conducted on well-known binary classification datasets show statistically significant improvements in F1-score (between 2.4% and 9.4%) over ReLU using identical network architectures. Notably, these performance gains were achieved without increasing the network's parameter count, supporting the trend toward more efficient neural networks that can operate effectively on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper's findings suggest that evolved activation functions can provide significant performance improvements for compact networks while maintaining energy efficiency during both training and inference phases.

                arXiv:2503.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When employing an evolutionary algorithm to optimize a neural networks architecture, developers face the added challenge of tuning the evolutionary algorithm's own hyperparameters - population size, mutation rate, cloning rate, and number of generations. This paper introduces Neuvo Ecological Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a novel method that incorporates these evolutionary parameters directly into the candidate solutions' phenotypes, allowing them to evolve dynamically alongside architecture specifications. Experimental results across four binary classification datasets demonstrate that ENAS not only eliminates manual tuning of evolutionary parameters but also outperforms competitor NAS methodologies in convergence speed (reducing computational time by 18.3%) and accuracy (improving classification performance in 3 out of 4 datasets). By enabling "greedy individuals" to optimize resource allocation based on fitness, ENAS provides an efficient, self-regulating approach to neural architecture search.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11002">Configuration Design of Mechanical Assemblies using an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm and Constraint Programming</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A configuration design problem in mechanical engineering involves finding an optimal assembly of components and joints that realizes some desired performance criteria. Such a problem is a discrete, constrained, and black-box optimization problem. A novel method is developed to solve the problem by applying Bivariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (BMDA) and constraint programming (CP). BMDA is a type of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) that exploits the dependency knowledge learned between design variables without requiring too many fitness evaluations, which tend to be expensive for the current application. BMDA is extended with adaptive chi-square testing to identify dependencies and Gibbs sampling to generate new solutions. Also, repair operations based on CP are used to deal with infeasible solutions found during search. The method is applied to a vehicle suspension design problem and is found to be more effective in converging to good solutions than a genetic algorithm and other EDAs. These contributions are significant steps towards solving the difficult problem of configuration design in mechanical engineering with evolutionary computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11524">Underdamped Particle Swarm Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents Underdamped Particle Swarm Optimization (UEPS), a novel metaheuristic inspired by both the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the dynamic behavior of an underdamped system. The underdamped motion acts as an intermediate solution between undamped systems, which oscillate indefinitely, and overdamped systems, which stabilize without oscillation. In the context of optimization, this type of motion allows particles to explore the search space dynamically, alternating between exploration and exploitation, with the ability to overshoot the optimal solution to explore new regions and avoid getting trapped in local optima.
  First, we review the concept of damped vibrations, an essential physical principle that describes how a system oscillates while losing energy over time, behaving in an underdamped, overdamped, or critically damped manner. This understanding forms the foundation for applying these concepts to optimization, ensuring a balanced management of exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, the classical PSO algorithm is discussed, highlighting its fundamental features and limitations, providing the necessary context to understand how the underdamped behavior improves PSO performance.
  The proposed metaheuristic is evaluated using benchmark functions and classic engineering problems, demonstrating its high robustness and efficiency.

                arXiv:2501.04007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Self-Optimization (SO) model can be considered as the third operational mode of the classical Hopfield Network, leveraging the power of associative memory to enhance optimization performance. Moreover, it has been argued to express characteristics of minimal agency, which renders it useful for the study of artificial life. In this article, we draw attention to another facet of the SO model: its capacity for creativity. Drawing on creativity studies, we argue that the model satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions of a creative process. Moreover, we show that learning is needed to find creative outcomes above chance probability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modifying the learning parameters in the SO model gives rise to four different regimes that can account for both creative products and inconclusive outcomes, thus providing a framework for studying and understanding the emergence of creative behaviors in artificial systems that learn.

<p>Cre-dependent viral tracing from medial dopaminergic ZI neurons revealed abundant fiber projections rostrocaudally throughout the brain. Interestingly, the midbrain motor regions, including the periaqueductal gray area and superior colliculus, contained the densest accumulation of fiber projections, and this fiber density was independent of the region size.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The zona incerta (ZI) supports diverse behaviors including binge feeding, sleep–wake cycles, nociception, and hunting. Diverse ZI functions can be attributed to its heterogeneous neurochemical characterization, cytoarchitecture, and efferent connections. The ZI is predominantly GABAergic, but we recently identified a subset of medial ZI GABA cells that are marked by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and produce dopamine (DA). While the role of GABA within the ZI is well studied, less is known about the functions of ZI DA cells. To identify potential roles of ZI DA cells, we further phenotyped them and mapped their efferent fiber projections. We showed that wild-type TH-immunoreactive (-ir) ZI cells did not express somatostatin or calretinin immunoreactivity. We next validated a <i>Th-cre;L10-Egfp</i> mouse line and found that medial <i>Egfp</i> ZI cells were more likely to be TH-ir. We therefore delivered a Cre-dependent virus into the medial ZI of <i>Th-cre</i> or <i>Th-cre;L10-Egfp</i> mice and selected two injection cases for full brain mapping, namely, cases with the lowest and highest colocalization between TH-ir and virally transduced, DsRed-labeled cells, to identify common target sites. Overall, DsRed-labeled fibers were distributed brainwide and were most prominent within the motor-related midbrain (MBmot), notably the periaqueductal gray area and superior colliculus. We also observed numerous DsRed-labeled fibers within the polymodal association cortex-related thalamus (DORpm), like paraventricular thalamic nucleus and nucleus of reunions, that processes external and internal sensory input. Overall, ZI DA cells displayed a similar fiber profile to ZI GABA cells and may integrate sensory input to coordinate motor output at their target sites.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural Contributions to Extrasynaptic Glutamatergic Signaling in Olfactory Bulb Glomeruli"/>
<p>Within olfactory bulb glomeruli, glutamate released from the dendrites of external tufted cells (eTCs) can excite mitral cells (MCs) through an atypical “extrasynaptic” mechanism. Here, we used serial section electron microscopy images of rat bulb glomeruli with biocytin-labeled MC and eTC dendrites to evaluate the potential ultrastructural underpinnings. Two features of the environment around eTC dendrodendritic synapses that could support extrasynaptic signaling included an unusually short distance to nearby excitatory dendrites as well as an absence of nearby astroglial processes.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Olfactory bulb glomeruli have a complex organization that includes axodendritic synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and excitatory mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs), as well as dendrodendritic synapses between MCs/TCs and GABAergic periglomerular cells (PGCs). MCs also receive excitatory signals from one subclass of TCs, the external tufted cells (eTCs). While these signals are driven by glutamate released from eTC dendrites, they appear not to reflect direct eTC &gt; MC synaptic connections but rather “spill-over” of glutamate released at eTC &gt; PGC synapses acting on nearby MC dendrites. Here, we used serial section electron microscopy images of rat olfactory bulb glomeruli with biocytin-labeled MC and eTC dendrites to evaluate potential ultrastructural underpinnings of “extrasynaptic” signaling. We compared the environment around eTC &gt; PGC synapses with that of MC &gt; PGC synapses using several quantitative measures and, as a further point of comparison, also evaluated axodendritic OSN &gt; MC and OSN &gt; eTC synapses. Across the four synapse types, one unique feature of eTC &gt; PGC synapses was their much closer distance to the nearest dendrites of excitatory cells (including MCs), averaging ∼160 nm. In contrast, astroglial processes were positioned quite far away from eTC &gt; PGC synapses, with a mean distance of ∼500 nm. These distance values would suggest that glutamate released from eTC &gt; PGC synapses may access nearby excitatory dendrites without interference from glial glutamate transporters, thus providing an ultrastructural basis for extrasynaptic signaling. Our battery of ultrastructural measures, which included brick analyses, also supported a long-standing model for the organization of glomeruli in which OSN and dendrodendritic synapses are segregated into discrete compartments.</p>

">Deep-learning models of the ascending proprioceptive pathway are subject to illusions</a></h4>

              
                Proprioception is essential for perception and action. Like any other sense, proprioception is also subject to illusions. In this study, we model classic proprioceptive illusions in which tendon vibrations lead to biases in estimating the state of the body. We investigate these illusions with task-driven models that have been trained to infer the state of the body from distributed sensory muscle spindle inputs (primary and secondary afferents). Recent work has shown that such models exhibit representations similar to the neural code along the ascending proprioceptive pathway. Importantly, we did not train the models on illusion experiments and simulated muscle-tendon vibrations by considering their effect on primary afferents. Our results demonstrate that task-driven models are indeed susceptible to proprioceptive illusions, with the magnitude of the illusion depending on the vibration frequency. This work illustrates that primary afferents alone are sufficient to account for these classic illusions and provides a foundation for future theory-driven experiments.

">Phase-synchronized 40 Hz transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation boosts gamma oscillations and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations play a crucial role in core cognitive functions such as memory processes. Enhancing gamma oscillatory activity, which is reduced in Alzheimers Disease (AD), may have therapeutic potential, but effective interventions remain to be determined. This study applies novel noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, namely phase-locked 40-Hz intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), and explores gamma oscillations and working memory changes. In 300 experimental sessions conducted on 30 participants, the effects of 40-Hz tACS, 40-Hz iTBS, two combined interventions (phase-locked iTBS to tACS peak sine wave or tACS trough sine wave), and a sham condition were explored. Gamma oscillatory activity (for 2 hours after intervention), working memory (3-back and 1-back load), and brain functional connectivity were monitored following each intervention. All stimulation protocols enhanced 40-Hz oscillatory power, with the iTBS-tACS Peak showing the most significant and stable increase, followed by 40-Hz tACS and 40-Hz iTBS. These stimulation protocols improved functional connectivity during the 30 minutes post-intervention while participants performed a memory task. Only the 40-Hz tACS and iTBS protocols enhanced high-load working memory speed. Concurrent, peak-synchronized 40 Hz iTBS combined with tACS and 40-Hz tACS may be a reliable protocol to induce long-lasting oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range. These protocols may have therapeutic effects in patients with Alzheimers disease.

">Rapid modulation of choice behavior by ultrasound on the human frontal eye fields</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is establishing causal brain-function relationships with spatial and temporal precision. Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) offers a unique opportunity to modulate deep brain structures non-invasively with high spatial resolution, but temporally precise effects and their neurophysiological foundations have yet to be demonstrated in humans. Here, we develop a temporally precise TUS protocol targeting the frontal eye fields (FEFs), a well-characterized circuit critical for saccadic eye movements. We demonstrate that TUS induces robust excitatory behavioral effects. Importantly, individual differences in baseline GABAergic inhibitory tone predict response magnitude. These findings establish TUS as a reliable tool for chronometric circuit interrogation and highlight the importance of neurophysiological state in neuromodulation. This work bridges human and animal research, advancing targeted TUS applications in neuroscience and clinical settings.

">Subthreshold variability of neuronal populations driven by synchronous synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                Even when driven by the same stimulus, neuronal responses are well-known to exhibit a striking level of spiking variability. In-vivo electrophysiological recordings also reveal a surprisingly large degree of variability at the subthreshold level. In prior work, we considered biophysically relevant neuronal models to account for the observed magnitude of membrane voltage fluctuations. We found that accounting for these fluctuations requires weak but nonzero synchrony in the spiking activity, in amount that are consistent with experimentally measured spiking correlations. Here we investigate whether such synchrony can explain additional statistical features of the measured neural activity, including neuronal voltage covariability and voltage skewness. Addressing this question involves conducting a generalized moment analysis of conductance-based neurons in response to input drives modeled as correlated jump processes. Technically, we perform such an analysis using fixed-point techniques from queuing theory that are applicable in the stationary regime of activity. We found that weak but nonzero synchrony can consistently explain the experimentally reported voltage covariance and skewness. This confirms the role of synchrony as a primary driver of cortical variability and supports that physiological neural activity emerges as a population-level phenomenon, especially in the spontaneous regime.

">Perimenopause promotes neuroinflammation in select hippocampal regions in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by age-dependent amyloid beta (A{beta}) aggregation and accumulation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. Significantly, there are prominent sex differences in the risk, onset, progression, and severity of AD, as well as response to therapies, with disease burden disproportionally affecting women. Although menopause onset (i.e., perimenopause) may be a critical transition stage for AD susceptibility in women, the role of early ovarian decline in initial disease pathology, particularly key neuroinflammatory processes, is not well understood. To study this, we developed a unique mouse model of perimenopausal AD by combining an accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) model of menopause induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) with the 5xFAD transgenic AD mouse model. To target early stages of disease progression, 5xFAD females were studied at a young age (~4 months) and at the beginning stage of ovarian failure analogous to human perimenopause (termed peri-AOF), and compared to age-matched males. Assessment of neuropathology was performed by immunohistochemical labeling of A{beta} as well as markers of astrocyte and microglia activity in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory that is deleteriously impacted during AD. Our results show that genotype, AOF, and sex contributed to AD-like pathology. Aggregation of A{beta} was heightened in female 5xFAD mice and further increased at peri-AOF, with hippocampal subregion specificity. Further, select increases in glial activation also paralleled A{beta} pathology in distinct hippocampal subregions. However, cognitive function was not affected by peri-AOF. These findings align with the hypothesis that perimenopause constitutes a period of susceptibility for AD pathogenesis in women.

">Progressively reduced cerebral oxygen metabolism and elevated plasma NfL levels in the zQ175DN mouse model of Huntington disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in exon-1 of the huntingtin gene. Currently, no disease-modifying therapies are available, with a significant challenge in evaluating therapeutic efficacy before clinical symptoms emerge. This highlights the need for early biomarkers and intervention strategies. Therefore, it is essential to develop and characterize accurate mouse models and identify early biomarkers for preclinical therapeutic development. In this study, we characterized the pathological progression of the heterozygous zQ175 neo-deleted knock in (zQ175DN) mouse model across four age groups: 3, 6, 10, and 16 months to identify human translatable outcome measures. T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) MRI was used to assess global CMRO2, while T2-weighted MRI was used to analyze brain volumes. Significant brain volume loss was detected as early as 6 months of age, worsening progressively with age in the zQ175 DN mice, resembling HD brain volumetric changes. A decline in CMRO2 was observed in 6-month-old zQ175 DN mice, with significant and progressive reductions in 10- and 16- months old HD mice. Additionally, PHP1-positive mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates were present in the striatum of zQ175 DN mice at all four age groups, with intranuclear localization prior to 6 months, transitioning to both intranuclear and neuropil aggregates in older zQ175 DN mice, suggesting that the localization of mHTT aggregates may reflect the severity of HD pathogenesis. Interestingly, plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein concentrations were significantly elevated at 6 months of age and older zQ175DN mice. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting outcome measures in preclinical evaluations of HD therapies using the zQ175 DN mouse model.

">Experimental change in personality: Overexpression of GDNF in the rat striatum converts the low exploratory phenotype into highly explorative</a></h4>

              
                Major vulnerability factors for psychiatric disorders such as depression, that often prevent complete remission and lead to relapses, are temperamental. In a rat model of clustered persistent high anxiety/low motivation, we have found that overexpression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) by intra-striatally administered adeno-associated virus vector strikingly converts the passive coping style of low exploratory rats into an active one, similar to high exploratory rats. This conversion of behavioural strategy developed gradually over repeated testing, and was associated with increased catecholamine metabolism in several brain regions and changes in the regulation of serotonin neurotransmission. An increase in in vivo dopamine transporter availability in the striatum was necessary for the phenotype conversion. Associated changes in striatal gene expression included key players in monoamine storage and epitranscriptomic regulation. The increase in GDNF signalling also caused alterations in levels and regional covariation of oxidative metabolism, indicative of persistent reorganization of neural activity throughout the brain. Thus, neurotrophic factors, GDNF in particular, may play a pivotal role in the development, persistence and alteration of personality traits, and therefore constitute a potential target for treatment of chronic, relapsing psychiatric disorders.

                Space and time are fundamental components of memory, yet how the brain encodes these dimensions to guide behavior remains unclear. Using virtual-reality environments, we uncovered a two-phase neural code in hippocampus CA1 that represents time or distance through two functional pyramidal subpopulations, PyrUp and PyrDown. In Phase I, PyrUp activity synchronously increases to mark the initiation of encoding; In Phase II, their activity decays at heterogeneous, neuron-specific rates, creating a gradual divergence in across-population firing rates that scales with elapsed time. Conversely, PyrDown activity initially decreases before gradually rising. The crossover point, where rising PyrDown activity surpasses declining PyrUp activity, precedes predictive licking behavior. Combining optogenetics and computational modeling, we provided circuit-level evidence that PyrUp neurons primarily process locomotion-related inputs regulated by somatostatin-positive interneurons, whereas PyrDown neurons mainly receive reward-related inputs gated by parvalbumin-positive interneurons. These findings advance our understanding of how hippocampal circuits compute spatiotemporal information to inform behavior.

                This study examines neural responses to visual stimuli under Near and Far flanker conditions using EEG. Fifty participants (25 per condition) completed a visual task with closely or distantly positioned distractors. EEG data were analyzed using spectrograms, wavelet transformation, and neural firing rate estimation. Standard preprocessing techniques ensured data quality and statistical tests assessed differences between conditions. Findings provide insight into how spatial stimulus configurations affect neural processing and attention.

">A hippocampal population code for rapid generalization</a></h4>

              
                Generalizing from experience and applying prior knowledge to new situations is essential for intelligent behavior. Traditional models attribute this generalization to gradual statistical learning in the neocortex. However, such a slow process cannot account for animals' rapid generalization from limited experience. Here, we demonstrate that the hippocampus supports rapid generalization in mice by generating disentangled memory representations, where different aspects of experience are encoded independently. This code enabled the transfer of prior knowledge to solve new tasks. We identify specific circuit mechanisms underlying this rapid generalization. We show that the seemingly random changes in individual neuronal activity over time and across environments result from structured circuit-level processes, governed by the dynamics of local inhibition and cross-regional cell assemblies, respectively. Our findings provide computational and mechanistic insights into how the geometric structure and underlying circuit organization of hippocampal population dynamics facilitate both memory discrimination and generalization, enabling efficient and flexible learning.

">Relative strength variability measures for brain structural connectomes and their relationship with cognitive functioning</a></h4>

              
                In this work, we propose a new class of graph measures for weighted connectivity information in the human brain based on node relative strengths: relative strength variability (RSV), measuring susceptibility to targeted attacks, and hierarchical RSV (hRSV), a first weighted statistical complexity measure for networks. Using six different network weights for structural connectomes from the UK Biobank, we conduct comprehensive analyses to explore relationships between the RSV and hRSV, and (i) other known network measures, (ii) general cognitive function ('g'). Both measures exhibit low correlations with other graph measures across all connectivity weightings indicating that they capture new information of the brain connectome. We found higher g was associated with lower RSV and lower hRSV. That is, higher g was associated with higher resistance to targeted attack and lower statistical complexity. Moreover, the proposed measures had consistently stronger associations with g than other widely used graph measures including clustering coefficient and global efficiency and were incrementally significant for predicting g above other measures for five of the six network weights. Overall, we present a new class of weighted network measures based on variations of relative node strengths which significantly improved prediction of general cognition from traditional weighted structural connectomes.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>As global population ages, maintaining cognitive health in elderly is crucial. Previous studies suggest a positive link between healthy aging and cognition, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study used genome-wide association studydata to investigate neural mechanisms between healthy aging and cognition. We employed 2-sample Mendelian randomization to evaluate causal relationship between healthy aging (indexed by a multivariate genetic predictor, mvAge) and 6 cognitive measurements. We then used a 2-step Mendelian randomization approach and mediation analysis to identify brain imaging-derived phenotypes potentially mediating this relationship. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated that healthy aging had a positive causal relationship with various cognitive functions (common executive function, intelligence, cognitive performance, and fluid intelligence score). Two-step Mendelian randomization analysis identified 27 brain imaging-derived phenotypes having robust causal relationships with healthy aging and various cognitive measurements. Mediation analysis suggested that volume of subcallosal cortex might mediate effects of healthy aging on all 4 cognitive functions. Volume of cerebellum’s VIIb could mediate effects on common executive functions, while fractional anisotropy in the anterior thalamic radiation might mediate effects on intelligence and cognitive performance. These findings suggest that specific brain regions may play a potential mediating role in the relationship between healthy aging and cognitive maintenance.</span>

">C9orf72 Repeat Expansion Induces Metabolic Dysfunction in Human iPSC- Derived Microglia and Modulates Glial-Neuronal Crosstalk</a></h4>

              
                The C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia, but its cell type-specific effects on energy metabolism and immune pathways remain poorly understood. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, astrocytes and microglia from C9orf72 patients and their isogenic controls, we investigated metabolic changes at the single-cell level under basal and inflammatory conditions. Our results showed that microglia are particularly susceptible to metabolic disturbances. While C9orf72 motor neurons exhibited impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced ATP production, C9orf72 microglia presented pronounced increases in glycolytic activity and oxidative stress, accompanied by the upregulation of the expression of key metabolic enzymes. These metabolic changes in microglia were exacerbated by inflammatory stimuli. To investigate how these changes affect the broader cellular environment, we developed a human iPSC-derived triculture system comprising motor neurons, astrocytes and microglia. This model revealed increased metabolic activity in all cell types and highlighted that microglia-driven metabolic reprogramming in astrocytes contributes to the vulnerability of motor neurons under inflammatory conditions. Our findings highlight the central role of microglia in driving metabolic dysregulation and intercellular crosstalk in ALS pathogenesis and suggest that targeting metabolic pathways in immune cells may provide new therapeutic avenues.

">Nanoscale Lattice Organization of Molecular Condensates Drives Compositional Degeneracy in Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity is essential for neuronal communication, involving coordinated structural, molecular and functional changes that are shaped by the nanoscale alterations of the active zone and postsynaptic density. Emerging evidence suggests that synapses function as complex information processing machines, where unique molecular assemblies shape transmission properties. Central to this is the organization of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and Bassoon within active zones. Utilizing advanced techniques like liquid-liquid phase separation, super-resolution microscopy, and data-driven models of synaptic transmission, we reveal how nanoscale "compositional degeneracy" in Bassoon and VGCCs enables synapses to achieve functional adaptability through multiple molecular configurations. By modulation of local uncertainty and implementing probabilistic inference, synapses fine-tune transmission efficiency by regulating dynamic entropy and free energy. These principles are especially evident during homeostatic scaling, where synaptic scaling mechanisms differ with neuronal maturity. This study highlights how distinct thermodynamic states in VGCC and Bassoon organization optimize information transfer at different plasticity stages. Our findings propose a refined framework for understanding synaptic transmission as an adaptable, entropy-modulated process, balancing resilience and efficiency.

">Three types of remapping with linear decoders: a population-geometric perspective</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal remapping, in which place cells form distinct activity maps across different environments, is a robustly-observed phenomenon with many theories and interpretations. Some theories view remapping as the mechanism behind reduced interference between competing spatial memories, whereas others associate it with changes in an underlying latent state representation. However, it remains unclear how these interpretations of remapping relate to one another, and what types of activity changes they are compatible with. To shed some light on these questions, here we propose a neural coding and population geometry perspective to unify and elucidate the mechanisms behind remapping. Assuming that hippocampal population activity can be understood through a linearly-decodable latent space, we show that there are three possible mechanisms to induce activity changes that resemble remapping. Remapping can be due to (i) a true change in the mapping between neural and latent space, (ii) modulation of activity due to non-spatial mixed selectivity of place cells, or (iii) neural variability outside of the latent space that reflects a redundant code. We simulate and visualize examples of these remapping types in a network model, and relate the resultant remapping behavior to various models and experimental findings in the literature. Overall, our work serves as a unifying framework with which to visualize, understand, and compare the wide array of theories and experimental observations about remapping, and may serve as a testbed for understanding neural response variability under various experimental conditions.

">Proteomic Subtyping of Alzheimer's Disease CSF links Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction to Reduced levels of Tau and Synaptic Biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant clinical and molecular heterogeneity, influenced by genetic and demographic factors. Using an unbiased, network-driven approach, we analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome from 431 individuals (483 samples), including 111 African American participants, to identify core protein modules associated with AD, race, sex, and age. Our analysis revealed ten co-expression modules linked to distinct biological pathways and cell types, many of which correlated with established AD biomarkers such as {beta}-amyloid, tau, and phosphorylated tau. To further resolve disease heterogeneity, we applied a proteomic subtyping approach, identifying six distinct CSF subtypes spanning the clinical and pathological spectrum. These subtypes were validated across independent cohorts, with many aligning with previously defined AD subtypes, including those linked to neuronal hyperplasticity, immune activation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Notably, the BBB subtype, enriched with African Americans and men, was characterized by low CSF tau, high CSF/serum albumin ratios, and reduced synaptic protein levels. This subtype also exhibited increased levels of proteolytic enzymes, including thrombin and matrix metalloproteases, that cleave tau. Plasma dilution into the neuronal hyperplastic AD subtype CSF led to reduced tau and synaptic protein module levels, indicating that plasma protease activity contributes to tau and synaptic protein depletion independent of underlying brain pathology. These findings highlight the impact of BBB integrity on CSF tau levels, particularly in men and African Americans, and underscore the need for diversity-informed AD biomarker strategies to improve diagnostics and therapeutic targeting across populations.

">Unleashing the potential of OPM-MEG to study event-related fields against low-frequency artifacts: the case of sentence processing</a></h4>

              
                OPM-MEG (optically pumped magnetometers-magnetoencephalography) offers un-precedented opportunity in its proximity to the brain and in mobility, outperforming other human MEG systems. However, movements induce low-frequency artifacts (up to ~ 3 Hz) in this system, calling for pipelines that could efficiently reduce these low-frequency noises. Although a high-pass filter of e.g., 4 Hz may minimize these artifacts, it may also eliminate many event-related field (ERF) components, such as the N400 response in sentence processing studies. Moreover, as an emerging technology with expensive sensors, many labs are starting with an experimental setup with fewer sensors (e.g., ~ 10), making it challenging to reject principal components based on visually inspecting the topographic field maps. In the current paper, we show that a combination of moderate high-pass filtering (1 Hz) and evoked-biased denoising source separation (evoked-biased DSS) can effectively reveal typical N400 deflections and effects (between nouns and verbs), with a nine-sensor OPM-MEG setup. Our current pipeline paves the way to studying ERFs with OPM-MEG in more budget-friendly setups with a small number of sensors.

">Correlative light and electron microscopy reveals the fine circuit structure underlying evidence accumulation in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating information is a critical component of most circuit computations in the brain across species, yet its precise implementation at the synaptic level remains poorly understood. Dissecting such neural circuits in vertebrates requires precise knowledge of functional neural properties and the ability to directly correlate neural dynamics with the underlying wiring diagram in the same animal. Here we combine functional calcium imaging with ultrastructural circuit reconstruction, using a visual motion accumulation paradigm in larval zebrafish. Using connectomic analyses of functionally identified cells and computational modeling, we show that bilateral inhibition, disinhibition, and recurrent connectivity are prominent motifs for sensory accumulation within the anterior hindbrain. We also demonstrate that similar insights about the structure-function relationship within this circuit can be obtained through complementary methods involving cell-specific morphological labeling via photo-conversion of functionally identified neuronal response types. We used our unique ground truth datasets to train and test a novel classifier algorithm, allowing us to assign functional labels to neurons from morphological libraries where functional information is lacking. The resulting feature-rich library of neuronal identities and connectomes enabled us to constrain a biophysically realistic network model of the anterior hindbrain that can reproduce observed neuronal dynamics and make testable predictions for future experiments. Our work exemplifies the power of hypothesis-driven electron microscopy paired with functional recordings to gain mechanistic insights into signal processing and provides a framework for dissecting neural computations across vertebrates.

">Vagal afferent activation induces a NREM-sleep-like state with brain-body cooling, but locus coeruleus activation</a></h4>

              
                Parasympathetic nervous system activity, vital for restorative sleep, is influenced by vagal sensory afferents, but how these shape brain-body correlates of sleep remains open. We investigated this by combining vagal sensory neuron (VSN) stimulation with EEG/EMG, heart rate, brain-body temperature, and noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neuron population activity measures. Opto-/chemogenetic VSN manipulations in Vglut2-Cre mice were validated via in vitro synaptic physiology, cFos expression, and heart rate measures. Chemogenetic VSN stimulation during the resting phase induced a non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS)-like state with enriched, but homeostatically regulated, low-frequency (0.75-4 Hz) EEG activity, yet suppressed REMS. Simultaneously, brain-body temperatures dropped while LC activity increased. Recovery was gradual towards normal NREMS-REMS-cycles but accelerated by external warming, identifying cooling as key factor. We conclude that VSN activation can promote brain-body correlates as a continuum of normal NREM sleep while engaging forebrain neuromodulation, offering insights into mechanisms of sleep disruptions linked to autonomic dysregulation.

                While the dorsoventral and mediolateral organization of striatum has resolved clear functional distinctions, far less is known about how the anterior-posterior striatal axis contributes to behavioral control. We explore this within the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), a key region for value-based choice, by comparing population neuronal activity and function within anterior (A-DMS) and posterior (P-DMS) subregions while mice operantly seek reward. Neural recordings show that P-DMS encoded action values and strategy information prior to choice selection while A-DMS activity represented recently selected choices and their anticipated values via a dynamic population reorganization immediately following action selection. Optogenetic perturbations were consistent with these temporally distinct coding properties as unilateral manipulation of the P-DMS prior to choice biased choice contralaterally in a value-dependent manner and unilateral inhibition of the A-DMS following choice impaired future value-based action selection. Using anterograde tracing, we found that the A-DMS and P-DMS projected to a common region within the ventromedial substantia nigra pars reticulata (vmSNr), which contained value-related signals combining aspects of upstream DMS processing. Together, our results support a model for temporally distributed influence on value-based choice across the anterior-posterior axis of the DMS.

">Are online corrections really a distinct class of movement?</a></h4>

              
                Humans have a remarkable capacity to adjust reaching movements rapidly and accurately when visual targets jump to a new location. The short latency of such online corrections has led to the hypothesis that they constitute a distinct class of movement and arise from an automatic pilot that is selectively engaged only during ongoing movements. However, concrete evidence for this hypothesis is scarce. Here, we test this idea by measuring muscle recruitment, force, and kinematics in a jumping target reaching task. In separate blocks of trials, participants were instructed to respond to target jumps by (1) following the jumped target, (2) stopping the on-going movement, or (3) ignoring the jumped target. This allowed us to establish the automaticity and timing of responses to target jumps and to compare such measures to the original reaching movement initiated from rest. We find that the earliest phase of muscle recruitment elicited by the jumped target corresponds to a subcortical reflex, beginning at ~80ms and ending by ~120ms, preceding the onset of voluntary recruitment at ~130ms. This reflex inexorably drives a reaching adjustment towards the new target in all three blocks; it is only somewhat reduced in the stop and ignore blocks. Critically, this earliest phase of muscle recruitment was also present at the exact same latency (80ms) for the original reaching movement initiated from rest. Thus, rather than supporting the model of online corrections as distinct class of movement that is mediated by an automatic pilot, our results suggest that all reaches, whether adjusted in mid-flight or initiated from rest, arise from a common nested control system featuring subcortical and cortical components whose influence can be strategically preset by task demands.

">Retrieval practice prevents stress-induced inference impairment by restoring rapid memory reactivation</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of human memory is its ability to form novel inferences by linking discrete but related events. Our study examined whether acute stress impairs memory inference in humans and assessed the potential of retrieval practice to buffer this effect. Participants were trained on pairs of images, AB and BC, to establish interconnected triads (ABC) with a shared bridge element B. Twenty-four hours later, we induced acute stress in half of the participants and then tested for their capacity to infer the indirect AC associations. Behavioral results indicated that acute stress impaired memory inference, yet targeted retrieval practice of the AB and BC pairs after encoding could prevent the stress-induced impairment in A-C inference. Using multivariate decoding analysis of human electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we provided neural evidence that bridge element B is rapidly reactivated during the inferential process, a neural signature that is predictive for subsequent successful inference. Importantly, we showed that stress disrupts this rapid neural reactivation of the brdige element, but retrieval practice can buffer the stress effect and even enhanced the strength of reactivation signals beyond the non-stress condition. Collectively, our findings pinpoint rapid memory reactivation of bridge information as an essential neural mechanism underpinning memory-based inference, which, although susceptible to stress, can be enhanced through retrieval practice. These insights suggest that building robust memory traces could enable subsequent memory inferences to be resilient to stress, highlighting that retrieval practice could sustain normal flexible cognitions under stress.

">The Adolescent Functional Connectome is Dynamically Controlled by a Sparse Core of Cognitive and Topological Hubs</a></h4>

              
                Fundamental mechanisms that control the brain's ability to dynamically respond to cognitive demands are poorly understood, especially during periods of accelerated neural and cognitive maturation, such as adolescence. Using a sparsity-promoting feedback control framework we investigated the controllability of the adolescence functional connectome. Critical feedback costs associated with a region's control action on itself and the rest of the brain were estimated using resting-state fMRI data from an early longitudinal sample in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (n = 1394; median (IQR) age = 10.1 (1.1) years at baseline and 12.1 (1.1) years at follow-up). A highly reproducible, core set of predominantly highly connected regions retained their control action over the connectome under high feedback costs. They included posterior visual areas, retrosplenial cortex, cuneus and precuneus, superior parietal lobule, temporal ventral cortex and dorsolateral and lateral prefrontal cortices, i.e., both developed and developing brain regions. These regions were central to the topological organization of the connectome, consistently engaged during spontaneous coordination of resting-state networks, and overlapped with cognitive and topological brain hubs that play ubiquitous roles in cognitive function and the organization of the connectome. Also, most received (integrated) and distributed approximately equal amounts of neural information. These regions' control action was developmentally stable, i.e., critical feedback costs did not change significantly during puberty, suggesting that, despite ongoing maturation and topological changes in the adolescent brain, fundamental mechanisms of system controllability may be well developed to facilitate information processing and response to cognitive demands.

">Schwann cells modified to secrete MANF is a potential cellular therapy for peripheral nerve regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Despite several decades of research, an effective therapy for peripheral nerve regeneration is still lacking. The lack of knowledge of molecular candidates that equally promote axon regeneration and glial cell dynamics essential for regeneration poses challenges in developing effective therapies. Improper optimization of potential therapies leading to failures in ensuring their local availability in nerves also poses additional challenges. Here, we showed that the neurotrophic factor, the mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), equally promotes axon regeneration and glial cell dynamics favorable for nerve regeneration. We showed that while endogenous expression of MANF is primarily restricted to non-peptidergic sensory neurons in adult rats, exogenous MANF promotes the growth of all subtypes of adult rat sensory neurons. We also demonstrated that exogenous MANF promotes the proliferation and migration of adult rat primary Schwann Cells (SCs). Further, we found that local and repeated administration of exogenous MANF to injured mouse nerve promote axon regeneration. Finally, we devised a therapeutic approach by programming nerve resident SCs to locally and continuously deliver MANF to injured rat nerves and showed that this approach improved nerve regeneration indices. Overall, this work developed a therapeutic approach by harnessing the power of SCs as a local delivery system of MANF for improving nerve regeneration.

">Radial astroglia cooperate with microglia to clear neuronal cell bodies during zebrafish optic tectum development</a></h4>

              
                The clearance of dead cells by phagocytes is an essential component of neural development in many organisms. Microglia are the main phagocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), but the extent of participation by other glial cells remains unclear, especially under homeostatic conditions. During zebrafish optic tectum (OT) development, we observed radial astroglia forming dynamic, spherical projections from their basal processes. These projections, which we call scyllate heads, coincide with a wave of neuronal cell death in the OT. We show that scyllate heads surround the majority of dying neurons soon after phosphatidylserine exposure. However, unlike traditional phagosomes, scyllate heads persist for many hours and are rarely acidified or internalized. Instead, microglia invade scyllate heads and remove their contents for terminal degradation. Our study reveals an active role for radial astroglia in homeostatic cell clearance and cooperation between microglia and radial astroglia during zebrafish OT development.

">Temporal misalignment in scene perception: Divergent representations of locomotive action affordances in human brain responses and DNNs</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system processes scenes with remarkable speed, enabling the extraction of essential information to navigate our surroundings in a single glance. To elucidate how the brain transforms visual inputs into neural representations of navigationally relevant information, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) responses to diverse indoor and outdoor scenes along with behavioral annotations of locomotive action affordances (e.g., walking, cycling), object annotations, and low-level image features to model distinct types of scene information. Using representational similarity analysis, we examined the neural representation of locomotive action affordances over time, their co-localization within scene-selective cortex, and their computational alignment with deep neural networks (DNNs). Our results show that locomotive action affordance representations emerge within 200 ms of visual processing, showing unique contributions to EEG responses at temporally distinct time-points from objects and low-level properties. Spatiotemporal fusion with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings in scene-selective brain regions reveals that both the parahippocampal (PPA) and occipital place region (OPA), but not the medial place region (MPA), contribute to locomotive action affordance representations, with a distinct temporal hierarchy between them. While DNNs exhibit good predictivity of early EEG responses, they primarily capture low-level features and show limited alignment with affordance processing. These findings reveal a temporally distinct neural representation of action affordances and highlight a limitation of current DNNs in modeling affordance perception.

">SpikeMAP: An unsupervised spike sorting pipeline for cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons in high-density multielectrode arrays with ground-truth validation</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale extracellular recording techniques represent a major advance in interrogating the structure and dynamics of neuronal circuits. However, methods that can resolve cell-type identity in a principled way, while simultaneously scaling to thousands of neurons, are currently lacking. Here, we introduce spikeMAP, a pipeline for the analysis of large-scale recordings of in vitro cortical activity that not only allows for the detection of spikes produced by single neurons (spike sorting), but also allows for the reliable distinction between genetically determined cell types by utilizing viral and optogenetic strategies as ground-truth validation. This approach tightly integrates the data analysis pipeline to an optogenetic, viral, and pharmacological protocol allowing for the dynamical probing of distinct cell-types while simultaneously recording from large populations. The novelty of spikeMAP is to combine a stream of well-established analysis techniques in an end-to-end fashion, creating a unified framework as follows. First, individual spike waveforms are fitted by spline interpolation to estimate their half-amplitude and peak-to-peak durations. These values are then entered in a principal component analysis with k-means clustering to identify uncorrelated signals from single channels on the array. Optimal separability of clusters is assessed by linear discriminant analysis. Finally, each channels source location is identified using spatiotemporal characteristics of spike waveforms across the array. We show that spikeMAP can resolve cell type identity in high-density arrays by analyzing activity monitored from mouse prefrontal cortex in vitro slices with an array of 4,096 closely-spaced channels. Using an optotagging functional strategy, we show an effective distinction of regular-spiking excitatory neurons from fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons using measures of action potential waveform, Fano factor, and spatially-dependent cross-correlations. In sum, the approach introduces a toolbox, validated by an experimental pipeline, that allows for a comprehensive characterization of neuronal activity obtained from different cell-types in high-density multielectrode recordings. This provides a scalable approach to investigate the interplay between distinct cell types in microcircuits of the brain.

">Differential Glutamatergic Inputs to Semilunar Granule Cells and Granule Cells Underscore Dentate Gyrus Projection Neuron Diversity</a></h4>

              
                Semilunar Granule Cells (SGCs) are sparse dentate gyrus projection neurons whose role in the dentate circuit, including pathway specific inputs, remains unknown. We report that SGCs receive more frequent spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs than granule cells (GCs). Dual GC-SGC recordings identified that SGCs receive stronger medial entorhinal cortex and associational synaptic drive but lack short-term facilitation of lateral entorhinal cortex inputs observed in GCs. SGCs dendritic spine density in proximal and middle dendrites was greater than in GCs. However, the strength of commissural inputs and dendritic input integration, examined in passive morphometric simulations, were not different between cell types. Activity dependent labeling identified an overrepresentation of SGCs among neuronal ensembles in both mice trained in a spatial memory task and task naive controls. The divergence of modality specific inputs to SGCs and GCs can enable parallel processing of information streams and expand the computational capacity of the dentate gyrus.

">Muscarinic type 1 receptor activated effectors in principal neurons of the rat basolateral amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a crucial role in context-specific learning and memory by integrating valence-specific stimuli with internal physiological states. Cholinergic signaling systems modulate neural excitability to influence information processing in the BLA. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are of particular interest because aberrant mAChR signaling in BLA circuits is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, substance use, and age-related cognitive decline. This study evaluates mAChR activation in BLA principal neurons (PNs) in juvenile rat brain slices using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We found that carbachol (CCh, a selective mAChR agonist) excites BLA PNs voltage clamped near the resting potential (as indicated by a downward shift in holding current), but produces a biphasic change in membrane resistance, indicating an involvement of multiple effectors. More specifically, we observed that CCh excites BLA PNs by inhibiting the afterhyperpolarization (AHP), by reducing a steady state inhibitory current, and by promoting an afterdepolarization (ADP). We further identify and characterize a CCh-induced and calcium-activated non-selective cation current (ICAN) that underlies the ADP in voltage clamp. Overall, our findings provide new insights into specific effectors modulated by activation of pirenzepine sensitive mAChRs expressed by BLA PNs. We also reveal new details about the time- and voltage-dependence of current carried by the CCh/M1R-activated ICAN like current in BLA PNs, and highlight its ability to promote a suprathreshold ADP capable of generating sustained firing after a brief excitatory stimulus. Improved understanding of these effectors will provide potentially valuable new insights on the wide range of mechanisms through which cholinergic system dysfunction can lead to impaired executive function.

">Neural network-based encoding in free-viewing fMRI with precision models</a></h4>

              
                Representations learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit a remarkable resemblance to information processing patterns observed in the primate visual system on large neuroimaging datasets collected under diverse, naturalistic visual stimulation but with instruction for participants to maintain central fixation. However, this condition diverges significantly from ecologically valid visual behaviour, suppresses activity in visually active regions, and imposes substantial cognitive load on the viewing task. We present a modification of the encoding model framework, adapting it for use with naturalistic vision datasets acquired under fully natural viewing conditions -- without fixation -- by incorporating eye-tracking data and receptive field maps. Our precision encoding models were trained on the StudyForrest dataset, which features fully naturalistic movie viewing. By combining voxel-specific population receptive field estimates with eye-tracking data for each frame, we generate subject- and voxel-specific feature time series. These time series are constructed by sampling only the locally and temporally relevant elements of the CNN feature map for each voxel. Our results demonstrate that precision encoding models outperform conventional encoding models. This framework provides a strong foundation and justification for future large-scale data collection under fixation-free, fully naturalistic viewing conditions.

                Extracellular electrophysiological recordings present unique computational challenges for neuronal classification due to noise, technical variability, and batch effects across experimental systems. We introduce HIPPIE (High-dimensional Interpretation of Physiological Patterns In Extracellular recordings), a deep learning framework that combines self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled datasets with supervised fine-tuning to classify neurons from extracellular recordings. Using conditional convolutional joint autoencoders, HIPPIE learns robust, technology-adjusted representations of waveforms and spiking dynamics. This model can be applied to electrophysiological classification and clustering across diverse biological cultures and technologies. We validated HIPPIE on both in vivo mouse recordings and in vitro brain slices, where it demonstrated superior performance over other unsupervised methods in cell-type discrimination and aligned closely with anatomically defined classes. Its latent space organizes neurons along electrophysiological gradients, while enabling batch and individual corrected alignment of recordings across experiments. HIPPIE establishes a general framework for systematically decoding neuronal diversity in native and engineered systems.

                Background The global shift in corporate philosophy from wealth maximization to share value creation has propelled sustainable finance into the forefront of research endeavours. Despite its significance, the realm of sustainable finance, especially in the context of mergers and acquisitions, remains relatively underexplored. Objective This research intends to identify the gap by conducting a cutting-edge and expansive systematic review, unravelling the intricate layers of sustainable finance concerning mergers and acquisitions. Data source The data source is Web of Science to start with, yielding 41 publications. A similar search on Scopus yielded 52 articles. Not surprisingly, the 41 publications discovered via the Web of Science search were also found in the Scopus results. Study eligibility criteria Papers on business, management, environmental studies, corporate finance, economics, and ethics are featured. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Employing advanced methodologies including machine learning tools, our research delves into domain specific influential papers, top-contributing journals, noteworthy authors, institutions, and nations. By dissecting the context and methodologies employed in scholarly works, we aim to instil a through overview of the current body of knowledge. our study categorizes the selected scholarly research into four distinct objectives, facilitating a nuanced understanding of the diverse perspectives within the field. Each stratum of papers is meticulously analysed and discussed, offering insights into key themes and patterns. To guide future research initiatives, we present a synthesis of pertinent research questions, exploring avenues such as the incorporation of innovative financial instruments like green bonds and artificial intelligence. Results Since the Sustainable Development Goals were introduced in 2016, sustainable finance has become an increasingly important topic in merger and acquisition research. Research is progressing at a rapid pace in China and Australia, while emerging nations are falling behind. In addition, this study specifies the necessity of conducting a more comprehensive examination of the habits of company representatives regarding sustainable investments. This aspect has been neglected in earlier research. Additionally, because global M&As are becoming more common, research on cross-border M&As must take precedence over domestic ones. Finally, there is a gap in the current body of knowledge about greenwashing, green audits, and the use of AI in sustainable finance. Conclusions and implications of key findings Machine learning and big data analytics may help scholars get a more thorough grasp of the historical and present significance of sustainability in M&A. New era researchers may advance the potential yet unexplored topics.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. This study’s aim was to compare the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20–40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between the number of periodontopathogens and the amount of nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected, DNA was isolated, the entire 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, and sample libraries were prepared in accordance to the Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology procedure. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity in saliva samples that were pooled according to three groups; T2DM patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3), was measured using bioinformatic methods. Additionally, the relationships between the periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Fusobacterium spp.) and denitrifying community (Haemophilus, Neisseria, Rothia, and Veillonella) were assessed. Results Alpha-diversity analysis revealed, the G1 group had significantly lower bacterial diversity and abundance than groups G2 and G3 (p< 0.0001). However, the microbiota profiles of diabetic patient groups with periodontitis and gingivitis were comparable. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, potential biomarkers for differentiating between gingivitis and periodontitis were discovered. Areas under the curve (AUC) between Fusobacterium spp. and Neisseria were found to be 0.94 (p = 0.43), while the AUC between P. gingivalis and Rothia was not significant (0.84, p = 0.08). Conclusion People with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis exhibit different relationships between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in their salivary microbiome. These features might be essential indicators for early identification and treatment of gingivitis in order to prevent periodontitis.

                Background Posthepatectomy liver dysfunction can lead to fatal outcomes, making it a highly undesirable complication. Numerous studies have attempted to mitigate liver dysfunction after hepatectomy. However, in the context of hepatectomy, Royal Jelly, previously known for its various benefits to liver health, has not been studied. Methods In this study, thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups. Just before undergoing 80% hepatectomy, 16 rats received intravenous Royal Jelly (RJ group), while the remaining 16 rats were administered intravenous phosphate-buffered saline in a blinded manner (PBS group). Four rats died before the scheduled time for specimen collection, leaving 28 rats for analysis. Forty-eight hours after hepatectomy, liver function (bilirubin and prothrombin time) was evaluated in all rats. Additionally, hepatocyte proliferation was examined using the Ki67 marker, which was obtained from the remaining liver specimens. The difference in bilirubin levels and prothrombin time between the two groups was tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. The difference in Ki-67 percentage between the two groups was analyzed using the t-test. Results The RJ group exhibited a lower median total bilirubin level compared to the PBS group (p<0.001). Additionally, the prothrombin time in the RJ group was lower than that of the PBS group (p<0.05). The Ki-67 percentage in the RJ group was also lower than in the PBS group (p<0.05). These findings suggest that the rats administered Royal Jelly demonstrated better liver function compared to the other group. Conclusions Administer intravenous Royal Jelly to rats undergoing 80% hepatectomy helps to protect liver function. This study indicates the potential for further research on Royal Jelly as a possible alternative for reducing liver dysfunction following surgery or other medical conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1107/v4?src=rss">Prevalence of common mental health problems and associated factors among university students visiting Supara mental health service: A cross-sectional study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early studies found that the mental health problems rate was relatively high in university students. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental problems and associated factors in university students. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study at Supara mental health service in the Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital between February 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The secondary assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 8 items from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess suicidal risk (8Q), , and the Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-15). The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. In addition, multivariable regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results: A total of 184 participants (62% female; mean age = 22.49 years (SD 3.93) were recruited. The depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and anxiety disorders rates were 57.1%, 15.2% and 13.6%, respectively. Grade point averages (GPAs) below 3.0 (OR=3.09, 95%CI: 1.17-8.14) and a family history of mental disorder (OR=3.40, 95%CI: 1.10-10.48) were significant associated factors of moderate to severe mental health problems. Detecting and screening these factors may help the university to provide early detection and treatment for students. Conclusions: Depressive disorders were the most common mental health disorders. Females, low GPAs and a family history of mental disorder were predictors of moderate to severe mental health problems.

                Background There is evidence that patients with COVID-19 have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than the normal population. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems and their associated factors in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospitel in Thailand. Methods Mental health problems were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 items, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. McNemar's test was used to compare the prevalence of mental health problems between day 1 and day 7. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results A total of 186 participants (68.3% female; mean age = 37.21 years (SD 13.66) were recruited. The depression, anxiety, and stress rate on day 1 of admission was 26.9%, 32.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Having mild COVID-19 symptoms was a significantly associated factor with anxiety (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.05-6.89) and stress (OR=4.53, 95%CI: 1.32-15.55). Conclusions There was a high rate of mental health problems in COVID-19 patients. Detecting and managing mental health problems should be considered standard care for COVID-19 patients.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal was to examine the effect of sociodemographic variables, Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical stages and pathology on brain metabolism in Down syndrome (DS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 71 euploid healthy controls (HC) and 105 adults with DS (67 asymptomatic, 12 prodromal, and 26 with dementia) from the Down-Alzheimer Barcelona Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants underwent [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, 3 Tmagnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (ratio beween amyloid β peptide 42 and 40, phosphorylated tau 181, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]). Voxel-wise analyses in SPM12 examined the effects of age, sex, intellectual disability, Alzheimer's clinical stage, and CSF biomarkers on brain metabolism.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, brain metabolism decreased with age primarily in the frontal lobe. By contrast, a more distributed pattern of metabolic loss was observed in DS with age, predominating in temporoparietal regions. Compared to asymptomatic DS participants, those at the prodromal stage exhibited medial parietal hypometabolism, which later extended to other temporoparietal and frontal regions at the dementia stage. In asymptomatic individuals, we observed a widespread hypometabolism compared to HC, mainly in medial frontal and parietal regions. All CSF biomarkers were closely associated with hypometabolism in regions affected by the disease, with the strongest association observed for NfL in medial parietal structures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The brain metabolic decline in DS with age reflects Alzheimer's pathological processes and involves temporoparietal regions in a similar pattern to that found in other forms of AD. Hypometabolism is more tightly related to CSF NfL levels than to core AD biomarkers. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The Earth continues to suffer from the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak even now, particularly due to the absence of appropriate theoretical frameworks for related emergency responses. In this study, we provided a simplified model for the emergency response to the coronavirus infection. We employed a qualitative content analysis, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist and flow diagram. Specifically, we examined eight underlying factors (leaders’ inability, focus on economic recovery, controversies regarding the usage of face masks, unprecedented reliance on herd immunity, hasty research and development, late decision-making, coordination failure, and occurrence of natural hazards) and eight selected overarching factors (global leadership, national policies, individual strategies, culture, research and development, timing, communication, and contingency). Considering these factors, we proposed the “Earth as a comprehensive system” approach, under which elements of the pandemic response are comprehensively included to facilitate problem-solving, social support, strategic use, assistance from various professionals, and education. The operational mechanism of this approach clearly emphasizes unified efforts for responding to a pandemic by systematically including various interdependent components of the Earth.

                Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma. Head and neck involvement accounts for only 10–15% of cases. Achieving clear margins in this region is challenging owing to anatomical constraints. Such cases often require extensive resection and complex reconstructions. This study presents a case series of extensive dermatofibrosarcoma resections in the head and neck, focusing on the surgical margins, reconstruction strategies, recurrence rates, and adjuvant therapy. We report four cases of head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma involving the cheek and scalp. Surgery included wide local excision with margins of 3–5 cm, which was confirmed intraoperatively by frozen section analysis. Reconstruction involved free flaps, local flaps, and healing with secondary intention. The choice depends on the defect size and location. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to selected cases. All patients achieved negative margins. One patient developed flap necrosis that required revision surgery. No local recurrence was observed during the follow-up (1–7 years). Head and neck dermatofibrosarcoma justifies aggressive surgical resection to achieve clear margins, which is the key to reducing the risk of recurrence. Free flaps and local reconstruction techniques ensure good functional and aesthetic outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated in patients with close margins or deep invasion. Long-term follow-up is essential owing to its high recurrence potential.

                The enteric nervous system (ENS), an elaborate network of neurons and glia woven through the gastrointestinal tract, is integral for digestive physiology and broader human health. Commensurate with its importance, ENS dysfunction is linked to a range of debilitating gastrointestinal disorders. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), with their pleiotropic roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, serve as key developmental effectors within the ENS. Herein, we review the regulatory dynamics of miRNAs in ENS ontogeny, showcasing specific miRNAs implicated in both congenital and acquired enteric neuropathies, such as Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR), achalasia, intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND), chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), and slow transit constipation (STC). By delineating miRNA-mediated mechanisms in these diseases, we underscore their importance for ENS homeostasis and highlight their potential as therapeutic targets.

                Ali et al. investigate proteomic changes in cerebrospinal fluid across multiple Alzheimer’s disease cohorts. They identify 2,029 dysregulated proteins that cluster into four groups, enriched in different biological processes compromised during different stages of AD continuum. They create and validate robust models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status.

                Whether tissue stem cells balance self-renewal with multipotent differentiation through successive binary steps or a multiple-option choice is unclear. Puig-Barbe and colleagues find a dimerization network of bHLH factors in the Drosophila intestine that provides unified regulation to the choice between stem, absorptive, and secretory fates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93063">Microprism-based two-photon imaging of the mouse inferior colliculus reveals novel organizational principles of the auditory midbrain</a></h4>

              
                To navigate real-world listening conditions, the auditory system relies on the integration of multiple sources of information. However, to avoid inappropriate cross-talk between inputs, highly connected neural systems need to strike a balance between integration and segregation. Here, we develop a novel approach to examine how repeated neurochemical modules in the mouse inferior colliculus lateral cortex (LC) allow controlled integration of its multimodal inputs. The LC had been impossible to study via imaging because it is buried in a sulcus. Therefore, we coupled two-photon microscopy with the use of a microprism to reveal the first-ever sagittal views of the LC to examine neuronal responses with respect to its neurochemical motifs under anesthetized and awake conditions. This approach revealed marked differences in the acoustic response properties of LC and neighboring non-lemniscal portions of the inferior colliculus. In addition, we observed that the module and matrix cellular motifs of the LC displayed distinct somatosensory and auditory responses. Specifically, neurons in modules demonstrated primarily offset responses to acoustic stimuli with enhancement in responses to bimodal stimuli, whereas matrix neurons showed onset response to acoustic stimuli and suppressed responses to bimodal stimulation. Thus, this new approach revealed that the repeated structural motifs of the LC permit functional integration of multimodal inputs while retaining distinct response properties.

                Juvenile hormone (JH) is important to maintain insect larval status; however, its cell membrane receptor has not been identified. Using the lepidopteran insect <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> (cotton bollworm), a serious agricultural pest, as a model, we determined that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) cadherin 96ca (CAD96CA) and fibroblast growth factor receptor homologue (FGFR1) function as JH cell membrane receptors by their roles in JH-regulated gene expression, larval status maintaining, rapid intracellular calcium increase, phosphorylation of JH intracellular receptor MET1 and cofactor Taiman, and high affinity to JH III. Gene knockout of <i>Cad96ca</i> and <i>Fgfr1</i> by CRISPR/Cas9 in embryo and knockdown in various insect cells, and overexpression of CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mammalian HEK-293T cells all supported CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmitting JH signal as JH cell membrane receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101851">Dual role of FOXG1 in regulating gliogenesis in the developing neocortex via the FGF signalling pathway</a></h4>

              
                In the developing vertebrate central nervous system, neurons and glia typically arise sequentially from common progenitors. Here, we report that the transcription factor Forkhead Box G1 (<i>Foxg1</i>) regulates gliogenesis in the mouse neocortex via distinct cell-autonomous roles in progenitors and postmitotic neurons that regulate different aspects of the gliogenic FGF signalling pathway. We demonstrate that loss of <i>Foxg1</i> in cortical progenitors at neurogenic stages causes premature astrogliogenesis. We identify a novel FOXG1 target, the pro-gliogenic FGF pathway component <i>Fgfr3</i>, which is suppressed by FOXG1 cell-autonomously to maintain neurogenesis. Furthermore, FOXG1 can also suppress premature astrogliogenesis triggered by the augmentation of FGF signalling. We identify a second novel function of FOXG1 in regulating the expression of gliogenic cues in newborn neocortical upper-layer neurons. Loss of FOXG1 in postmitotic neurons non-autonomously enhances gliogenesis in the progenitors via FGF signalling. These results fit well with the model that newborn neurons secrete cues that trigger progenitors to produce the next wave of cell types, astrocytes. If FGF signalling is attenuated in <i>Foxg1</i> null progenitors, they progress to oligodendrocyte production. Therefore, loss of FOXG1 transitions the progenitor to a gliogenic state, producing either astrocytes or oligodendrocytes depending on FGF signalling levels. Our results uncover how FOXG1 integrates extrinsic signalling via the FGF pathway to regulate the sequential generation of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the cerebral cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104826">Gaskell, Langley, and the "para-sympathetic" idea</a></h4>

              
                Historically, the creation of the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system of the vertebrates is inextricably linked to the unification of the cranial and sacral autonomic outflows. There is an intriguing disproportion between the entrenchment of the notion of a ‘cranio-sacral’ pathway, which informs every textbook schematic of the autonomic nervous system since the early XX<sup>th</sup> century, and the wobbliness of its two roots: an anatomical detail overinterpreted by Walter Holbrook Gaskell (the ‘gap’ between the lumbar and sacral outflows), on which John Newport Langley grafted a piece of physiology (a supposed antagonism of these two outflows on external genitals), repeatedly questioned since, to little avail. I retrace the birth of a flawed scientific concept (the cranio-sacral outflow) and the way in which it ossified instead of dissipated. Then, I suggest that the critique of the ‘cranio-sacral outflow’ invites, in turn, a radical deconstruction of the very notion of a ‘parasympathetic’ outflow, and a more realistic description of the autonomic nervous system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96519">A microglia clonal inflammatory disorder in Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Somatic genetic heterogeneity resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations is widespread in human tissues and can cause diseases, however, few studies have investigated its role in neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both in vitro and in patients. Although the natural history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in humans, microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in patients.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100218">Expression of a single inhibitory member of the Ly49 receptor family is sufficient to license NK cells for effector functions</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells recognize target cells through germline-encoded activation and inhibitory receptors enabling effective immunity against viruses and cancer. The Ly49 receptor family in the mouse and killer immunoglobin-like receptor family in humans play a central role in NK cell immunity through recognition of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and related molecules. Functionally, these receptor families are involved in the licensing and rejection of MHC-I-deficient cells through missing-self. The Ly49 family is highly polymorphic, making it challenging to detail the contributions of individual Ly49 receptors to NK cell function. Herein, we showed mice lacking expression of all Ly49s were unable to reject missing-self target cells in vivo, were defective in NK cell licensing, and displayed lower KLRG1 on the surface of NK cells. Expression of Ly49A alone on an H-2D<sup>d</sup> background restored missing-self target cell rejection, NK cell licensing, and NK cell KLRG1 expression. Thus, a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is sufficient to license NK cells and mediate missing-self in vivo.

However, there is still a limited number of studies that comprehensively assess (i) amplitudes, latencies, and sensory gating effects in all early components of auditory processing (M50–M100–M200 complex) at the source level in magnetoencephalography with their relation to structural anatomy (gray matter volume, thickness, gyrification) (ii) and the association between brain metrics and clinical phenotype in the same group of children. To address this question, we used a standard paired-clicks paradigm in magnetoencephalography and brain morphometry analysis in children with and without ASD (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><sub>ASD</sub> = 20, <span style="font-style:italic;">N</span><sub>TD</sub> = 20). First, the results revealed a reduction of M200 and altered M200 sensory gating effect in the left auditory cortex in children with ASD. Second, these alterations were related to lower language comprehension skills and higher autistic symptom severity. Finally, altered MEG responses were associated with gray matter thickness reduction as well as abnormal gyrification in the primary auditory cortex in ASD. The study revealed low-level functional and structural atypicalities in children with ASD and their relation to clinical phenotype.</span>

This study utilized the multilayer time-varying brain network to reveal the effect patterns of different separation degrees and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels on brain functional connectivity during ASSA. Specifically, a multilayer time-varying brain network with six time-windows equally divided by each epoch was constructed to investigate the segregation and integration of brain functional connectivity. The results showed that the inter-layer connectivity strength was consistently lower than the intra-layer connectivity strength for various separation degrees and SNR levels. Moreover, the connectivity strength of the multilayer time-varying brain network increased with decreasing separation degrees and initially increased and subsequently decreased with decreasing SNR levels. The second time-window of the network showed the most significant variation under some conditions and was determined as the core layer. The topology within the core layer was mainly reflected in the connectivity between the frontal and parietal-occipital cortices. In conclusion, these results suggest that spatial separation and background noise significantly modulate brain functional connectivity during ASSA.</span>

The tau-PET imaging data of 161 amyloid-beta-negative cognitively unimpaired participants as control and 259 amyloid-beta-positive subjects were recruited from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Linear regression analysis revealed that a higher tau-PET <span style="font-style:italic;">z</span>-score is associated with a lower density of nine receptors in the serotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, and glutamate systems. Furthermore, adding four neurotransmitter receptor density <span style="font-style:italic;">z</span>-scores significantly increased the proportion of explained variance by 3% to 7% compared to the epicenter-connectivity distance model in the group-level analysis.

                Pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, often associated with metastatic spread at diagnosis. We report the case of a 61-year-old male with a history of renal stones who presented with a four-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and declining visual acuity in the right eye. Imaging revealed a left hilar tumor with carcinomatous consolidation, bilateral parenchymal nodules, and left pleural effusion. Ophthalmologic evaluation showed choroidal lesions in the right eye, confirmed by orbital MRI as a subretinal intraocular lesion. Biopsies confirmed pulmonary SCC. The patient received six cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy alongside choroidal radiotherapy. After four cycles, choroidal metastases regressed, and visual acuity improved. Post-treatment imaging showed complete resolution of the intraocular lesion and a 34% reduction in tumor burden per RECIST 1.1. This case underscores the efficacy of combined systemic and localized therapies in managing advanced metastatic pulmonary SCC.

                Background This study reviewed the environmental and economic impacts of urban development in mountainous areas, with special attention to the impacts on the livelihoods of people and biodiversity in Ghana. Forests in mountainous areas provide essential economic and ecosystem services ranging from food, medicinal plants, wood (for wood, construction, furniture, fuel for cooking and heating) and clean water. Economic benefits in the form of tourism are also important. The situation in Ghana is compared to global situations and trends. While few studies are conducted globally to protect mountain resources, in Ghana there is dearth of literature for this kind of study. Ironically, building on mountains is gradually becoming an acceptable practice in Ghana. Methods A descriptive design was adopted in this study which comprises monitoring and observing the rate of decline of forest resources within a specified period of time. The study also made use of mixed method approach which combined numerical data and textual information. Literature on the impacts of urban development on the livelihoods of mountain people and environment were reviewed. The general economy and environmental impact of mountainous infrastructure on mountain people were also reviewed. Results The study showed that fast urban development in mountainous areas has negative consequences for the livelihoods of forest dwellers, ecosystem services, and forest resources. Policies related to land use in mountainous areas were also reviewed, as well as the challenges faced by municipal assemblies’ planning departments. It was found that the work of municipal planning officials is influenced by political elites at the national level. Conclusions In order to discourage urban development on mountains, the planning department of municipal assemblies should be seen as autonomous, where independence should be given to the professionals involved.

                Background Radon gas, a decay product of radium, is a significant environmental health risk due to its radioactive properties. Understanding the radium content and radon exhalation rates in soil is crucial for evaluating potential radiological hazards and ensuring environmental safety. Methods Soil samples were collected from twelve different locations in Wukro, Tigray, representing various soil types. The sealed can technique, using LR-115 Type-II plastic track detectors, was employed to measure radium concentrations and radon exhalation rates over a four-month exposure period. Radon mass exhalation rates, surface exhalation rates, and radium concentrations were calculated, and the Alpha Index was also determined to assess radiological risk. Results and Discussion The radon mass exhalation rates ranged from 0.18 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1 to 0.82 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1, with a mean of 0.48 × 10−7 Bq.kg−1.d−1. Surface exhalation rates varied from 0.38 × 10−6Bq.m−2.d−1 to 1.72 × 10−6 Bq.m−2.d−1, averaging 1.02 × 10−6 Bq.m−2.d−1. Radium concentrations ranged from 0.33 to 1.47 Bq.kg−1, with an average of 0.87 Bq.kg−1. A significant positive correlation between radium content and radon exhalation rates was observed, indicating a direct relationship between these variables. Clay soils exhibited the highest radium concentrations, while sandy soils had the lowest. All measured values were below the safety limit of 370 Bq.kg−1 recommended by OECD and UNSCEAR, suggesting no significant radiological risk in the study area. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of monitoring natural radiation levels for environmental safety. The findings provide a baseline for future studies and emphasize the need for continuous assessment to detect any long-term changes in soil radioactivity.

                The article introduces the concept of ‘intellectual neighbourhood,’ a historical-philosophical framework emphasising the collaborative nature of knowledge production across time in Eurasia, where respect for diverse ideas flourished. The study traces the contributions of Ali Qushji and his followers, illustrating how their works emerged from this interconnected intellectual milieu. The analysis further highlights how cosmopolitan cities like Samarkand and Istanbul functioned as conduits for knowledge exchange and acknowledges the influence of key Islamic scholars such as Nasir al-Din Tusi. Ultimately, the article advocates for a deeper appreciation of historical contexts to inform the reconstruction of contemporary intellectual neighbourhoods. It underscores the critical importance of trust and collaboration in navigating today’s complex global landscape.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-692/v3?src=rss">Association of Leptin and Leptin receptor Gene polymorphisms with Insulin resistance in pregnant women: A cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Leptin, along with its receptor, are linked with mechanisms affecting a diverse array of pregnancy-specific pathologies that include gestational diabetes and intrauterine growth restriction. The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance. Methods 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62±29.23 and 59.88±22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, ‘AA’ of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy.

                Novel object recognition tasks are commonly used to assess memory in rodents. These tests rely on an innate preference for exploring objects that are new or have been moved or changed. However, this preference, while normally seen in control conditions, is not immutable. Stressful experiences as well as lesions and genetic mutations can lead mice and rats to show clear preferences for exploring familiar objects and familiar locations. This opinion article discusses the evidence for changes in novelty preference, implications of this lability for assessing memory, and the significance of shifts in novelty preference as a readout of changes in curiosity with implications in approach–avoidance behavior and explore–exploit decision-making. Finally, we provide some recommendations for reporting and interpreting novelty preference task findings moving forward.

                Cheung et al. discovered hypothalamic subsets that encode threat, safety, predator imminence, anxiety, and arousal in freely behaving mice. These neural dynamics correlate with individual variations in defensiveness, providing insights into how innate fear is represented and scaled in the brain to guide survival responses.

                Cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells are known to interact within the tumor microenvironment and influence each other to impact on tumor progression. Here, Kay et al. discuss how they can also potentially metabolically interact with each other to alter the overall phenotype of the tumor and influence response to therapy.

                Using a forward genetics screen, Wu et al. uncovered the role of an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, TMEM11, in regulating Th1 cell effector functions. Tmem11−/− Th1 cells show alterations in mitochondrial cristae integrity and increased mtROS levels that influence cellular metabolism and chromatin modifications, resulting in decreased effector functions.

                Watanabe et al. demonstrate that high maternal progesterone during pregnancy supports efficient glucose supply to the developing embryo by increasing maternal insulin resistance via mPRε. This study suggests the potential use of mPRε modulators for managing pregnancy-related glycemic disorders such as gestational diabetes mellitus and for managing metabolic syndromes in offspring.

                Lyon et al. identify genetic factors important for MRSA vaginal colonization through an in vivo Tn-seq screen. Validation reveals competitive fitness defects in qoxB, bshB2, nanE, and srrAB mutants. Cross-comparison of ΔsrrAB in vitro RNA-seq with vaginal transcriptomic data uncovers >30 SrrAB-regulated factors potentially driving MRSA vaginal fitness.

                Klatzmann et al. identify a network-based bifurcation mechanism underlying conscious access. Using a mesoscale biophysical model, they reveal all-or-none dynamics emerging from connectome structural organization via an NMDA/AMPA receptor gradient. They validated this prediction using cortex-wide in vitro autoradiography. These findings provide insights into neural dynamics supporting conscious access.

                Cai et al. show that OsNAT10 is an RNA acetyltransferase responsible for ac4C modification in rice, influencing the ac4C mRNA modification pattern. OsNAT10 mediates the ac4C modification of key photosynthesis regulators, thereby regulating their stability and translation efficiency, which enhances photosynthetic efficiency and promotes rice growth and yield.
