              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Health status classification model for medical adherence system in retirement township [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Medical adherence and remote patient monitoring have gained huge attention from researchers recently, especially with the need to observe the patients’ health outside hospitals due to the ongoing pandemic. The main goal of this research work is to propose a health status classification model that provides a numerical indicator of the overall health condition of a patient via four major vital signs, which are body temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation level, and heart rate. A dataset has been prepared based on the data obtained from hospital records, with these four vital signs extracted for each patient. This dataset provides a label associating each patient to the number of medical diagnoses. Generally, the number of diagnoses correlates with the patient's medical condition, with no diagnoses indicating normal condition, one to two diagnoses suggest low risk, and more than that implies high risk. Thus, we propose a method to classify a patient’s health status into three classes, which are normal, low risk and high risk. This would provide guidance for healthcare workers on the patient's medical condition. By training the classification model using the prepared dataset, the seriousness of a patient's health condition can be predicted. This prediction is performed by classifying the patients based on their four vital signs. Our tests have yielded encouraging results using precision and recall as the evaluation metrics. The key outcome of this work is a trained classification model that quantifies a patient's health condition based on four vital signs. Nevertheless, the model can be further improved by considering more input features such as medical history. The results obtained from this research can assist medical personnel by providing a secondary advice regarding the health status for the patients who are located remotely from the medical facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Profile of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: Results from a longitudinal, prospective, multi‐site study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is highly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives of the study were to characterize autistic features in young children with TSC.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants included 138 children followed from ages 3 to 36 months with TSC from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms of ASD in TSC. Developmental and autism-specific assessments were administered, and a clinical diagnosis of ASD was determined for all participants at 36 months. Further analyses were performed on 117 participants with valid autism assessments based on nonverbal mental age greater than 15 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prevalence of clinical diagnosis of ASD at 36 months was 25%. Nearly all autistic behaviors on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) were more prevalent in children diagnosed with ASD; however, autism-specific behaviors were also observed in children without ASD. Overall quality of social overtures, facial expressions, and abnormal repetitive interests and behaviors were characteristics most likely to distinguish children with ASD from those without an ASD diagnosis. Participants meeting ADOS-2 criteria but not a clinical ASD diagnosis exhibited intermediate developmental and ADOS-2 scores compared to individuals with and without ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ASD is highly prevalent in TSC, and many additional individuals with TSC exhibit a broad range of sub-threshold autistic behaviors. Our findings reveal a broader autism phenotype that can be identified in young children with TSC, which provides opportunity for early targeted treatments.</p>

	<p>To identify a screening tool for poor self-reported sleep quality at 12 weeks according to non-invasive measurements and patients’ characteristics in the first week after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), data from 473 mTBI participants were collected and follow-ups were performed at 12 weeks. Patients with previous poor self-reported sleep quality prior to the injury were excluded. Patients were then divided into two groups at 12 weeks according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index based on whether or not they experienced poor sleep quality. The analysis was performed on personal profiles and heart rate variability (HRV) for 1 week. After analyzing the non-invasive measurements and characteristics of mTBI patients who did not complain of poor sleep quality, several factors were found to be relevant to the delayed onset of poor sleep quality, including age, gender, and HRV measurements. The HRV–age–gender (HAG) index was proposed and found to have 100% sensitivity (cut-off, 7; specificity, 0.537) to predicting whether the patient will experience poor sleep quality after mTBI at the 12-week follow-up. The HAG index helps us to identify patients with mTBI who have no sleep quality complaints but are prone to developing poor self-reported sleep quality. Additional interventions to improve sleep quality would be important for these particular patients in the future.</p>

	<p>Emerging evidence has indicated disrupted learned irrelevance (LIrr), a form of selective attention deficit that may contribute to psychotic symptom formation, in schizophrenia. However, previous research mostly focused on chronic patients. There is a paucity of studies on LIrr in first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (i.e., schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder; FES), which were limited by small sample size and have produced mixed results. The current study examined a LIrr effect and its relationship with positive symptom severity in 40 briefly-medicated FES patients and 42 demographically-matched healthy controls using a well-validated computerized LIrr paradigm which has been applied in chronic schizophrenia sample. Positive symptoms were assessed by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS). Our results showed that controls demonstrated intact LIrr, with significantly faster learning about previously predictive (relevant) than previously non-predictive (irrelevant) cues. Lack of such normal attention bias towards predictive over non-predictive cues was observed in FES patients, indicating their failure to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant stimuli. Nonetheless, we failed to reveal any significant correlations between learning scores, in particular learning scores for non-predictive cues, and positive symptom measures in FES patients. Learning scores were also not associated with other symptom dimensions, cognitive functions and antipsychotic dose. In conclusion, our findings indicate aberrant LIrr with impaired allocation of attention to relevant versus irrelevant stimuli in briefly-medicated FES patients. Further prospective research is warranted to clarify the longitudinal trajectory of such selective attention deficit and its association with positive symptoms and treatment response in the early course of illness.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Two novel short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) protocols, assessing SICI across a range of interstimulus intervals (ISIs) using either parallel threshold-tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TT-TMS) or automated conventional TMS (cTMS), were recently introduced. However, the test-retest reliability of these protocols has not been investigated, which is important if they are to be introduced in the clinic. SICI was recorded in 18 healthy subjects using TT-TMS (T-SICI) and cTMS (A-SICI). All subjects were examined at four identical sessions, i.e., morning and afternoon sessions on 2 d, 5&ndash;7 d apart. Both SICI protocols were performed twice at each session by the same observer. In one of the sessions, another observer performed additional examinations. Neither intraobserver nor interobserver measures of SICI differed significantly between examinations, except for T-SICI at ISI 3 ms (<I>p</I> = 0.00035) and A-SICI at ISI 2.5 ms (<I>p</I> = 0.0103). Intraday reliability was poor-to-good for A-SICI and moderate-to-good for T-SICI. Interday and interobserver reliabilities of T-SICI and A-SICI were moderate-to-good. Although between-subject variation constituted most of the total variation, SICI repeatability in an individual subject was poor. The two SICI protocols showed no considerable systematic bias across sessions and had a comparable test-retest reliability profile. Findings from the present study suggest that both SICI protocols may be reliably and reproducibly employed in research studies, but should be used with caution for individual decision-making in clinical settings. Studies exploring reliability in patient cohorts are warranted to investigate the clinical utility of these two SICI protocols.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The nonhuman primate (NHP) constitutes an extraordinarily important model in neuroscience research for understanding the neuronal underpinnings of perceptual, motor, cognitive, and executive functions of the primate brain, and to study the physiological causes, effects, and potential treatments of brain disorders. Because of their cognitive capabilities, NHPs receive special attention in animal welfare regulations around the world, and their well-being is a benchmark for the evaluation, monitoring, and refinement of experimental procedures. As a consequence, many typical neuroscientific procedures are considered only mildly severe by animal welfare boards. There is, however, an ongoing debate about possible long-term and cumulative effects. Because of a lack of longitudinal data, it is unclear whether mildly severe procedures may cause more significant harm on the long-term, and to what extent they may impact animal well-being and healthiness over time. We here make use of a database of blood samples drawn over a period of 15 years from 39 rhesus monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) to address the issue of long-term, cumulative effects of neuroscientific procedures. A careful analysis of indicative primate blood markers for chronic inflammation, hydration status, and stress levels, their comparison to baseline values from both the same animals and the literature, and evaluation of additional hematologic, physiological, and behavioral parameters did not provide support for the notion of long-term, cumulative effects on the monkeys&rsquo; healthiness and well-being. The results may serve the community as a reference for the severity assessment of neuroscientific experiments involving NHPs.</p>

                Longstanding scientific efforts have been dedicated to answer why and how our particular intelligence is generated by our brain but not by the brain of other species. However, surprisingly little effort has been made to ask why no other species ever developed an intelligence similar to ours. Here, I explore this question based on genetic and paleontologic evidence. Contrary to the established view, this review suggests that the developmental hurdles alone are not high enough to explain the uniqueness of human intelligence (HI). As an additional explanation I propose that HI is normally not retained by natural selection, because it is, under most conditions, an intrinsically unfavourable trait. This unfavourableness, however, cannot be explained by physical constraints alone; rather, it may also be rooted in the same emotional and social complexity that is necessary for the development of HI. Thus, a major obstacle towards HI may not be solely the development of the required physical assets, but also to cope with harmful individual, social and environmental feedback intrinsically associated with this trait.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A data-driven approach for constructing mutation categories for mutational signature analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gal Gilad, Mark D. M. Leiserson, Roded Sharan</p>

Mutational processes shape the genomes of cancer patients and their understanding has important applications in diagnosis and treatment. Current modeling of mutational processes by identifying their characteristic signatures views each base substitution in a limited context of a single flanking base on each side. This context definition gives rise to 96 categories of mutations that have become the standard in the field, even though wider contexts have been shown to be informative in specific cases. Here we propose a data-driven approach for constructing a mutation categorization for mutational signature analysis. Our approach is based on the assumption that tumor cells that are exposed to similar mutational processes, show similar expression levels of DNA damage repair genes that are involved in these processes. We attempt to find a categorization that maximizes the agreement between mutation and gene expression data, and show that it outperforms the standard categorization over multiple quality measures. Moreover, we show that the categorization we identify generalizes to unseen data from different cancer types, suggesting that mutation context patterns extend beyond the immediate flanking bases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimating ectopic beat probability with simplified statistical models that account for experimental uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qingchu Jin, Joseph L. Greenstein, Raimond L. Winslow</p>

Ectopic beats (EBs) are cellular arrhythmias that can trigger lethal arrhythmias. Simulations using biophysically-detailed cardiac myocyte models can reveal how model parameters influence the probability of these cellular arrhythmias, however such analyses can pose a huge computational burden. Here, we develop a simplified approach in which logistic regression models (LRMs) are used to define a mapping between the parameters of complex cell models and the probability of EBs (P(EB)). As an example, in this study, we build an LRM for P(EB) as a function of the initial value of diastolic cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub><sup>ini</sup>), the initial state of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> load ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub><sup>ini</sup>), and kinetic parameters of the inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>K1</sub>) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). This approach, which we refer to as arrhythmia sensitivity analysis, allows for evaluation of the relationship between these arrhythmic event probabilities and their associated parameters. This LRM is also used to demonstrate how uncertainties in experimentally measured values determine the uncertainty in P(EB). In a study of the role of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub><sup>ini</sup> uncertainty, we show a special property of the uncertainty in P(EB), where with increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>SR</sub><sup>ini</sup> uncertainty, P(EB) uncertainty first increases and then decreases. Lastly, we demonstrate that I<sub>K1</sub> suppression, at the level that occurs in heart failure myocytes, increases P(EB).

Over the past 40 years, actigraphy has been used to study rest-activity patterns in circadian rhythm and sleep research. Furthermore, considering its simplicity of use, there is a growing interest in the analysis of large population-based samples, using actigraphy. Here, we introduce <i>pyActigraphy</i>, a comprehensive toolbox for data visualization and analysis including multiple sleep detection algorithms and rest-activity rhythm variables. This open-source python package implements methods to read multiple data formats, quantify various properties of rest-activity rhythms, visualize sleep agendas, automatically detect rest periods and perform more advanced signal processing analyses. The development of this package aims to pave the way towards the establishment of a comprehensive open-source software suite, supported by a community of both developers and researchers, that would provide all the necessary tools for in-depth and large scale actigraphy data analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Experiment level curation of transcriptional regulatory interactions in neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eric Ching-Pan Chu, Alexander Morin, Tak Hou Calvin Chang, Tue Nguyen, Yi-Cheng Tsai, Aman Sharma, Chao Chun Liu, Paul Pavlidis</p>

To facilitate the development of large-scale transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) that may enable in-silico analyses of disease mechanisms, a reliable catalogue of experimentally verified direct transcriptional regulatory interactions (DTRIs) is needed for training and validation. There has been a long history of using low-throughput experiments to validate single DTRIs. Therefore, we reason that a reliable set of DTRIs could be produced by curating the published literature for such evidence. In our survey of previous curation efforts, we identified the lack of details about the quantity and the types of experimental evidence to be a major gap, despite the theoretical importance of such details for the identification of bona fide DTRIs. We developed a curation protocol to inspect the published literature for support of DTRIs at the experiment level, focusing on genes important to the development of the mammalian nervous system. We sought to record three types of low-throughput experiments: Transcription factor (TF) perturbation, TF-DNA binding, and TF-reporter assays. Using this protocol, we examined a total of 1,310 papers to assemble a collection of 1,499 unique DTRIs, involving 251 TFs and 825 target genes, many of which were not reported in any other DTRI resource. The majority of DTRIs (965; 64%) were supported by two or more types of experimental evidence and 27% were supported by all three. Of the DTRIs with all three types of evidence, 170 had been tested using primary tissues or cells and 44 had been tested directly in the central nervous system. We used our resource to document research biases among reports towards a small number of well-studied TFs. To demonstrate a use case for this resource, we compared our curation to a previously published high-throughput perturbation screen and found significant enrichment of the curated targets among genes differentially expressed in the developing brain in response to Pax6 deletion. This study demonstrates a proof-of-concept for the assembly of a high resolution DTRI resource to support the development of large-scale TRNs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RgCop-A regularized copula based method for gene selection in single cell rna-seq data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Snehalika Lall, Sumanta Ray, Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay</p>

Gene selection in unannotated large single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is important and crucial step in the preliminary step of downstream analysis. The existing approaches are primarily based on high variation (highly variable genes) or significant high expression (highly expressed genes) failed to provide stable and predictive feature set due to technical noise present in the data. Here, we propose <i>RgCop</i>, a novel regularized copula based method for gene selection from large single cell RNA-seq data. <i>RgCop</i> utilizes copula correlation (<i>Ccor</i>), a robust equitable dependence measure that captures multivariate dependency among a set of genes in single cell expression data. We raise an objective function by adding a <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> regularization term with <i>Ccor</i> to penalizes the redundant co-efficient of features/genes, resulting non-redundant effective features/genes set. Results show a significant improvement in the clustering/classification performance of real life scRNA-seq data over the other state-of-the-art. <i>RgCop</i> performs extremely well in capturing dependence among the features of noisy data due to the scale invariant property of copula, thereby improving the stability of the method. Moreover, the differentially expressed (DE) genes identified from the clusters of scRNA-seq data are found to provide an accurate annotation of cells. Finally, the features/genes obtained from <i>RgCop</i> can able to annotate the unknown cells with high accuracy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Photophysiological cycles in Arctic krill are entrained by weak midday twilight during the Polar Night</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan H. Cohen, Kim S. Last, Corie L. Charpentier, Finlo Cottier, Malin Daase, Laura Hobbs, Geir Johnsen, Jørgen Berge</p>

Light plays a fundamental role in the ecology of organisms in nearly all habitats on Earth and is central for processes such as vision and the entrainment of the circadian clock. The poles represent extreme light regimes with an annual light cycle including periods of Midnight Sun and Polar Night. The Arctic Ocean extends to the North Pole, and marine light extremes reach their maximum extent in this habitat. During the Polar Night, traditional definitions of day and night and seasonal photoperiod become irrelevant since there are only “twilight” periods defined by the sun’s elevation below the horizon at midday; we term this “midday twilight.” Here, we characterize light across a latitudinal gradient (76.5° N to 81° N) during Polar Night in January. Our light measurements demonstrate that the classical solar diel light cycle dominant at lower latitudes is modulated during Arctic Polar Night by lunar and auroral components. We therefore question whether this particular ambient light environment is relevant to behavioral and visual processes. We reveal from acoustic field observations that the zooplankton community is undergoing diel vertical migration (DVM) behavior. Furthermore, using electroretinogram (ERG) recording under constant darkness, we show that the main migratory species, Arctic krill (<i>Thysanoessa inermis</i>) show endogenous increases in visual sensitivity during the subjective night. This change in sensitivity is comparable to that under exogenous dim light acclimations, although differences in speed of vision suggest separate mechanisms. We conclude that the extremely weak midday twilight experienced by krill at high latitudes during the darkest parts of the year has physiological and ecological relevance.

The Michaelis constant <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> describes the affinity of an enzyme for a specific substrate and is a central parameter in studies of enzyme kinetics and cellular physiology. As measurements of <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> are often difficult and time-consuming, experimental estimates exist for only a minority of enzyme–substrate combinations even in model organisms. Here, we build and train an organism-independent model that successfully predicts <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> values for natural enzyme–substrate combinations using machine and deep learning methods. Predictions are based on a task-specific molecular fingerprint of the substrate, generated using a graph neural network, and on a deep numerical representation of the enzyme’s amino acid sequence. We provide genome-scale <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> predictions for 47 model organisms, which can be used to approximately relate metabolite concentrations to cellular physiology and to aid in the parameterization of kinetic models of cellular metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA samples from small-bodied fish species [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Fish species are commonly used as experimental models in the laboratory. DNA is routinely collected from these animals to permit identification of their genotype. The current standard procedure to sample DNA is fin clipping, which involves anaesthetising individuals and removing a portion of the caudal fin. While fin clipping reliably generates good quality DNA samples for downstream applications, there is evidence that it can alter health and welfare, leading to infection and impacting on the fish’s behaviour. This in turn can result in greater variation in the data collected. In a recent study we adapted a skin swabbing protocol to collect DNA from small-bodied fish, including sticklebacks and zebrafish, without the use of anaesthetics or sharp instruments. A rayon-tipped swab was used to collect mucus from the flank of the fish, which was then used for DNA extraction. We subsequently demonstrated that compared to fin clipping, skin swabbing triggered fewer changes in stress axis activation and behaviour. We also found that data collected from fish that had been swabbed were less variable than data from fish that had been fin clipped, potentially allowing smaller sample sizes in experimental groups after using this technique, and thereby reducing animal use. Here we provide a detailed protocol explaining how to collect DNA samples from small laboratory fish using skin swabs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">FDRestimation: Flexible False Discovery Rate Computation in R [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                False discovery rates (FDR) are an essential component of statistical inference, representing the propensity for an observed result to be mistaken. FDR estimates should accompany observed results to help the user contextualize the relevance and potential impact of findings. This paper introduces a new user-friendly R pack-age for estimating FDRs and computing adjusted p-values for FDR control. The roles of these two quantities are often confused in practice and some software packages even report the adjusted p-values as the estimated FDRs. A key contribution of this package is that it distinguishes between these two quantities while also offering a broad array of refined algorithms for estimating them. For example, included are newly augmented methods for estimating the null proportion of findings - an important part of the FDR estimation procedure. The package is broad, encompassing a variety of adjustment methods for FDR estimation and FDR control, and includes plotting functions for easy display of results. Through extensive illustrations, we strongly encourage wider reporting of false discovery rates for observed findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of clinical, histology, TNF-α, and collagen expressions on oral ulcer in rats after treatment with areca nut and chrysanthemum oral gel [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into five groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), and F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Tau reduction prevents epileptogenesis, but underlying mechanisms are uncertain. Chang et al. show that tau ablation decreases the baseline activity of excitatory neurons and modulates the intrinsic excitability and axon initial segments of inhibitory neurons, promoting network inhibition. In combination, these effects counteract network hypersynchrony and diseases causing excitation/inhibition imbalance.

                Toullec et al. explore the assembly of PIKK complexes as a paradigm to understand the principles governing the biogenesis of multimeric complexes. Biochemical and functional analyses show that, in fission yeast, PIKK maturation and assembly occur sequentially, rather than simultaneously, and require distinct factors and mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Monitoring mitochondrial calcium and metabolism in the beating MCU-KO heart</a></h4>

              
                Kosmach et al. develop an optical spectroscopy-based method using Ca2+ indicator dye Rhod-2-AM to monitor mitochondrial Ca2+ in the ex vivo perfused mouse heart. Using this method with hearts under beta-adrenergic stimulation, we find that there are no alternative Ca2+ uptake pathways in germline MCU-KO hearts.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Hippocampal and thalamic afferents form distinct synaptic microcircuits in the mouse infralimbic frontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Patterns of synaptic connectivity govern the functional properties of neural circuits. Graham et al. map the afferent neurons targeting eight specific cell classes in mouse infralimbic cortex. Inputs from the hippocampus and thalamus are differentially targeted to specific neurons, suggesting two distinct synaptic microcircuits control circuit transformations.

                Xie et al. apply a bacterial pupylation system to proximity label electrical and chemical synapses in the mouse cortex by fusing the ligase PafA with CX26/36 and with gephyrin, respectively. Proximity labeling enables stamping of transient electrical synapses, demonstrating utility for decoding physiological functions in the developing nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mechanical overstimulation causes acute injury and synapse loss followed by fast recovery in lateral-line neuromasts of larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Excess noise damages sensory hair cells, resulting in loss of synaptic connections with auditory nerves and, in some cases, hair-cell death. The cellular mechanisms underlying mechanically induced hair-cell damage and subsequent repair are not completely understood. Hair cells in neuromasts of larval zebrafish are structurally and functionally comparable to mammalian hair cells but undergo robust regeneration following ototoxic damage. We therefore developed a model for mechanically induced hair-cell damage in this highly tractable system. Free swimming larvae exposed to strong water wave stimulus for 2 hours displayed mechanical injury to neuromasts, including afferent neurite retraction, damaged hair bundles, and reduced mechanotransduction. Synapse loss was observed in apparently intact exposed neuromasts, and this loss was exacerbated by inhibiting glutamate uptake. Mechanical damage also elicited an inflammatory response and macrophage recruitment. Remarkably, neuromast hair-cell morphology and mechanotransduction recovered within hours following exposure, suggesting severely damaged neuromasts undergo repair. Our results indicate functional changes and synapse loss in mechanically damaged lateral-line neuromasts that share key features of damage observed in noise-exposed mammalian ear. Yet, unlike the mammalian ear, mechanical damage to neuromasts is rapidly reversible.

To combat infections from drug-resistant bacteria, the transplantation of commensal antimicrobial bacteria as a therapeutic has shown clinical promise. We screened a collection of diverse staphylococcus species from domestic dogs and cats for antimicrobial activity against MRSP. A unique strain (<i>S. felis</i> C4) was isolated from feline skin that inhibited MRSP and multiple gram-positive pathogens. Whole genome sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed several secreted antimicrobials including a thiopeptide bacteriocin micrococcin P1 and phenol-soluble modulin beta (PSMβ) peptides that exhibited antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity. Fluorescence and electron microscopy revealed that <i>S. felis</i> antimicrobials inhibited translation and disrupted bacterial but not eukaryotic cell membranes. Competition experiments in mice showed that <i>S. felis</i> significantly reduced MRSP skin colonization and an antimicrobial extract from <i>S. felis</i> significantly reduced necrotic skin injury from MRSP infection. These findings indicate a feline commensal bacterium that could be utilized in bacteriotherapy against difficult-to-treat animal and human skin infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The structure of behavioral variation within a genotype</a></h4>

              
                Individual animals vary in their behaviors. This is true even when they share the same genotype and were reared in the same environment. Clusters of covarying behaviors constitute behavioral syndromes, and an individual’s position along such axes of covariation is a representation of their personality. Despite these conceptual frameworks, the structure of behavioral covariation within a genotype is essentially uncharacterized and its mechanistic origins unknown. Passing hundreds of inbred <i>Drosophila</i> individuals through an experimental pipeline that captured hundreds of behavioral measures, we found sparse but significant correlations among small sets of behaviors. Thus, the space of behavioral variation has many independent dimensions. Manipulating the physiology of the brain, and specific neural populations, altered specific correlations. We also observed that variation in gene expression can predict an individual’s position on some behavioral axes. This work represents the first steps in understanding the biological mechanisms determining the structure of behavioral variation within a genotype.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning differentially shapes prefrontal and hippocampal activity during classical conditioning</a></h4>

              
                The ability to use sensory cues to inform goal directed actions is a critical component of behavior. To study how sounds guide anticipatory licking during classical conditioning, we employed high-density electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampal CA1 area and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in mice. CA1 and PFC neurons undergo distinct learning dependent changes at the single cell level and maintain representations of cue identity at the population level. In addition, reactivation of task-related neuronal assemblies during hippocampal awake Sharp-Wave Ripples (aSWR) changed within individual sessions in CA1 and over the course of multiple sessions in PFC. Despite both areas being highly engaged and synchronized during the task, we found no evidence for coordinated single cell or assembly activity during conditioning trials or aSWR. Taken together, our findings support the notion that persistent firing and reactivation of task-related neural activity patterns in CA1 and PFC support learning during classical conditioning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The inner mechanics of Rhodopsin Guanylyl Cyclase during 2cGMP-formation revealed by real-time FTIR spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                Enzymerhodopsins represent a recently discovered class of rhodopsins which includes histidine kinase rhodopsin, rhodopsin phosphodiesterases and rhodopsin guanylyl cyclases (RGCs). The regulatory influence of the rhodopsin domain on the enzyme activity is only partially understood and holds the key for a deeper understanding of intra-molecular signaling pathways. Here we present a UV-Vis and FTIR study about the light-induced dynamics of a RGC from the fungus Catenaria anguillulae, which provides insights into the catalytic process. After the spectroscopic characterization of the late rhodopsin photoproducts, we analyzed truncated variants and revealed the involvement of the cytosolic N-terminus in the structural rearrangements upon photo-activation of the protein. We tracked the catalytic reaction of RGC and the free GC domain independently by UV-light induced release of GTP from the photolabile NPE-GTP substrate. Our results show substrate binding to the dark-adapted RGC and GC alike and reveal differences between the constructs attributable to the regulatory influence of the rhodopsin on the conformation of the binding pocket. By monitoring the phosphate rearrangement during cGMP and pyrophosphate formation in light-activated RGC, we were able to confirm the M state as the active state of the protein. The described setup and experimental design enable real-time monitoring of substrate turnover in light-activated enzymes on a molecular scale, thus opening the pathway to a deeper understanding of enzyme activity and protein-protein interactions.

                Nuclease-directed genome editing is a powerful tool for investigating physiology and has great promise as a therapeutic approach to correct mutations that cause disease. In its most precise form, genome editing can use cellular homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways to insert information from an exogenously supplied DNA repair template (donor) directly into a targeted genomic location. Unfortunately, particularly for long insertions, toxicity and delivery considerations associated with repair template DNA can limit HDR efficacy. Here, we explore chemical modifications to both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA-repair templates. We describe 5′-terminal modifications, including in its simplest form the incorporation of triethylene glycol (TEG) moieties, that consistently increase the frequency of precision editing in the germlines of three animal models (<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, zebrafish, mice) and in cultured human cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Finger somatotopy is preserved after tetraplegia but deteriorates over time</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies showed reorganised and/or altered activity in the primary sensorimotor cortex after a spinal cord injury (SCI), suggested to reflect abnormal processing. However, little is known about whether somatotopically-specific representations can be activated despite reduced or absent afferent hand inputs. In this observational study we used functional MRI and an (attempted) finger movement task in tetraplegic patients to characterise the somatotopic hand layout in primary somatosensory cortex. We further used structural MRI to assess spared spinal tissue bridges. We found that somatotopic hand representations can be activated through attempted finger movements in absence of sensory and motor hand functioning, and no spared spinal tissue bridges. Such preserved hand somatotopy could be exploited by rehabilitation approaches that aim to establish new hand-brain functional connections after SCI (e.g., neuroprosthetics). However, over years since SCI the hand representation somatotopy deteriorated, suggesting that somatotopic hand representations are more easily targeted within the first years after SCI.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human Erbb2-induced Erk activity robustly stimulates cycling and functional remodeling of rat and human cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                Multiple mitogenic pathways capable of promoting mammalian cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation have been identified as potential candidates for functional heart repair following myocardial infarction. However, it is unclear whether the effects of these mitogens are species-specific and how they directly compare in the same cardiac setting. Here, we examined how CM-specific lentiviral expression of various candidate mitogens affects human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs) and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) <i>in vitro</i>. In 2D-cultured CMs from both species, and in highly mature 3D-engineered cardiac tissues generated from NRVMs, a constitutively-active mutant form of the human gene Erbb2 (cahErbb2) was the most potent tested mitogen. Persistent expression of cahErbb2 induced CM proliferation, sarcomere loss, and remodeling of tissue structure and function, which were attenuated by small molecule inhibitors of Erk signaling. These results suggest transient activation of Erbb2/Erk axis in cardiomyocytes as a potential strategy for regenerative heart repair.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder Present Subtle Heterogenous Cardiac Abnormalities.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) are strongly linked on a functional and genetic level. Most work has been focused on the neurodevelopmental abnormalities in CHD, whereas the investigation of cardiac abnormalities (CHD or not) in ASD has been more limited. In this work we investigate the prevalence of cardiac comorbidities relative to genetic contributors of ASD. Methods: Using high frequency ultrasound imaging, we screened 9 mouse models with ASD-related genetic alterations (Arid1b(+/-), Chd8(+/-), 16p11.2 (deletion), Sgsh(+/-), Sgsh(-/-), Shank3 {Delta}exon 4-9(+/-), Shank3 {Delta}exon 4-9(-/-), Fmr1(-/-), Vps13b(+/-)), along with pooled wild-type littermates (WT). Using a standardised imaging protocol, the cardiac morphological and functional parameters measured were thickness and thickening of the left-ventricular (LV) anterior and posterior walls, LV chamber diameter, LV fractional shortening, heart rate (HR), aorta diameter (AoD), LV stroke volume and cardiac output. Results: Small-scale alterations in cardiac structure and function were found in the mutant groups compared to WTs. When mutant groups were compared to each other, a greater number of significant differences was observed than when mutant groups were compared to WT controls. Mutant groups differed primarily in measures of structure (LV chamber diameter and anterior wall thickness, HR, AoD), while when compared to WT controls, they differed in both structure and function (LV anterior wall thickness and thickening, LV chamber diameter and fractional shortening, HR). The mutant groups with most differences to WT controls are 16p11.2 (deletion), Fmr(-/-), Arid1b(+/-). Among mutant groups, the groups differing most from the others were 16p11.2 (deletion), Sgsh(+/-), Fmr1(-/-). Our results recapitulate the clinical findings associated with each genetic mutation and broadly with ASD, to the extent that a direct comparison is possible. Additionally, our protocol was verified as an effective screening protocol capturing various dimensions of cardiac function. Conclusions: The characteristic heterogeneity of ASD was recapitulated in the cardiac phenotype of ASD-models. However, determining whether certain mutant groups differ in morphological or functional measures (as a general category) can offer insight regarding common underlying mechanisms. Clinically, knowledge of cardiac abnormalities in ASD can be essential as even non-lethal cardiac abnormalities can impact normal development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The hallucinogenic serotonin2A receptor agonist, DOI, promotes CREB-dependent gene expression of specific plasticity-associated genes in the rodent neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelic compounds that target the 5-HT2A receptor are reported to evoke psychoplastogenic effects, including enhanced dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of neuronal plasticity-associated genes is implicated in the cytoarchitectural effects of serotonergic psychedelics, however the transcription factors that drive this regulation are poorly elucidated. Here, we addressed the contribution of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the regulation of neuronal plasticity-associated genes by the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonist, DOI. In vitro studies with rat cortical neurons indicated that DOI enhances the phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB) through the MAP kinase and CaMKII pathways, with both cascades contributing to the DOI-evoked upregulation of Arc, Bdnf1, Cebpb and Egr2 expression, whilst the upregulation of Egr1 and cFos mRNA involved the MAP kinase and CaMKII pathway respectively. We observed a robust DOI-evoked increase in the expression of several neuronal plasticity-associated genes in the rat neocortex in vivo. Further, 5-HT2A receptor stimulation enhanced pCREB enrichment at putative cAMP response element (CRE) binding sites in the Arc, Bdnf1, Cebpb, cFos, but not Egr1 and Egr2, promoters in the rodent neocortex. The DOI-mediated transcriptional induction of Arc, cFos and Cebpb was significantly attenuated in the neocortex of CREB deficient (CREB{delta} KO) mice. Collectively, these results indicate that the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI leads to a rapid transcriptional upregulation of several neuronal plasticity-associated genes, with a subset of them exhibiting a CREB-dependent regulation. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that similar to slow-acting classical antidepressants, rapid-action serotonergic psychedelics that target the 5-HT2A receptor may also recruit the transcription factor CREB to enhance the expression of neuronal plasticity-associated genes in the neocortex, which could in turn contribute to the rapid psychoplastogenic changes evoked by these compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Opposing subclasses of Drosophila ellipsoid body neurons promote and suppress sleep</a></h4>

              
                Recent work in Drosophila has uncovered several neighboring classes of sleep-regulatory neurons within the central complex. However, the logic of connectivity and network motifs remains limited by the incomplete examination of relevant cell types. Using a recent genetic-anatomical classification of ellipsoid body ring neurons, we conducted a thermogenetic screen to assess sleep/wake behavior and discovered two opposing populations: sleep-promoting R3m and wake-promoting R3d neurons. Activation of these neurons influences sleep duration and architecture by prolonging or shortening sleep bouts, suggesting a key role in sleep maintenance. R3m and R3d neurons are GABAergic and require GABA synthesis for their effects on sleep. Finally, we use a fluorescent reporter for putative synaptic partners to embed these neurons within the known sleep-regulatory network; R3m and R3d neurons lay downstream of wake-active Helicon cells, and R3m neurons likely inhibit R3d neurons. Together, the data presented herein suggest a neural mechanism by which previously uncharacterized circuit elements operate within the sleep homeostat to stabilize sleep-wake states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fetal neural progenitors process TLR signals from bacterial components to enhance proliferation and rework brain development</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial cell wall, a universal pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), crosses the placenta into the fetal brain. We determined that PAMPs interact with TLR2/6 on murine fetal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to induce overexpansion of all neocortical layers leading to a larger, folded cortex and abnormal postnatal behavior. The NPC overexpansion originated at E10 and targeted ventricular radial glia (vRG), the primary NPC, by shortening cell cycle and increasing self-renewal. The mechanism involved two novel signaling pathways in NPCs mediated by recognition of bacterial PAMPs by TLR2/6 including: a) loss of primary cilia, activation of hedgehog signaling, and increased FOXG1 and b) increased PI3K/AKT activity. These findings reveal PAMP/TLR2/6 acts as a morphogen in fetal neurodevelopment. In addition, the loss of Tlr2 or Tlr6 without pathogenic challenge, increased the number of neurons, establishing the requirement for an endogenous TLR2 signal for normal neurodevelopment in the embryo.

                The intellectual disability found in people with Down syndrome (DS) is associated with a decrease in white matter in the central nervous system. To study the mechanism of this myelination deficit, we differentiated two isogenic lines of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from people with DS into brain-like and spinal cord-like neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and promoted a transition towards oligodendroglial fate by activating the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway. In the spinal cord-like trisomic cells, we found no difference in expression of OLIG2 or NKX2.2, two transcription factors essential for commitment to the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage. However, in the brain-like trisomic NPCs, OLIG2 is significantly upregulated and is associated with reduced expression of NKX2.2. We found that this gene dysregulation and block in NPC transition can be normalized by increasing the concentration of a SHH pathway agonist (SAG) during differentiation. These results underscore the importance of regional and cell type differences in gene expression in DS and demonstrate that modulation of SHH signaling in trisomic cells can rescue an early perturbed step in neural lineage specification in DS.

                Studies of brain activity evoked by naturalistic stimuli have found narrative suspense produces reliable patterns of activation consistent with increased attention to the narrative and decreased processing of non-narrative stimuli (Bezdek et al., 2015). Yet the progression of brain states (i.e. patterns of activity levels across the whole brain) at suspense peaks and how they differ from suspense valleys or resting state scans has not previously been investigated. We used a fast fMRI acquisition sequence to measure sub-second brain states at peaks and valleys of narrative suspense and during rest. We found five brain states that occur during suspenseful film viewing, four of which differ in their frequency near suspense peaks compared to valleys. The pattern of results is consistent with the theoretical view that suspense captures and focuses attentional processing, triggering subsequent cognitive processing of narrative events.

                Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition that is characterized by hypersensitivity to multi-modal sensory stimuli, widespread pain, and fatigue. We have previously proposed explosive synchronization (ES), a phenomenon wherein a small perturbation to a network can lead to an abrupt state transition, as a potential mechanism of the hypersensitive FM brain. Therefore, we hypothesized that converting a brain network from ES to general synchronization (GS) may reduce the hypersensitivity of FM brain. To find an effective brain network modulation to convert ES into GS, we constructed a large-scale brain network model near criticality (i.e., an optimally balanced state between order and disorders), which reflects brain dynamics in conscious wakefulness, and adjusted two parameters: local structural connectivity and signal randomness of target brain regions. The network sensitivity to global stimuli was compared between the brain networks before and after the modulation. We found that only increasing the local connectivity of hubs (nodes with intense connections) changes ES to GS, reducing the sensitivity, whereas other types of modulation such as decreasing local connectivity, increasing and decreasing signal randomness are not effective. This study would help to develop a network mechanism-based brain modulation method to reduce the hypersensitivity in FM.

                Abnormalities in energetic and proteic homeostasis during ageing relate to neurodegenerative diseases. The mitochondria are a hub of oxidative metabolism, influencing autophagic flux. Ageing can lead to a functional disruption of these systems, leading to neuroenergetic and proteotoxic imbalance. Lower levels of testosterone have been proposed as a mechanism accelerating functional decline during ageing. In this study we investigated whether nandrolone decanoate (ND), an analog of testosterone, in aged animals improves mitochondrial bioenergetics and autophagy. Albino CF1 mice of 3 and 18 months of age, were separated in 4 groups that received daily subcutaneous injections for 15 days of either ND (15mg/kg), or vehicle. Were performed baseline and 14th day 18FDG uptake analysis, through positron emission tomography scan. High resolution respirometry was performed to assess functionally mitochondrial respiratory states and respiratory control ratio (RCR) in synaptossomes fractions. Also, hypothalamic immunocontent of AMPK, pAMPKT172, Beclin-1 and BCL-2 LC3 was assessed. Results demonstrate that aged animals did not display alterations nor in 18FDG uptake, neither in mitochondrial respiratory states. Also, aged mice displayed reduced pAMPKT172/ AMPK ratio, and increased LC3-II compared to adult controls. Curiously, ND in aged mice did neither increase 18FDG uptake, nor alter mitochondrial states. Albeit, ND increased pAMPKT172/ AMPK ratio, LC3-II turnover, as well as increased RCR. This suggest that ageing does not culminate necessarily in bioenergetics alterations in brain, although biomarkers of energetic status and autophagy are reduced. ND improved bioenergetic efficiency and autophagy in aged mice. These benefits are probably mediated by reprogramation of AMPK signalling.

                Despite remarkable advances in mapping the functional connectivity of the cortex, the functional connectivity of subcortical regions is understudied in living humans. This is the case for brainstem nuclei that control vital processes, such as autonomic, limbic, nociceptive and sensory functions. This is because of the lack of precise brainstem nuclei localization, of adequate sensitivity and resolution in the deepest brain regions, as well as of optimized processing for the brainstem. To close the gap between the cortex and the brainstem, on 20 healthy subjects, we computed a correlation based functional connectome of 15 brainstem nuclei involved in autonomic, limbic, nociceptive, and sensory function (superior and inferior colliculi, ventral tegmental area parabrachial pigmented nucleus complex, microcellular tegmental nucleus prabigeminal nucleus complex, lateral and medial parabrachial nuclei, vestibular and superior olivary complex, superior and inferior medullary reticular formation, viscerosensory motor nucleus, raphe magnus, pallidus, and obscurus, and parvicellular reticular nucleus alpha part) with the rest of the brain. Specifically, we exploited 1.1mm isotropic resolution 7 Tesla resting state fMRI, ad hoc coregistration and physiological noise correction strategies, and a recently developed probabilistic template of brainstem nuclei. Further, we used 2.5mm isotropic resolution resting state fMRI data acquired on a 3 Tesla scanner to assess the translatability of our results to conventional datasets. We report highly consistent correlation coefficients across subjects, confirming available literature on autonomic, limbic, nociceptive and sensory pathways, as well as high interconnectivity within the central autonomic network and the vestibular network. Interestingly, our results showed evidence of vestibulo autonomic interactions in line with previous work. Comparison of 7 Tesla and 3 Tesla findings showed high translatability of results to conventional settings for brainstem cortical connectivity and good yet weaker translatability for brainstem brainstem connectivity. The brainstem functional connectome might bring new insight in the understanding of autonomic, limbic, nociceptive and sensory function in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ultrasound-mediated delivery of novel tau-specific monoclonal antibody enhances brain uptake but not therapeutic efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Tau-specific immunotherapy is an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. However, targeting tau effectively remains a considerable challenge due to the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which excludes 99.9% of peripherally administered antibodies. We have previously shown that the delivery of tau-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) with low-intensity scanning ultrasound in combination with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS+MB) increases the passage of IgG antibodies into the brain. SUS+MB transiently opens tight junctions to allow paracellular transport, but also facilitates transcellular transport, particularly for larger cargoes. However, therapeutic efficacy after enhanced brain delivery has not been explored. To assess whether ultrasound-mediated delivery of tau-specific mAbs leads to an enhanced therapeutic response, K369I tau transgenic K3 mice were passively immunised once weekly for 12 weeks with a novel mAb, RNF5, in combination with SUS+MB. While none of the treatment arms improved behaviour or motor functions in these mice, we found that both RNF5 and SUS+MB treatments on their own reduced tau pathology, but, surprisingly, the combination of both (RNF5+SUS+MB) did not achieve an additive reduction in tau pathology. This was despite observing increased antibody penetration in the brain. Interestingly, a significant fraction of the antibody in the combination treatment was visualized in brain endothelial cells, suggesting that paracellular transport may not be the preferred uptake mechanism for RNF5. Taken altogether, more research is warranted to develop SUS+MB as a delivery modality for anti-tau antibodies.

                Hundreds of KCNQ2 variants have been identified by genetic testing of children with early onset epilepsy and/or developmental disability. Voltage-clamp recording from heterologous cells has proved useful for establishing deleterious functional effects of KCNQ2 variants, but procedures adapting these assays for standardized, higher throughput data collection and reporting are lacking. In this study, we employed automated patch clamp recording to assess in parallel the functional and pharmacological properties of 79 missense and 2 in-frame deletion variants of KCNQ2. Among the variants we studied were a training set of 18 pathogenic variants previously studied by voltage-clamp recording, 24 mostly rare population variants, and 39 disease-associated variants with unclear functional effects. Variant KCNQ2 subunits were transiently expressed in a cell line stably expressing KCNQ3 to reconstitute the physiologically relevant channel complex. Variants with severe loss-of-function were also co-expressed 1:1 with WT KCNQ2 in the KCNQ3 cell line to mimic the heterozygous genotype and assess dominant-negative behavior. In total, we analyzed electrophysiological data recorded from 9,480 cells. The functional properties of WT KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels and pharmacological responses to known blockers and activators determined by automated patch clamp recording were highly concordant with previous findings. Similarly, functional properties of 18 known pathogenic variants largely matched previously published results and the validated automated patch clamp assay. Many of the 39 previously unstudied disease-associated KCNQ2 variants exhibited prominent loss-of-function and dominant-negative effects, providing strong evidence in support of pathogenicity. All variants, exhibit response to retigabine (10 M), although there were differences in maximal responses. Variants within the ion selectivity filter exhibited the weakest responses whereas retigabine had the strongest effect on gain-of-function variants in the voltage-sensor domain. Our study established a high throughput method to detect deleterious functional consequences of KCNQ2 variants. We demonstrated that dominant-negative loss-of-function is a common mechanism associated with missense KCNQ2 variants but this does not occur with rare population variation in this gene. Importantly, we observed genotype-dependent differences in the response of KCNQ2 variants to retigabine.

                Brainstem nuclei play a pivotal role in many functions, such as arousal and motor control. Nevertheless, the connectivity of arousal and motor brainstem nuclei is understudied in living humans due to the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution of conventional imaging, and to the lack of atlases of these deep tiny regions of the brain. For a holistic comprehension of sleep, arousal and associated motor processes, we investigated in 20 healthy subjects the resting-state functional connectivity of 18 arousal and motor brainstem nuclei in living humans. To do so, we used high spatial-resolution 7 Tesla resting-state fMRI, as well as a recently developed in-vivo probabilistic atlas of these nuclei in stereotactic space. Further, we verified the translatability of our brainstem connectome approach to conventional (e.g. 3 Tesla) fMRI. Arousal brainstem nuclei displayed high interconnectivity, as well as connectivity to the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal forebrain and frontal cortex, in line with animal studies and as expected for arousal regions. Motor brainstem nuclei showed expected connectivity to the cerebellum, basal ganglia and motor cortex, as well as high interconnectivity. Comparison of 3 Tesla to 7 Tesla connectivity results indicated good translatability of our brainstem connectome approach to conventional fMRI, especially for cortical and subcortical (non-brainstem) targets and to a lesser extent for brainstem targets. The functional connectome of 18 arousal and motor brainstem nuclei with the rest of the brain might provide a better understanding of arousal, sleep and accompanying motor function in living humans in health and disease.

                Removing power line and other frequency-specific artifacts from electrophysiological data without affecting neural signals remains a challenging task. Recently, an approach was introduced that combines spectral and spatial filtering to effectively remove line noise: Zapline (de Cheveigne, 2020). This algorithm, however, requires manual selection of the noise frequency and the number of spatial components to remove during spatial filtering. Moreover, it assumes that noise frequency and spatial topography are stationary over time, which is often not warranted. To overcome these issues, we introduce Zapline-plus, which allows adaptive and automatic removal of frequency-specific noise artifacts from M/EEG data. To achieve this, our extension first searches for peaks in the spectrum, then applies Zapline iteratively to chunks of data to account for non-stationarity of the noise over time. Likewise, the exact noise frequency around the found target frequency is determined separately for every chunk to allow fluctuations of the peak noise frequency. The number of to-be-removed components is automatically determined using an outlier detection algorithm. Finally, the frequency spectrum after cleaning is analyzed for suboptimal cleaning and parameters are adapted accordingly before re-running the process if necessary. The software creates a detailed plot for analysis of the cleaning that can be used to inform manual changes. We showcase the efficacy of the different features of our algorithm by applying it to four openly available data sets, two EEG sets containing both stationary and mobile conditions, and two MEG sets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Performance Scaling for Structural MRI Surface Parcellations: A Machine Learning Analysis in the ABCD Study</a></h4>

              
                The use of pre-defined parcellations on surface-based representations of the brain as a method for data reduction is common across neuroimaging studies. In particular, prediction-based studies typically employ parcellation-driven summaries of brain measures as input to predictive algorithms, but the choice of parcellation and its influence on performance is often ignored. Here we employed pre-processed structural magnetic resonance imaging data (sMRI) from the ABCD Study to examine the relationship between 220 parcellations and out-of-sample predictive performance across 45 phenotypic measures in a large sample of 9-10-year-old children (N=9,432). Choice of Machine Learning (ML) pipeline and use of alternative multiple parcellation-based strategies were also assessed. Relative parcellation performance was dependent on the spatial resolution of the parcellation, with larger numbers of parcels (up to ~4000) outperforming coarser parcellations, according to a power-law scaling of between 1/4 and 1/3. Performance was further influenced by the type of parcellation, ML pipeline, and general strategy, with existing literature-based parcellations, a support vector based pipeline, and ensembling across multiple parcellations, respectively, as the highest performing. These findings highlight the choice of parcellation as an important influence on downstream predictive performance, showing in some cases that switching to a higher resolution parcellation can yield a relatively large boost to performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic alcohol drinking persistently suppresses thalamostriatal excitation of cholinergic neurons to impair cognitive flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to addictive substances impairs flexible decision-making. Cognitive flexibility is mediated by striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs). However, how chronic alcohol drinking alters cognitive flexibility through CINs remains unclear. Here, we report that chronic alcohol consumption and withdrawal impaired reversal of instrumental learning. Chronic alcohol consumption and withdrawal also caused a long-lasting (21 d) reduction of excitatory thalamic inputs onto CINs and reduced pause response of CINs in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). CINs are known to inhibit glutamatergic transmission in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) but facilitate this transmission in D2-MSNs, which may contribute to flexible behavior. We discovered that chronic alcohol drinking impaired CIN-mediated inhibition in D1-MSNs and facilitation in D2-MSNs. Importantly, in vivo optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation of thalamostriatal transmission in DMS CINs rescued alcohol-induced reversal learning deficits. These results demonstrate that chronic alcohol drinking reduces thalamic excitation of DMS CINs, compromising their regulation of glutamatergic transmission in MSNs, which may contribute to alcohol-induced impairment of cognitive flexibility. These findings provide a neural mechanism underlying inflexible drinking in alcohol use disorder.

                Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by species of filamentous fungi widely found as a contaminant in food and with high toxic potential. Studies have shown that this toxin cause kidney and liver damage, however, data on the effects of exposure to OTA on the central nervous system are still scarce. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a teleost often used in translational research due to its physiological, genetic, and behavioral homology with mammals, in addition to being useful as an environmental bioindicator. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to OTA on behavioral and neurochemical parameters in adult zebrafish. The animals were treated with different doses of OTA (1.38, 2.77, and 5.53 mg/kg) and submitted to behavioral evaluations in the open tank and social interaction tests. Subsequently, they were euthanized, and the brains were used to assess markers associated with oxidative status. In the open tank test OTA induced changes in distance, absolute turn angle, mean speed, and time-freezing. However, no significant effects were observed in the social interaction test. Moreover, OTA also induced alterations in neurochemical parameters with changes in non-protein thiols (NPSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR). This study showed that OTA can affect neurobiological aspects in zebrafish even at low doses.

                A broad range of brain pathologies critically relies on the vasculature, and cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. However, the cellular and molecular architecture of the human brain vasculature remains poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 599,215 freshly isolated endothelial, perivascular and other tissue-derived cells from 47 fetuses and adult patients to construct a molecular atlas of the developing fetal, adult control and diseased human brain vasculature. We uncover extensive molecular heterogeneity of healthy fetal and adult human brains and across eight vascular-dependent CNS pathologies including brain tumors and brain vascular malformations. We identify alteration of arteriovenous differentiation and reactivated fetal as well as conserved dysregulated pathways in the diseased vasculature. Pathological endothelial cells display a loss of CNS-specific properties and reveal an upregulation of MHC class II molecules, indicating atypical features of CNS endothelial cells. Cell-cell interaction analyses predict numerous endothelial-to-perivascular cell ligand-receptor crosstalk including immune-related and angiogenic pathways, thereby unraveling a central role for the endothelium within brain neurovascular unit signaling networks. Our single-cell brain atlas provides insight into the molecular architecture and heterogeneity of the developing, adult/control and diseased human brain vasculature and serves as a powerful reference for future studies.

                Epilepsy is associated with genetic risk factors and cortico-subcortical network alterations, but associations between neurobiological mechanisms and macroscale connectomics remain unclear. This multisite ENIGMA-Epilepsy study examined whole-brain structural covariance networks in patients with epilepsy and related findings to postmortem co-expression patterns of epilepsy risk genes. Brain network analysis included 578 adults with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), 288 adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), and 1,328 healthy controls from 18 centres worldwide. Graph theoretical analysis of structural covariance networks revealed increased clustering and path length in orbitofrontal and temporal regions in TLE, suggesting a shift towards network regularization. Conversely, people with IGE showed decreased clustering and path length in fronto-temporo-parietal cortices, indicating a random network configuration. Syndrome-specific topological alterations reflected expression patterns of risk genes for hippocampal sclerosis in TLE and for generalized epilepsy in IGE. These imaging-genetic signatures could guide diagnosis, and ultimately, tailor therapeutic approaches to specific epilepsy syndromes.

                Filament assembly of amyloid-{beta} peptides ending at residue 42 (A{beta}42) is a central event in Alzheimer's disease. We report the cryo-EM structures of A{beta}42 filaments from brain. Two structurally related S-shaped protofilament folds give rise to two types of filaments. Type I filaments were found mostly in the brains of individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease and Type II filaments in individuals with familial Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. The structures of A{beta}42 filaments from brain differ from those of filaments assembled in vitro. By contrast, in App NL-F knock-in mice, A{beta}42 deposits were made of Type II filaments. Knowledge of A{beta}42 filament structures from human brain may lead to the development of inhibitors of assembly and improved imaging agents.

                Three-photon (3P) microscopy significantly increases the depth and resolution of in vivo imaging due to decreased scattering and nonlinear optical sectioning. Past studies used separate 1300 and 1700 nm excitation sources to excite green and red fluorescent proteins. Recently work shows that a single 1300 nm excitation source allows for dual color 3P imaging with increased signal-to-background and decreased average power. Future use of single excitation 3P microscopes would reduce the need for additional custom optical elements and decrease cost. However, there is a lack of experimental data characterizing the excitation properties of specific fluorophore combinations in the near-infrared range. Here, we assess the dual-color imaging potential of tdTomato or mScarlet in combination with EGFP when excited by a single excitation source tuned from 1225-1360 nm in the living mouse brain. We find that tdTomato and mScarlet, expressed in oligodendrocytes and neurons respectively, have exceptional signal-to-background in the 1300-1360 nm range in deep cortex, consistent with enhanced 3P cross sections. These results suggest that a single excitation source is advantageous for multiple applications of dual-color structural and functional brain imaging highlighting the importance of empirical characterization of individual fluorophores in the near-infrared region.

                Microglia modulate synaptic activity, essential for context-dependent cognitive performance, allowing organism-level adaptations to different environmental scenarios. Yet, the microglial molecular drivers required for synaptic remodeling related to cognitive performance remain largely elusive. Here, combining conditional gene targeting, single-cell live imaging, RNA-seq, high-throughput proteomics, systems biology, and animal behavior, we mapped a molecular nexus between microglia and synapses that instruct cognitive performance. Specifically, we found that microglia use the RhoGTPase Rac1 as a relay switch to sense the brain microenvironment and drive synaptic remodeling required for experience-dependent sociability and learning related to memory. Targeting this microglial relay modifies context-dependent cognitive performance.

                Episodic migraine is reflected by cyclic changes in behaviour and cortical processing. In this study, we aimed to identify how functional connectivities change over the entire migraine cycle. By using longitudinal neuroimaging and a whole-brain analysis approach, we tested 12 episodic migraine patients across 82 fMRI recordings during spontaneous headache attacks, with follow-up measurements over the pain-free interval without any external stimulation. We focussed on two different trajectories with a linear increase of connectivity and a peak either during the prodromal phase or during the headache attack. We found cycle-related connectivity changes for the anterior insula and the posterior orbitofrontal cortex. Both regions showed the highest connections with sensory, motor, and cingulate areas in the prodromal phase. The connectivity between the hypothalamus and the locus coeruleus was strongest during the headache attack. The peak connectivity during the prodromal phase and its collapse during the headache can be regarded as a mechanism of normalising cortical processing. The increase of synchronicity of functional connections during the ictal phase of the migraine cycle may contribute to the variety of symptoms of migraine attacks, such as headache, hypersensitivity to sensory modalities, and autonomous symptoms. We speculate about a malfunction at the molecular level in agranular frontal and insular brain regions, which needs to be followed up upon in subsequent studies.

                Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by selective vulnerability of distinct cell populations; however, the cause for this specificity remains elusive. Many circuits that degenerate in disease are shaped by neural activity during development, raising the possibility that mechanisms governing early cell loss may be misused when activity is compromised in the mature brain. Here we show that electrical activity and synaptic transmission are both required for neuronal survival in the adult entorhinal cortex, but these silencing methods trigger distinct means of degeneration in the same neuronal population. Competition between active and inactive cells drives axonal disintegration caused by synaptic inhibition, but not axon retraction due to electrical suppression. These findings suggest that activity dependence may persist in some areas of the adult brain long after developmental critical periods have closed. We speculate that lifelong plasticity required to support memory may render entorhinal neurons vulnerable to prolonged activity changes in disease.

                Communication across anatomical areas of the brain is key to both sensory and motor processes. Dimensionality reduction approaches have shown that the covariation of activity across cortical areas follows well-delimited patterns. Some of these patterns fall within the "potent space" of neural interactions and generate downstream responses; other patterns fall within the "null space" and prevent the feedforward propagation of synaptic inputs. Despite growing evidence for the role of null space activity in visual processing as well as preparatory motor control, a mechanistic understanding of its neural origins is lacking. Here, we developed a mean-rate model that allowed for the systematic control of feedforward propagation by potent and null modes of interaction. In this model, altering the number of null modes led to no systematic changes in firing rates, correlations, or mean synaptic strengths across areas, making it difficult to characterize feedforward communication with common measures of functional connectivity. A novel measure termed the null ratio captured the proportion of null modes relayed from one area to another. Applied to simultaneous recordings of primate cortical areas V1 and V2 during image viewing, the null ratio revealed that feedforward interactions have a broad null space that may reflect properties of visual stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coherent oscillations in balanced neural networks driven by endogenous fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                We present a detailed analysis of the dynamical regimes observed in a balanced network of identical Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with a sparse connectivity for homogeneous and heterogeneous in-degree distribution. Depending on the parameter values, either an asynchronous regime or periodic oscillations spontaneously emerge. Numerical simulations are compared with a mean field model based on a self-consistent Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The FPE reproduces quite well the asynchronous dynamics in the homogeneous case by either assuming a Poissonian or renewal distribution for the incoming spike trains. An exact self consistent solution for the mean firing rate obtained in the limit of infinite in-degree allows identifying balanced regimes that can be either mean- or fluctuation-driven. A low-dimensional reduction of the FPE in terms of circular cumulants is also considered. Two cumulants suffice to reproduce the transition scenario observed in the network. The emergence of periodic collective oscillations is well captured both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous setups by the mean field models upon tuning either the connectivity, or the input DC current. In the heterogeneous situation we analyze also the role of structural heterogeneity.

                Neuronal firing patterns are the result of inputs converging onto single cells. Identifying these inputs, anatomically and functionally, is essential to understand how neurons integrate information. Single-cell electroporation of helper genes and subsequent local injection of recombinant rabies viruses enable precise mapping of inputs to individual cells in superficial layers of the intact cortex. However, access to neurons in deeper structures requires more invasive procedures, including removal of overlying tissue. We have developed a method that through a combination of virus injections allows us to target [&le;]4 hippocampal cells 48% of the time and a single cell 16% of the time in wildtype mice without the use of electroporation or tissue aspiration. We identify local and distant monosynaptic inputs that can be functionally characterised in vivo. By expanding the toolbox for monosynaptic circuit tracing, this method will help further our understanding of neuronal integration at the level of single cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Crystal or Jelly? Effect of Color on the Perception of Translucent Materials with Photographs of Real-world Objects</a></h4>

              
                Translucent materials are ubiquitous in nature (e.g. teeth, food, wax), but our understanding of translucency perception is limited. Previous work in translucency perception has mainly used monochromatic rendered images as stimuli, which are restricted by their diversity and realism. Here, we measure translucency perception with photographs of real-world objects. Specifically, we use three behavior tasks: binary classification of 'translucent' versus 'opaque', semantic attribute rating of perceptual qualities (see-throughness, glossiness, softness, glow and density), and material categorization. Two different groups of observers finish the three tasks with color or grayscale images. We find that observers' agreements depend on the physical material properties of the objects such that translucent materials generate more inter-observer disagreements. Further, there are more disagreements among observers in the grayscale condition in comparison to that in color condition. We also discover that converting images to grayscale substantially affects the distributions of attribute ratings for some images. Furthermore, ratings of see-throughness, glossiness, and glow could predict individual observers' binary classification of images in both grayscale and color conditions. Lastly, converting images to grayscale alters the perceived material categories for some images such that observers tend to misjudge images of food as non-food and vice versa. Our result demonstrates color is informative about material property estimation and recognition. Meanwhile, our analysis shows mid-level semantic estimation of material attributes might be closely related to high-level material recognition. We also discuss individual differences in our results and highlight the importance of such consideration in material perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic changes in spatial representation within the posterior parietal cortex in response to visuomotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies used fMRI population receptive field (pRF) mapping to demonstrate that retinotopic organization extends from primary visual cortex to ventral and dorsal visual pathways by quantifying visual field maps, receptive field size, and laterality throughout multiple areas. Visuospatial representation in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is modulated by attentional deployment, raising the question of whether spatial representation in the PPC is dynamic and flexible and that this flexibility contributes to visuospatial learning. To answer this question, changes in spatial representation within PPC, as measured with pRF mapping, were recorded before and after visuomotor adaptation. Visuospatial input was laterally manipulated, rightward or leftward, via prism adaptation, a well-established visuomotor technique that modulates visuospatial performance. Based on existing models of prism adaptation mechanism of action, we predicted left prism adaptation to produce a right visuospatial bias via an increasing pRF size in the left parietal cortex. However, our hypothesis was agnostic as to whether right PPC will show an opposite effect given the bilateral bias to right visual field. Findings show that adaptation to left-shifting prisms increases pRF size in both PPCs, while leaving space representation in early visual cortex unchanged. This is the first evidence that prism adaptation drives a dynamic reorganization of response profiles in the PPC. Our results show that spatial representation in the PPC not only reflects changes driven by attentional deployment but dynamically changes in response to visuomotor adaptation. Furthermore, our results provide support for using prism adaptation as a tool to rehabilitate visuospatial deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">M1 dynamics share similar inputs for initiating and correcting movement</a></h4>

              
                Motor cortex is integral to generating voluntary movement commands. However, as a dynamical system, it is unclear how motor cortical movement commands are informed by either new or sensory-driven corrective instructions. Here, we examine population activity in the primary motor cortex of macaques during a continuous, sequential arm movement task in which the movement instruction is updated several times over the course of a trial. We use Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS) to decompose population activity into a portion explainable via dynamics, and a stream of inferred inputs required to instruct that dynamical system. The time series of inferred inputs had several surprising properties. First, input timing was more strongly locked to target appearance than to movement onset, suggesting that variable reaction times may be a function of how inputs interact with ongoing dynamics rather than variability in instruction timing. Second, inferred inputs were tuned nearly identically for both initial and corrective movements, suggesting a commonality in the structure of inputs across visually-instructed and corrective movements that was previously obscured by the complexity of the dynamical system that is M1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Remembering the pattern: A longitudinal case study on statistical learning in spatial navigation and memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Distinct brain systems are thought to support statistical learning over different timescales. Regularities encountered during online perceptual experience can be acquired rapidly by the hippocampus. Further processing during offline consolidation can establish these regularities gradually in cortical regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These mechanisms of statistical learning may be critical during spatial navigation, for which knowledge of the structure of an environment can facilitate future behavior. Rapid acquisition and prolonged retention of regularities have been investigated in isolation, but how they interact in the context of spatial navigation is unknown. We had the rare opportunity to study the brain systems underlying both rapid and gradual timescales of statistical learning using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) longitudinally in the same patient over a period of three weeks. As hypothesized, spatial patterns were represented in the hippocampus but not mPFC for up to one week after statistical learning and then represented in the mPFC but not hippocampus two and three weeks after statistical learning. Taken together, these findings clarify that the hippocampus may do the initial work of extracting regularities and transfer these integrated memories to cortex, rather than only storing individual experiences and leaving it up to cortex to extract regularities.

	<p>Functional Cognitive Disorder (FCD) is a common diagnosis at the memory clinic. FCD is characterised by significant self-reported cognitive symptoms in the absence of external evidence of cognitive dysfunction. A potential explanation for this is a deficit in metacognition, the process by which we internally judge our own abilities. Here we investigated differences in accuracy, confidence, and metacognition between people with FCD (N = 20), neurodegenerative mild cognitive impairment (nMCI; N = 14), and healthy controls (N = 23). The groups were assessed on forced choice memory and perceptual tasks, with trial by trial confidence ratings. FCD and nMCI participants showed lower accuracy on the memory task (means FCD 63.65%, nMCI 63.96%, HC 71.22%), with a significant difference between the FCD and HC groups after controlling for age and sex. There were no between-group differences in memory task confidence (means FCD 3.19, nMCI 3.59, HC 3.71). The FCD group showed greater confidence when longer time was allowed on the memory task. No between group differences in perceptual task accuracy (means FCD 63.97%, nMCI 64.50%, FCD 65.86%) or confidence (means FCD 3.71, nMCI 3.43, HC 3.88) were found. No differences in metacognitive efficacy emerged between the groups, either on the memory or perceptual task (Memory Meta-d’/d’:FCD 0.63, nMCI 0.94 HC 0.85; Perceptual Meta-d’,d’: FCD 0.50, nMCI 0.51, HC 0.72). Participants showed greater metacognitive efficacy on the memory task compared to the perceptual task. The difficulties experienced by people with FCD do not appear to be due to metacognitive deficits. Their performance was similar to people with nMCI over aspects of the memory tasks, which suggests that the primary issue may lie with memory encoding or retrieval, rather than with their judgement of performance accuracy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Reduced Dopamine Signaling Impacts Pyramidal Neuron Excitability in Mouse Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Dopaminergic modulation is essential for the control of voluntary movement; however, the role of dopamine in regulating the neural excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) is not well understood. Here, we investigated two modes by which dopamine influences the input/output function of M1 neurons. To test the direct regulation of M1 neurons by dopamine, we performed whole-cell recordings of excitatory neurons and measured excitability before and after local, acute dopamine receptor blockade. We then determined whether chronic depletion of dopaminergic input to the entire motor circuit, via a mouse model of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, was sufficient to shift M1 neuron excitability. We show that D1 receptor (D1R) and D2R antagonism altered subthreshold and suprathreshold properties of M1 pyramidal neurons in a layer-specific fashion. The effects of D1R antagonism were primarily driven by changes to intrinsic properties, while the excitability shifts following D2R antagonism relied on synaptic transmission. In contrast, chronic depletion of dopamine to the motor circuit with 6-hydroxydopamine induced layer-specific synaptic transmission-dependent shifts in M1 neuron excitability that only partially overlapped with the effects of acute D1R antagonism. These results suggest that while acute and chronic changes in dopamine modulate the input/output function of M1 neurons, the mechanisms engaged are distinct depending on the duration and origin of the manipulation. Our study highlights the broad influence of dopamine on M1 excitability by demonstrating the consequences of local and global dopamine depletion on neuronal input/output function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discrete mechanical model of lamellipodial actin network implements molecular clutch mechanism and generates arcs and microspikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David M. Rutkowski, Dimitrios Vavylonis</p>

Mechanical forces, actin filament turnover, and adhesion to the extracellular environment regulate lamellipodial protrusions. Computational and mathematical models at the continuum level have been used to investigate the molecular clutch mechanism, calculating the stress profile through the lamellipodium and around focal adhesions. However, the forces and deformations of individual actin filaments have not been considered while interactions between actin networks and actin bundles is not easily accounted with such methods. We develop a filament-level model of a lamellipodial actin network undergoing retrograde flow using 3D Brownian dynamics. Retrograde flow is promoted in simulations by pushing forces from the leading edge (due to actin polymerization), pulling forces (due to molecular motors), and opposed by viscous drag in cytoplasm and focal adhesions. Simulated networks have densities similar to measurements in prior electron micrographs. Connectivity between individual actin segments is maintained by permanent and dynamic crosslinkers. Remodeling of the network occurs via the addition of single actin filaments near the leading edge and via filament bond severing. We investigated how several parameters affect the stress distribution, network deformation and retrograde flow speed. The model captures the decrease in retrograde flow upon increase of focal adhesion strength. The stress profile changes from compression to extension across the leading edge, with regions of filament bending around focal adhesions. The model reproduces the observed reduction in retrograde flow speed upon exposure to cytochalasin D, which halts actin polymerization. Changes in crosslinker concentration and dynamics, as well as in the orientation pattern of newly added filaments demonstrate the model’s ability to generate bundles of filaments perpendicular (actin arcs) or parallel (microspikes) to the protruding direction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Time to revisit the endpoint dilution assay and to replace the TCID50 as a measure of a virus sample’s infection concentration</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Cresta, Donald C. Warren, Christian Quirouette, Amanda P. Smith, Lindey C. Lane, Amber M. Smith, Catherine A. A. Beauchemin</p>

The endpoint dilution assay’s output, the 50% infectious dose (ID<sub>50</sub>), is calculated using the Reed-Muench or Spearman-Kärber mathematical approximations, which are biased and often miscalculated. We introduce a replacement for the ID<sub>50</sub> that we call Specific INfection (SIN) along with a free and open-source web-application, midSIN (https://midsin.physics.ryerson.ca) to calculate it. midSIN computes a virus sample’s SIN concentration using Bayesian inference based on the results of a standard endpoint dilution assay, and requires no changes to current experimental protocols. We analyzed influenza and respiratory syncytial virus samples using midSIN and demonstrated that the SIN/mL reliably corresponds to the number of infections a sample will cause per mL. It can therefore be used directly to achieve a desired multiplicity of infection, similarly to how plaque or focus forming units (PFU, FFU) are used. midSIN’s estimates are shown to be more accurate and robust than the Reed-Muench and Spearman-Kärber approximations. The impact of endpoint dilution plate design choices (dilution factor, replicates per dilution) on measurement accuracy is also explored. The simplicity of SIN as a measure and the greater accuracy provided by midSIN make them an easy and superior replacement for the TCID<sub>50</sub> and other <i>in vitro</i> culture ID<sub>50</sub> measures. We hope to see their universal adoption to measure the infectivity of virus samples.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Factors affecting aerosol SARS-CoV-2 transmission via HVAC systems; a modeling study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zachary J. Cotman, Michael J. Bowden, Barrett P. Richter, Joseph H. Phelps, Christopher J. Dibble</p>

The role of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. To address this gap, we simulated the release of SARS-CoV-2 in a multistory office building and three social gathering settings (bar/restaurant, nightclub, wedding venue) using a well-mixed, multi-zone building model similar to those used by Wells, Riley, and others. We varied key factors of HVAC systems, such as the Air Changes Per Hour rate (ACH), Fraction of Outside Air (FOA), and Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values (MERV) to examine their effect on viral transmission, and additionally simulated the protective effects of in-unit ultraviolet light decontamination (UVC) and separate in-room air filtration. In all building types, increasing the ACH reduced simulated infections, and the effects were seen even with low aerosol emission rates. However, the benefits of increasing the fraction of outside air and filter efficiency rating were greatest when the aerosol emission rate was high. UVC filtration improved the performance of typical HVAC systems. In-room filtration in an office setting similarly reduced overall infections but worked better when placed in every room. Overall, we found little evidence that HVAC systems facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission; most infections in the simulated office occurred near the emission source, with some infections in individuals temporarily visiting the release zone. HVAC systems only increased infections in one scenario involving a marginal increase in airflow in a poorly ventilated space, which slightly increased the likelihood of transmission outside the release zone. We found that improving air circulation rates, increasing filter MERV rating, increasing the fraction of outside air, and applying UVC radiation and in-room filtration may reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission indoors. However, these mitigation measures are unlikely to provide a protective benefit unless SARS-CoV-2 aerosol emission rates are high (>1,000 Plaque-forming units (PFU) / min).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for switching from face-to-face to remote conference: An opportunity to estimate the reduction in GHG emissions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Valentin Guignon, Catherine Breton, Jérôme Mariette, François Sabot, Julien Fumey, Vincent Lefort, Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier</p>

In 2020, the world faced the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that drastically altered people’s lives. Since then, many countries have been forced to suspend public gatherings, leading to many conference cancellations, postponements, or reorganizations. Switching from a face-to-face to a remote conference became inevitable and the ultimate solution to sustain scientific exchanges at the national and the international levels. The same year, as a committee, we were in charge of organizing the major French annual conference that covers all computational biology areas: The “Journées Ouvertes en Biologie, Informatique et Mathématiques<i>”</i> (JOBIM). Despite the health crisis, we succeeded in changing the conference format from face to face to remote in a very short amount of time. Here, we propose 10 simple rules based on this experience to modify a conference format in an optimized and cost-effective way. In addition to the suggested rules, we decided to emphasize an unexpected benefit of this situation: a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to travel for scientific conference attendance. We believe that even once the SARS-CoV-2 crisis is over, we collectively will have an opportunity to think about the way we approach such scientific events over the longer term.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Universally valid reduction of multiscale stochastic biochemical systems using simple non-elementary propensities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yun Min Song, Hyukpyo Hong, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Biochemical systems consist of numerous elementary reactions governed by the law of mass action. However, experimentally characterizing all the elementary reactions is nearly impossible. Thus, over a century, their deterministic models that typically contain rapid reversible bindings have been simplified with non-elementary reaction functions (e.g., Michaelis-Menten and Morrison equations). Although the non-elementary reaction functions are derived by applying the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) to deterministic systems, they have also been widely used to derive propensities for stochastic simulations due to computational efficiency and simplicity. However, the validity condition for this heuristic approach has not been identified even for the reversible binding between molecules, such as protein-DNA, enzyme-substrate, and receptor-ligand, which is the basis for living cells. Here, we find that the non-elementary propensities based on the deterministic total QSSA can accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of the reversible binding in general. However, serious errors occur when reactant molecules with similar levels tightly bind, unlike deterministic systems. In that case, the non-elementary propensities distort the stochastic dynamics of a bistable switch in the cell cycle and an oscillator in the circadian clock. Accordingly, we derive alternative non-elementary propensities with the stochastic low-state QSSA, developed in this study. This provides a universally valid framework for simplifying multiscale stochastic biochemical systems with rapid reversible bindings, critical for efficient stochastic simulations of cell signaling and gene regulation. To facilitate the framework, we provide a user-friendly open-source computational package, ASSISTER, that automatically performs the present framework.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Network potential identifies therapeutic miRNA cocktails in Ewing sarcoma</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Davis T. Weaver, Kathleen I. Pishas, Drew Williamson, Jessica Scarborough, Stephen L. Lessnick, Andrew Dhawan, Jacob G. Scott</p>

MicroRNA (miRNA)-based therapies are an emerging class of targeted therapeutics with many potential applications. Ewing Sarcoma patients could benefit dramatically from personalized miRNA therapy due to inter-patient heterogeneity and a lack of druggable (to this point) targets. However, because of the broad effects miRNAs may have on different cells and tissues, trials of miRNA therapies have struggled due to severe toxicity and unanticipated immune response. In order to overcome this hurdle, a network science-based approach is well-equipped to evaluate and identify miRNA candidates and combinations of candidates for the repression of key oncogenic targets while avoiding repression of essential housekeeping genes. We first characterized 6 Ewing sarcoma cell lines using mRNA sequencing. We then estimated a measure of tumor state, which we term network potential, based on both the mRNA gene expression and the underlying protein-protein interaction network in the tumor. Next, we ranked mRNA targets based on their contribution to network potential. We then identified miRNAs and combinations of miRNAs that preferentially act to repress mRNA targets with the greatest influence on network potential. Our analysis identified TRIM25, APP, ELAV1, RNF4, and HNRNPL as ideal mRNA targets for Ewing sarcoma therapy. Using predicted miRNA-mRNA target mappings, we identified miR-3613-3p, let-7a-3p, miR-300, miR-424-5p, and let-7b-3p as candidate optimal miRNAs for preferential repression of these targets. Ultimately, our work, as exemplified in the case of Ewing sarcoma, describes a novel pipeline by which personalized miRNA cocktails can be designed to maximally perturb gene networks contributing to cancer progression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detection of CYP2C19*2_ allele among Helicobacter pylori -infected patients in two tertiary hospitals of Khartoum, Sudan, 2019 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: CYP2C19*2 has been identified as the most common allelic variant of CYP2C19 affecting the response to Proton pump inhibitors (PPI). This study aims to detect CYP2C19*2 allele in H. pylori-infected Sudanese population, owing its probable effect on H. pylori eradication. Methods: Antral biopsies was collected from 30 patients attending endoscopy units. Extraction of DNA was performed through QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit. Samples were screened for Urease C (UreC) gene of H. pylori using conventional PCR. Detection of CYP2C19*2 was performed in positive H. pylori samples using Real time-PCR. Results: The mean age of patients was 40.7 (±20.2 SE). Positive samples for UreC were 24 (80%) samples. Among them, four samples (16.6%) were found positive for CYP2C19*2 allele presence. Gender was found to be statistically associated with the presence of the allele (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study illustrates that CYP2C19*2 is of modest prevalence among H. pylori-infected Sudanese population. The determination of genotypic and allelic frequencies of CYP2C19 gene among different populations will provide data to be used to personalize treatment according to individual genetic profile, and minimize the possible adverse side effects of CYP2C19 substrates.

                Background: Prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their behavioral risk factors (tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol) among children and adolescents have garnered paramount importance under the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods: Project PaThWay is a school-based, two years, multi-component intervention to prevent key behavioral NCD risk factors among school-going children (classes 6-8th; 10-14 years) from private and public schools across two Indian cities (Pune and Bengaluru). We assessed the baseline knowledge, attitude, and behavior related to NCD risk factors (unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco use) of the participating students through a survey. The intervention was developed and designed for implementation by the trained teachers and similar-age peers, as facilitators. The teachers and peer leaders were trained through organising school-level orientation workshops for implementation of intervention activities, after baseline assessment. Year 1 of the intervention focuses on the knowledge and learnings and year 2 on enhancing the life-skills (leadership, communication, refusal, health advocacy, etc.). Regular monitoring visits by the project team to ensure intervention activities are being carried out as planned and providing continuous support. The end line evaluation will be done after the completion of two years’ intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of the Project PaThWay intervention. Outcome measures will include improved knowledge, positive attitude, improve behaviors related to diet, physical activity, and tobacco use, and enhanced skills in handling NCD risk factors. A process evaluation will explore several aspects of Project PaTHWay intervention (fidelity, dosage, reach, adaptations), social validity (acceptability, feasibility, utility). Conclusion: Project PaTHWay, having a multiple-component intervention, may offer the best chance for success, as it addresses multiple risk factors using multi-pronged strategies. The agents of intervention implementation are trained teachers and similar-age student peer leaders (as facilitators), one of the successful and effective approaches in school-based interventions globally and in India.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of ingestion of red dragon fruit extract on levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase after strenuous exercise in rats (Rattus norvegicus) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prolonged activation of skeletal muscles causes a decrease in the production of fatigue. Exercise with strenuous intensity causes an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). An increase in free radicals causes oxidative stress resulting in damage to cell function to mitochondrial dysfunction, and fatigue. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant potential of red dragon fruit (RDF) to delay fatigue due to oxidative stress, which improves cell function in mitochondria. Methods: 25 male rats (Rattus norvegicus) aged three months were divided into five groups: Group K1 was N.A. (No Activity) but drinking and eating; Group K2 performed strenuous exercise without RDF treatment; Groups 3, 4, and 5 (P1, P2 and P3, respectively) performed strenuous exercise and were treated with 75 mg kg-1.bw, 150 mg kg-1.bw, and 300 mg kg-1.bw of RDF extract, respectively. The exercise for the rats involved intense swimming for 20 minutes every day, four days a week for 31 days.  Malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured with the ELISA and histopathology for muscle soleus and lung tissue. Results: Strenuous exercise followed by RDF extract ingestion was compared for fatigue in terms of duration and time; before (24.55±1.38 minute) and after (95.31±7.82 minute) and led to a significant difference of 39% (p<0.01). The study also compared MDA before and after RDF extract ingestion in the K2 vs. the P1 group (p<0.05). At the same time, P2 differed more significantly (p<0.01). This indicated a spread of free radicals and featured histopathological damage of muscle cells. However, ingestion of RDF extract leads to improvement of soleus muscle cells; thus, repairs cell function, delaying fatigue. Conclusion: This study confirmed that strenuous exercise, which causes an increase in ROS, intensifies free radicals with RDF extract ingestion and declines oxidative stress, repairing cell function and delaying fatigue.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">NMDA receptor modulation and severe acute respiratory syndrome treatment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors is expressed in the human lungs and central nervous system.  NMDA receptor potentiation could increase calcium ion influx and promote downstream signaling mechanisms associated with cellular contractions that are disrupted in severe acute respiratory syndrome. Pharmacological effects generated by triggering glutamate receptor function in the brain, coupled with concurrent stimulation of the respiratory tract, may produce a synergetic effect, improving the airway smooth muscle function. A novel multipronged intervention to simultaneously potentiate NMDA receptors expressed both in the central nervous system and airway muscles would be helpful for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome that deteriorates peripheral and central nervous system function before causing death in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Distribution of imposter syndrome among medical students of Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Imposter syndrome (IS), suffering from self-doubt and fear, despite clear accomplishment and competencies, is often detected in medical students and adversely affects the well-being of the student. This study aimed at assessing the prevalence of IS among public and private medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional design among medical students in Bangladesh. Data were collected between February to July 2020 through snowball sampling technique across medical colleges in Bangladesh. Relative risk ratios (RRRs) with 95% CI were calculated to investigate the magnitude of association between imposter syndrome exposure and explanatory variables. Results: A total of 500 students participated in this study with approximately 47% and 53% of students studying at public and private medical colleges, respectively. Around 32% of medical students were exposed to IS (47% of public and 53% of private medical college students). Medical students were the most significantly associated with IS for third (RR: 1.487, CI: 1.068-2.071) and fourth-year students (RR: 1.493, CI: 1.043-2.136). Overall, we found that respondents aged 22 to 25 were 3.6% (RR:1.036, CI:0.801-1.339) more likely to be suffering from IS than their younger counterparts. Conclusion: Third and fourth-year medical students, in particular, require more care than others; teachers and authorities should provide them with proper guidance and care, encourage them, and thus grow their self-reliance and confidence.

                Orofacial pain represents a challenge for dentists, especially if with a non-odontogenic basis. Orofacial neuropathic pain is chronic, arduous to localize and develops without obvious pathology. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, coexist and negatively affect the condition. This article presents one case of atypical odontalgia and one of trigeminal neuralgia treated with psychological and psychopharmacologic tailored and adapted therapies, after conventional medications had failed.  In addition, an overview of the pathologies related to the challenging differential diagnosis in orofacial pain is given, since current data are insufficient.   A 68-year-old male complained of chronic throbbing, burning pain in a maxillary tooth, worsening upon digital pressure. Symptoms did not abate after conventional amitriptyline therapy; psychological intervention and antianxiety drug were supplemented and antidepressant agent dosage incremented; the patient revealed improvement and satisfaction with the multidisciplinary approach to his pathology. A 72-year-old male lamented chronic stabbing, intermittent, sharp, shooting and electric shock-like pain in an upper tooth, radiating and following the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Pain did not recur after psychological intervention and a prescription of antidepressant and antianxiety agents, while conventional carbamazepine therapy had not been sufficient to control pain. Due to concern with comorbid psychiatric disorders, we adopted a patient-centered, tailored and balanced therapy, favourably changing the clinical outcome.  Comorbid psychiatric disorders have a negative impact on orofacial pain and dentists should consider adopting tailored therapies, such as psychological counselling and behavioural and psychopharmacologic strategies, besides conventional treatments. They also need to be familiar with the signs and symptoms of orofacial pain, recollecting a comprehensive view of the pathologies concerning the differential diagnosis. A prompt diagnosis prevents pain chronicity, avoiding an increase in complexity and a shift to orofacial neuropathic pain and legal claims.

                Objective: To investigate the relationship between congenital umbilical–portal–systemic venous shunt (UPSVs) and fetal outcome. Methods: The ultrasonographic and genetic characteristics of 11 cases of UPSVS were retrospectively analyzed and followed up to postnatal. Results: Four cases of ductus venosus -- systemic shunt (DVSS), one case of extrahepatic portal -- systemic shunt (EHPSS), and one case of umbilical systemic shunt (USS) combined with intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (IHPSS), six cases of intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (IHPSS) were observed. chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 9.1% (1/11), other ultrasonic abnormalities in 54.5% (6/11), cardiothoracic ratio increase in 45.5% (5/11), fetal growth restriction in 36.4% (4/11), edema was in 9.1% (1/11) and live birth was in 72.7% (8/11). Conclusion: The incidence of IHPSS is the highest and the outcome is the best. Shunt of DVSS and IHPSS can be closed spontaneously after birth. When the prenatal diagnosis is congenital UPSVs, chromosomal abnormalities and other ultrasonic abnormalities should be required further examination, and the growth and development of the fetus should be closely monitored.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pancreatic cancer grading in pathological images using deep learning convolutional neural networks [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The cancer grades define how aggressively the cancer will spread and give indication for doctors to make proper prognosis and treatment. The current method of pancreatic cancer grading, by means of manual examination of the cancerous tissue following a biopsy, is time consuming and often results in misdiagnosis and thus incorrect treatment. This paper presents an automated grading system for pancreatic cancer from pathology images developed by comparing deep learning models on two different pathological stains. Methods: A transfer-learning technique was adopted by testing the method on 14 different ImageNet pre-trained models. The models were fine-tuned to be trained with our dataset. Results: From the experiment, DenseNet models appeared to be the best at classifying the validation set with up to 95.61% accuracy in grading pancreatic cancer despite the small sample set. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in grading pancreatic cancer based on pathology images. Previous works have either focused only on detection (benign or malignant), or on radiology images (computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] etc.). The proposed system can be very useful to pathologists in facilitating an automated or semi-automated cancer grading system, which can address the problems found in manual grading.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Synchronous online learning during movement control order in higher education institutions: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Higher education institutions (HEI) are not spared from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The closure of campuses because of the movement control order (MCO) to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 has forced HEIs to adopt online learning, especially synchronous online learning (SOL). Although teaching and learning can be continued via SOL, retaining students’ interest and sustaining their engagement have not been sufficiently explored. This study presents a systematic review of the research pertaining to SOL associated with students’ interest and engagement in HEIs during the MCO environment. Methods: Five major online databases, i.e., EBSCOhost, Science Direct, Emerald, Scopus and Springer were searched to collect relevant papers published between 1st January 2010 to 15th June 2021 including conference proceedings, peer-reviewed papers and dissertations. Papers written in the English language, based in full-fledged universities, and with these five keywords: (i) synchronous online learning, (ii) engagement, (iii) interest, (iv) MCO/Covid-19 and (v) HEI, were included. Papers focussing on synchronous and asynchronous online learning in schools and colleges were excluded. Each paper was reviewed by two reviewers in order to confirm the eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: We found 31 papers of which six papers were related to SOL, engagement and interest in HEIs in the MCO environment. Our review presents three major findings: (i) limited research has been conducted on SOL associated with students’ engagement and interest, (ii) studies related to the context of HEIs in the MCO environment are limited, and (iii) the understanding of the new phenomena through qualitative research is insufficient. We highlight the SOL alignment with students’ engagement, interest, style preference, learner interaction effectiveness, behavior and academic performance. Conclusions: We believe that the findings of this study are timely and require attention from the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Digital taxation to promote frugal innovation in institutions of higher learning: a three-decade systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), digital taxation emerged as a tool for accelerating the economic growth of a nation. While Industry 4.0 focuses on enabling real-time decision-making with sophisticated technology to enhance productivity, digital taxation can serve as an important tool for improving business sustainability. Institutions of higher learning (IHL), which aim to design an IR 4.0 educational ecosystem, can embrace digital taxation, as they face various challenges with different resources. The literature indicates that frugal innovation through digital taxation in institutions of higher learning, can solve emerging resource challenges. Method: We present a systematic review of studies on digital taxation to promote frugal innovation published in the past three decades (1991 to 2021). We obtained a total of 21 papers from a ‘digital taxation’ keyword search, 10 of which were related to digital taxation. However, the 10 papers were not related to frugal innovation. Result: We present two major findings. Firstly, research on digital taxation for frugal innovation is scant. Secondly, challenges exist in digital taxation implementation, which requires further attention. Conclusion: We conclude this review with a recommendation for the conceptual framework, to highlight potential research warranting the attention of the research community.

                The 22nd annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2021, open-bio.org/events/bosc-2021/) was held online as a track of the 2021 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology / European Conference on Computational Biology (ISMB/ECCB) conference. Launched in 2000 and held every year since, BOSC is the premier meeting covering topics related to open source software and open science in bioinformatics. In 2020, BOSC partnered with the Galaxy Community Conference to form the Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020); that was the first BOSC to be held online. This year, BOSC returned to its roots as part of ISMB/ECCB 2021. As in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic made it impossible to hold the conference in person, so ISMB/ECCB 2021 took place as an online meeting attended by over 2000 people from 79 countries. Nearly 200 people participated in BOSC sessions, which included 27 talks reviewed and selected from submitted abstracts, and three invited keynote talks representing a range of global perspectives on the role of open science and open source in driving research and inclusivity in the biosciences, one of which was presented in French with English subtitles.

                Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a global pandemic since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, which mutates at a higher rate. Multiple studies had been done to identify and study nonsynonymous mutations, which change amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. On the other hand, there is little study on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 synonymous mutations. Although these mutations do not alter amino acids, some studies suggest that they may affect viral fitness. This study aims to predict the effect of synonymous mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.   Methods: A total of 30,229 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were retrieved from Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID) database and aligned using MAFFT. Then, the mutations and their respective frequency were identified. A prediction of RNA secondary structures and their base pair probabilities was performed to study the effect of synonymous mutations on RNA structure and stability. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis was also performed to measure the codon usage bias (CUB) of SARS-CoV-2.  Results: A total of 150 synonymous mutations were identified. The synonymous mutation identified with the highest frequency is C3037U mutation in the nsp3 of ORF1a, followed by C313U and C9286U mutation in nsp1 and nsp4 of ORF1a, respectively.   Conclusion: Among the synonymous mutations identified, C913U mutation in ORF1a and C26735U in membrane (M) protein may affect RNA secondary structure, reducing the stability of RNA folding and possibly resulting in a higher translation rate. However, lab experiments are required to validate the results obtained from prediction analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pneumococcal carriage and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in mother-baby pairs in a rural community in Eastern Uganda: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pneumococcal carriage predisposes children to pneumonia. Pneumonia poses a significant threat to the lives of children below five years old worldwide, contributing to a high number of hospitalizations and death. Morbidity and morbidity are especially common in children under five and the elderly, although any age group can be affected. This study aimed to estimate pneumococcal carriage and determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the pneumococci isolated from mother-baby pairs in Ngora district after the rollout of the pneumococcal vaccine. We hypothesized that high carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in mothers leads to carriage in their babies and hence a greater chance of contracting pneumonia. Methods: Consecutive sampling was used to select 152 mother-baby pairs from community visits and those seeking care at the health facility. We collected nasal swabs from both baby and mother for culture and sensitivity testing using Kirby-Bauer’s agar disc diffusion method. Results: This study found that there was a low prevalence of pneumococcal carriage in the mother-baby pair in the Ngora district. We also observed high rates of microbial resistance to penicillin, which is the first-line drug for the management of pneumonia in Uganda. Conclusions: The relationship between pneumococcal carriage and immunization status suggests that the pneumococcal vaccine is protective against the pneumococcal carriage. Resistance of S. pneumoniae to commonly used antibiotics was high.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The distribution patterns of a set of conserved brain developmental regulatory transcription factors were analyzed in the forebrain of the basal actinopterygian fish <i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>, consistent with the prosomeric model. In the telencephalon, the pallium was characterized by ventricular expression of <i>Pax6</i>. In the subpallium, the combined expression of <i>Nkx2.1</i>/Islet-1 (<i>Isl1</i>) allowed to propose ventral and dorsal areas, as the septo-pallidal (<i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i>+) and striatal derivatives (<i>Isl1</i>+), respectively, and a dorsal portion of the striatal derivatives, ventricularly rich in <i>Pax6</i> and devoid of <i>Isl1</i> expression. Dispersed Orthopedia (<i>Otp</i>) cells were found in the supracommissural and posterior nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, related to the medial portion of the amygdaloid complex. The preoptic area was identified by the <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i> expression. In the alar hypothalamus, an <i>Otp</i>-expressing territory, lacking <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i>, was identified as the paraventricular domain. The adjacent subparaventricular domain (Spa) was subdivided in a rostral territory expressing <i>Nkx2.1</i> and an <i>Isl1</i>+ caudal one. In the basal hypothalamus, the tuberal region was defined by the <i>Nkx2.1</i>/<i>Isl1</i> expression and a rostral <i>Otp</i>-expressing domain was identified. Moreover, the <i>Otp</i>/<i>Nkx2.1</i> combination showed an additional zone lacking <i>Isl1</i>, tentatively identified as the mamillary area. In the diencephalon, both <i>Pax6</i> and <i>Isl1</i> defined the prethalamic domain, and within the basal prosomere 3, scattered <i>Pax6</i>- and <i>Isl1</i>-expressing cells were observed in the posterior tubercle. Finally, a small group of <i>Pax6</i> cells was observed in the pretectal area. These results improve the understanding of the forebrain evolution and demonstrate that its basic <i>bauplan</i> is present very early in the vertebrate lineage.</p>

In a recent study, Pascoal et al. provide evidence that microgliosis colocalizes with tau in a Braak-like pattern, furthering the notion that microglial activation is strongly related to the propagation of tangle pathology.

                Chelaru et al. demonstrate that while pairwise interactions between visual cortical neurons capture the spiking patterns across multiple brain states, explaining the population dynamics in executive areas involves higher-order interactions. These results help elucidate the extent to which the multi-neuronal firing patterns in cortical populations can be predicted by interneuronal interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early prediction of in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients: a machine-learning model based on age, blood analyses, and chest x-ray score</a></h4>

              
                An early-warning model to predict in-hospital mortality on admission of COVID-19 patients at an emergency department (ED) was developed and validate using a Machine-Learning model. In total, 2782 patients were enrolled between March 2020 and December 2020, including 2106 patients (first wave) and 676 patients (second wave) in the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The first-wave patients were divided into two groups with 1474 patients used to train the model, and 632 to validate it. The 676 patients in the second wave were used to test the model. Age, 17 blood analytes and Brescia chest X-ray score were the variables processed using a Random Forests classification algorithm to build and validate the model. ROC analysis was used to assess the model performances. A web-based death-risk calculator was implemented and integrated within the Laboratory Information System of the hospital. The final score was constructed by age (the most powerful predictor), blood analytes (the strongest predictors were lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, Lymphocyte %, Ferritin std and Monocyte %), and Brescia chest X-ray score. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve obtained for the three groups (training, validating and testing) were 0.98, 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. The model predicts in-hospital mortality on the basis of data that can be obtained in a short time, directly at the ED on admission. It functions as a web-based calculator, providing a risk score which is easy to interpret. It can be used in the triage process to support the decision on patient allocation.

                Elucidating how synaptic molecules such as AMPA receptors mediate neuronal communication and tracking their dynamic expression during behavior is crucial to understand cognition and disease, but current technological barriers preclude large-scale exploration of molecular dynamics in vivo. We have developed a suite of innovative methodologies that break through these barriers: a new knockin mouse line with fluorescently tagged endogenous AMPA receptors, two-photon imaging of hundreds of thousands of labeled synapses in behaving mice, and computer-vision-based automatic synapse detection. Using these tools, we can longitudinally track how the strength of populations of synapses changes during behavior. We used this approach to generate an unprecedentedly detailed spatiotemporal map of synapses undergoing changes in strength following sensory experience. More generally, these tools can be used as an optical probe capable of measuring functional synapse strength across entire brain areas during any behavioral paradigm, describing complex system-wide changes with molecular precision.

                The sharing of research data is essential to ensure reproducibility and maximize the impact of public investments in scientific research.  Here we describe OpenNeuro, a BRAIN Initiative data archive that provides the ability to openly share data from a broad range of brain imaging data types following the FAIR principles for data sharing. We highlight the importance of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard for enabling effective curation, sharing, and reuse of data. The archive presently shares more than 600 datasets including data from more than 20,000 participants, comprising multiple species and measurement modalities and a broad range of phenotypes. The impact of the shared data is evident in a growing number of published reuses, currently totalling more than 150 publications.  We conclude by describing plans for future development and integration with other ongoing open science efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal sequences during theta rely on behavior-dependent spatial maps</a></h4>

              
                Navigation through space involves learning and representing relationships between past, current and future locations. In mammals, this might rely on the hippocampal theta phase code, where in each cycle of the theta oscillation, spatial representations provided by neuronal sequences start behind the animal's true location and then sweep forward. However, the exact relationship between theta phase, represented position and true location remains unclear and even paradoxical. Here, we formalize previous notions of 'spatial' or 'temporal' theta sweeps that have appeared in the literature. We analyze single-cell and population variables in unit recordings from rat CA1 place cells and compare them to model simulations based on each of these schemes. We show that neither spatial nor temporal sweeps quantitatively accounts for how all relevant variables change with running speed. To reconcile these schemes with our observations, we introduce 'behavior-dependent' sweeps, in which theta sweep length and place field properties, such as size and phase precession, vary across the environment depending on the running speed characteristic of each location. These behavior-dependent spatial maps provide a structured heterogeneity that is essential for understanding the hippocampal code.
