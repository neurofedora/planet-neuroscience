                arXiv:2509.21332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review highlights brain health as a dynamic process shaped by both genetic and environmental influences throughout development. Critical periods provide unique windows of heightened neural plasticity, during which genetic-environmental interactions and parental influences profoundly impact brain maturation. Frameworks such as DOHaD, ACEs, and neurosocial plasticity elucidate how early-life experiences modulate long-term cognitive and emotional outcomes. Brain health science is emerging as a field integrating neuroscience, public health, and social context. Resilience-oriented approaches and predictive processing, offer renewed perspectives on adaptive brain function. Clinically, understanding critical periods and plasticity spanning from fetal life to old age, has implications for early detection, targeted interventions, and resilience-oriented strategies, emphasizing the potential for lifelong optimization of mental health.

                arXiv:2509.22209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reinforcement learning algorithms have made significant progress in solving multi-armed bandit problems, they often lack biological plausibility in architecture and dynamics. Here, we propose a bio-inspired neural model based on interacting populations of rate neurons, drawing inspiration from the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Our model reports robust performance across various stochastic bandit problems, matching the effectiveness of standard algorithms such as Thompson Sampling and UCB. Notably, the model exhibits adaptive behavior: employing greedy strategies in low-uncertainty situations while increasing exploratory behavior as uncertainty rises. Through evolutionary optimization, the model's hyperparameters converged to values that align with known synaptic mechanisms, particularly in terms of synapse-dependent neural activity and learning rate adaptation. These findings suggest that biologically-inspired computational architectures can achieve competitive performance while providing insights into neural mechanisms of decision-making under uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21671">Neuroprobe: Evaluating Intracranial Brain Responses to Naturalistic Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.21671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe: a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions. First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models, Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at https://neuroprobe.dev/

                arXiv:2409.06843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does the human brain encode complex visual information? While previous research has characterized individual dimensions of visual representation in cortex, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how visual information is organized across the full range of neural population activity. Here, analyzing fMRI responses to natural scenes across multiple individuals, we discover that neural representations in human visual cortex follow a remarkably consistent scale-free organization -- their variance systematically decays as a power law, detected across four orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. This scale-free structure appears consistently across multiple visual regions and across individuals, suggesting it reflects a fundamental organizing principle of visual processing. Critically, when we align neural responses across individuals using hyperalignment, we find that these representational dimensions are largely shared between people, revealing a universal high-dimensional spectrum of visual information that emerges despite individual differences in brain anatomy and visual experience. Traditional analysis approaches in cognitive neuroscience have focused primarily on a small number of high-variance dimensions, potentially missing crucial aspects of visual representation. Our results demonstrate that visual information is distributed across the full dimensionality of cortical activity in a systematic way, suggesting we need to move beyond low-dimensional characterizations to fully understand how the brain represents the visual world. This work reveals a new fundamental principle of neural coding in human visual cortex and highlights the importance of examining neural representations across their full dimensionality.

                arXiv:2507.17897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11312">Repetitive TMS-based Identification of Methamphetamine-Dependent Individuals Using EEG Spectra</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.11312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.

                arXiv:2409.16322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Different from conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Therefore, simplistic binary AD classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class heterogeneity and instance-level imbalance. In this work, we found using a sample score estimator can generate sample-specific soft scores aligning with cognitive scores. We subsequently propose two simple yet effective methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Based on the ADReSS and CU-MARVEL corpora, we demonstrated and analyzed the advantages of the proposed approaches in detection performance. These findings provide insights for developing robust and reliable AD detection models.

                arXiv:2410.17199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability of a broad class of recurrent neural networks widely used in theoretical neuroscience, including models of large-scale human brain dynamics. Motivated by emerging applications in non-invasive neurostimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we study the control synthesis of these networks using constant and piecewise constant inputs. The neural model considered is a continuous-time Hopfield-type system with nonlinear activation functions and arbitrary input matrices representing inter-regional brain interactions. Our main contribution is the formulation and solution of a control synthesis problem for such nonlinear systems using specific solution representations. These representations yield explicit algebraic conditions for synthesizing constant and piecewise constant controls that solve a two-point boundary value problem in state space up to higher-order corrections with respect to the time horizon. In particular, the input is constructed to satisfy a tractable small-time algebraic relation involving the Jacobian of the nonlinear drift, ensuring that the synthesis reduces to verifying conditions on the system matrices. For canonical input matrices that directly actuate $k$ nodes, this implies that the reachable set (with constant inputs) of a given initial state is an affine subspace whose dimension equals the input rank and whose basis can be computed efficiently using a thin QR factorization. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis in guiding the design of brain stimulation protocols for therapeutic and cognitive applications.

                arXiv:2509.20916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability; current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21504">Discovering alternative solutions beyond the simplicity bias in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform neuroscience-style tasks has become a popular way to generate hypotheses for how neural circuits in the brain might perform computations. Recent work has demonstrated that task-trained RNNs possess a strong simplicity bias. In particular, this inductive bias often causes RNNs trained on the same task to collapse on effectively the same solution, typically comprised of fixed-point attractors or other low-dimensional dynamical motifs. While such solutions are readily interpretable, this collapse proves counterproductive for the sake of generating a set of genuinely unique hypotheses for how neural computations might be performed. Here we propose Iterative Neural Similarity Deflation (INSD), a simple method to break this inductive bias. By penalizing linear predictivity of neural activity produced by standard task-trained RNNs, we find an alternative class of solutions to classic neuroscience-style RNN tasks. These solutions appear distinct across a battery of analysis techniques, including representational similarity metrics, dynamical systems analysis, and the linear decodability of task-relevant variables. Moreover, these alternative solutions can sometimes achieve superior performance in difficult or out-of-distribution task regimes. Our findings underscore the importance of moving beyond the simplicity bias to uncover richer and more varied models of neural computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21340">Cycle is All You Need: More Is Different</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.21340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an information-topological framework in which cycle closure is the fundamental mechanism of memory and consciousness. Memory is not a static store but the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant cycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and preserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures this: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode low-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically, polychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking reinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary cancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation loops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces high-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations, generalizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this process: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves decompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions with bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of high-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness) across contexts. We conclude that cycle is all you need: persistent invariants enable generalization in non-ergodic environments with long-term coherence at minimal energetic cost.

                arXiv:2509.21341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symbolic surrogate modeling of frozen Transformer embeddings to obtain compact, auditable classifiers with calibrated probabilities. For five benchmarks (SST2G, 20NG, MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17), embeddings from ModernBERT, DINOv2, and SigLIP are partitioned on the training set into disjoint, information-preserving views via semantic-preserving feature partitioning (SPFP). A cooperative multi-population genetic program (MEGP) then learns additive, closed-form logit programs over these views. Across 30 runs per dataset we report F1, AUC, log-loss, Brier, expected calibration error (ECE), and symbolic complexity; a canonical model is chosen by a one-standard-error rule on validation F1 with a parsimony tie-break. Temperature scaling fitted on validation yields substantial ECE reductions on test. The resulting surrogates achieve strong discrimination (up to F1 around 0.99 on MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17; around 0.95 on SST2G), while 20NG remains most challenging. We provide reliability diagrams, dimension usage and overlap statistics, contribution-based importances, and global effect profiles (PDP and ALE), demonstrating faithful, cross-modal explanations grounded in explicit programs.

                arXiv:2509.21342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are exemplary deep models designed for graph data. Message passing mechanism enables GNNs to effectively capture graph topology and push the performance boundaries across various graph tasks. However, the trend of developing such complex machinery for graph representation learning has become unsustainable on large-scale graphs. The computational and time overhead make it imperative to develop more energy-efficient GNNs to cope with the explosive growth of real-world graphs. Spiking Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which integrate biologically plausible learning via unique spike-based neurons, have emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative. Different layers communicate with sparse and binary spikes, which facilitates computation and storage of intermediate graph representations. Despite the proliferation of SGNNs proposed in recent years, there is no systematic benchmark to explore the basic design principles of these brain-inspired networks on the graph data. To bridge this gap, we present SGNNBench to quantify progress in the field of SGNNs. Specifically, SGNNBench conducts an in-depth investigation of SGNNs from multiple perspectives, including effectiveness, energy efficiency, and architectural design. We comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art SGNNs across 18 datasets. Regarding efficiency, we empirically compare these baselines w.r.t model size, memory usage, and theoretical energy consumption to reveal the often-overlooked energy bottlenecks of SGNNs. Besides, we elaborately investigate the design space of SGNNs to promote the development of a general SGNN paradigm.

Abstract: This paper presents a neuromorphic system for cognitive load classification in a real-world setting, an Air Traffic Control (ATC) task, using a hardware implementation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking features, extracted from an open-source dataset, were used to train and evaluate both conventional machine learning models and SNNs. Among the SNN architectures explored, a minimalistic, single-layer model trained with a biologically inspired delta-rule learning algorithm achieved competitive performance (80.6%). To enable deployment on neuromorphic hardware, the model was quantized and implemented on the mixed-signal DYNAP-SE chip. Despite hardware constraints and analog variability, the chip-deployed SNN maintained a classification accuracy of up to 73.5% using spike-based input. These results demonstrate the feasibility of event-driven neuromorphic systems for ultra-low-power, embedded cognitive state monitoring in dynamic real-world scenarios.

                arXiv:2509.21346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately assessing mental workload is crucial in cognitive neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and real-time monitoring, as cognitive load fluctuations affect performance and decision-making. While Electroencephalography (EEG) based machine learning (ML) models can be used to this end, their high computational cost hinders embedded real-time applications. Hardware implementations of spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative for low-power, fast, event-driven processing. This study compares hardware compatible SNN models with various traditional ML ones, using an open-source multimodal dataset. Our results show that multimodal integration improves accuracy, with SNN performance comparable to the ML one, demonstrating their potential for real-time implementations of cognitive load detection. These findings position event-based processing as a promising solution for low-latency, energy efficient workload monitoring in adaptive closed-loop embedded devices that dynamically regulate cognitive load.

                arXiv:2509.21355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming (DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems governed by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space into domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic programming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early evolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population cooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical symbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all populations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to identify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic constructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided pruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic programming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation, and 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and test root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed statistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error distributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in validation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that domain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve convergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable modeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the underlying physical structure.

                arXiv:2509.21369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) has made it even more important to manage the charging infrastructure sustainably. The expansion of charging station networks, especially in large cities, creates serious logistical challenges for charging point operators (CPOs) in planning maintenance and repair activities. Inefficient field personnel management can lead to time loss, high operational costs, and resource waste. This study presents an integrated method to optimize the planning of EV charging network maintenance operations. The proposed approach groups charging stations according to geographical proximity using the K-means clustering algorithm and calculates the shortest routes between clusters using a genetic algorithm. The method was developed in Python and applied to a dataset consisting of 100 EV charging stations in Istanbul.
  Considering the population density, traffic density, and resource constraints of Istanbul, the route planning approach presented in this study has great potential, especially for such metropolises. According to the different parameter configurations tested, the most efficient scenario provided approximately 35\% distance savings compared to the reference route created according to the sequential data layout. While the reference route provides a simple comparison, the study presents a solution that will enable field operations in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul to be conducted in a more efficient, planned and scalable manner. In future studies, it is planned to integrate real-time factors such as traffic conditions and field technician constraints.

                arXiv:2509.21617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets, Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

                arXiv:2501.14539v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-to-learn (L2L), defined as progressively faster learning across similar tasks, is fundamental to both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, its neural basis remains elusive, as most studies emphasize neural population dynamics induced by synaptic plasticity while overlooking adaptations driven by intrinsic neuronal plasticity, which point-neuron models cannot capture. To address the above issue, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network with bi-level intrinsic plasticity (IP$^{2}$-RSNN). First, based on task demands, a slow meta-intrinsic plasticity determines which intrinsic neuronal properties are learnable, which is preserved throughout subsequent task learning once configured. Second, a fast intrinsic plasticity fine-tunes those learnable properties within each task. Our results indicate that the proposed bi-level intrinsic plasticity plays a critical role in enabling L2L in RSNNs and show that IP$^{2}$-RSNNs outperform point-neuron recurrent neural networks and self-attention models. Furthermore, our analysis of multi-scale neural dynamics reveals that the bi-level intrinsic plasticity is essential to task-type-specific adaptations at both the neuronal and network levels during L2L, while such adaptations cannot be captured by point-neuron models. Our results suggest that intrinsic plasticity provides significant computational advantages in L2L, shedding light on the design of brain-inspired deep learning models and algorithms.

                arXiv:2507.14270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15371">Event2Vec: Processing Neuromorphic Events directly by Representations in Vector Space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic event cameras possess superior temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, their asynchronous and sparse data format poses a significant challenge for conventional deep learning methods. Existing solutions to this incompatibility often sacrifice temporal resolution, require extensive pre-processing, and do not fully leverage GPU acceleration. Inspired by word-to-vector models, we draw an analogy between words and events to introduce event2vec, a novel representation that allows neural networks to process events directly. This approach is fully compatible with the parallel processing and self-supervised learning capabilities of Transformer architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of event2vec on the DVS Gesture, ASL-DVS, and DVS-Lip benchmarks. A comprehensive ablation study further analyzes our method's features and contrasts them with existing representations. The experimental results show that event2vec is remarkably parameter-efficient, has high throughput, and can achieve high accuracy even with an extremely low number of events. Beyond its performance, the most significant contribution of event2vec is a new paradigm that enables neural networks to process event streams as if they were natural language. This paradigm shift paves the way for the native integration of event cameras with large language models and multimodal models. Code, model, and training logs are provided in https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Panda/event2vec.

                arXiv:2505.02861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are foundational in simulating complex real-world scenarios involving autonomous, interacting entities. However, traditional MAS architectures often suffer from rigid coordination mechanisms and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. We propose MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework for optimal agent selection in multi-domain task environments. Our system implements a supervised learning approach that models task context, agent histories, and expected response quality to select the most appropriate agent for each task. A novel fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses along completeness, relevance, and confidence dimensions, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike previous methods that hard-code agent-task mappings, MetaOrch dynamically predicts the most suitable agent while estimating selection confidence. Experiments in simulated environments with heterogeneous agents demonstrate that our approach achieves 86.3% selection accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies including random selection and round-robin scheduling. The modular architecture emphasizes extensibility, allowing agents to be registered, updated, and queried independently. Results suggest that neural orchestration offers a powerful approach to enhancing the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of multi-agent systems across diverse task domains.

                arXiv:2506.00533v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GCN-based traveling salesman problem (TSP) solvers face two critical challenges: poor cross-scale generalization for TSPs and high training costs. To address these challenges, we propose a Subgraph-Based Rescaling Graph Convolutional Network (RsGCN). Focusing on the scale-dependent features (i.e., features varied with problem scales) related to nodes and edges, we design the subgraph-based rescaling to normalize edge lengths of subgraphs. Under a unified subgraph perspective, RsGCN can efficiently learn scale-generalizable representations from small-scale TSPs at low cost. To exploit and assess the heatmaps generated by RsGCN, we design a Reconstruction-Based Search (RBS), in which a reconstruction process based on adaptive weight is incorporated to help avoid local optima. Based on a combined architecture of RsGCN and RBS, our solver achieves remarkable generalization and low training cost: with only 3 epochs of training on a mixed-scale dataset containing instances with up to 100 nodes, it can be generalized successfully to 10K-node instances without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our advanced performance across uniform-distribution instances of 9 different scales from 20 to 10K nodes and 78 real-world instances from TSPLIB, while requiring the fewest learnable parameters and training epochs among neural competitors.

                arXiv:2508.04167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lenia is a continuous extension of Conway's Game of Life that exhibits rich pattern formations including self-propelling structures called gliders. In this paper, we focus on Asymptotic Lenia, a variant formulated as partial differential equations. By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we analytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the ``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss function, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider configurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find novel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also derive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed, expanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns result in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach effectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to discover through traditional methods. Finally, we establish connections between Asymptotic Lenia and neural field models, highlighting mathematical relationships that bridge these systems and suggesting new directions for analyzing pattern formation in continuous dynamical systems.

">Flexible Working Memory in the Peripheral Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) representations that are distributed across the brain can be flexibly recruited to best guide behavior. For instance, information may be represented relatively more strongly in visual cortex when a WM task requires fine visual detail, or more strongly in motor cortex when a specific response can be prepared. If WM is geared to prospectively guide actions, then we might also expect such task-oriented neural signals to propagate to the peripheral sensors and effectors that realize WM goals. Likewise, there is now evidence that oculomotor signals like saccade biases can track simple visuo-spatial WM features. However, it is unclear if such signatures are functionally meaningful, and how much information is contained in them. Here, we test the idea that WM content is adaptively distributed across the nervous system according to behavioral demands. Namely, we test whether visual WM stimulus features are expressed in patterns of both eye and hand movements during a WM delay, and whether the distribution of such peripheral motor activity shifts with the task context. In a delayed recall task, we manipulated how human participants reported their memory by having them either draw a line or adjust a wheel to match a remembered orientation. Via eye- and stylus-tracking, we found that remembered orientations were decodable from small inflections in both gaze and hand movements during the blank WM delay. Moreover, this decoding strength varied by response format: gaze patterns tracked memorized features relatively better in the wheel condition (vs. draw), while hand movements were better in the draw condition (vs. wheel). Individuals who showed greater wheel benefits in gaze-based decoding also showed greater draw benefits in hand-based decoding, suggesting a strategic processing shift to the more relevant system. Therefore, visually encoded WM contents may be adaptively allocated to the most task-relevant motor effectors, balancing WM representations across peripheral activity according to behavioral needs.

">Human dorsal root ganglia neuronal cell line to study nociceptive signaling: a new pipeline for pain therapy.</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptive afferent neurons within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) detect and relay painful stimuli from the periphery to the brain, and the malfunctioning of this process leads to sustained pain states. Animal model studies have been invaluable for demonstrating the importance of the DRG nociceptor in pain sensation and the development of related analgesic targets. However, there are functional biological differences between human and animal model nociceptors. Therefore, a complementary in vitro model of human nociception is critical to confirming the relevance of preclinical findings for therapeutic drug development. We characterized the nociceptive properties of differentiated cells from the human DRG-derived immortalized cell line HD10.6. Within differentiated HD10.6 cells, we documented the abundance and localization of nociceptive machinery central to regulating excitability and linked with pain sensation including ion channels TRPV1 and NaV1.7 and afferent peptides CGRP and Substance P. Using calcium influx imaging assays, we confirmed the electrical functionality of TRPV1 and NaV1.7 in HD10.6 cells, and through whole-cell patch clamp, we found similar baseline electrophysiological parameters of HD10.6 cells to those previously observed in human patient DRGs. Further, we found that differentiated HD10.6 cells express the mu opioid receptor 1 protein, and DAMGO, a mu agonist, blocks depolarization-evoked calcium influx in a naloxone-reversible fashion. Importantly, using an inflammatory cocktail, excitation and peripheral sensitization are induced within HD10.6 cells, mirroring nociceptors in a pain state during or after tissue damage or inflammation. Finally, HD10.6 cells were also cultured into dual-chambered microfluidic devices to mirror the biological anatomy of the nociceptor. Within this system, we demonstrated the uptake of adeno-associated-virus (AAV) by the peripheral terminals and AAV transport to the soma. Altogether, we have developed the use of HD10.6 cells to create a system of human nociceptive signaling on a chip to study human nociceptor physiology and intervention.

">Human patient-specific FOXG1 syndrome mouse model revealed FOXG1-MYCN-mediated regulation of protein homeostasis in neurodevelopmental disorder</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by disruptions in brain development, resulting in cognitive, behavioral, and neurological impairments. FOXG1 syndrome (FS), caused by heterozygous mutations in the FOXG1 gene, exemplifies a severe monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder. To investigate its pathogenesis, we generated a patient-specific W300X mouse model carrying a truncation variant of FOXG1. We found that the truncated FOXG1 protein in W300X-heterozygous (W300X-Het) mice is more abundant and more nuclear-localized than the full-length FOXG1 protein, implicating a pathogenic mechanism involving the truncated protein. Interestingly, W300X-Het mice exhibited profound abnormalities in the dentate gyrus, including disrupted neurogenesis, impaired granule cell migration, and altered dendritic morphology. Transcriptomic profiling identified broad dysregulation in protein homeostasis pathways, particularly ribosomal biogenesis, translation, and proteostasis. Disruption of the FOXG1-MYCN pathway, critical for robust protein synthesis during neural stem cell division, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, emerged as a key mechanism underlying these defects. In parallel, microglial activation and inflammation were markedly increased in the dentate gyrus, contributing to a pro-inflammatory environment that exacerbates neurogenic and structural deficits. Consistent with hippocampal dysfunction in FS patients, W300X-Het mice exhibited significant spatial learning and memory impairments. Together, our study highlights disrupted protein homeostasis and neuroinflammation as key drivers of FS pathogenesis, providing a framework for developing therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

">Parkinson's disease LRRK2 mutations dysregulate iron homeostasis and promote oxidative stress and ferroptosis in human neurons and astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Background: Iron accumulation is a hallmark of sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology and correlates with clinical motor symptom severity. The biochemical mechanisms driving iron dyshomeostasis in PD brain and whether these are early or late event in the neurodegenerative process remain unknown. Elevated nigral iron levels have been reported in LRRK2 mutation carriers, both in PD patients compared to idiopathic PD and in asymptomatic carriers relative to controls, suggesting that iron accumulation precedes clinical onset in LRRK2-associated PD. However, the precise consequence of pathogenic LRRK2 mutations on cellular iron handling within neurons and glial cells remains unclear. Methods: Here, we investigated different readouts of iron homeostasis in iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes from PD patients harboring G2019S or R1441C/G LRRK2 mutations or healthy controls, as well as an isogenic iPSC panel with the same variants. By using high-content and super-resolution microscopy of iron-specific probes, we assayed iron content and distribution in cells and examined the downstream effects of iron dyshomeostasis on ferroptosis signaling. Results: We show that heterozygous LRRK2 mutations dysregulate cellular iron across iPSCs, neurons and astrocytes, in a kinase-dependent manner. Lysosomal ferrous iron storage was consistently elevated across iPSCs, iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes carrying LRRK2 mutations. LRRK2 regulates Rab GTPase function through their direct phosphorylation, and our prior work revealed significant but divergent lysosomal phenotypes between Rab8a and Rab10 knockout models. Here, we report that Rab8a knockout recapitulates key aspects of LRRK2 mutation phenotypes on intracellular iron and ferritin levels, although with differences in magnitude and specificity. By contrast, Rab10 deficiency showed opposing effects, suggesting distinct roles for these well-established LRRK2 substrates in iron homeostasis. Finally, we show that basal lipid peroxidation and ROS levels are elevated in isogenic LRRK2 mutant neurons, while iron chelation was sufficient to reduce LRRK2-dependent ROS. Conclusions: Together, our findings demonstrate that LRRK2 mutations disrupt iron homeostasis across disease-relevant cell types and establish a discrete biochemical pathway linking LRRK2 signaling and vulnerability to ferroptosis. Ongoing work aims to further dissect the roles of Rab substrates in these pathways.

">Dendritic Interaction of Timescales in Afterdepolarization Potentials and Nonmonotonic Spike--adding</a></h4>

              
                Depolarizations that occur after action potentials, known as afterdepolarization potentials or ADPs, are important for neuronal excitability and stimulus evoked transient bursting. Slow inward and fast outward currents underlie the generation of such ADPs with modulation of ADP amplitudes occurring as a result of neuronal morphology. However, the relative contribution and role of these slow inward and fast outward currents in ADP generation is poorly understood in the context of somatic and dendritic localization as well as with varied dendritic properties. Using a two compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley type model, the role of somatic and dendritic compartmentalization of ADP associated currents is investigated, revealing that dendritic (rather than somatic) slow inward and fast outward currents are the main contributors to ADP and spike-adding during both brief step current and AMPA current input. Additionally, dendritic size and passive properties of the dendrites were found to be key modulators of ADP amplitude. However, increasing magnitudes of NMDA current conductance resulted in nonmonotonic spike-adding in a manner dependent on dendritic Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ activated K+ currents, which was found to be the result of tight regulation of stimulus evoked transient bursting through positive feedback on action potential generation by dendritic Ca2+ and subsequent negative feedback through Ca2+ activated K+ currents. This novel mechanism of ADP and spike-adding regulation highlights the role of currents with slow timescales in ADPs, stimulus evoked bursting and neuronal excitability with implications for Ca2+ dependent synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation.

">Tmem117, an oligodendrocyte-enriched regulator of NCX activity, links myelin homeostasis to counterregulation and metabolic health.</a></h4>

              
                The counterregulatory response (CRR) to hypoglycemia is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanism orchestrated by the central nervous system (CNS) to ensure survival during glucose scarcity. In individuals with diabetes, this response is frequently impaired, contributing to life-threatening episodes of hypoglycemia. Tmem117 was previously identified in a genetic screen as a promising hypothalamic regulator of CRR. Our previous work highlighted its contribution to CRR through regulation of vasopressin secretion. Here, we reveal that Tmem117 is also enriched in cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage and we characterize the contribution of oligodendrocytic Tmem117 in CRR. We show that depletion of Tmem117 from either all oligodendrocyte lineage cells or only mature oligodendrocytes leads to myelin deficits and male-specific defects in CRR. Furthermore, we reveal that transient, adult-onset depletion of Tmem117 in mature oligodendrocytes is sufficient to induce long-lasting metabolic imbalances in male mice, suggesting that defects in oligodendrocytes and myelin can affect peripheral glucose homeostasis. Mechanistically, we provide for the first-time insights on the function of Tmem117 showing that it regulates intracellular calcium dynamics through its interaction with the sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1. Together, these results redefine our understanding of the cellular contributors to the CRR, highlight the importance of oligodendrocytes in systemic glucose regulation, and position Tmem117 as a promising molecular target for cell-specific manipulation of NCX activity.

">Mapping the Structural Brain Network of Psychopathy: Convergent Evidence from Humans and Chimpanzees</a></h4>

              
                Psychopathy, a condition characterized by profound emotional and interpersonal deficits, has long been hypothesized to stem, in part, from structural brain abnormalities. Yet, neuroimaging findings remain inconsistent. To address these discrepancies, we applied a novel structural network mapping approach combined with cross-species analyses. Traditional meta-analysis revealed weak spatial convergence across 20 samples. Nevertheless, we found that heterogeneous peak locations coalesced into a distributed set of regions encompassing the insular, and prefrontal cortices. This network overlapped strikingly (r = .93) with a lesion-derived network causally linked to antisocial behaviour, and variation within it predicted volumetric risk scores in both humans (n = 107, R2 = .16) and chimpanzees (n = 148, R2 = .21). These findings suggest that psychopathy reflects abnormalities across a collection of distributed regions rather than isolated areas, providing a unifying explanation for decades of inconsistent results and advancing our understanding of its clinical, biological, and evolutionary bases.

">PRRT2 as an auxiliary regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation</a></h4>

              
                During sustained activity, voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels enter a slow inactivation state to limit cellular hyperexcitability. Disruption of this regulatory process has been implicated in skeletal, cardiac and neurological disorders. While the kinetics of this process are well characterized, its endogenous modulators remain unclear. Here, we identify Proline-Rich Transmembrane Protein 2 (PRRT2) as a native regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation. We show that PRRT2 facilitates the entry of Nav channels into slow-inactivated state and delays their recovery, a regulatory effect conserved from zebrafish to humans. PRRT2 forms molecular complexes with Nav channels both in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse cortex, PRRT2 deficiency impairs the slow inactivation of Nav channels in neuronal axons, leading to reduced cortical resilience in response to hyperexcitable challenges. Together, these findings establish PRRT2 as a physiological modulator of Nav channel slow inactivation and reveal a mechanism that supports cortical resilience to pathological perturbations.

">Postpartum enhancement of spatial learning and cognitive flexibility: an IntelliCage study</a></h4>

              
                The transition to motherhood has been shown to result in significant changes in the structure and function of the brain, with particular emphasis on the enhancement of cognitive abilities that are essential for survival. Specifically, in murine models, spatial learning and cognitive flexibility have been identified as critical components of mothering. These abilities facilitate efficient navigation of the environment, resource acquisition, and responsiveness to offspring's needs. While cognitive enhancements during the postpartum period have been observed in various experimental setups, research using long-term data collection with automated monitoring in home cage setup is completely lacking even though it provides a more reliable approach than other experimental procedures. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by systematically examining spatial learning and cognitive flexibility in female mice during the reproductive stages using IntelliCage, with the objective of offering a more comprehensive understanding of maternal cognitive adaptations. Utilising the IntelliCage system, we observed that female mice in the postpartum phase outperformed pregnant and nulliparous females in place learning, reversal learning, and fixed schedule drinking tasks, demonstrating faster adaptation and superior retention of information. These paradigms mirror real-world challenges faced by mothers, such as navigating resources and balancing caregiving with self-maintenance. The enhanced performance demonstrated by the mothers could be attributed to their heightened motivation and cognitive abilities, potentially influenced by substantial hormonal shifts, which have been known to modify neuroplasticity in critical brain regions. The identification of these improvements in maternal behaviour may offer novel insights into the impact of reproductive experiences on brain function, with implications for maternal health and broader cognitive research.

">Sustained dynamics of saccadic inhibition and adaptive oculomotor responses during continuous exploration</a></h4>

              
                In natural environments, stimuli often recur across time and space, requiring the visual system to remain sensitive to novelty while managing predictability. A central question in systems neuroscience is how motor systems adapt to repeated sensory events without compromising responsiveness. We investigated this adaptive capacity using saccadic inhibition (SI), a reflexive suppression of eye movements triggered by sudden visual transients, as a probe of oculomotor dynamics during naturalistic viewing. Human participants (N = 21) freely explored visual arrays while brief gaze-contingent flashes appeared five times at random intervals, either foveally or parafoveally. SI reliably occurred ~120 ms post-flash across repetitions and locations, indicating robust sensory-driven inhibition. However, the rebound phase, reflecting saccade reprogramming, showed a progressive decline. In a second experiment (N = 19), only the first or the fifth flash was visible on each trial. In this case, neither inhibition nor rebound was altered, suggesting that the rebound decline is driven by repeated sensory stimulation rather than exploration time. This dissociation reveals selective habituation of motor re-engagement mechanisms, while reflexive inhibitory gating remains stable. We propose that inhibition is mediated by circuitry that transiently suppresses saccade initiation and resists habituation. By contrast, the weakening rebound reflects a separate, habituation-prone route that reduces saccade generation to irrelevant events. Functionally, this imbalance implies a recalibration within the saccade generator, preserving inhibitory capacity while constraining motor output. Our findings uncover a distinct form of oculomotor habituation and demonstrate how SI reveals dynamic decoupling of sensory input and motor output under repeated stimulation.

">Exercise-induced DNA damage response and memory formation in mice</a></h4>

              
                This study reveals that acute aerobic exercise enhances memory formation through a controlled DNA damage mechanism, offering crucial insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention. This work challenges the traditional view that DNA damage is inherently harmful, demonstrating that minor, reversible DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) induced by exercise serve as necessary primers for memory consolidation - a mechanism that may be impaired in AD pathogenesis. AD affects 1 in 9 adults over 65, with ~95% being late-onset cases where up to 40% of risk factors are modifiable through lifestyle interventions like exercise. While exercise demonstrably lowers AD risk, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study provides a missing mechanistic link by showing how exercise-induced DNA damage repair systems could counteract the DNA damage accumulation and repair dysregulation that are established hallmarks of brain aging and AD. In data presented herein, young mice showed significantly higher SSB rates in active genomic regions compared to aged mice, suggesting the decline of a protective mechanism (i.e., hormesis) with aging - potentially explaining increased AD susceptibility in older adults. The present study also suggests that exercise-induced SSBs are not random cellular damage but precisely targeted events that occur at genes essential for neuroplasticity, synaptic function, and memory formation. These breaks activate PARP1 (Poly ADP ribose polymerase 1), a crucial DNA damage sensor that simultaneously initiates repair processes while facilitating transcriptional programs necessary for memory consolidation. This mechanism may represent how exercise "primes" the brain against the pathological DNA damage accumulation seen in AD. In support of this, in behavioral experiments, a single exercise bout converted sub-threshold learning into robust long-term memory formation. This memory enhancement correlated with upregulation of both neurotrophic genes (BDNF, Fos) and DNA repair enzymes (PARP1, PARP2), demonstrating coordinated damage-repair processes that appear compromised in AD. We identify HPF1 as a critical cofactor enabling PARP1 to perform trans-ADP-ribosylation of histones, linking DNA damage sensing to epigenetic chromatin remodeling required for memory-related gene expression. This pathway represents a novel therapeutic target for AD, as restoring efficient DNA repair mechanisms might slow or prevent memory loss.

">Combinatorial protein barcodes enable self-correcting neuron tracing with nanoscale molecular context</a></h4>

              
                Mapping nanoscale neuronal morphology with molecular annotations is critical for understanding healthy and dysfunctional brain circuits. Current methods are constrained by image segmentation errors and by sample defects (e.g., signal gaps, section loss). Genetic strategies promise to overcome these challenges by using easily distinguishable cell identity labels. However, multicolor approaches are spectrally limited in diversity, whereas nucleic acid barcoding lacks a cell-filling morphology signal for segmentation. Here, we introduce PRISM (Protein-barcode Reconstruction via Iterative Staining with Molecular annotations), a platform that integrates combinatorial delivery of antigenically distinct, cell-filling proteins with tissue expansion, multi-cycle imaging, barcode-augmented reconstruction, and molecular annotation. Protein barcodes increase label diversity by >750-fold over multicolor labeling and enable morphology reconstruction with intrinsic error correction. We acquired a [~]10 million m3 volume of mouse hippocampal area CA2/3, multiplexed across 23 barcode antigen and synaptic marker channels. By combining barcodes with shape information we achieve an 8x increase in automatic tracing accuracy of genetically labelled neurons. We demonstrate PRISM supports automatic proofreading across micron-scale spatial gaps and reconnects neurites across discontinuities spanning hundreds of microns. Using PRISM's molecular annotation capability, we map the distribution of synapses onto traced neural morphology, characterizing challenging synaptic structures such as thorny excrescences (TEs), and discovering a size correlation among spatially proximal TEs on the same dendrite. PRISM thus supports self-correcting neuron reconstruction with molecular context.

">Behavioral Decoding Reveals Cortical Endocannabinoid Potentiation during Δ9-THC Impairment</a></h4>

              
                How {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) impairs natural behaviors in mice remains unknown. We developed a video monitored behavioral platform with machine learning classifiers to unravel discrete changes in natural mouse behaviors. THC infusion into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) disrupted walking kinematic features characteristic of impairment responses. THC predominantly increased mPFC GABAergic activity preceding walk initiation shifting the mPFC excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. Pose-defined closed loop photo-stimulation of mPFC GABAergic neurons demonstrated that THC exacerbates selected parameters of motor impairment. Surprisingly, THC also induced a time locked, movement-induced, transient potentiation of mPFC endocannabinoid (eCB) release and ensuing CB1R-mediated synaptic inhibition. Here we establish that THC-modifies mPFC E/I balance to excitation via dynamic changes in eCB release which acts to induce behavioral impairment.

">In-situ glial cell-surface proteomics identifies pro-longevity factors in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Much focus has shifted towards understanding how glial dysfunction contributes to age-related neurodegeneration due to the critical roles glial cells play in maintaining healthy brain function. Cell-cell interactions, which are largely mediated by cell-surface proteins, control many critical aspects of development and physiology; as such, dysregulation of glial cell-surface proteins in particular is hypothesized to play an important role in age-related neurodegeneration. However, it remains technically difficult to profile glial cell-surface proteins in intact brains. Here, we applied a cell-surface proteomic profiling method to glial cells from intact brains in Drosophila, which enabled us to fully profile cell-surface proteomes in-situ, preserving native cell-cell interactions that would otherwise be omitted using traditional proteomics methods. Applying this platform to young and old flies, we investigated how glial cell-surface proteomes change during aging. We identified candidate genes predicted to be involved in brain aging, including several associated with neural development and synapse wiring molecules not previously thought to be particularly active in glia. Through a functional genetic screen, we identified one surface protein, DIP-{beta}, which is down-regulated in old flies and can increase fly lifespan when overexpressed in adult glial cells. We further performed whole-head single-nucleus RNA-seq, and revealed that DIP-{beta} overexpression mainly impacts glial and fat cells. We also found that glial DIP-{beta} overexpression was associated with improved cell-cell communication, which may contribute to the observed lifespan extension. Our study is the first to apply in-situ cell-surface proteomics to glial cells in Drosophila, and to identify DIP-{beta} as a potential glial regulator of brain aging.

">Domain-Specific Functional Network Adaptations Supporting Dual-Task Performance in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with declines in both motor and cognitive functions, which are well captured by dual task gait paradigms. However, the functional brain network mechanisms supporting motor and cognitive aspects of dual task performance in aging remain unclear. We examined 40 older adults (50 to 80 years) and 20 younger adults (20 to 40 years) who performed a motor single task (pedaling), a cognitive single-task (Go/NoGo), and a combined cognitive motor dual task during functional magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) using a custom-built MRI compatible pedaling device. Behaviorally, older adults showed significant dual task costs in motor performance, while cognitive performance was preserved. Neurally, older adults showed selective increases in connectivity within executive and motor-planning regions of cognitive networks, consistent with compensatory recruitment, whereas motor networks underwent broader reorganization, with strengthened frontoparietal control circuits but weakened cerebello-parietal and sensorimotor pathways. Multivariate analyses further revealed age related differences in latent connectivity behavior relationships: motor network patterns in older adults were more dispersed, reflecting heterogeneous reorganization, whereas cognitive-network patterns were more overlapping across groups, suggesting relative preservation. These findings suggest that aging involves a domain specific balance of resilience and vulnerability across brain networks and highlight motor-network adaption as a promising target for understanding why some older adults maintain function while others decline.

">Intrinsic Neural Oscillations Predict Verbal Learning Performance and Encoding Strategy Use</a></h4>

              
                Individuals adopt different encoding strategies to facilitate learning. However, few studies have investigated the neurophysiological basis that support these different encoding strategies across individuals. The present work addresses this gap by extending our previous findings on the direct relationship between cortical spectral power, measured via resting-state magnetoencephalography, and performance on standard cognitive test results. Our results highlight the complex interactions between endogenous brain oscillations, learning and verbal encoding strategies assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-2). First, we found that resting-state theta oscillations were significantly associated with verbal learning and subjective clustering strategies. Second, we observed that semantic clustering is facilitated by oscillatory patterns in left sensory-motor brain regions. Finally, our analyses revealed that serial and semantic clustering strategies are related to opposite regression patterns, indicating a competitive interaction. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the neural oscillatory dynamics that support diverse encoding strategies in verbal learning.

">Outdoor Air Pollution, Perivascular Space Morphology, and Cognition in Preadolescence</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ambient air pollution exposure is associated with structural brain differences and poorer cognition in children; however, mechanisms of toxicity remain unclear. Perivascular spaces (PVS), key for brain waste clearance, may play a role in the neurotoxicity of air pollution. This study explored associations between air pollution exposure, PVS morphology, and cognition in preadolescents. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study data from 6,949 9-10-year-old participants. Annual average exposures to PM2.5, O3, NO2, and 15 PM2.5 components were estimated using spatiotemporal models mapped to residential addresses. PVS count and volume were derived from T1w and T2w MRI, and cognition was estimated using NIH Toolbox scores. Linear mixed-effects models examined independent associations between air pollution, PVS, and cognition; weighted quantile sum regression assessed co-exposure effects of PM2.5 mixtures. Findings: Linear models revealed that exposures to Zn, NH4+, and Br were positively associated with PVS count in several regions. Higher PVS count in five key regions was associated with poorer cognitive performance across several NIH Toolbox domains. Higher Ca, Zn, and NH4+ exposures were associated with poorer cognition (PFDR < 0.01). Higher frontal lobe PVS count mediated the association between Zn exposure and poorer total cognition (P < 0.01). Co-exposure models revealed that PM2.5 mixtures were associated with higher temporal and cingulate PVS count, and poorer working memory and crystallized intelligence (P < 0.01). Interpretation: Outdoor air pollution was associated with higher PVS count and reduced cognition, suggesting that brain clearance may be a novel mechanism linking pollution to neurodevelopmental harm in preadolescents.

">Study of Sex Differences in the Whole Brain White Matter Using Diffusion MRI Tractography and Suprathreshold Fiber Cluster Statistics</a></h4>

              
                Sex-specific characteristics demonstrate a substantial influence on the human brain white matter, suggesting distinct brain structural connectivity patterns between females and males. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is an important tool in assessing white matter connectivity and brain tissue microstructure across different populations. Whole brain white matter analysis using dMRI tractography for group statistical comparison is a challenging task due to the large number of white matter connections. In this work, we study whole-brain white matter connectivity differences between females and males using dMRI tractography. We study a large cohort of 707 healthy adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. By applying a well-established fiber clustering pipeline and a suprathreshold fiber cluster statistical method, we evaluated tracts in the cerebral cortex, as well as those connecting to regions such as the cerebellum, which have been relatively less studied using dMRI tractography. We identified several tracts that differed significantly between females and males in terms of their fractional anisotropy and/or mean diffusivity. These included several deep white matter tracts (e.g., arcuate fasciculus, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum) that have been previously shown to have sex differences, as well as superficial white matter tracts in the frontal lobe. However, there were relatively few cortical association tracts that exhibited significant sex differences. We also identified cerebellar tracts with sex differences. Finally, correlation analysis revealed that these white matter differences were linked to a range of neurobehavioral measures, with the strongest and most consistent associations observed for motor function. Overall, these findings provide characterizations of sex differences in the white matter and indicate that the circuits underlying motor function may be an important focus of future work on sex differences in the human brain.

">Robustness and fidelity of voltage imaging analysis pipelines</a></h4>

              
                Tracking neuronal voltage changes using fluorescent voltage indicators is rapidly reshaping neuroscientific research. Voltage imaging enables direct visualization of electrical signals from subcellular compartments to large-scale networks, yet requires sophisticated image-analysis procedures. Here, we present a comprehensive study of current voltage imaging analysis pipelines and discuss the experimental conditions for which they are most suitable. We compare strengths and limitations of these pipelines in motion correction, denoising and segmentation routines, and discuss how different signal processing strategies can influence data integrity and interpretation. Our results show that most real-time analyses require GPU accelerated algorithms and that denoising prior to signal processing is needed for analysis of subcellular dynamics. We conclude that voltage imaging analyses needs to be tailored to different experimental settings: we propose a decision-tree to determine analysis strategies for diverse experimental conditions. Together, these insights pave the way for reproducible, high-fidelity voltage imaging studies.

">Dopamine receptor sensitivity and Pavlovian conditioned approach</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the determinants of individual differences in cue-reactivity and drug sensitivity is critical to identifying neurobiological mechanisms underlying vulnerability to addiction. In this study, we examined the relationship between dopamine D1 and D2 receptor sensitivity and the attribution of incentive salience to reward cues and sensitivity to cocaine. Male Sprague Dawley rats were classified as having high or low sensitivity to the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole, and a subset was tested with the D1 receptor agonist SKF 82958. Cue-reactivity was assessed using a Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) task, which distinguishes between sign-tracking (approach to a cue that predicts reward) and goal-tracking (approach to the site of reward delivery). Cocaine sensitivity was measured by locomotor activity and 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), a putative measure of appetitive states. High D2 responders exhibited more sign-tracking and greater cocaine-induced USVs than low responders despite no difference in cocaine-induced locomotion. Sign-trackers also showed greater locomotor sensitivity to D1 receptor stimulation than goal-trackers and produced more cocaine-induced USVs. Rats with high sensitivity to both D1 and D2 receptor stimulation showed the strongest sign-tracking behavior and affective response to cocaine. These findings suggest that dopamine receptor sensitivity is associated with the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues and potentially the appetitive effects of cocaine. This dopaminergic phenotype may reflect a mechanism contributing to both individual differences in cue-reactivity and drug responsiveness.

">Using Propensity Score Matching to Control for MRI Scan Quality</a></h4>

              
                Movement during MRI scanning complicates distinguishing between the different tissues in the brain (e.g., grey and white matter). Standard practice excludes scans based on researcher-determined visual quality thresholds. Unfortunately, children, elderly, and clinical populations are shown to move more, resulting in higher exclusion rates. This disproportionate exclusion creates systematic bias in the literature and makes research findings less generalizable. Furthermore, the artifacts caused by motion are demonstrated to continue to confound data, even after visual quality control has occurred. We aimed to minimize the confounding factor of systematic group differences in movement. To achieve this, we used a post-scanning statistical technique called propensity score matching (PSM) that matches control and patient populations on scan quality metrics, leading to more comparable groups, greater inclusion, and more generalizable results. We found that PSM can attenuate significant differences in scan quality between groups while allowing for greater sample diversity than standard exclusion protocols. Crucially, using PSM can also alter the results of neuroimaging-based analyses. Using three datasets (total n = 1536), we compared voxel based morphometry analyses based on different quality control protocols. In particular, we observed discrepant results between PSM and strict threshold exclusion, with PSM magnifying some regional group differences and diminishing others. Overall, PSM is a customizable way to mitigate the impact of confounds in neuroimaging research and a powerful method to help distinguish true effects from artifacts.

">Dynamical models reveal distance to criticality in ageing brain dynamics.</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain changes with age remains a central question in neuroscience. Here, we combine magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from young and older adults with a whole-brain dynamical model to explore how brain dynamics evolve across the lifespan. Using a network of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators constrained by empirical structural connectivity, we systematically vary three model parameters to identify the settings that best reproduce alpha-band features observed in MEG data. Our findings reveal age-related shifts in these model parameters: older individuals exhibit stronger global coupling and more positive values of the bifurcation parameter, consistent with a transition to a supercritical regime. These results align with prior work suggesting altered excitation-inhibition balance in ageing and indicate a systematic reconfiguration of whole-brain dynamics. By situating empirical observations within a dynamical systems framework, this study provides a principled approach for quantifying the brains distance to criticality and lays the groundwork for future clinical applications.

">Harnessing cGAS-STING signaling to counteract the genotoxic-immune nexus in tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by aberrant tau aggregation, cognitive decline, and persistent neuroinflammation, yet the mechanisms driving neuroinflammation and disease progression remain incompletely understood. Here, utilizing human postmortem AD brains and a mouse model of tauopathy, we report that genotoxic stress-induced cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) immune pathway form a self-amplifying loop that fuels neuropathology and cognitive deficits. Targeted disruption of this cycle through either genetic deletion of cGAS or pharmacological inhibition of STING restores immune homeostasis and attenuates tau pathology and cognitive deficits. Our results showed a significant accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DDSBs) and impaired DNA repair function, alongside elevated cGAS-STING signaling and type I interferon (IFN-I) responses in human AD brains compared to non-AD. In the PS19 transgenic (PS19Tg) mouse model of tauopathy, we found significantly elevated levels of DDSBs and altered expression of DNA repair proteins during early stages of disease, which preceded the dysregulation of cGAS-STING signaling and emergence of significant neuropathology in the later stage. Interestingly, genetic deletion of cGAS shifted microglial polarization from a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype toward an anti-inflammatory M2 state, accompanied by a reduction in IFN-I signaling and improved cognitive performance in PS19Tg mice. Pharmacological STING inhibition reshaped the transcriptomic landscape, revealing selective regulation of pathways governing synaptic plasticity, and immune responses. This transcriptional reprogramming was accompanied by suppression of inflammatory responses, reduction in synaptic pathology, and attenuation of tau pathology in PS19Tg mice, underscoring STING as a therapeutic target for tauopathy. In conclusion, our findings reveal that genotoxic-immune crosstalk drives neuroinflammation and tau pathology and identify a conserved, druggable cGAS-STING axis that can be targeted to impede or slow disease progression in tauopathies.

">Precision Imaging for Intraindividual Investigation of the Reward Response</a></h4>

              
                The reliance of fMRI research on between-person comparisons is limited by low test retest reliability and inability to explain within-person processes. Intraindividual studies are needed to understand how changes in brain functioning relate to changes in behavior. Here, we present open data and analysis of a novel intensively sampled fMRI study, the Night Owls Scan Club. This precision imaging dataset includes 44 sessions acquired across four participants at a roughly biweekly rate. In each session, participants completed multiple reward-related tasks and mood and alertness ratings, and mood induction behavioral manipulation. In this study, we examined how the reward response reflects between-person or within-person variance. Test-retest-reliability of the reward response was very low and not explained my measurement error, suggesting little utility for between-person comparisons. At an intraindividual level, the mood induction showed small increases in the reward anticipation response. Additionally, mood and alertness explained notable intraindividual variance of the reward response, including as much as 31% for one participant. Overall, results suggest that BOLD activation to reward tasks, and likely other fMRI tasks, is more appropriate for within-person study than between-person study, highlighting a need for intensive longitudinal neuroimaging designs.

">Examination of Balancing in a Real-World Inverted Pendulum</a></h4>

              
                Motor adaptation is typically studied using simplified virtual tasks. Here, we investigated how humans learn to stabilize a physically unstable, underactuated system, and how participants cope with changes in the system's dynamics. Twelve right-handed adults balanced a real inverted pendulum by moving a cart along a linear rail. Study 1 characterized the passive mechanical properties of three pendulums (short, medium, and long) using free-oscillatory decay and fall to absolute 30 degrees trials, after their release from the upright position. Longer rods exhibited slower decay and lower natural frequencies, as well as a longer duration before falling, indicating greater passive stability. Study 2 assessed human motor control of the pendulum to maintain balance. Human participants trained with the medium pendulum (30 trials) and were then tested with all three pendulums (20 trials each). During training, balance performance improved significantly, with time to failure increasing over trials. During testing, performance scaled with pendulum length, and longer rods were easier to balance. Similar peak cart velocities were observed across conditions, suggesting equivalent actuation effort. Additionally, as expected, pendulum angular velocities decreased with rod length, reflecting underlying inertial differences. Pendulum passive dynamics closely matched behavioral performance, supporting a strong link between intrinsic system properties and balancing outcomes. These findings show that motor learning in physically unstable environments is not only shaped by feedback and effort, but also by the alignment of human control strategies and abilities with the natural dynamics of the plant. We note that in this study, we used a modified pendulum rig previously employed to examine control engineering approaches to modelling balance, thereby generating a dataset that can later be used to compare human performance with real-time computer control implementations of the same tasks.

">Protein Biomarker in Focal Cortical Dysplasia: Molecular Clues to Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), particularly in pediatric and young adult populations characterized by structural abnormalities in cortical development. This study investigated 60 patients with histologically confirmed FCD, combining clinical, histopathological, and molecular data to identify subtype-specific molecular signatures. we investigated a panel of candidate protein biomarkers (AKT, PTEN, mTOR, HTR6, RHEB, KCNT1, RALA, DEPDC5) across FCD subtypes using patient-derived tissue samples. Our results reveal subtype-specific alterations in biomarker expression, particularly within the mTOR signaling pathway, supporting its central role in cortical malformations. Key dysregulated genes AKT, mTOR, PTEN, RHEB, DEPDC5, KCNT1, RALA, and HTR6 involved in mTOR signaling, neuronal excitability, and cortical development. Western blotting and IHC revealed marked upregulation of AKT and mTOR in FCD III, consistent with mTOR pathway hyperactivation. In contrast, KCNT1, RALA, and DEPDC5 were significantly downregulated across all subtypes, suggesting disrupted inhibitory signaling and GATOR1 complex dysfunction. ELISA assays validated increased expression of AKT, mTOR, and HTR6, particularly in higher-grade lesions. This study bridges clinical, histopathological, and protein-level data, providing novel insight into the molecular basis of FCD and highlighting candidate biomarkers for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

">Sensory plasticity of dorsal horn silent neurons: a critical mechanism for neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                The spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) integrates and modulates sensory processing but undergoes critical plasticity following nerve injury, leading to pain hypersensitivity. Mechanical allodynia, or touch-evoked pain, is a highly prevalent and debilitating symptom of neuropathic pain. It has been proposed that, after nerve injury, innocuous sensory neurons gain access to nociceptive-specific (NS) circuits in the DH due to altered spinal inhibitory controls, thereby converting touch into pain. It is however unclear how sensory processing is reorganized in these conditions across the different laminae of the DH to generate this symptom. In this study, we developed a novel ex vivo somatosensory preparation to selectively analyze excitatory neuronal activity across all DH laminae simultaneously, following physiological stimulations of the skin. Using two-photon calcium (Ca2+) imaging, we studied the DH activity under physiological conditions, after spinal disinhibition or nerve injury, and generated a computational model to reveal the sensory plasticity of individual DH neurons that leads to neuropathic pain. We demonstrate that spinal disinhibition, whether pharmacologically induced or resulting from nerve injury, converts most DH excitatory neurons into highly polymodal cells. We further show that such disinhibition unmasks an unprecedented number of previously silent neurons in both superficial and deep DH laminae, responding to a wide dynamic range (WDR) of sensory modalities. The computational model pinpoints that neuropathic pain does not result primarily from the transformation of excitatory NS neurons into WDR neurons, but rather from the activation of a previously dormant excitatory circuit. This newly active circuit spans both superficial and deep DH laminae and is predominantly composed of WDR excitatory neurons The identification of this extensive silent neuronal network provides critical insights into DH plasticity mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain, and should guide future therapeutic strategies.

">Multiscale predictive modeling robustly improves the accuracy of pseudo-prospective seizure forecasting in drug-resistant epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Extensive research over the past two decades has focused on identifying a preictal period in scalp as well as intracranial EEG (iEEG). This has led to a plethora of seizure prediction and forecasting algorithms which have reached only moderate success on curated and pre-segmented EEG datasets (accuracy/AUC [&ge;] 0.8). Furthermore, when tested on their ability to pseudo-prospectively predict seizures from continuous EEG recordings, all existing algorithms suffer from low sensitivity (large false negatives), high time in warning (large false positives), or both. In this study, we provide pilot evidence that predictive modeling of the dynamics of iEEG features (biomarkers), seizure risk, or both at the scale of tens of minutes can significantly improve the pseudo-prospective accuracy of almost any state-of-the-art seizure forecasting model. In contrast to the bulk of prior research that has focused on designing better features and classifiers, we start from off-the-shelf features and classifiers and shift the focus to learning how iEEG features (classifier input) and seizure risk (classifier output) evolve over time. Using iEEG from n = 5 patients undergoing presurgical evaluation at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and six state-of-the-art baseline models, we first demonstrate that a wide array of iEEG features are highly predictable over time, with over 99% and 35% of studied features, respectively, having R2 > 0 for 10-second- and 10-minute-ahead prediction (mean R2 of 0.85 and 0.2). Furthermore, in almost all patients and baseline models, we observe a strong correlation between feature predictability (with some features remaining predictable up to 30 minutes) and classification-based feature importance. As a result, we subsequently demonstrate that adding an autoregressive model that predicts iEEG features on 12{+/-}4 minutes into the future is almost universally beneficial, with a mean improvement of 28% in terms of area under pseudo-prospective sensitivity-time in warning curve (PP-AUC). The addition of the second autoregressive predictive model at the level of seizure risk further improved accuracy, with a total mean improvement of 51% in PP-AUC. Our results provide pioneering evidence for the long-term predictability of seizure-relevant iEEG features and the vast utility of time series predictive modeling for improving seizure forecasting using continuous intracranial EEG.

">Noninvasive profiling of input-output excitability curves in human prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Background: The human prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in cognitive control and behavior, and its dysfunction has been linked to numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, noninvasive measurement of prefrontal activity remains challenging, limiting our understanding of how to optimize prefrontal treatments. Input-output relationships reveal how neural circuits respond to different inputs and are essential for determining optimal treatment parameters and understanding individual variability in treatment response, yet systematic investigation of prefrontal input-output relationships has been lacking. Objective: To characterize human prefrontal excitability with input-output (I/O) curves. Methods: We employed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography in a randomized mixed-block design with 28 healthy participants receiving single-pulse TMS to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) across 12 stimulation intensities (60-140% of resting motor threshold). We quantified prefrontal excitability using early local TMS-evoked potentials (EL-TEPs), local cortical responses measured locally 20-60 ms post-stimulus. Results: We observed a strong effect of TMS intensity on prefrontal EL-TEPs. Sigmoidal EL-TEP I/O curves were observed in 57% of participants, with the sigmoidality partially explained by the signal quality of the EL-TEP. Correlations were observed between EL-TEP and motor-evoked potential curve parameters, but intensity parameterization approaches did not significantly differ in explaining inter-individual EL-TEP response variability. Reliable EL-TEPs could be obtained using fewer TMS pulses at higher intensities, and test-retest assessments revealed robust I/O curve profiles. Conclusions: These findings provide a systematic noninvasive characterization of prefrontal input-output physiology in humans, establishing a validated framework for estimating prefrontal excitability. The comparison of various intensity parameterizations motivates the need for enhanced models and individualized measurement of stimulation responses.

">Brain Network Differences in Second Language Learning Depend on Individual Competencies</a></h4>

              
                Integrating new words into an existing semantic network is a core challenge of second language (L2) acquisition. We investigated how evidence-based learning strategies and individual performance shape the neurocognitive dynamics of vocabulary learning. Eighty-three adults with German or French as their native language (L1) learned 48 Finnish (L2) nouns over 14 days using a mobile app that systematically varied retrieval practice, corrective feedback, multisensory learning, and distributed learning. Before and after training, EEG was recorded during a translation recognition task designed to elicit the N400, an index of semantic integration. Vocabulary accuracy increased from 0.41% pre-learning to 75.5% post-learning (dz = 3.96), and the N400 incongruity effect increased significantly, F(1, 75) = 99.52, p < .001, 2g = .32, reflecting successful integration of new L2 words into the mental lexicon. High performers showed larger N400 responses and distinct ERP template-map preponderance (i.e., the proportion of epoch time points assigned to a given template map) indicating more efficient and specialized neural processing. Despite systematic manipulation of learning strategies, no single approach yielded consistent behavioral or neural advantages, suggesting that overall exposure and cumulative practice - rather than any specific strategy - were the key drivers of robust learning. ERP template-map analyses further revealed that learning not only amplified neural responses but also shifted the preponderance of maps in the N400 window, signaling a qualitative reorganization of semantic processing. These findings bridge cognitive neuroscience and language education, suggesting that the depth and success of vocabulary learning may depend more on the degree of integration achieved than on the specific instructional strategy employed.

The retraction has been agreed upon following an investigation into concerns raised by a third party. The article purports a homology between amino acid sequences of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and the rubella virus E2 glycoprotein. However, further analysis has demonstrated that the referenced sequences are not present in the mature MOG proteins. The authors did not respond to address the concerns and did not provide their original data. As a result, the editors consider the conclusions of this article to be unsupported.</p>

                <p>Behavioral neuroscience research often requires substantial financial investment in specialized equipment and software, creating barriers for new investigators and limiting the flexibility of established laboratories. This study explores how 3D printing and machine learning can be combined to reduce startup and operational costs while maintaining research quality. Using 3D printing, we designed and manufactured a mouse T-maze and elevated plus maze to assess cognition and anxiety-like behaviors in male mice. These custom-built mazes demonstrated comparable efficacy with commercial alternatives while offering greater affordability, scalability, and customization. To complement the hardware, we integrated machine learning for automated tracking and analysis of mouse behavior, achieving accuracy equivalent to commercial solutions or experienced human scoring at significantly reduced cost. By combining 3D printing with machine learning, our approach significantly lowers financial barriers for new investigators and enables established research groups to allocate resources more effectively. This approach not only expands research possibilities for established labs but also lowers the barrier to entry for early-career scientists and institutions with limited funding.</p>

                <p>Visual responses in the cortex are strongly influenced by shifts in spatial attention. This modulation of visual processing includes changes in firing rate, decreased response variability, and decreased interneuronal correlations; all of which are thought to underlie enhanced perception near the center of attention at the cost of perception at other locations. Information from the retina is relayed to primary visual cortex via neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Although early studies describe an enhancement of LGN activity with spatial attention, more recent work has cast doubt on this view. Given its strategic position as the gateway to the cortex, an understanding of the effects of attention on visual processing in the LGN is important. We therefore performed experiments to reexamine the influence of spatial attention on spiking activity in macaque LGN (one male, one female) and applied a broad set of analyses and functional metrics to assess possible effects. Our results reveal a statistically significant effect of spatial attention in the LGN: firing rates were slightly higher and more reliable when monkeys directed attention toward the receptive fields of recorded neurons compared with when attention was directed to different retinotopic locations. However, effects were much smaller than previously reported (~1 vs ~4%) and further analyses suggest that effects are weak, inconsistent, and restricted to a small subset of parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. Thus, while spatial attention does exert an influence in the LGN, its effects are weak and may have limited impact on downstream processing.</p>

                <p>The environment experienced by children, such as exposure to chronic early life adversity (ELA), increases lifespan brain disorder risk. The mechanisms that link ELA exposure to functional brain disruptions are not well understood. A limited-bedding and nesting paradigm, in which ELA is induced in mouse pups over the first postnatal week through disruption of maternal care, is characterized by limited resources, environment unpredictability, and disruption of reward and cognitive behaviors. Studies using this model demonstrated sex-selective alterations in hippocampal mitochondrial-associated proteins in response to ELA compared with care as usual (CAU). Further, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity and complex I activity are increased in ELA juveniles, yet decreased in adults, with the impact of ELA moderated by sex in adults. Given that altered mitochondrial function is a key mediator in metabolic adaptations, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of reversing mitochondrial dysfunction and the anhedonia that accompanies ELA by addressing oxidative stress. Treatment with the antioxidant MitoQ began at weaning and extended to 3&nbsp;months. Measures of complex I activity demonstrated full recovery in adults. Female-specific deficits in the sucrose preference task, which is a measure of rewarding behavior in rodents, also exhibited recovery, with preference for sucrose comparable with that of CAU mice. These data indicate that mitochondrial health is one component of responses to early life adversity that has lifespan implications, but with the capacity to recover normal functioning in adults.</p>

A majority of all infectious diseases manifest some climate-sensitivity. However, many of those sensitivities are not well understood as meteorological drivers of infectious diseases co-occur with other drivers exhibiting complex non-linear influences and feedback. This makes it hard to dissect their individual contributions. Here we apply a novel deep learning Explainable AI (XAI) compartment model with covariate drivers and dynamic feedback to predict and explain the dengue incidence across Sri Lanka. We compare the compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model to a deep learning model without a compartmental structure. We find that the covariate compartmental hybrid model performs better and can describe drivers of the dengue spatiotemporal incidence over time. The strongest drivers in our model in order of importance are precipitation, socio-demographics, and normalized vegetation index. The novel method demonstrated can be used to leverage known infectious disease dynamics while accounting for the influence of other drivers and different population immunity contexts. While allowing for interpretation of the covariate driver influences, the approach bridges the gap between dynamical compartmental and data driven dynamical models.

The spread of infectious diseases is shaped by spatial and temporal aspects, such as host population structure or changes in the transmission rate or number of infected individuals over time. These spatiotemporal dynamics are imprinted in the genomes of pathogens and can be recovered from those genomes using phylodynamics methods. However, phylodynamic methods typically quantify either the temporal or spatial transmission dynamics, which leads to unclear biases, as one can potentially not be inferred without the other. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a structured coalescent skyline approach, MASCOT-Skyline, that allows us to jointly infer spatial and temporal transmission dynamics of infectious diseases using Markov chain Monte Carlo inference. To do so, we model the effective population size dynamics in different locations using a non-parametric function, allowing us to approximate a range of population size dynamics. We show, using a range of different viral outbreak datasets, potential issues with phylogeographic methods. We then use these viral datasets to motivate simulations of outbreaks that illuminate the nature of biases present in the different phylogeographic methods. We show that spatial and temporal dynamics should be modeled jointly, even if one seeks to recover just one of the two. Further, we showcase conditions under which we can expect phylogeographic analyses to be biased, particularly different subsampling approaches, as well as provide recommendations on when we can expect them to perform well. We implemented MASCOT-Skyline as part of the open-source software package MASCOT for the Bayesian phylodynamics platform BEAST2.

                <p>by Jennifer D. Senta, Sonia J. Bishop, Anne G.E. Collins</p>

Anxiety has been robustly linked to deficits in frontal executive function including working memory (WM) and attentional control processes. However, although anxiety has also been associated with impaired performance on learning tasks, computational investigations of reinforcement learning (RL) impairment in anxiety have yielded mixed results. WM processes are known to contribute to learning behavior in parallel to RL processes and to modulate the effective learning rate as a function of load. However, WM processes have typically not been modeled in investigations of anxiety and RL. In the current study, we leveraged an experimental paradigm (RLWM) which manipulates the relative contributions of WM and RL processes in a reinforcement learning and retention task using multiple stimulus set sizes. Using a computational model of interactive RL and WM processes, we investigated whether individual differences in physiological or cognitive anxiety impacted task performance via deficits in RL or WM. Elevated physiological, but not cognitive, anxiety scores were strongly associated with worse performance during learning and retention testing across all set sizes. Computationally, higher physiological anxiety scores were significantly related to reduced learning rate and increased rate of WM decay. To highlight the importance of modeling WM contributions to learning, we considered the effect of fitting RL models without WM modules to the data. Here we found that reduced learning performance for higher physiological anxiety was at least partially misattributed to stochastic decision noise in 9 out of 10 RL-only models considered. These findings reveal a dual-process impairment in learning in anxiety that is linked to a more physiological than cognitive anxiety phenotype. More broadly, this work also points to the importance of accounting for the contribution of WM to RL when investigating psychopathology-related deficits in learning.

The ontogenesis of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) and its sensitivity to maternal signals are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the development of the clock in the rat SCN from the fetal to the postweaning period and identified rhythmic metabolic signals from the mother to the fetal SCN. We determined daily expression profiles of clock genes (<i>Per2</i>, <i>Nr1d1</i>, <i>Bmal1</i>) and clock- and metabolism-related genes (<i>Dbp</i>, <i>E4bp4</i>) and performed time-resolved analysis of the metabolome and lipidome in the SCN and plasma of 19-day-old embryos (E19) and 2-, 10-, 20-, and 28-day-old pups (P02–28). Our data show that rhythms in the expression of canonical clock genes are absent at E19 and develop gradually until P10, but the <i>Dbp</i> rhythm was still developing between P20 and P28. Expression of the metabolism-sensitive gene <i>E4bp4</i> and levels of essential amino acids and other metabolites supplied by maternal food are rhythmic in the fetal SCN, which is lost after birth at P02 and reappears later in the postnatal period. Maternal food-derived metabolites were also rhythmic in fetal plasma. The temporal coherence of the fetal SCN metabolome and lipidome declines markedly and its rhythmicity disappears immediately after birth. The results revealed previously unforeseen pathways by which the fetal SCN may receive rhythmic information from the mother before its clock develops.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binds exclusively the c-Met surface receptor, and the HGF/c-Met axis regulates T cell function in autoimmune diseases. We analyzed c-Met expression on human CD4 T cells in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) versus non-inflammatory neurological disease (NIND), to better understand the role of CD4 T cells in MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 34 untreated MS patients (age 28–44 years) and 13 NIND (age 34–51 years) who underwent paired blood and CSF sampling at the time of diagnosis work-up. Phenotypic and functional CD4 T cells characterization was determined by flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing. Adhesion and transmigration capacities were studied to further characterize the function of c-Met<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>c-Met<sup>+</sup> memory CD4 T cells were detected at higher levels in both blood (median of 1.98%) and CSF (5.88%) in MS compared to NIND (0.37% and 0.68%, respectively) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Ex vivo c-Met<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells exhibited higher levels of GM-CSF, interleukin (IL)-17, interferon (IFN)-γ$$ \upgamma $$, and double positive IL-17<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ$$ \gamma $$<sup>+</sup> expression, compared with c-Met<sup>−</sup> CD4 T cells. c-Met<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells expressed increased levels of integrins—Itgα4β1 (VLA-4) and ItgαLβ2 (LFA-1)—compared with c-Met<sup>−</sup> CD4 T cells. Anti-Itgα4 (natalizumab) and anti-ItgαLβ2 (odulimomab) inhibited CD4 T cell transmigration with predominant inhibition of CD4 T cells expressing c-Met.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results emphasize c-Met as an immune marker of highly pro-inflammatory and migratory CD4 T lymphocytes in both the periphery and central nervous system of MS patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="Back Again to the Future: A New Era for Cerebroprotection"/>
<p>Cerebroprotection is a fresh framework for designing neurological therapy that targets glia and vascular cells, in addition to neurons. In the future, successful cerebroprotection will involve targeting all elements of the neurovascular unit. Preclinical trials must include functional outcomes, as well as lesion morphometry. Utmost rigor and transparency must be required of preclinical studies. With optimal targeting, proper endpoints, and improved rigor, future clinical trials will have a higher likelihood of success. Created with Biorender.
</p>
<br/>
<p>In multiple disease areas, neurology has failed to translate promising treatments from positive preclinical studies to successful clinical trial results. Despite this history, we persist in testing new, putative neuroprotectants using the same concepts, approaches, and methods without much modification. Recent novel data and new concepts offer an opportunity to break with past doctrine decisively, and open a new era of different approaches, methods, and strategies for studying future protections for brain injury. Cerebroprotection is a fresh framework for designing neurological therapy that targets glia and vascular cells, in addition to neurons. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Sun et al. use long-read sequencing data from high-grade serous ovarian cancer to perform de novo profiling of extrachromosomal DNA characteristics. They show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a multifunctional driver of genomic variations and tumor progression, including genomic instability, enhancer amplification, and transposon activation.

A non-covalent inhibitor targeting their forkhead domains disrupts this oncogenic transcriptional program, leading to cell-cycle arrest.

Their study suggests that to minimize total arrest failure, checkpoint strengths need to be sub-optimal for each individual arrest-failure type.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 26 September 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63399-x">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-63399-x</a></p>Broad-spectrum vaccines have been proposed as a tool for rapid response to emerging infectious disease threats and are in pre-clinical development. Here, the authors use mathematical modelling to assess the potential impacts of broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines for a hypothetical “SARS-X” outbreak.

It turns out that this mechanism is simply based on the difference of adhesive friction at cell front and rear.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100734">Spatial frequency adaptation modulates population receptive field sizes</a></h4>

              
                The spatial tuning of neuronal populations in the early visual cortical regions is related to the spatial frequency (SF) selectivity of neurons. However, there has been no direct investigation into how this relationship is reflected in population receptive field (pRF) sizes despite the common application of pRF mapping in visual neuroscience. We hypothesised that adaptation to high/low SF would decrease the sensitivity of neurons with respectively small/large receptive field sizes, resulting in a change in pRF sizes as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test this hypothesis, we first quantified the SF aftereffect using a psychophysical paradigm where human observers made SF judgments following adaptation to high/low SF noise patterns. We then incorporated the same adaptation technique into a standard pRF mapping procedure to investigate the spatial tuning of the early visual cortex following SF adaptation. Results showed that adaptation to a low/high SF resulted in smaller/larger pRFs, respectively, as hypothesised. Our results provide the most direct evidence to date that the spatial tuning of the visual cortex, as measured by pRF mapping, is related to the SF selectivity of visual neural populations. This has implications for various domains of visual processing, including size perception and visual acuity.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The superficial white matter (SWM) comprises short-range fibers that connect adjacent cortical regions; however, its structural connectivity remains poorly understood. In a previous dissection study, we identified anatomical “crossings” where superficial white matter fibers converge from multiple directions. Building on this, the present study investigated superficial white matter characteristics associated with these crossings using diffusion-weighted imaging data from 10 individuals in the Human Connectome Project. A total of 605 regions of interest (ROIs) were placed at presumed crossing locations in the dominant hemisphere. Superficial white matter fibers were categorized by tract length (short, medium, and long), and streamline distribution was analyzed. Short- and medium-length fibers showed predominantly intragyral connections, while long fibers exhibited more diverse intragyral connectivity. Graph theoretical analysis identified high-efficiency regions of interest, putative hub regions, which were mapped onto cytoarchitectonic structures from the Economo-Koskinas atlas and compared with myelin concentration. High-efficiency regions for short- and middle-length fibers were mainly in primary motor and sensory areas, particularly visual regions, corresponding to high myelin concentration and cytoarchitectonic areas 1 and 5. In contrast, high-efficiency regions for long fibers were distributed in the association cortex (area 3). These findings provide new insights into the structural organization of superficial white matter and its relationship to cortical architecture.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Understanding someone else’s attention lies at the heart of human interaction. When we perceive something to be in someone else’s attention, we understand it to be in that person’s mind in the moment, ready to affect that person’s choices. It has been proposed that people construct predictive models of the attentional state of others. In that proposal, a working understanding of someone else’s attention goes far beyond merely tracking the direction of someone’s eyes. For example, in a recent study, participants watched a spotlight of attention moving around a picture and successfully judged whether the trace represented real, human attention or an artificially manipulated version, demonstrating implicit information about how patterns of attention behave over space and time. However, the neuronal underpinnings of attention modeling are almost entirely unstudied. Here we tested people in an fMRI scanner while they performed the attention judgment paradigm. When contrasting attention traces that participants judged to be artificial versus those judged to be real, activity was found bilaterally in the precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and anterior insula, as well as in a part of the right temporoparietal junction. These areas partially overlap the theory-of-mind network and the salience network. The activations differ from those known to be involved in processing low-level features of attention such as the sight of other people’s eyes. The results provide an initial picture of the cortical networks involved in monitoring the attention patterns of others and recognizing when those patterns deviate from expectation.</span>

                <p>When compared with nature sounds, exposure to mechanical sounds evokes higher levels of perceptual and physiological arousal, prompting the recruitment of attentional and physiological resources to elicit adaptive responses. However, it is unclear whether these attributes are solely related to the sound intensity of mechanical sounds, since in most real-world scenarios, mechanical sounds are present at high intensities or if other acoustic or semantic factors are also at play. We measured the skin conductance response (SCR), reflecting sympathetic nervous system activity as well as the pleasantness and eventfulness of the soundscape across two passive and active listening tasks in healthy subjects (<I>N</I> = 25; 14 females, 11 males). The auditory stimuli were divided into two categories, nature and mechanical sounds, and were manipulated to vary in three perceived loudness levels. As expected, we found that the sound category influenced perceived soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness. SCR was analyzed by taking the mean level across the stimulus epoch and also by quantifying its dynamics. We found that mean SCR was modulated by loudness only. SCR rise-time (a measure of the time it takes the skin response to increase from the baseline to its maximum value) correlated significantly with soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness for nature and mechanical sounds. This study highlights the importance of considering both the loudness level and sound category in evaluating the perceptual soundscape, and it identifies SCR as a valuable tool for such assessments.</p>

                <p>Rhythmic network states have been theorized to facilitate communication between brain regions, but how these oscillations influence communication subspaces, i.e., the low-dimensional neural activity patterns that mediate interregional communication, and in turn how subspaces impact behavior remain unclear. Using a spatial memory task in rats (male Long&ndash;Evans rats), we simultaneously recorded ensembles from hippocampal CA1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to address this question. We found that task behaviors best aligned with low-dimensional, shared subspaces between these regions rather than local activity in either region. Critically, both network oscillations and speed modulated the structure and performance of this communication subspace. To understand the communication space, we visualized shared CA1&ndash;PFC communication geometry using manifold techniques and found ring-like structures. We hypothesize that these shared activity manifolds are utilized to mediate the task behavior. These findings suggest that memory-guided behaviors are driven by shared CA1&ndash;PFC interactions that are dynamically modulated by oscillatory states, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between rhythms and behaviorally relevant neural communication.</p>

                <p>by Priyata Kalra, Bastian Kister, Rebekka Fendt, Mario Köster, Julia Pulverer, Sven Sahle, Lars Kuepfer, Ursula Kummer</p>

Drug effects are difficult to investigate in detail <i>in vivo</i>. However, a mechanistic understanding of drug action is clearly beneficial for both pharmaceutical development as well as for optimization of treatment designs. We here established a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) mouse model which simultaneously describes whole-body pharmacokinetics of murine IFN-α as well as the cellular pharmacodynamic effect through the antiviral response biomarker Mx2. To this end, a dynamic model of intracellular IFN-α signalling in the JAK/STAT pathway was combined with a whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of IFN-α in mice. The pharmacodynamic behaviour of the resulting mouse IFN-α QSP model was first compared to a cellular model of the JAK/STAT pathway to compare <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> drug effects and to identify functional differences. It was found that the <i>in vitro</i> drug effect in the cellular model overestimates the <i>in vivo</i> response in mice at least by a factor of two which is partly due to the missing drug clearance <i>in vitro</i>. Also, the drug responses in the <i>in vitro</i> model were time delayed. Interspecies analyses in murine and a previously published human QSP model of IFN-α next show a similar dynamic behavior. However, our models demonstrate eight to 16-fold stronger response levels in mice than in humans due to more efficient interferon binding. Our analysis supports a mechanistic analysis of both upstream pharmacokinetic as well as downstream pharmacodynamic drug effects through the combination of physiological knowledge and quantitative computational models. The study hence shows potential applications for QSP modelling in terms of study planning, for example by choosing physiologically relevant in vitro concentrations. Also, the QSP model allows inter-species comparisons of the effect strength in specific functional readouts, which in humans are otherwise not possible due to the limited sampling possibilities. We expect QSP modelling to play an increasingly important role in drug development and research in the future.

                <p>by Tianyong Yao, Ruby Kim</p>

Dopamine (DA) plays a vital role in mood, alertness, and behavior, with dysregulation linked to disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, ADHD, depression, and addiction. In this study, we develop and analyze a reduced mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake to investigate how daily rhythms influence dopamine dynamics and the efficacy of dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs) used in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric conditions. We simplify a detailed mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake and demonstrate that our reduced system maintains key dynamical features including homeostatic regulation via autoreceptors. Our model captures core autoregulatory mechanisms and reveals that DRIs can exert substantial time-of-day effects, allowing for dopamine levels to be sustained at elevated levels when administered at circadian troughs. These fluctuations depend sensitively on the timing of DRI administration relative to circadian variations in enzyme activity. We further extend the model to incorporate feedback from local dopaminergic tone, which generates ultradian oscillations in the model independent of circadian regulation. Administration of DRIs lengthens the ultradian periodicity. Our findings provide strong evidence that intrinsic fluctuations in DA should be considered in the clinical use of DRIs, offering a mechanistic framework for improving chronotherapeutic strategies targeting dopaminergic dysfunction.

                <p>by Zhiqiang Ma, Ran Chen, Zibo Feng</p>
Background <p>Circulating proteins play a critical role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet few have been targeted therapeutically. This study aimed to identify novel protein targets for RA therapy.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a comprehensive proteome-wide Mendelian Randomization (MR), colocalization analysis, and summary-data-based MR (SMR) to explore potential causal relationships between plasma proteins and RA, with an overall sample size of 1,148,608. The GWAS data on plasma proteins were obtained from the FinnGen study, the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project and Iceland GWAS data. Then, validation of key molecules’ differential expression pattern was done using external transcriptomic data from RA patients, while the Drug Signatures Database (DsigDB) was used to identify potential therapeutic drugs. Drugs and target proteins interactions was evaluated with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations approaches. Potential side effects of plasma proteins associated with RA were elucidated by phenome-wide association study (Phe-WAS) approach.</p> Results <p>Genetically predicted levels of 68 plasma proteins were associated with RA. After colocalization and SMR analysis, 6 plasma proteins (FCRL3, SUGP1, TNFAIP3, EHBP1, HAPLN4, and CILP2) have been passed all tests and identified as having potential as therapeutic targets for RA. Further Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis indicated that three protiens (CILP2, TNFAIP3 and EHBP) have a good potential as biomarkers for RA. Differential gene analysis showed the downregulation of HAPLN4, FCRL3, EHBP1 and TNFAIP3 in RA, as well as the upregulation of CILP2 in RA. Further Phe-WAS suggested that targeting these proteins may have potential side effects.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study investigated the causal relationships between plasma proteins and RA, deepening our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and facilitating the development of new therapeutic drugs.</p>

                <p>by Baiwei Liu, Siyang Kong, Freek van Ede</p>

The N2pc is a popular human-neuroscience marker of covert and internal spatial attention that occurs 200–300 ms after being prompted to shift attention—a time window also characterized by the spatial biasing of small fixational eye movements known as microsaccades. Here, we show how co-occurring microsaccades profoundly modulate N2pc amplitude during top-down shifts of spatial attention in both perception and working memory. At the same time, we show that a significant—albeit severely weakened—N2pc can still be established in the absence of co-occurring microsaccades. Moreover, despite the strong modulation of the N2pc by microsaccade presence and direction, the N2pc does not align to the precise timing of microsaccades, ruling out that the observed N2pc modulations by microsaccades are a direct artifact of microsaccade-related eye-muscle activity, corneo-retinal dipole movement, or visual inputs moving over the retina. Thus, while microsaccades strongly modulate N2pc amplitude, microsaccades themselves are not a prerequisite for, nor a direct cause of, the N2pc.

The liver circadian clock and hepatic transcriptome are highly responsive to metabolic signals generated from feeding–fasting rhythm. Previous studies have identified a number of nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways that could interpret metabolic input to regulate rhythmic hepatic biology. Here, we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification (PTM) in mediating metabolic regulation of rhythmic biology in the liver. We observe daily oscillation of global nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation in the liver of mice subjected to night-restricted feeding (NRF) using label-free global O-GlcNAc proteomics. Additional site-specific O-GlcNAc analysis by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry further supports temporal differences in O-GlcNAcylation by revealing day–night differences. Proteins involved in gene expression are enriched among rhythmically O-GlcNAcylated proteins, suggesting rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation may directly regulate the hepatic transcriptome. We show that rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation can also indirectly modulate nuclear proteins by interacting with phosphorylation. Several proteins harboring O-GlcNAcylation-phosphorylation interplay motif exhibit rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation. Specifically, we show that O-GlcNAcylation occurs at a phospho-degron of a key circadian transcriptional activator, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), thus regulating its stability and transcriptional output. Finally, we report that day-restricted feeding (DRF) in the nocturnal mouse significantly alters O-GlcNAcylation pattern. Whereas global O-GlcNAcylation analysis indicates dampening of global O-GlcNAcylation rhythm in mice fed under DRF, site-specific analysis reveals differential responses of O-GlcNAc sites when timing of food intake is altered. Notably, a substantial number of O-GlcNAcylation sites exhibit inverted day–night profiles when mice are subjected to DRF. This suggests the dysregulation of daily nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation rhythm may contribute to the disruption in liver transcriptome previously observed in DRF condition. In summary, our results provide new mechanistic insights into metabolic regulation of hepatic transcriptional regulators via interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation and shed light on the deleterious effects of improper mealtimes.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003396">Cross‐species rescue reveals sequence requirements for a rapidly evolving intrinsically disordered region</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sang On Park, Rishad Khondker, Ariel Blank, Annie Dyatel, Corey Frazer, Richard J. Bennett, Robert J. Reid, Rodney J. Rothstein, Luke E. Berchowitz</p>

Many proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that are essential for their function but do not adopt a stable structure; instead, they exist as an ensemble of conformations. Because these regions lack fixed structural constraints, traditional structure-based and alignment-based approaches are often ineffective for studying their sequence–function relationships. Here, we present an approach that combines molecular evolution with genetic complementation to extract functional sequence features of an IDR. We use the budding yeast RNA-binding protein Rim4 as a model system. Rim4 is required for sporulation, and its IDR facilitates its dual role as a translational activator and repressor. Notably, Rim4’s IDR supports assembly into an SDS-resistant amyloid-like form, which is required for its repressor function. We demonstrate that the Rim4 IDR is functionally conserved across orthologous sequences spanning more than 400 million years of evolution, despite extensive sequence divergence. Our results suggest that noncomplementing Rim4 IDRs generally evolve toward higher hydrophobicity, and that reducing hydrophobicity can refunctionalize a nonfunctional IDR sequence that diverged over 200 million years ago. In the refunctionalized IDR, the activator function is restored, whereas assembly into an amyloid-like form remains uncomplemented. Overall, our findings add to evidence that IDRs can perform multiple functions, with each role optimized by distinct biochemical properties, and that evolutionary pressure favoring one function may drive the IDR toward biochemical characteristics that compromise its other functions.

<p>Teles et al. propose a model of brain evolution that explains how come fish with larger bodies have larger brains with more neurons across cohorts raised in different growth conditions, while individuals within a cohort do not, mimicking the different findings across and within species, respectively.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Comparative work on brain size variation across vertebrates has shown that larger species have larger brains and that larger brains have more neurons across species in each clade. This trend supports the expectation that larger bodies require larger brains with more neurons but is at odds with the finding that within a species, larger animals do not necessarily have larger brains, and larger brains do not have more neurons. While the latter finding is inconsistent with the expectation that larger brained species evolve through selection of larger brained individuals, the lack of correlation between brain size and numbers of neurons across individuals of a same species might be due to the small range of variation that is typically found within a species. Here, we take advantage of ecologically regulated indeterminate growth exhibited by the cichlid fish tilapia (<i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i>) raised under different population densities to generate an over 30-fold variation in body mass across adult individuals of the same age. We find that across the cohorts of individuals raised with different growth opportunities provided by different population densities, larger animals have larger brains with more neurons that occur at similar neuronal densities, as applies to interspecific scaling in several vertebrate clades. Within each cohort raised at a given population density, however, those animals with more neurons have higher neuronal densities, but not larger brains or bodies, though the latter scale together—as applies to intraspecific scaling in mice and chickens. We conclude that brain size and number of neurons are determined independently across individuals in a population but scale together across cohorts, in step changes that accompany varying opportunities for growth, in the absence of any selection pressure. Based on these results, we propose a model of brain evolution through plastic changes in response to changing environmental opportunities that accounts for intra-, inter-, and clade-specific patterns of brain scaling and diversity.</p>
