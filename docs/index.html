              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02644">Modelling Alzheimer's Protein Dynamics: A Data-Driven Integration of Stochastic Methods, Machine Learning and Connectome Insights</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to cognitive decline. This study presents a novel stochastic modelling approach to simulate the propagation of these proteins within the brain. We employ a network diffusion model utilizing the Laplacian matrix derived from MRI data provided by the Human Connectome Project (https://braingraph.org/cms/). The deterministic model is extended by incorporating stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to account for inherent uncertainties in disease progression. Introducing stochastic components into the model allows for a more realistic simulation of the disease due to the multi-factorial nature of AD. By simulation, the model captures the variability in misfolded protein concentration across brain regions over time. Bayesian inference is a statistical method that uses prior beliefs and given data to model a posterior distribution for relevant parameter values. This allows us to better understand the impact of noise and external factors on AD progression. Deterministic results suggest that AD progresses at different speeds within each lobe of the brain, moreover, the frontal takes the longest to reach a perfect disease state. We find that in the presence of noise, the model never reaches a perfect disease state and the later years of AD are more unpredictable than earlier on in the disease. These results highlight the importance of integrating stochastic elements into deterministic models to achieve more realistic simulations, providing valuable insights for future studies on the dynamics of neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02685">Geometry of naturalistic object representations in recurrent neural network models of working memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent decision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working memory has primarily used categorical (i.e., one-hot) inputs, rather than ecologically relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies have primarily investigated working memory during single or few cognitive tasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is maintained in working memory in neural networks is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained them on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the RNN's latent space, we found that: (1) Multi-task RNNs represent both task-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks; (2) The latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla RNNs are largely shared across tasks, but highly task-specific in gated RNNs such as GRU and LSTM; (3) Surprisingly, RNNs embed objects in new representational spaces in which individual object features are less orthogonalized relative to the perceptual space; (4) The transformation of working memory encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent space) into memory was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing the retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were distinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ chronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans, enabling testable predictions with neural data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089">Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.03089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, are widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00109">Back to the Continuous Attractor</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous attractors offer a unique class of solutions for storing continuous-valued variables in recurrent system states for indefinitely long time intervals. Unfortunately, continuous attractors suffer from severe structural instability in general--they are destroyed by most infinitesimal changes of the dynamical law that defines them. This fragility limits their utility especially in biological systems as their recurrent dynamics are subject to constant perturbations. We observe that the bifurcations from continuous attractors in theoretical neuroscience models display various structurally stable forms. Although their asymptotic behaviors to maintain memory are categorically distinct, their finite-time behaviors are similar. We build on the persistent manifold theory to explain the commonalities between bifurcations from and approximations of continuous attractors. Fast-slow decomposition analysis uncovers the persistent manifold that survives the seemingly destructive bifurcation. Moreover, recurrent neural networks trained on analog memory tasks display approximate continuous attractors with predicted slow manifold structures. Therefore, continuous attractors are functionally robust and remain useful as a universal analogy for understanding analog memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02406">Automated Placement of Analog Integrated Circuits using Priority-based Constructive Heuristic</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a heuristic approach for solving the placement of Analog and Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits. Placement is a crucial step in the physical design of integrated circuits. During this step, designers choose the position and variant of each circuit device. We focus on the specific class of analog placement, which requires so-called pockets, their possible merging, and parametrizable minimum distances between devices, which are features mostly omitted in recent research and literature. We formulate the problem using Integer Linear Programming and propose a priority-based constructive heuristic inspired by algorithms for the Facility Layout Problem. Our solution minimizes the perimeter of the circuit's bounding box and the approximated wire length. Multiple variants of the devices with different dimensions are considered. Furthermore, we model constraints crucial for the placement problem, such as symmetry groups and blockage areas. Our outlined improvements make the heuristic suitable to handle complex rules of placement. With a search guided either by a Genetic Algorithm or a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, we show the quality of the proposed method on both synthetically generated and real-life industrial instances accompanied by manually created designs. Furthermore, we apply reinforcement learning to control the hyper-parameters of the genetic algorithm. Synthetic instances with more than 200 devices demonstrate that our method can tackle problems more complex than typical industry examples. We also compare our method with results achieved by contemporary state-of-the-art methods on the MCNC dataset, showing that our method is competitive and/or surpasses previous results.

                arXiv:2411.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex engineering problems can be modelled as optimisation problems. For instance, optimising engines, materials, components, structure, aerodynamics, navigation, control, logistics, and planning is essential in aerospace. Metaheuristics are applied to solve these optimisation problems. The present paper presents a systematic study on applying metaheuristics in aerospace based on the literature. Relevant scientific repositories were consulted, and a structured methodology was used to filter the papers. Articles published until March 2022 associating metaheuristics and aerospace applications were selected. The most used algorithms and the most relevant hybridizations were identified. This work also analyses the main types of problems addressed in the aerospace context and which classes of algorithms are most used in each problem.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02842">Metaheuristics for the Template Design Problem: Encoding, Symmetry and Hybridisation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The template design problem (TDP) is a hard combinatorial problem with a high number of symmetries which makes solving it more complicated. A number of techniques have been proposed in the literature to optimise its resolution, ranging from complete methods to stochastic ones. However, although metaheuristics are considered efficient methods that can find enough-quality solutions at a reasonable computational cost, these techniques have not proven to be truly efficient enough to deal with this problem. This paper explores and analyses a wide range of metaheuristics to tackle the problem with the aim of assessing their suitability for finding template designs.
  We tackle the problem using a wide set of metaheuristics whose implementation is guided by a number of issues such as problem formulation, solution encoding, the symmetrical nature of the problem, and distinct forms of hybridisation. For the TDP, we also propose a slot-based alternative problem formulation (distinct to other slot-based proposals), which represents another option other than the classical variation-based formulation of the problem.
  An empirical analysis, assessing the performance of all the metaheuristics (i.e., basic, integrative and collaborative algorithms working on different search spaces and with/without symmetry breaking) shows that some of our proposals can be considered the state-of-the-art when they are applied to specific problem instances.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02791">Language Models and Cycle Consistency for Self-Reflective Machine Translation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for machine translation (MT). We start with one conjecture: an ideal translation should contain complete and accurate information for a strong enough LLM to recover the original sentence. We generate multiple translation candidates from a source language A to a target language B, and subsequently translate these candidates back to the original language A. By evaluating the cycle consistency between the original and back-translated sentences using metrics such as token-level precision and accuracy, we implicitly estimate the translation quality in language B, without knowing its ground-truth. This also helps to evaluate the LLM translation capability, only with monolingual corpora. For each source sentence, we identify the translation candidate with optimal cycle consistency with the original sentence as the final answer. Our experiments demonstrate that larger LLMs, or the same LLM with more forward passes during inference, exhibit increased cycle consistency, aligning with the LLM model size scaling law and test-time computation scaling law. This work provide methods for, 1) to implicitly evaluate translation quality of a sentence in the target language, 2), to evaluate capability of LLM for any-to-any-language translation, and 3), how to generate a better translation for a specific LLM.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03082">Self-supervised cross-modality learning for uncertainty-aware object detection and recognition in applications which lack pre-labelled training data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.03082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows how an uncertainty-aware, deep neural network can be trained to detect, recognise and localise objects in 2D RGB images, in applications lacking annotated train-ng datasets. We propose a self-supervising teacher-student pipeline, in which a relatively simple teacher classifier, trained with only a few labelled 2D thumbnails, automatically processes a larger body of unlabelled RGB-D data to teach a student network based on a modified YOLOv3 architecture. Firstly, 3D object detection with back projection is used to automatically extract and teach 2D detection and localisation information to the student network. Secondly, a weakly supervised 2D thumbnail classifier, with minimal training on a small number of hand-labelled images, is used to teach object category recognition. Thirdly, we use a Gaussian Process GP to encode and teach a robust uncertainty estimation functionality, so that the student can output confidence scores with each categorization. The resulting student significantly outperforms the same YOLO architecture trained directly on the same amount of labelled data. Our GP-based approach yields robust and meaningful uncertainty estimations for complex industrial object classifications. The end-to-end network is also capable of real-time processing, needed for robotics applications. Our method can be applied to many important industrial tasks, where labelled datasets are typically unavailable. In this paper, we demonstrate an example of detection, localisation, and object category recognition of nuclear mixed-waste materials in highly cluttered and unstructured scenes. This is critical for robotic sorting and handling of legacy nuclear waste, which poses complex environmental remediation challenges in many nuclearised nations.

Abstract: All machine learning algorithms use a loss, cost, utility or reward function to encode the learning objective and oversee the learning process. This function that supervises learning is a frequently unrecognized hyperparameter that determines how incorrect outputs are penalized and can be tuned to improve performance. This paper shows that training speed and final accuracy of neural networks can significantly depend on the loss function used to train neural networks. In particular derivative values can be significantly different with different loss functions leading to significantly different performance after gradient descent based Backpropagation (BP) training. This paper explores the effect on performance of using new loss functions that are also convex but penalize errors differently compared to the popular Cross-entropy loss. Two new classification loss functions that significantly improve performance on a wide variety of benchmark tasks are proposed. A new loss function call smooth absolute error that outperforms the Squared error, Huber and Log-Cosh losses on datasets with significantly many outliers is proposed. This smooth absolute error loss function is infinitely differentiable and more closely approximates the absolute error loss compared to the Huber and Log-Cosh losses used for robust regression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1325/v1?src=rss">Water quality evaluation by WQI and ICOs for the rivers of Joya de los Sachas and Francisco de Orellana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                A monitoring program enabled the evaluation of water quality and the simulation of the pollution dynamics of the rivers in the Joya de los Sachas and Francisco de Orellana cantons in Ecuador. For this assessment one used the WQI (water quality index) and the pollution indices ICOMO (organics contamination), ICOSUS (suspended solids), ICOMI (mineralization), ICOTRO (trophy system), and ICOpH (pH Index). The mathematical model operates with several input parameters, including dissolved oxygen, fecal coliforms, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), turbidity, total solids, total phosphorus, pH, total nitrogen, suspended solids, alkalinity, conductivity, temperature, and the concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, and phosphates. WQI values were obtained from ICO pollution indices. The pollution of the Sacha area is significant, WQI = 0.292, which represents an advanced degree of pollution, since increased BOD values correspond to a high load of organic pollutants. They can originate from household, agricultural, industrial, and soil erosion waste. Likewise, the Sacha River has an ICOSUS = 0.16, which renders water treatment difficult, without impacting human health. Calculated WQI values reveal that the water quality of the Sacha, Basura and Coca rivers is low, being highly contaminated. In contrast, the Huamayacu, Jivino Rojo, Jivino Negro, and Jivino Blanco rivers are commonly polluted.

                This study shows that ethnomedicine and ethnobotany have gained great relevance for their role in preserving ancestral knowledge about the use of medicinal plants. Despite the benefits, such as cultural preservation and biodiversity, new challenges arise, such as the lack of standardization and scientific validation, which limits their integration into modern medicine. Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications across different cultures, using the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. The searches were conducted in electronic databases, such as Scopus, EBSCO, and Web of Science, following PRISMA protocol guidelines and focusing on studies published between 2007 and 2024. Research gaps were identified, and questions were developed to better understand ethnomedicinal practices, their validation, and conservation. A total of seventy studies were selected, documenting a wide diversity of medicinal plants, with a significant focus on the conservation of traditional knowledge. However, critical gaps were identified in the scientific validation and integration of this knowledge into conservation policies. The results of the thematic analysis highlight the need for standardized protocols and a multidisciplinary approach to validate and preserve ethnomedicinal knowledge, ensuring its relevance in modern medicine and its transmission to future generations.

                Purpose To report the impact of front surface eccentricity (FSE) of scleral lenses (SCLs) on the visual performance of eyes exhibiting refractive surgery-induced higher-order aberrations (HOAs) Method A female teenager presented to the clinic with blurring of vision and dependency on spectacles even after undergoing Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE) in both eyes (BE). Her presenting uncorrected high contrast distance visual acuity (HCDVA) was 20/60 in the right eye (RE) and 20/40 in the left eye (LE). On examination, the cornea showed a ring-shaped area of ablation with faint scarring and a well-apposed lenticule-extraction site. Subjective refraction improved the HCDVA to 20/20p in RE and 20/25 in LE but the patient was not happy with the quality of vision. Ocular aberrometry revealed an increase in total HOAs as the underlying cause of unsatisfactory vision. Result A contact lens trial was recommended for BE to enhance visual quality. Rigid corneal lenses (RCLs) were tried, but the patient was intolerant to them. Large diameter SCLs of different FSEs (0, 0.6, and 0.8) were tried to reduce these aberrations. SCL with FSE 0 yielded the most favourable visual outcome, which was confirmed subjectively on ocular aberrometry. Conclusion With this case report, we hypothesize that the eccentricity of SCL can be selected according to the asphericity (at 6 mm) of the posterior corneal surface. This case also re-emphasizes the impact of SCL with varying FSEs on reducing HOAs and enhancing visual quality in eyes where conventional RCLs yield suboptimal results.

                Background of the study Child marriage is linked with multiple maternal and child health issues. However, there is insufficient information regarding the factors influencing child marriage among rural women. Objective To identify the determinants of child marriage among rural women of reproductive age women in the West Guji Zone, Southern Ethiopia, 2024. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 1 to May 5, 2024. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 711 participants. The SPSS version 25 was used for data analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to determine the determinants of child marriage. Adjusted odd ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to assess the strength of the associations, and statistical significance was declared at p < 0.05. Results The prevalence of child marriage was 49.6% (95% CI: 0.472-0.524). Being Muslim (AOR=2.104, 95% CI =1.176-3.764), nonformal fathers’ education (AOR=2.633, 95% CI=1.135-6.109), primary level of fathers’ education (AOR=3.326, 95% CI=1.421-7.787); not exposed to media (AOR=1.56, 95% CI=1.033-2.356); living with a relative (AOR=1.592, 95% CI=1.012-2.504); not knowing the legal age of marriage (AOR=2.528, 95% CI=1.593-4.010); marital decision making by girls (AOR=.666, 95% CI=.463-.959), and poor parental wealth status (AOR=4.464, 95% CI=2.795-7.129) were associated with child marriage. Conclusion Almost one in every two women married before 18 in the study area. The determinant factors include religion, fathers’ level of education, exposure to media, living arrangements; awareness of the legal marital age, marriage decision making, and parents’ wealth status. Thus, intervention efforts should focus on these factors to increase the marital age and improve women’s prospects.

                Background The Environmental Nutrition Program (ENP) as an environmental intervention offers voluntary involvement with students, but persists in exposure. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ENP on students’ dietary intake and nutritional knowledge. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a control school. ENP comprises four activities: the use of uniform food serving tools, nutrition fact displays, food and nutrition information displays, and body weighing awareness. The ENP emphasized voluntary involvement with students but persisted in exposure for over 8-weeks. Multiple passes of 24-hour food recall and validated questionnaires were used in the assessments by a nutritionist. Multiple linear regressions were performed to analyze the effectiveness of ENP. Results A total of 113 female high school students, with a median age of 16 years, were recruited. At baseline, all students had a lower dietary intake than the national recommendation. Except for the stipend, no differences in the characteristics were found among the students. The students’ carbohydrate intake and nutritional knowledge significantly increased after the ENP in the intervention school (p < 0.001). Total energy, protein, and fat intake also improved after ENP. Conclusion ENP activities effectively increased students’ daily carbohydrate intake and nutritional knowledge. Thus, ENP may be appropriate for enhancing nutrition literacy among female students. Future studies with a longer time frame are encouraged to yield sustained, favorable dietary practices.

                Background Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) has improved diagnosis and treatment planning in paediatric dentistry, but no bibliometric studies have examined the research landscape. This study provides an overview of CBCT in paediatric dentistry. Methods A bibliometric review was conducted using articles from the Web of Science database up to February 2024. Conference papers and editorials were excluded. Data extracted included citation counts, publication dates, journals, impact factors, study designs, topics, geographical and institutional affiliations, authors, and keywords. Collaborative networks were visualised using VOSviewer, and Spearman’s correlation assessed the relationship between citation counts and other variables. Results The review analysed 517 articles, with the most cited receiving 557 citations. Publication dates ranged from 2005 to 2024, with a peak in 2023. Observational studies were the most common, particularly on maxillary expansion. The American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics was the most cited journal, and the USA was a major contributor. Jacobs R authored the most articles (n=19), and the University of Alberta led in institutional output. Spearman’s correlation showed a weak positive correlation between citation count and journal impact factor (rho=0.272, p<0.001) and a strong negative correlation with publication year (rho=-0.762, p<0.001). Conclusions This bibliometric review provides an overview of the use of CBCT in paediatric dentistry, particularly in maxillary expansion. The findings suggest that more specific imaging protocols may improve safety and clinical outcomes, and that further investigation of long-term outcomes may provide valuable insights.

                The health sector in Bangladesh is thriving, and the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) program has been in place to investigate the causes of maternal and perinatal death. This study aimed to investigate the availability of information systems for measuring the status of an MPDSR program and the planning process and actions developed based on real-time information. This study delved into innovative information systems that can be used to monitor and measure the impact of health programs. The study included both the primary and secondary data. A total of six key informant interviews were conducted to explore the enablers and strengths of information systems. Secondary data were collected from government websites and MPDSR action plans. This study highlights the potential and challenges of governmental health information systems in notifying maternal and neonatal deaths. While the current notification rates are not up to national standards, it is encouraging to see health managers develop action plans and address this issue. The MPDSR information system is a valuable tool to help health managers measure changes in maternal and perinatal mortality rates and design locally targeted interventions. However, several obstacles must be addressed, such as insufficient data, lack of monitoring, and irregularities in MPDSR review meetings. By finding ways to overcome these challenges, we can unlock the full potential of MPDSR and improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The success of an MPDSR program relies on how the information is utilized to take action and measure the outcome. Advanced information systems, such as health dashboards, scorecards, and administrative data, can play a vital role in measuring the progress and impact of a program. The primary challenge lies in capturing all deaths, including their causes, and having the capacity to analyze the data effectively to develop action plans for health managers.

                Background The association between anemia and severity of infection as well as mortality rates among patients infected with COVID-19 has scarcely been studied. This is the first study from the UAE aimed to assess the influence of anemia on COVID-19 severity, ICU admission, and mortality rate. Methods A retrospective chart review of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was conducted in a large COVID-19 referral hospital in UAE. The study included adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data, severity of the disease, ICU admissions, and mortality rates were analyzed and correlated to the presence of anemia among the patients. Results A total of 3092 patients were included. 362 patients (11.7%) were anemic and most of the cases were between asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 (77.4%, n=2393). Among patients with anemia, 30.1% (n=109) had moderate to severe COVID-19. Statistically, anemia was associated significantly with a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcome compared to nonanemic patients (AOR:1.59, 95% CI:1.24-2.04, p<0.001). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was almost 3 times higher among anemic patients compared to nonanemic (AOR:2.83,95% CI:1.89-4.25, p<0.001). In addition, the overall mortality rate of 2.8% (n=87) was 2.5-fold higher in anemic than nonanemic patients (OR:2.56, CI: 1.49-4.06, p<0.001). Moreover, older age (≥48-year-old) and male gender were independent predictors for severe illness (Age: OR=1.26, CI:1.07-1.51, p=0.006; Gender: OR:1.43,CI:1.15-1.78, p<0.001)) and ICU admission (Age: OR:2.08, CI:1.47-2.94, p<0.001; Gender: OR: 1.83, CI:1.12-3.00, p=0.008) whereas only age ≥48 years old contributed to higher mortality rate (OR:1.60, CI:1.04-2.46, p=0.034). Conclusion Anemia was a major risk factor for severe COVID-19, ICU admission and mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Thus, healthcare providers should be aware of monitoring the hematological parameters among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and anemia to reduce the risk of disease complications and mortality. This association should also be considered in other infectious diseases.

                Background Effective clinical laboratories are the need of the hour, they play a significant role in healthcare, providing tests for diagnosis, treatment monitoring. Having skilled and adequate staffing is crucial for clinical laboratories to operate efficiently, manage their workload effectively, and deliver test results in a timely manner. Despite being critical for healthcare delivery, ensuring adequate staffing levels in clinical laboratories remains a complex challenge for healthcare providers worldwide due to resource constraints and workforce shortages. Methods This study evaluates the effectiveness of clinical laboratory staff utilization by considering workload, work pressure, and staffing requirements. We utilized the Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method to assess the staffing in the clinical laboratory of a tertiary care hospital. Annual hospital statistics were collected for two years from June 2021 to May 2023 to calculate the average number of days (234) worked annually, percentage of workload, distribution of activity time measurement units, and the ratio of needed, surplus, and existing staff. The findings aim to provide valuable insights for optimizing staffing levels and ensuring an efficient laboratory environment. Result The analysis found a significant workforce gap in the laboratory between the current staff numbers and the calculated staffing needs. The WISN ratios ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, indicating the existing 33 staff members face a high workload burden. The calculated ideal staffing level was 46.33 personnel. These results demonstrate staff shortage and excess workload pressure on the current laboratory employees. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of optimizing staffing levels in clinical laboratories to ensure quality service delivery. The WISN methodology can be a useful tool in healthcare facilities for making evidence -based decisions for staff allocation, maximizing the utilization of employee skill sets, and establishing standard staffing benchmarks tailored to the needs of clinical laboratories.

                Background One of the most common strabismus types in children is intermittent exotropia, which masks the deviation of one eye outward, mostly in children aged 2-4 years. It may affect visual development and often coexists with refractive mistakes. Unlike esotropia, which usually links to hyperopia, intermittent exotropia might have a different relationship with refractive errors and thus lead to myopia. Methods In this cross-sectional study from August 2021 to December 2023, 179 patients diagnosed with intermittent exotropia were recruited via an outpatient clinic of Najah Al-Quraishi, Baghdad, Iraq. The refractive errors were compared by autorefractometry and retinoscopy after cycloplegic dilation. Data analysis was constructed under the use of IBM SPSS V.26 for the determination of emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia prevalence. Results The most expected refractive error among the 179 patients was emmetropia, which occurred in 68 patients (38%). Low hyperopia and low myopia were also common, with 64 and 40, respectively. A limited number of patients had moderate/high myopia and moderate/high hyperopia; in detail, the prevalence was following: 5% of patients had moderate myopia, while 0.5% of patients suffered from high myopia; symmetrically, 5% were moderate to high hyperopia. From the data collected, a trend emerged for a low refractive error and symmetric refractive error in both eyes. Conclusion Contrasted to prior conventional wisdom about refractive error in strabismus, it established the greater incidence of emmetropia in patients with intermittent exotropia. The findings call for specific management strategies to be applied in this population.

Protein domain annotation is typically done by predictive models such as HMMs trained on sequence motifs. However, sequence-based annotation methods are prone to error, particularly in calling domain boundaries and motifs within them. These methods are limited by a lack of structural information accessible to the model. With the advent of deep learning-based protein structure prediction, existing sequenced-based domain annotation methods can be improved by taking into account the geometry of protein structures. We develop dimensionality reduction methods to annotate repeat units of the Leucine Rich Repeat solenoid domain. The methods are able to correct mistakes made by existing machine learning-based annotation tools and enable the automated detection of hairpin loops and structural anomalies in the solenoid. The methods are applied to 127 predicted structures of LRR-containing intracellular innate immune proteins in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and validated against a benchmark dataset of 172 manually-annotated LRR domains.

We conducted an international cross-sectional survey of biomedical researchers’ perspectives on the reproducibility of research. This study builds on a widely cited 2016 survey on reproducibility and provides a biomedical-specific and contemporary perspective on reproducibility. To sample the community, we randomly selected 400 journals indexed in MEDLINE, from which we extracted the author names and emails from all articles published between October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2021. We invited participants to complete an anonymous online survey which collected basic demographic information, perceptions about a reproducibility crisis, perceived causes of irreproducibility of research results, experience conducting reproducibility studies, and knowledge of funding and training for research on reproducibility. A total of 1,924 participants accessed our survey, of which 1,630 provided useable responses (response rate 7% of 23,234). Key findings include that 72% of participants agreed there was a reproducibility crisis in biomedicine, with 27% of participants indicating the crisis was “significant.” The leading perceived cause of irreproducibility was a “pressure to publish” with 62% of participants indicating it “always” or “very often” contributes. About half of the participants (54%) had run a replication of their own previously published study while slightly more (57%) had run a replication of another researcher’s study. Just 16% of participants indicated their institution had established procedures to enhance the reproducibility of biomedical research and 67% felt their institution valued new research over replication studies. Participants also reported few opportunities to obtain funding to attempt to reproduce a study and 83% perceived it would be harder to do so than to get funding to do a novel study. Our results may be used to guide training and interventions to improve research reproducibility and to monitor rates of reproducibility over time. The findings are also relevant to policy makers and academic leadership looking to create incentives and research cultures that support reproducibility and value research quality.

The CA1 region of the hippocampus is one of the most studied regions of the rodent brain, thought to play an important role in cognitive functions such as memory and spatial navigation. Despite a wealth of experimental data on its structure and function, it has been challenging to integrate information obtained from diverse experimental approaches. To address this challenge, we present a community-based, full-scale in silico model of the rat CA1 that integrates a broad range of experimental data, from synapse to network, including the reconstruction of its principal afferents, the Schaffer collaterals, and a model of the effects that acetylcholine has on the system. We tested and validated each model component and the final network model, and made input data, assumptions, and strategies explicit and transparent. The unique flexibility of the model allows scientists to potentially address a range of scientific questions. In this article, we describe the methods used to set up simulations to reproduce in vitro and in vivo experiments. Among several applications in the article, we focus on theta rhythm, a prominent hippocampal oscillation associated with various behavioral correlates and use our computer model to reproduce experimental findings. Finally, we make data, code, and model available through the hippocampushub.eu portal, which also provides an extensive set of analyses of the model and a user-friendly interface to facilitate adoption and usage. This community-based model represents a valuable tool for integrating diverse experimental data and provides a foundation for further research into the complex workings of the hippocampal CA1 region.

                <p>by Katelyn Del Toro, Rosalyn Sayaman, Kate Thi, Yamhilette Licon-Munoz, William Curtis Hines</p>

A fundamental question in biology, central to our understanding of cancer and other pathologies, is determining how different cell types coordinate to form and maintain tissues. Recognizing the distinct features and capabilities of the cells that compose these tissues is critical. Unfortunately, the complexity of tissues often hinders our ability to distinguish between neighboring cell types and, in turn, scrutinize their transcriptomes and generate reliable and tractable cell models for studying their inherently different biologies. We have recently introduced a novel method that permits the identification and purification of the 12 cell types that compose the human breast—nearly all of which could be reliably propagated in the laboratory. Here, we explore the nature of these cell types. We sequence mRNAs from each purified population and investigate transcriptional patterns that reveal their distinguishing features. We describe the differentially expressed genes and enriched biological pathways that capture the essence of each cell type, and we highlight transcripts that display intriguing expression patterns. These data, analytic tools, and transcriptional analyses form a rich resource whose exploration provides remarkable insights into the inner workings of the cell types composing the breast, thus furthering our understanding of the rules governing normal cell and tissue function.

                Background Human activity recognition (HAR) is increasingly important in enhancing healthcare systems by enabling accurate monitoring of individuals' movements through sensor data. This paper is motivated by the need to improve the accuracy of HAR, particularly for applications in e-health systems, where reliable activity detection can lead to better health outcomes. The study explores six prominent machine learning techniques—decision tree, random forest, linear regression, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks—to determine which methods can most effectively predict activities like walking, sitting, standing, laying, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Methods We employed these six machine learning algorithms to analyze a comprehensive dataset derived from various sensors. Each model was rigorously trained and evaluated to compare its effectiveness in recognizing human activities. The experiments aimed to identify strengths and weaknesses in each approach, with particular emphasis on advanced techniques such as random forest, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and gated recurrent networks (GRNs). Results The experimental evaluation revealed that the random forest classifier, CNN, GRN, and neural networks delivered promising results, achieving high accuracy levels. Notably, the neural network model excelled, attaining an impressive accuracy of 98%. In contrast, the Naïve Bayes model did not meet the performance expectations set by the other algorithms. Conclusions This research effectively classifies activities such as sitting, standing, laying, walking, walking downstairs, and walking upstairs, underscoring the potential of machine learning in HAR. The findings highlight the superior performance of neural networks in enhancing activity recognition, which could lead to advanced applications in e-health systems and improve overall healthcare monitoring strategies.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Motor circuits in the vertebrate hindbrain need to become functional early in development. What are the fundamental mechanisms that establish early synaptic inputs to motor neurons? Previous evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that motor neuron dendrite positioning serves a causal role in early spinal motor circuit development, with initial connectivity determined by the overlap between premotor axons and motor neuron dendrites (perhaps without the need for molecular recognition). Does motor neuron dendrite topography serve a similar role in the hindbrain? In the current study, we provide the first quantitative analysis of the dendrites of facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) in larval zebrafish. We previously demonstrated that FBMNs exhibit functional topography along the dorsoventral axis, with the most ventral cell bodies most likely to exhibit early rhythmic activity—suggesting that FBMNs with ventral cell bodies are most likely to receive inputs from premotor neurons carrying rhythmic respiratory signals. We hypothesized that this functional topography can be explained by differences in dendrite positioning, giving ventral FBMNs preferential access to premotor axons carrying rhythmic signals. If this hypothesis is true, we predicted that FBMN cell body position would be correlated with dendrite position along the dorsoventral axis. To test this prediction, we used single-cell labeling to trace the dendritic arbors of FBMNs in larval zebrafish at 5-days post-fertilization (dpf). FBMN dendrites varied in complexity, and this variation could not be attributed to differences in the relative age of neurons. Most dendrites grew caudally, laterally, and ventrally from the cell body—though FBMN dendrites could extend their dendrites dorsally. Across our sample, FBMN cell body position correlated with dendrite position along the dorsoventral axis, consistent with our hypothesis that differences in dendrite positioning serve as the substrate for differences in activity patterns across neurons. Future studies will build on this foundational data, testing additional predictions of the central hypothesis—to further investigate the mechanisms of early motor circuit development.</p>

                The authors show that activation of prelimbic (PL) cortex inputs leads to depolarization block in a subset of anterior paraventricular thalamic (aPVT) neurons. Inhibitory inputs from the anteroventral thalamic reticular nucleus (avTRN) restore aPVT firing rates and shift the top-down effects of PL inputs on aPVT activity and motivated behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92860">Natural forgetting reversibly modulates engram expression</a></h4>

              
                Memories are stored as ensembles of engram neurons and their successful recall involves the reactivation of these cellular networks. However, significant gaps remain in connecting these cell ensembles with the process of forgetting. Here, we utilized a mouse model of object memory and investigated the conditions in which a memory could be preserved, retrieved, or forgotten. Direct modulation of engram activity via optogenetic stimulation or inhibition either facilitated or prevented the recall of an object memory. In addition, through behavioral and pharmacological interventions, we successfully prevented or accelerated forgetting of an object memory. Finally, we showed that these results can be explained by a computational model in which engrams that are subjectively less relevant for adaptive behavior are more likely to be forgotten. Together, these findings suggest that forgetting may be an adaptive form of engram plasticity which allows engrams to switch from an accessible state to an inaccessible state.

                Pathogenic variants in subunits of RNA polymerase (Pol) III cause a spectrum of <i>Polr3</i>-related neurodegenerative diseases including 4H leukodystrophy. Disease onset occurs from infancy to early adulthood and is associated with a variable range and severity of neurological and non-neurological features. The molecular basis of <i>Polr3</i>-related disease pathogenesis is unknown. We developed a postnatal whole-body mouse model expressing pathogenic <i>Polr3a</i> mutations to examine the molecular mechanisms by which reduced Pol III transcription results primarily in central nervous system phenotypes. <i>Polr3a</i> mutant mice exhibit behavioral deficits, cerebral pathology and exocrine pancreatic atrophy. Transcriptome and immunohistochemistry analyses of cerebra during disease progression show a reduction in most Pol III transcripts, induction of innate immune and integrated stress responses and cell-type-specific gene expression changes reflecting neuron and oligodendrocyte loss and microglial activation. Earlier in the disease when integrated stress and innate immune responses are minimally induced, mature tRNA sequencing revealed a global reduction in tRNA levels and an altered tRNA profile but no changes in other Pol III transcripts. Thus, changes in the size and/or composition of the tRNA pool have a causal role in disease initiation. Our findings reveal different tissue- and brain region-specific sensitivities to a defect in Pol III transcription.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98489">The recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machine captures neural assembly dynamics in whole-brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Animal behaviour alternates between stochastic exploration and goal-directed actions, which are generated by the underlying neural dynamics. Previously, we demonstrated that the compositional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (cRBM) can decompose whole-brain activity of larval zebrafish data at the neural level into a small number (∼100-200) of assemblies that can account for the stochasticity of the neural activity (van der Plas et al., eLife, 2023). Here, we advance this representation by extending to a combined stochastic-dynamical representation to account for both aspects using the recurrent temporal RBM (RTRBM) and transfer-learning based on the cRBM estimate. We demonstrate that the functional advantage of the RTRBM is captured in the temporal weights on the hidden units, representing neural assemblies, for both simulated and experimental data. Our results show that the temporal expansion outperforms the stochastic-only cRBM in terms of generalization error and achieves a more accurate representation of the moments in time. Lastly, we demonstrate that we can identify the original time-scale of assembly dynamics by estimating multiple RTRBMs at different temporal resolutions. Together, we propose that RTRBMs are a valuable tool for capturing the combined stochastic and time-predictive dynamics of large-scale data sets.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94743">SntB triggers the antioxidant pathways to regulate development and aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus flavus</a></h4>

              
                The epigenetic reader SntB was identified as an important transcriptional regulator of growth, development, and secondary metabolite synthesis in <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. In this study, by gene deletion and complementation, we found SntB is essential for mycelia growth, conidial production, sclerotia formation, aflatoxin synthesis, and host colonization. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that SntB played key roles in oxidative stress response of <i>A. flavus</i>, influencing related gene activity, especially <i>catC</i> encoding catalase. SntB regulated the expression activity of <i>catC</i> with or without oxidative stress, and was related to the expression level of the secretory lipase (G4B84_008359). The deletion of <i>catC</i> showed that CatC participated in the regulation of fungal morphogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and aflatoxin production, and that CatC significantly regulated fungal sensitive reaction and AFB1 yield under oxidative stress. Our study revealed the potential machinery that SntB regulated fungal morphogenesis, mycotoxin anabolism, and fungal virulence through the axle of from H3K36me3 modification to fungal virulence and mycotoxin biosynthesis. The results of this study shed light into the SntB-mediated transcript regulation pathways of fungal mycotoxin anabolism and virulence, which provided potential strategy to control the contamination of <i>A. flavus</i> and its aflatoxins.

                Computation in neural circuits relies on the judicious use of nonlinear circuit components. In many cases, multiple nonlinear components work collectively to control circuit outputs. Separating the contributions of these different components is difficult, and this limits our understanding of the mechanistic basis of many important computations. Here, we introduce a tool that permits the design of light stimuli that predictably alter rod and cone phototransduction currents – including stimuli that compensate for nonlinear properties such as light adaptation. This tool, based on well-established models for the rod and cone phototransduction cascade, permits the separation of nonlinearities in phototransduction from those in downstream circuits. This will allow, for example, direct tests of how adaptation in rod and cone phototransduction affects downstream visual signals and perception.

">Contactin-1 is a critical neuronal cell surface receptor for perineuronal net structure</a></h4>

              
                Perineuronal nets (PNNs), are neuron-specific substructures within the neural extracellular matrix (ECM). These reticular structures form on a very small subset of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and yet have a profound impact in regulating neuronal development and physiology. PNNs are well-established as key regulators of plasticity in the CNS. Their appearance coincides with the developmental transition of the brain more to less plastic state. And, importantly, numerous studies have demonstrated that indeed PNNs play a primary role in regulating this transition. There is, however, a growing literature implicating PNNs in numerous roles in neural physiology beyond their role in regulating developmental plasticity. Accordingly, numerous studies have shown PNNs are altered in a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, linking them to these conditions. Despite the growing interest in PNNs, the mechanisms by which they modulate neural functions are poorly understood. We believe the limited mechanistic understanding of PNNs is derived from the fact that there are limited models, tools or techniques that specifically target PNNs in a cell-autonomous manner and without also disrupting the surrounding neural ECM. These limitations are primarily due to our incomplete understanding of PNN composition and structure. In particular, there is little understanding of the neuronal cell surface receptors that nucleate these structures on subset of neurons on which they form in the CNS. Therefore, the main focus our work is to identify the neuronal cell surface proteins critical for PNN formation and structure. In our previous studies we demonstrated PNN components are immobilized on the neuronal surface by two distinct mechanisms, one dependent on the hyaluronan backbone of PNNs and the other mediated by a complex formed by receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta (RPTP{zeta}) and tenascin-R (Tnr). Here we first demonstrate that the Tnr-RPTP{zeta} complex in PNNs is bound to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked receptor protein. Using a biochemical and structural approach we demonstrate the GPI-linked protein critical for binding the Tnr-RPTP{zeta} complex in PNNs is contactin-1 (Cntn1). We further show the binding of this complex in PNNs by Cntn1 is critical for PNN structure. We believe identification of CNTN1 as a key cell-surface protein for PNN structure is a very significant step forward in our understanding of PNN formation and structure and will offer new strategies and targets to manipulate PNNs and better understand their function.

">Chemogenetic manipulation of the ventral pallidum-nucleus accumbens shell pathway modulates sucrose consumption independent of motivation in female rats.</a></h4>

              
                Here we investigated the role of the ventral pallidum (VP) to nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) pathway in mediating sucrose consumption and motivation for food in female rats. Using chemogenetic techniques, excitatory and inhibitory designer receptors were expressed in VP neurons projecting to the AcbSh. Behavioral assays assessed both lever pressing under a progressive ratio schedule and free sucrose consumption following activation or inhibition of this pathway. Results showed that inhibition of VP-AcbSh projections increased sucrose intake, while excitation reduced it, without affecting motivation to work for food. These findings indicate a specific influence of the VP-AcbSh pathway on sucrose consumption independent of food-seeking motivation. The study highlights the importance of differentiating VP efferents in understanding distinct roles in feeding behaviors and suggests that the VP-AcbSh pathway modulates consumption based on food type and potentially other variables.

">Sufficiency of ITD for (biased) human auditory azimuthal perception</a></h4>

              
                Experiments on human auditory perception have shown that interaural time difference (ITD) is sufficient to generate spatial percepts, even though stimuli containing only the ITD cue are perceived as being emitted from inside the head instead of from external locations at specific azimuths. These experiments are thus interpreted as "lateralization" instead of "localization" tasks. In fact, lateralized spatial perception has been quantified using tasks in which participants have to report their estimates by selecting a putative location inside the head, or matching the perceived position to sounds with a given interaural level difference. Therefore, these estimates are made with respect to internal frames of reference, but it is unclear whether these percepts have any significance for the more ecological problem of locating an external sound source. In order to investigate the link between internalized spatial percepts and sound localization, we designed a new task in which subjects are instructed to report externalized azimuthal location for sounds containing only ITD cues. Despite the mismatch between an internalized percept having to be reported as emanating from an external location, subjects were able to estimate azimuths consistently. Furthermore, normalized estimates were indistinguishable from those obtained using traditional lateralization tasks. Our results revealed a direct relationship between perceived azimuths and ITD, which deviates from that obtained from acoustical analysis of binaural recordings, revealing estimation biases. Intriguingly, these results indicate that externalized percepts are not required for the generation of azimuthal percepts.

">In vivo cell-type and brain region classification via multimodal contrastive learning</a></h4>

              
                Current electrophysiological approaches can track the activity of many neurons, yet it is usually unknown which cell-types or brain areas are being recorded without further molecular or histological analysis. Developing accurate and scalable algorithms for identifying the cell-type and brain region of recorded neurons is thus crucial for improving our understanding of neural computation. In this work, we develop a multimodal contrastive learning approach for neural data that can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks, including inference of cell-type and brain location. We utilize this approach to jointly embed the activity autocorrelations and extracellular waveforms of individual neurons. We demonstrate that our embedding approach, Neuronal Embeddings via MultimOdal contrastive learning (NEMO), paired with supervised fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art cell-type classification for an opto-tagged visual cortex dataset and brain region classification for the public International Brain Laboratory brain-wide map dataset. Our method represents a promising step towards accurate cell-type and brain region classification from electrophysiological recordings.

">Unraveling eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs): how saccade direction and middle ear properties shape amplitude and time course</a></h4>

              
                Eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs) reflect movements of the tympanic membrane that are known to scale with the magnitude and direction of saccades. While EMREOs have been consistently described in humans and non-human primates, many questions regarding this phenomenon remain open. Based on bilateral in-ear recordings in human participants we here probe a number of their properties that improve our understanding of the EMREOs' origin and functional significance. We show that the time courses are comparable between the left and right ears, and between paradigms guiding saccades by visual and auditory targets. However, the precise time course and amplitude differ significantly between ipsi- and contralateral saccades beyond the previously known phase-inversion described for saccades in opposing directions. Finally, we show that the EMREO amplitude is negatively related to the compliance of the tympanic membrane. These results altogether raise potential challenges for the interpretation of EMREOs in the light of a coordinate-alignment between vision and hearing. Furthermore, they support the notion that EMREOs largely reflect motor-related top-down signals that are relayed to the middle ear muscles in a differential principle similar as governing the execution of ipsi- and contralateral saccades.

">Presaccadic attentional shifts are not modulated by saccade amplitude</a></h4>

              
                Humans constantly explore the visual environment through saccades, bringing relevant visual stimuli to the center of the gaze. Before the eyes begin to move, visual attention is directed to the intended saccade target. As a consequence of this presaccadic shift of attention (PSA), visual perception is enhanced at the future gaze position. PSA has been investigated in a variety of saccade amplitudes, from microsaccades to locations that exceed the oculomotor range. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that PSA effects on visual perception are not equally distributed around the visual field. However, it remains unknown whether the magnitude of presaccadic perceptual enhancement varies with the amplitude of the saccades. Here, we measured contrast sensitivity thresholds during saccade planning in a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) discrimination task in human observers. Filtered pink noise (1/f) patches, presented at four eccentricities scaled in size according to the cortical magnification factor were used as visual targets. This method was adopted to mitigate well-known eccentricity effects on perception, thereby enabling us to explore the effects associated to saccade amplitudes. First, our results show that saccade preparation enhanced contrast sensitivity in all tested locations. Importantly, we found that this presaccadic perceptual enhancement was not modulated by the amplitude of the saccades. These findings suggest that presaccadic attention operates consistently across different saccade amplitudes, enhancing visual processing at intended gaze positions regardless of saccade size.

">Efficient laminar-distributed interactions and orientation selectivity in the mouse V1 cortical column</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of orientation selectivity in the visual cortex is a well-known phenomenon in neuroscience, but the details of such emergence and the role of different cortical layers and cell types, particularly in rodents which lack a topographical organization of orientation-selectivity (OS) properties, are less clear. To tackle this question, we use an existing biologically detailed model of the mouse V1 cortical column, which is constrained by existing connectivity data across cortical layers and between pyramidal, PV, SST and VIP cell types. Using this model as a basis, we implemented activity-dependent structural plasticity induced by stimulation with orientated drifting gratings, leading to a good match of tuning properties of pyramidal cells with experimentally observed OS laminar distribution, their evoked firing rate and tuning width. We then employed a mean-field model to uncover the role of co-tuned subnetworks in laminar signal propagation and explain the effects of intra- and inter- laminar coupling distributions. Our plasticity-induced modified model and mean-field model were able to explain both the excitatory enhancement through co-tuned subnetworks and inter-laminar disynaptic inhibition. Overall, our work highlights the importance of the clustering of neural selectivity features for effective excitatory transmission in cortical circuits.

">Inhibition of β-catenin signaling by Amyloid-β in endothelial cells impairs vascular barrier integrity</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is emerging as a critical mediator of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression and precedes the formation of large Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques in AD patients. Maintenance of the blood brain barrier integrity by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) is essential for brain homeostasis and is in part maintained by WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling. We hypothesized that A{beta} induces blood-brain barrier dysfunction by inhibiting WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling in brain endothelial cells, leading to reduced expression of BBB-related genes and barrier function. In brain endothelial cells, we found that A{beta} directly decreased {beta}-catenin transcriptional activity, but also inhibited activation of {beta}-catenin by the WNT3A peptide. Additionally, A{beta} reduced barrier integrity of ECs, which was in part restored by exposure to exogenous WNT3A. We observed A{beta}-induced inhibition within 3 hours of exposure. A{beta}-induced inhibition of {beta}-catenin signaling was consistent across both immortalized brain ECs and ECs differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells(iPSCs). We next investigated human iPSCs with and without the N141I mutation in presenilin-2 (PSEN2), known to increase A{beta} buildup and familial AD risk. We found the AD ECs showed smaller cell size and expressed lower VE-cadherin at the protein level. RNA sequencing revealed that the presence of PSEN2 N141I did not significantly impact gene expression of genes coding for proteins canonically involved in barrier integrity but did show differences in the expression of transposable elements. These results indicate that BBB dysfunction early in AD may be the result of A{beta} in the brain impairing WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling which maintains the barrier integrity of brain endothelial cells.

                The claustro-insular region is an evolutionarily conserved and extensively interconnected brain area, critical for functions such as attention, cognitive flexibility, interoception, and affective processing. Despite its importance, its cellular composition and organization remain poorly characterized, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying its diverse functions. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we created a high-resolution atlas of this region in mice, uncovering distinct neuronal subtypes and unexpected complexity. Leveraging this atlas, we investigated the role of NR4A2, a neuropsychiatric risk factor expressed in several claustro-insular neuronal subtypes. In an Nr4a2 haploinsufficiency model, we found that only claustrum neurons exhibited shifts in molecular identity. This identity shift, which involved the activation of a transcription factor cascade, was associated with alterations in neuronal firing activity. Our findings provide new insights into the cellular architecture of the claustro-insular region and highlights Nr4a2 as a master regulator of its component's identities.

                Structural covariance in brain anatomy is thought to reflect inter-regional sharing of developmental influences - although this hypothesis has proved hard to causally test. Here, we use neuroimaging in humans and mice to study sex-differences in anatomical covariance - asking if regions that have developed shared sex differences in volume across species also show shared sex difference in volume covariance. The study design illuminates both the biology of sex-differences and theoretical models for anatomical covariance -- benefitting from tests of inter-species convergence. We find that volumetric structural covariance is stronger in adult females compared to adult males for both wild-type mice and healthy human subjects: 98% of all comparisons with statistically significant covariance sex differences in mice are female-biased, while 76% of all such comparisons are female-biased in humans (q < 0.05). In both species, a region's covariance and volumetric sex-biases have weak inverse relationships to each other: volumetrically male-biased regions contain more female-biased covariation, while volumetrically female-biased regions have more male-biased covariation (mice: r = -0.185, p = 0.002; humans: r = -0.189, p = 0.001). Our results identify a conserved tendency for females to show stronger neuroanatomical covariance than males, evident across species, which suggests that stronger structural covariance in females could be an evolutionarily conserved feature that is partially related to volumetric alterations through sex.

">DNA replication fork speed Acts as an Engine in Cortical Neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                DNA fork speed, the rate of replication fork progression, has emerged as a cellular plasticity regulator, however, for its role in neurogenesis has never been explored before. Here, we show that fork speed was increased as neural progenitors-radial glial cells (RGCs) transition from symmetric to asymmetric divisions. After selectively deleting mini-chromosome maintenance complex (MCMs)-binding protein (MCMBP), fork speed was increased in RGCs, resulted in widespread apoptosis, DNA damage and micronuclei at later stage of neurogenesis, which triggered p53 activation and led to microcephaly. Further, co-deletion of Trp53 with Mcmbp largely rescued brain phenotype, however, fork speed became faster, unexpectedly resulting in massive RGCs detachment from their resident place. Mechanistically, MCM3 can interact with p53 mediating centrosome biogenesis to anchor RGCs during DNA replication. Finally, behavior analysis indicated that fast fork speed led to an anxiety-like behavior in mice. Altogether, our results illuminate an unrecognized role about DNA fork speed in corticogenesis.

">Selective Enhancement of the Interneuron Network and Gamma-Band Power via GluN2C/GluN2D NMDA Receptor Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) comprise a family of ligand-gated ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate a slow, calcium-permeable component to excitatory neurotransmission. The GluN2D subunit is enriched in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in cortical tissue. Diminished levels of GABAergic inhibition contribute to multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, suggesting that enhancing inhibition may have therapeutic utility, thus making GluN2D modulation an attractive drug target. Here, we describe the actions of a GluN2C/GluN2D-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM), (+)-EU1180-453, which has improved drug-like properties such as increased aqueous solubility compared to the first-in-class GluN2C/GluN2D-selective prototypical PAM (+)-CIQ. (+)-EU1180-453 doubles the NMDAR response at lower concentrations (< 10 uM) compared to (+)-CIQ, and produces a greater degree of maximal potentiation at 30 uM. Using in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we show that (+)-EU1180-453 potentiates triheteromeric NMDARs containing at least one GluN2C or GluN2D subunit, and is active at both exon5-lacking and exon5-containing GluN1 splice variants. (+)-EU1180-453 increases glutamate efficacy for GluN2C/GluN2D-containing NMDARs by both prolonging the deactivation time and potentiating the peak response amplitude. We show that (+)-EU1180-453 selectively increases synaptic NMDAR-mediated charge transfer onto P11-15 CA1 stratum radiatum hippocampal interneurons, but is without effect on CA1 pyramidal cells. This increased charge transfer enhances inhibitory output from GABAergic interneurons onto CA1 pyramidal cells in a GluN2D-dependent manner. (+)-EU1180-453 also shifts excitatory-to-inhibitory coupling towards increased inhibition and produces enhanced gamma band power from carbachol-induced field potential oscillations in hippocampal slices. Thus, (+)-EU1180-453 can enhance overall circuit inhibition, which could prove therapeutically useful for the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and other neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Mitochondrial dysfunction Impairs the Nuclear Pore Complex in Parkinson's Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The mislocalization of transcription factors and irregularities in the nuclear envelope of dopaminergic neurons affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) implicates the nuclear pore in disease pathogenesis. While mitochondrial dysfunction is an integral component of PD pathophysiology, the involvement of channel-forming nucleoporins (Nups) in mitochondrial dysfunction-related neurodegeneration has not been investigated. Here we have identified pathological changes in the levels and distribution of a set of Nups, which are key structural and functional components of the nuclear pore complex, in dopaminergic neuronal models of PD. We observed that mitochondrial dysfunction reduces the expression of these Nups and disrupts the localization of Ran GTPase in both in vitro and in vivo dopaminergic neuron models. Furthermore, the nuclear pore central channel component, Nup62, mislocalizes and accumulates in the cytoplasm of these neurons under mitochondrial stress conditions. Mitochondrial stress also interferes with classical nuclear export of proteins in dopaminergic neural cells. Notably, we observed Nup pathology and Ran gradient loss in nigral dopaminergic neurons of PD patient brains, which highlights the clinical relevance of nuclear pore dysfunction as a disease mechanism. These findings provide direct evidence of the critical role of Nup-related abnormalities in mitochondrial dysfunction-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, ultimately connecting nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport dysregulation to cell death in the development of PD.

">Oral Boldine Administration Attenuates Glia Activation and Prevents Neuropathic Pain in a Murine Spared Nerve Injury Model</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is present in about 20% of the population and is a major burden to the health care system. About 30-40% of these patients report neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by injury or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. Current available treatments for neuropathic pain have limited efficacy and substantial side effects. To address the need for more effective and safer treatments for neuropathic pain, this study aimed to test whether boldine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, could attenuate neuropathic pain in a murine model of spared nerve injury (SNI). We found that oral administration of boldine at 50 mg/kg body weight/day resulted in significant reduction of SNI-induced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity. Boldine also corrected SNI-induced weight bearing deficits, which are an indication of spontaneous pain. Boldine significantly inhibited SNI-induced peripheral inflammation as indicated by reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the serum. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that boldine reduced the number of reactive astrocytes and inhibited microglia activation in the dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord. Boldine also reduced the mRNA level of pro-inflammatory markers including IL-1{beta} and TNF- in the lumbar spinal cord after SNI. Quantitative PCR showed that boldine inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced overexpression of inflammatory markers in primary mouse astrocytes and in BV-2 microglial cells. Our findings suggest that boldine may be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neuropathic pain, possibly through inhibition of glia activation and neuroinflammation.

">Flexible 3D kirigami probes for in vitro and in vivo neural applications</a></h4>

              
                Three-dimensional (3D) microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are gaining popularity as brain-machine interfaces and platforms for studying electrophysiological activity. Interactions with neural tissue depend on the electrochemical, mechanical, and spatial features of the recording platform. While planar or protruding two-dimensional MEAs are limited in their ability to capture neural activity across layers, existing 3D platforms still require advancements in manufacturing scalability, spatial resolution, and tissue integration. In this work, we present a customizable, scalable, and straightforward approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami MEAs containing both surface and penetrating electrodes, designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue. These novel probes feature up to 512 electrodes distributed across 128 shanks in a single flexible device, with shank heights reaching up to 1 mm. We successfully deployed our 3D kirigami MEAs in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns. Flexible 3D kirigami MEAs are therefore a powerful tool for large-scale electrical sampling of complex neural tissues while improving tissue integration and offering enhanced capabilities for analyzing neural disorders and disease models where high spatial resolution is required.

">Molecular impact of nicotine and smoking exposure on the developing and adult mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) is associated with significant cognitive and behavioral effects on offspring. While neurodevelopmental outcomes have been studied for prenatal exposure to nicotine, the main psychoactive component of cigarette smoke, its contribution to MSDP effects has never been explored. Comparing the effects of these substances on molecular signaling in the prenatal and adult brain may provide insights into nicotinic and broader tobacco consequences that are developmental-stage specific or age-independent. Pregnant mice were administered nicotine or exposed to chronic cigarette smoke, and RNA-sequencing was performed on frontal cortices of postnatal day 0 pups born to these mice, as well as on frontal cortices and blood of the adult dams. We identified 1,010 and 4,165 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nicotine and smoking-exposed pup brains, respectively (FDR<0.05, Ns = 19 nicotine-exposed vs 23 vehicle-exposed; 46 smoking-exposed vs 49 controls). Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) alone was related to dopaminergic synapses and long-term synaptic depression, whereas MSDP was associated with the SNARE complex and vesicle transport. Both substances affected SMN-Sm protein complexes and postsynaptic endosomes. Analyses at the transcript, exon, and exon-exon junction levels supported gene level results and revealed additional smoking-affected processes. No DEGs at FDR<0.05 were found in adult mouse brain for any substance (12 nicotine-administered vs 11 vehicle-administered; 12 smoking-exposed vs 12 controls), nor in adult blood (12 smoking-exposed vs 12 controls), and only 3% and 6.41% of the DEGs in smoking-exposed pup brain replicated in smoking-exposed blood and human prenatal brain, respectively. Together, these results demonstrate variable but overlapping molecular effects of PNE and MSDP on the developing brain, and attenuated effects of both smoking and nicotine on adult versus fetal brain.

">Effects of HA1 (a Probucol Analogue) and ApoC3 siRNA on Lipoprotein-Amyloid Metabolism, Neurovascular Integrity and Cognitive Function in db/db Mice</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background and aims Chronically elevated levels of circulating lipoprotein-amyloid-beta (Abeta) are implicated in the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the initiation of a neurodegenerative cascade leading to Alzheimers disease (AD). Type 2 diabetes is associated with BBB dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, and an increased risk of AD. However, alterations in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL)-Abeta homeostasis and its downstream effects on the BBB in a diabetes context remain explored. This study aimed to 1) investigate, in a preclinical model of diabetes, the hypothesis that diabetes-induced impairments in TRL-Abeta metabolism might compromise BBB integrity and exacerbate cognitive function and behavioural changes, and 2) assess the efficacy of interventions that improve TRL catabolism, including probucol, HA1, and ApoC3 siRNA, to prevent disease progression by lowering circulating TRL-Abeta levels. Methods Five-week-old db/db mice underwent a 9- or 23-weeks dietary interventions with probucol, a probucol prodrug HA1, or a standard diet with four-weekly injections of ApoC3 siRNA. Db/+ mice served as negative controls for each treatment duration. Blood levels of Abeta and ApoB were measured using ELISA. Immunofluorescence imaging was used to quantify enterocytic levels of Abeta and ApoB, and assess changes in neurovascular integrity (IgG, PDGFRbeta, ZO1, occludin), neuroinflammation (GFAP, Iba1), and cerebral oxidative stress (8OHdG). Results Our results indicate that diabetes increased the abundance of plasma amyloid, specifically Abeta42, which correlated with enterocytic abundance, suggesting exaggerated postprandial excretion. Disrupted plasma amyloid homeostasis was associated with BBB breakdown, including diminished barrier function, and the loss of pericytes and astrocytes. Provision of the probucol analogue, HA1, normalised plasma and enterocytic amyloidemia concomitant with the preservation of the neurovascular junction. Treatment with ApoC3 siRNA attenuated plasma Abeta42 and modestly reduced neurovascular inflammation. Conclusion The findings further support the hypothesis that aberrant peripheral metabolism of lipoprotein-Abeta is associated with microvascular corruption and the development of anxiety-like behaviour. HA1 is more effective than probucol or ApoC3 siRNA in positively modulating lipoprotein-amyloid homeostasis in db/db mice and maintaining central capillary integrity.

">Microglia modulate cerebral blood flow and neurovascular coupling through ectonucleotidase CD39</a></h4>

              
                Microglia and the border-associated macrophages (BAMs) contribute to the modulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), but the mechanisms have remained ill-defined. Here, we show that microglia regulate the CBF baseline and upsurges after whisker stimulation or intracisternal magna injection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Genetic or pharmacological depletion of microglia reduces the activity-dependent hyperemia but not the cerebrovascular responses to adenosine stimulation. Notably, microglia repopulation corrects these CBF reactivity deficits. The microglial-dependent regulation of CBF requires the ATP-sensing P2ry12 receptor and the ectonucleotidase CD39 that initiates the breakdown of extracellular ATP. Pharmacological inhibition or microglia-specific deletion of CD39 simulates the CBF anomalies detected in microglia-deficient mice and reduces the rise of extracellular adenosine after whisker stimulation. Together, these results suggest that the microglial CD39-initiated conversion of extracellular ATP to adenosine is an important step in neurovascular coupling and the regulation of cerebrovascular reactivity.

                Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and secondary motor cortex (M2) are both implicated in flexible reward learning but the conditions that differentially recruit these regions are not fully understood. We imaged calcium activity from single neurons in OFC or M2 during de novo learning of uncertain reward probability schedules. After controlling for experience, predictions of choice were decoded from M2 neurons with similar accuracy under all certainty conditions, but were more accurately decoded from OFC neurons under greater uncertainty. In M2, the proportion of outcome selective neurons decreased with uncertainty whereas this proportion remained stable in OFC, due to an increased recruitment of reward-selective neurons across levels of uncertainty. Decoding accuracy of both choice and outcome were positively correlated with indices of flexible strategy use in OFC, but not M2. Our results indicate that OFC neurons preferentially encode choices and outcomes under conditions of uncertainty that foster greater reliance on adaptive strategies.

                A neuroanatomical minimal network model was revisited to elucidate the mechanism of salt concentration memory-dependent chemotaxis observed in Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans memorizes the salt concentration during cultivation, manifesting a pronounced taste preference for this concentration. The right-side head sensory neuron, designated ASER, exhibits a response to a decrease in salt concentration. The basal level of glutamate transmission from ASER has been demonstrated to transiently increase and decrease when the current environmental salt concentrations are lower and higher, respectively, than that during previous cultivation. Given the sensitivity of excitatory/inhibitory glutamate receptors expressed on the postsynaptic AIY interneurons, it can be anticipated that the ASER-AIY synaptic transmission will undergo a reversal due to alterations in the basal glutamate release. The neural network model, derived with the hypothesis, reproduced the salt concentration memory-dependent preference behavior and revealed the modular neural circuit function downstream of ASE that is responsible for salt klinotaxis.

                Increased neural activity characterizes early Alzheimers disease (AD), serving as a prognostic indicator for disease progression and cognitive decline. Mechanisms that drive this hyperactivity and their behavioral effects remain mostly unrevealed, although normalizing altered excitability levels has been shown to reverse cognitive impairment in early AD, both in animals and humans. Soluble amyloid-{beta} oligomers (oA{beta}) primary accumulate in limbic regions like hippocampus and induce neuronal hyperexcitability and subsequent cognitive deficits by impairing ion channel s function. Indeed, G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels -that control neuronal excitability- are greatly affected and their selective pharmacological activation has already been shown very effective to counteract oA{beta}-induced hyperexcitability and hippocampal dysfunction. However, GIRK gain-of-function in healthy animals disrupts learning, memory and underlying synaptic plasticity, greatly limiting its therapeutic potential in preclinical asymptomatic early AD patients. Therefore, GIRK-based pharmacological treatment needs further investigation to overcome these limitations. Here we tested two doses of a novel, more potent, and neuronal selective GIRK activator, VU0810464, in healthy and early oAB-generated AD male and female mice. Both doses normalized hippocampal synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP) and associated spatial object location memory (OLM) without sex dimorphism in AD animals. However, in healthy mice, low VU0810464 dose did not significantly alter LTP and OLM, whereas the high dose disrupted both. Our results suggest that the precise tuning of neural excitability with low dosing of VU0810464 might be a promising strategy to safely treat and prevent hippocampal overexcitation and upstreaming memory deficits in early preclinical asymptomatic phases of AD.

">EEG connectome-based predictive modeling of nonverbal intelligence level in healthy subjects</a></h4>

              
                Intelligence is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in successful behavioral and emotional regulation. Neuroimaging techniques coupled with machine learning algorithms have proven to be valuable tools for uncovering the neural foundations of individual cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, current electroencephalograph (EEG) studies primarily focus on classification tasks to predict the intelligence category of subjects (e.g., high, medium, or low intelligence), rather than providing quantitative intelligence level forecasts. Furthermore, the outcomes obtained are significantly impacted by the specific data processing pipeline chosen, which could potentially compromise result generalizability. In this study, we implemented a connectome-based predictive modeling approach on high-density resting state EEG data from healthy participants to predict their nonverbal intelligence level. This method was applied to three independently collected datasets (N = 255) with different functional connectivity methods, parcellation atlases, threshold p-values and curve fitting orders used to ensure the reliability of the findings. We found that the prediction accuracy expressed in terms of R2 varied significantly depending on the processing pipeline configuration, ranging from negative R2 values up to 0.27. The most consistent results across datasets were found in the alpha frequency band. Furthermore, we employed a computational lesioning approach to identify the valuable edges that made the most significant contribution to predicting intelligence. This analysis highlighted the crucial role of frontal and parietal regions in complex cognitive computations. Overall, these findings support and expand upon previous research, underscoring the close relationship between alpha rhythm characteristics and cognitive functions and emphasizing the critical consideration of method selection in result evaluation.

">Corticonigral projections recruit substantia nigra pars lateralis dopaminergic neurons for auditory threat memories</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the lateral substantia nigra project to the tail of striatum (TS), which is involved in threat conditioning. Auditory cortex also contributes to threatening behaviors, but whether it directly interacts with midbrain DANs and how these interactions might influence threat conditioning remain unclear. Here, functional mapping revealed robust excitatory input from auditory and temporal association cortexes to substantia nigra pars lateralis (SNL) DANs, but not to pars compacta (SNc) DANs. SNL DANs exhibited unique firing patterns, with irregular pacemaking and higher maximal firing, reflecting different channel complements than SNc DANs. Behaviorally, inhibiting cortex to SNL projections impaired memory retrieval during auditory threat conditioning. Thus, we demonstrate robust corticonigral projections to SNL DANs, contrasting with previous observations of sparse cortical input to substantia nigra DANs. These findings distinguish SNL DANs from other nigral populations, highlighting their role in threatening behaviors and expanding knowledge of cortex to midbrain interactions.

">A consensus definition for deep layer 6 excitatory neurons in mouse neocortex</a></h4>

              
                To understand neocortical function, we must first define its cell types. Recent studies indicate that neurons in the deepest cortical layer play roles in mediating thalamocortical interactions and modulating brain state and are implicated in neuropsychiatric disease. However, understanding the functions of deep layer 6 (L6b) neurons has been hampered by the lack of agreed upon definitions for these cell types. We compared commonly used methods for defining L6b neurons, including molecular, transcriptional and morphological approaches as well as transgenic mouse lines, and identified a core population of L6b neurons. This population does not innervate sensory thalamus, unlike layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (L6CThNs) in more superficial layer 6. Rather, single L6b neurons project ipsilaterally between cortical areas. Although L6b neurons undergo early developmental changes, we found that their intrinsic electrophysiological properties were stable after the first postnatal week. Our results provide a consensus definition for L6b neurons, enabling comparisons across studies.

	<p>Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that mind wandering during incubation phases enhances post-incubation creative performance. Recent empirical evidence, however, has highlighted a specific form of mind wandering closely related to creativity, termed freely moving mind wandering (FMMW). In this study, we examined the behavioral and neural associations between FMMW and creativity. Methods: We initially validated a questionnaire measuring FMMW by comparing its results with those from the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Data were collected from 1316 participants who completed resting-state fMRI scans, the FMMW questionnaire, and creative tasks. Correlation analysis and Bayes factors indicated that FMMW was associated with creative thinking (AUT). To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between FMMW and creativity, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) were employed to analyze the temporal dynamics of the resting-state fMRI data. Results: Our findings indicated that brain dynamics associated with FMMW involve integration within multiple networks and between networks (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.11, pFDR &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The links between brain dynamics associated with FMMW and creativity were mediated by FMMW (c&amp;amp;rsquo; = 0.01, [&amp;amp;minus;0.0181, &amp;amp;minus;0.0029]). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the relationship between FMMW and creativity, offering insights into the neural mechanisms underpinning this relationship.</p>

                <p>Adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) serotypes vary in how effectively they express genes across different cell types and brain regions. Here we report a systematic comparison of the AAV serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, and the directed evolution derived AAVrg, in the inferior colliculus (IC) and cerebellum. The AAVs were identical apart from their different serotypes, each having a synapsin promotor and expressing GFP (AAV-hSyn-GFP). Identical titers and volumes were injected into the IC and cerebellum of adult male and female mice, and brains were sectioned and imaged 2&nbsp;weeks later. Transduction efficacy, anterograde labeling of axonal projections, and retrograde labeling of somata were characterized and compared across serotypes. Cell-type tropism was assessed by analyzing the morphology of the GFP-labeled neurons in the cerebellar cortex. In both the cerebellum and IC, AAV1 expressed GFP in more cells, labeled a larger volume, and produced significantly brighter labeling than all other serotypes, indicating superior transgene expression. AAV1 labeled more Purkinje cells, unipolar brush cells, and molecular layer interneurons than the other serotypes, while AAV2 labeled a greater number of granule cells. These results provide guidelines for the use of AAVs as gene delivery tools in these regions.</p>

                Background Physical activity plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of older adults, positively influencing various aspects of their quality of life. This study aims to explore the relationship between physical activity and body segments, as well as the risk indices of non-communicable chronic diseases in healthy elderly individuals. Methods The analyzed variables include weekly physical activity, the Postural Correction Index (PCI), measured using the system developed by Portland State University (PSU), and predictors of non-communicable chronic diseases assessed through body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio. Results The results reveal a moderate positive relationship between physical activity and the PCI (r=0.45; p≤0.05), with significant correlations in specific components of the PCI, such as thoracic depression (r=0.51; p<0.01), anteroposterior shoulder alignment (r=0.51; p<0.01), and upper back (r=0.53; p<0.001). Conclusions It is concluded that physical activity has a significant positive impact on the posture of older adults, particularly in the trunk, contributing 40% to the improvement of PCI components. The PCI values obtained, exceeding 84.67 in men and 82.67 in women according to the PSU evaluation, underscore the effectiveness of physical activity in postural correction and the prevention of issues associated with chronic diseases.

                The health crisis caused by COVID-19 impacted the dynamics of the work of health professionals, specifically in nursing professionals who were aware of the essential need for care and a safe environment to reduce in-hospital risks and mortality indicators. The study aimed to analyze the scientific evidence on the lessons learned during the health crisis in the work of the nursing professional, and the analysis of scientific articles published between 2020 and 2023 in the Scopus databases, obtaining a total of 30 articles. The findings show that there is a need to adopt health contingency policies to respond to health crises, as well as to establish and apply coping strategies in health professionals to avoid the impact on their mental health. Additionally, it is important to recognize their role in society. In conclusion, contingency policies and coping strategies must be developed to ensure the safety and well-being of nursing professionals and prevent the impact on their mental health during health crises like the one caused by COVID-19. Furthermore, it is important to recognize and value the fundamental role of nursing professionals in disease prevention and care in society and continue to work on developing policies and support strategies for health professionals to ensure their safety and well-being during health crises.

                Background Glioblastoma is a highly infiltrative, currently incurable brain cancer. To date, translation of novel therapies for glioblastoma from the laboratory into clinical trials has relied heavily on in vitro cell culture and murine (subcutaneous and orthotopic) xenograft models using cells derived from the main bulk of patient tumours. However, it is the residual cells left-behind after surgery that are responsible for disease progression and death in the clinic. A lack of substantial improvements in patient survival for decades suggests commonly used murine xenograft models, a key step before clinical trials, do not reflect the biology of residual disease in patients. Methods To address this, we have developed the ‘Sheffield Protocol’ to generate ex vivo models that reflect both resected, and post-surgical residual disease from the same patient. The protocol leverages parallel derivation of inherently treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) from ‘core’ and distant ‘edge’ regions through careful macrodissection of a large en bloc specimen, such as from a partial lobectomy for tumour, followed by tissue dissociation and propagation in serum-free media. Opportunistic en bloc specimen use can liberate the most distant infiltrative cells feasibly accessible from living patients. Results We provide an example illustrating that resected and residual disease models represent spatially divergent tumour subpopulations harbouring distinct transcriptomic and cancer stem cell marker expression profiles. We also introduce the ‘Sheffield Living Biobank’ of glioma models (SLB) that incorporates over 150 GSC lines from 60+ patients, including 44+ resected and residual models, which are available for academic use via MTA. Conclusions These models provide a novel tool to reduce animal xenograft usage by improving candidate drug triage in early preclinical studies and directly replacing animal studies for some therapies that are post-Phase 1+ clinical trial for other cancers/conditions to, ultimately, deliver more effective treatments for post-surgical residual disease in glioblastoma.

                Background Preprints are scientific manuscripts that are made available on open-access servers but are not yet peer-reviewed. Although preprints are becoming more prevalent, uptake is not optimal. Understanding researchers’ opinions and attitudes toward preprints is valuable to optimize their use. Understanding knowledge gaps and researchers’ attitudes toward preprinting can assist stakeholders, such as journals, funding agencies, and universities, to use preprints more effectively. Here, we aimed to collect perceptions and behaviours regarding preprints across an international sample of biomedical researchers. Methods Corresponding authors of articles published in biomedical research journals were identified from a random sample of journals from the MEDLINE database. Their names and email addresses were extracted to invite them to our anonymous, cross-sectional survey, which asked participants questions about their knowledge, attitudes, and opinions regarding preprinting. Results The survey was completed by 730 respondents providing a response rate of 3.20% and demonstrated a wide range of attitudes and opinions about preprints with authors from various disciplines and career stages worldwide. Most respondents were familiar with the concept of preprints but most had not previously posted one. The lead author of the project and journal policy had the greatest impact on decisions to post a preprint, whereas employers/research institutes had the least impact. Supporting open science practices was the highest ranked incentive, while increasing authors’ visibility was the highest ranked motivation for publishing preprints. Conclusions Although many biomedical researchers recognize the benefits of preprints, there is still hesitation among others to engage in this practice. This may be due to the general lack of peer review of preprints and little enthusiasm from external organizations such as journals, funding agencies, and universities. Future work is needed to determine optimal ways to improve researchers’ attitudes through modifications to current preprint systems and policies.

                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of specific covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a tertiary care hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-237/v2?src=rss">Explicating collegiality and change management in neoliberalism during the dynamics of higher education institutions: : A Systematic Literature Review using PRISMA Checklist [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper discusses the lack of references that comprehensively describe the changes in universities owing to the ideology of neoliberalism. This research also discusses how a university maintains its function and identity when the great wave of neoliberalism massively erodes collegiality as the original philosophy of the university through a case study of the neoliberalism ideology on higher education. This study also provides a comprehensive framework for higher education management and governance changes. Methods We selected all retrieved sources based on the keywords and analyzed all the documents we obtained. This study obtained data from Scopus retrieved on October 27, 2023, using the following keywords: (TITLE-ABS-KEY ("collegiality") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("change management") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("neolibelism")) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ("higher education"). This study utilized bibliometric analysis to ensure a structured review of the literature on collegiality, change management, and neoliberalism in higher education. Results The findings show that organizational management, leadership, education, technology, curriculum, innovation, organizational change, decision-making, and human beings are significant trajectories of neoliberalism in higher education. Conclusions This study offers other constructs for accelerating leadership success in higher education. This relates to how change leadership can navigate changes resulting from neoliberal ideology.

The increasing availability of enzyme turnover number measurements from experiments and of turnover number predictions from deep learning models prompts the use of these enzyme parameters in precise metabolic engineering. Yet, there is no computational approach that allows the prediction of metabolic engineering strategies that rely on the modification of turnover numbers. It is also unclear if modifications of turnover numbers without alterations in the host’s transcriptional regulatory machinery suffice to increase the production of chemicals of interest. Here, we present a constraint-based modeling approach, termed Overcoming Kinetic rate Obstacles (OKO), that uses enzyme-constrained metabolic models to predict <i>in silico</i> strategies to increase the production of a given chemical, while ensuring specified cell growth. We demonstrate that the application of OKO to enzyme-constrained metabolic models of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> results in strategies that can at least double the production of over 40 compounds with little penalty to growth. Interestingly, we show that the overproduction of compounds of interest does not entail only an increase in the values of turnover numbers. Lastly, we demonstrate that a refinement of OKO, allowing also for manipulation of enzyme abundance, facilitates the usage of the available compendia and deep learning models of turnover numbers in the design of precise metabolic engineering strategies. Our results expand the usage of genome-scale metabolic models toward the identification of targets for protein engineering, allowing their direct usage in the generation of innovative metabolic engineering designs for various biotechnological applications.

                <p>by Alireza Rezvani-Sharif, Hadi Lioe, Steven K. Dower, Matthias Pelzing, Con Panousis, Dalton J. E. Harvie, Ineke L. Muir</p>
Background <p>The kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is a complex biochemical pathway that plays a crucial role in regulating several physiological processes, including inflammation, coagulation, and blood pressure. Dysregulation of the KKS has been associated with several pathological conditions such as hereditary angioedema (HAE), hypertension, and stroke. Developing an accurate quantitative model of the KKS may provide a better understanding of its role in health and disease and facilitate the rapid and targeted development of effective therapies for KKS-related disorders.</p> Objectives <p>Here, we present a novel, detailed mechanistic model of the plasma KKS, elucidating the processes of Factor XII (FXII) activation, the kallikrein feedback loop, cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen leading to bradykinin (BK) production, and the impact of inhibitors.</p> Methods <p>The model incorporates both surface and solution-phase reactions of all proteins in the KKS, describing how binding site concentration affects the rate of surface reactions. The model was calibrated and validated using a variety of published and in-house experimental datasets, which encompass a range of dextran sulphate (DXS) concentrations to initiate contact activation and various KKS inhibitors to block bradykinin production.</p> Results <p>Our mathematical model showed that a trace amount of activated FXII is required for subsequent FXII activation. The model also reveals a bell-shaped curve relationship between the activation of the KKS and the number of DXS surface binding sites. Simulations of BK generation in healthy and HAE plasma demonstrated the impact of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1inh) deficiency via increased peak BK levels and accelerated formation in HAE plasma. The efficacy of KKS inhibitors, such as CSL312, ecallantide, and C1inh, was also evaluated, with CSL312 showing the most potent inhibition of BK generation.</p> Conclusions <p>The present model represents a valuable framework for studying the intricate interactions within the plasma KKS and provides a better understanding of the mechanism of action of various KKS-targeted therapies.</p>

                <p>by David Kappel, Christian Tetzlaff</p>

Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. To show this, we developed a mathematical framework, in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. In addition, this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

                <p>by Robert A. Barber, Jingyi Yang, Chenyue Yang, Oonagh Barker, Tim Janicke, Joseph A. Tobias</p>

Sexual selection, one of the central pillars of evolutionary theory, has powerful effects on organismal morphology, behaviour, and population dynamics. However, current knowledge about geographical variation in this evolutionary mechanism and its underlying drivers remains highly incomplete, in part because standardised data on the strength of sexual selection is sparse even for well-studied organisms. Here, we use information on mating systems—including the incidence of polygamy and extra-pair paternity—to estimate the intensity of sexual selection in 10,671 (>99.9%) bird species distributed worldwide. We show that avian sexual selection varies latitudinally, peaking at higher latitudes, although the gradient is reversed in the world’s most sexually selected birds—specialist frugivores—which are strongly associated with tropical forests. Phylogenetic models further reveal that the strength of sexual selection is explained by temperature seasonality coupled with a suite of climate-associated factors, including migration, diet, and territoriality. Overall, these analyses suggest that climatic conditions leading to short, intense breeding seasons, or highly abundant and patchy food resources, increase the potential for polygamy in birds, driving latitudinal gradients in sexual selection. Our findings help to resolve longstanding debates about spatial variation in evolutionary mechanisms linked to reproductive biology and also provide a comprehensive species-level data set for further studies of selection and phenotypic evolution in the context of global climatic change.

                <p>by Safia A. Essien, Ivanshi Ahuja, George T. Eisenhoffer</p>

Apoptotic cells can signal to neighboring cells to stimulate proliferation and compensate for cell loss to maintain tissue homeostasis. While apoptotic cell-derived extracellular vesicles (AEVs) can transmit instructional cues to mediate communication with neighboring cells, the molecular mechanisms that induce cell division are not well understood. Here, we show that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (Mif)-containing AEVs regulate compensatory proliferation via ERK signaling in epithelial stem cells of larval zebrafish. Time-lapse imaging showed efferocytosis of AEVs from dying epithelial stem cells by healthy neighboring stem cells. Proteomic and ultrastructure analysis of purified AEVs identified Mif localization on the AEV surface. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic mutation of Mif, or its cognate receptor CD74, decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK and compensatory proliferation in the neighboring epithelial stem cells. Disruption of Mif activity also caused decreased numbers of macrophages patrolling near AEVs, while depletion of the macrophage lineage resulted in a reduced proliferative response by the epithelial stem cells. We propose that AEVs carrying Mif directly stimulate epithelial stem cell repopulation and guide macrophages to cell non-autonomously induce localized proliferation to sustain overall cell numbers during tissue maintenance.

                Background Interrupted time-series (ITS) studies are commonly used to examine the effects of interventions targeted at populations. Suppression of ITS studies or results within these studies, known as reporting bias, has the potential to bias the evidence-base on a particular topic, with potential consequences for healthcare decision-making. Therefore, we aim to determine whether there is evidence of reporting bias among ITS studies. Methods We will conduct a search for published protocols of ITS studies and reports of their results in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase up to December 31, 2022. We contact the authors of the ITS studies to seek information about their study, including submission status, data for unpublished results, and reasons for non-publication or non-reporting of certain outcomes. We will examine if there is evidence of publication bias by examining whether time-to-publication is influenced by the statistical significance of the study’s results for the primary research question using Cox proportional hazards regression. We will examine whether there is evidence of discrepancies in outcomes by comparing those specified in the protocols with those in the reports of results, and we will examine whether the statistical significance of an outcome’s result is associated with how completely that result is reported using multivariable logistic regression. Finally, we will examine discrepancies between protocols and reports of results in the methods by examining the data collection processes, model characteristics, and statistical analysis methods. Discrepancies will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Discussion These findings will inform systematic reviewers and policymakers about the extent of reporting biases and may inform the development of mechanisms to reduce such biases.

<p>We demonstrate the intricate network interactions that govern respiratory rhythm generation and airway motor activity, emphasizing the critical role of the postinspiratory complex (PiCo) in this complex circuitry.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The control of the respiratory rhythm and airway motor activity is essential for life. Accumulating evidence indicates that the postinspiratory complex (PiCo) is crucial for generating behaviors that occur during the postinspiratory phase, including expiratory laryngeal activity and swallowing. Located in the ventromedial medulla, PiCo is defined by neurons co-expressing two neurotransmitter markers (ChAT and Vglut2/Slc17a6). Here, we mapped the input–output connections of these neurons using viral tracers and intersectional viral-genetic tools. PiCo neurons were specifically targeted by focal injection of a doubly conditional Cre- and FlpO-dependent AAV8 viral marker (AAV8-Con/Fon-TVA-mCherry) into the left PiCo of adult Chat<sup>Cre/wt</sup>: Vglut2<sup>FlpO/wt</sup> mice, for anterograde axonal tracing. These experiments revealed projections to various brain regions, including the Cu, nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), Amb, X, XII, Sp5, RMg, intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt), lateral reticular nucleus (LRt), pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), contralateral PiCo, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), Kölliker–Fuse (KF), PB, and external cortex of the inferior colliculus (ECIC). A rabies virus (RV) retrograde transsynaptic approach was taken with EnvA-pseudotyped G-deleted (RV-SAD-G-GFP) to similarly target PiCo neurons in Chat<sup>Cre/wt</sup>: Vglut2<sup>FlpO/wt</sup> mice, following prior injections of helper AAVs (a mixture of AAV-Ef1a-Con/Fon oG and viral vector AAV8-Con/Fon-TVA-mCherry). This combined approach revealed prominent synaptic inputs to PiCo neurons from NTS, IRt, and A1/C1. Although PiCo neurons project axons to the contralateral PiCo area, this approach did not detect direct contralateral connections. We suggest that PiCo serves as a critical integration site, projecting and receiving neuronal connections implicated in breathing, arousal, swallowing, and autonomic regulation.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Psychiatric disorders are multifactorial conditions without clear biomarkers, influenced by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Understanding these disorders requires identifying specific endophenotypes that help break down their complexity. Here, we undertake an in-depth analysis of one such endophenotype, namely imbalanced approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), reviewing its significant dependency on the hippocampus. Imbalanced AAC is a transdiagnostic endophenotype, being a feature of many psychiatric conditions in humans. However, it is predominantly examined in preclinical research through paradigms that subject rodents to conflict-laden scenarios. This review offers an original perspective by discussing the AAC through three distinct lights: optogenetic modulation of the AAC, which updates our understanding of the hippocampal contribution to behavioral inhibition; the impact of environmental stress, which exacerbates conflict and strengthens the stress-psychopathology axis; and inherent epigenetic aspects, which uncover crucial molecular underpinnings of environmental (mal) adaptation. By integrating these perspectives, in this review we aim to underline a cross-species causal nexus between heightened hippocampal activity and avoidance behavior. In addition, we suggest a rationale to explore epigenetic pharmacology as a potential strategy to tackle AAC-related psychopathology. This review assumes greater significance when viewed through the lens of advancing AAC-centric diagnostics in human subjects. Unlike traditional questionnaires, which struggle to accurately measure individual differences in AAC-related dimensions, new approaches using virtual reality and computer games show promise in better focusing the magnitude of AAC contribution to psychopathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1315/v1?src=rss">A new management strategy in reopening laminectomies for cases with spinal canal stenosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background While a laminectomy is often mandated for spinal canal stenosis, foraminal stenosis may account for pain and functional limitations instead of central canal issues. Targeted treatment directed at this specific region may enhance patient outcomes. Methods Retrospective observational study of a total of 30 patients with previous decompression laminectomies for lumbar spinal canal stenosis were operated upon for foraminotomies from November 2012 to November 2018. The surgeries were clinically done, and EMG-confirmed nerve root compressions were treated with exact decompression techniques according to the anatomy and pathology in each case. Additionally, a systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines was conducted, utilizing Scopus and PubMed databases to identify studies on reoperation rates after decompression with or without fusion in lumbar spinal stenosis. Results The results were fearsome post-operatively, trying significant improvement in pain, functional status, and walking distance. Pain reduction was achieved in 80% of patients by an increase in the Carnovsky rating scale with evidence of improved pain reduction and walking endurance; this points to minimal resulting complications of one complete case of foot drop and three infective cases managed conservatively. It was shown in the systematic review that fusion surgeries lowered the rates of reoperations at the index level but increased those for adjacent segment reoperations, while decompression alone had higher index-level reoperation rates due to recurrent stenosis. Conclusion Most of the emphasis on foraminal stenosis, rather than traditional laminectomies, significantly reduces postoperative pain and improves functional outcomes. This strategy brings a promising alternative to the management of recurrent symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92737">Cell-autonomous targeting of arabinogalactan by host immune factors inhibits mycobacterial growth</a></h4>

              
                Deeper understanding of the crosstalk between host cells and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) provides crucial guidelines for the rational design of novel intervention strategies against tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacteria possess a unique complex cell wall with arabinogalactan (AG) as a critical component. AG has been identified as a virulence factor of Mtb which is recognized by host galectin-9. Here, we demonstrate that galectin-9 directly inhibited mycobacterial growth through AG-binding property of carbohydrate-recognition domain 2. Furthermore, IgG antibodies with AG specificity were detected in the serum of TB patients. Based on the interaction between galectin-9 and AG, we developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) screening assay and identified AG-specific mAbs which profoundly inhibit Mtb growth. Mechanistically, proteomic profiling and morphological characterizations revealed that AG-specific mAbs regulate AG biosynthesis, thereby inducing cell wall swelling. Thus, direct AG-binding by galectin-9 or antibodies contributes to protection against TB. Our findings pave the way for the rational design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for TB control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90930">Difficulty in artificial word learning impacts targeted memory reactivation and its underlying neural signatures</a></h4>

              
                Sleep associated memory consolidation and reactivation play an important role in language acquisition and learning of new words. However, it is unclear to what extent properties of word learning difficulty impact sleep associated memory reactivation. To address this gap, we investigated in 22 young healthy adults the effectiveness of auditory targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during non-rapid eye movement sleep of artificial words with easy and difficult to learn phonotactical properties. Here, we found that TMR of the easy words improved their overnight memory performance, whereas TMR of the difficult words had no effect. By comparing EEG activities after TMR presentations, we found an increase in slow wave density independent of word difficulty, whereas the spindle-band power nested during the slow wave up-states – as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation – was significantly higher in the easy/effective compared to the difficult/ineffective condition. Our findings indicate that word learning difficulty by phonotactics impacts the effectiveness of TMR and further emphasize the critical role of prior encoding depth in sleep associated memory reactivation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97883">Coupling of saccade plans to endogenous attention during urgent choices</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms that willfully direct attention to specific locations in space are closely related to those for generating targeting eye movements (saccades). However, the degree to which the voluntary deployment of attention to a location necessarily activates a corresponding saccade plan remains unclear. One problem is that attention and saccades are both automatically driven by salient sensory events; another is that the underlying processes unfold within tens of milliseconds only. Here, we use an urgent task design to resolve the evolution of a visuomotor choice on a moment-by-moment basis while independently controlling the endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (salience-driven) contributions to performance. Human participants saw a peripheral cue and, depending on its color, either looked at it (prosaccade) or looked at a diametrically opposite, uninformative non-cue (antisaccade). By varying the luminance of the stimuli, the exogenous contributions could be cleanly dissociated from the endogenous process guiding the choice over time. According to the measured time courses, generating a correct antisaccade requires about 30 ms more processing time than generating a correct prosaccade based on the same perceptual signal. The results indicate that saccade plans elaborated during fixation are biased toward the location where attention is endogenously deployed, but the coupling is weak and can be willfully overridden very rapidly.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95846">Perturbations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry alter expression of ribosomal proteins and key components of the MAPK signaling pathways</a></h4>

              
                Protein synthesis plays a major role in homeostasis and when dysregulated leads to various pathologies including cancer. To this end, imbalanced expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) is not only a consequence but also a driver of neoplastic growth. eIF3 is the largest, multi-subunit translation initiation complex with a modular assembly, where aberrant expression of one subunit generates only partially functional subcomplexes. To comprehensively study the effects of eIF3 remodeling, we contrasted the impact of eIF3d, eIF3e or eIF3h depletion on the translatome of HeLa cells using Ribo-seq. Depletion of eIF3d or eIF3e, but not eIF3h reduced the levels of multiple components of the MAPK signaling pathways. Surprisingly, however, depletion of all three eIF3 subunits increased MAPK/ERK pathway activity. Depletion of eIF3e and partially eIF3d also increased translation of TOP mRNAs that encode mainly ribosomal proteins and other components of the translational machinery. Moreover, alterations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry were often associated with changes in translation of mRNAs containing short uORFs, as in the case of the proto-oncogene MDM2 and the transcription factor ATF4. Collectively, perturbations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry exert specific effect on the translatome comprising signaling and stress-related transcripts with complex 5’ UTRs that are implicated in homeostatic adaptation to stress and cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93673">Reassessing the substrate specificities of the major Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan hydrolases lysostaphin and LytM</a></h4>

              
                Orchestrated action of peptidoglycan (PG) synthetases and hydrolases is vital for bacterial growth and viability. Although the function of several PG synthetases and hydrolases is well understood, the function, regulation, and mechanism of action of PG hydrolases characterised as lysostaphin-like endopeptidases have remained elusive. Many of these M23 family members can hydrolyse glycyl-glycine peptide bonds and show lytic activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> whose PG contains a pentaglycine bridge, but their exact substrate specificity and hydrolysed bonds are still vaguely determined. In this work, we have employed NMR spectroscopy to study both the substrate specificity and the bond cleavage of the bactericide lysostaphin and the <i>S. aureus</i> PG hydrolase LytM. Yet, we provide substrate-level evidence for the functional role of these enzymes. Indeed, our results show that the substrate specificities of these structurally highly homologous enzymes are similar, but unlike observed earlier both LytM and lysostaphin prefer the <span class="small-caps">D</span>-Ala-Gly cross-linked part of mature peptidoglycan. However, we show that while lysostaphin is genuinely a glycyl-glycine hydrolase, LytM can also act as a D-alanyl-glycine endopeptidase.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96155">Age-related decline in blood-brain barrier function is more pronounced in males than females in parietal and temporal regions</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in protecting the central nervous system (CNS), and shielding it from potential harmful entities. A natural decline of BBB function with aging has been reported in both animal and human studies, which may contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders. Limited data also suggest that being female may be associated with protective effects on BBB function. Here, we investigated age and sex-dependent trajectories of perfusion and BBB water exchange rate (kw) across the lifespan in 186 cognitively normal participants spanning the ages of 8–92 years old, using a non-invasive diffusion-prepared pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DP-pCASL) MRI technique. We found that the pattern of BBB kw decline with aging varies across brain regions. Moreover, results from our DP-pCASL technique revealed a remarkable decline in BBB kw beginning in the early 60 s, which was more pronounced in males. In addition, we observed sex differences in parietal and temporal regions. Our findings provide in vivo results demonstrating sex differences in the decline of BBB function with aging, which may serve as a foundation for future investigations into perfusion and BBB function in neurodegenerative and other brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98458">Cryo-electron tomographic investigation of native hippocampal glutamatergic synapses</a></h4>

              
                Chemical synapses are the major sites of communication between neurons in the nervous system and mediate either excitatory or inhibitory signaling. At excitatory synapses, glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter and upon release from presynaptic vesicles, is detected by postsynaptic glutamate receptors, which include ionotropic AMPA and NMDA receptors. Here, we have developed methods to identify glutamatergic synapses in brain tissue slices, label AMPA receptors with small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and prepare lamella for cryo-electron tomography studies. The targeted imaging of glutamatergic synapses in the lamella is facilitated by fluorescent pre- and postsynaptic signatures, and the subsequent tomograms allow for the identification of key features of chemical synapses, including synaptic vesicles, the synaptic cleft, and AuNP-labeled AMPA receptors. These methods pave the way for imaging brain regions at high resolution, using unstained, unfixed samples preserved under near-native conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98524">Nuclear translocation of SIRT4 mediates deacetylation of U2AF2 to modulate renal fibrosis through alternative splicing-mediated upregulation of CCN2</a></h4>

              
                TGF-β stimulates CCN2 expression which in turn amplifies TGF-β signaling. This process promotes extracellular matrix production and accelerates the pathological progression of fibrotic diseases. Alternative splicing plays an important role in multiple disease development, while U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 (U2AF2) is an essential factor in the early steps of pre-mRNA splicing. However, the molecular mechanism underlying abnormal <i>CCN2</i> expression upon TGF-β stimulation remains unclear. This study elucidates that SIRT4 acts as a master regulator for CCN2 expression in response to TGF-β by modulating U2AF2-mediated alternative splicing. Analyses of renal biopsy specimens from patients with CKD and mouse fibrotic kidney tissues revealed marked nuclear accumulation of SIRT4. The tubulointerstitial fibrosis was alleviated by global deletion or tubular epithelial cell (TEC)-specific knockout of <i>Sirt4</i>, and aggravated by adeno-associated virus-mediated SIRT4 overexpression in TECs. Furthermore, SIRT4 was found to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm through the BAX/BAK pore under TGF-β stimulation. In the cytoplasm, TGF-β activated the ERK pathway and induced the phosphorylation of SIRT4 at Ser36, which further promoted its interaction with importin α1 and subsequent nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, SIRT4 was found to deacetylate U2AF2 at K413, facilitating the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression. Importantly, exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies were found to effectively mitigate the UUO-induced kidney fibrosis in mice. Collectively, these findings indicated that SIRT4 plays a role in kidney fibrosis by regulating CCN2 expression via the pre-mRNA splicing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96957">TMEM16 and OSCA/TMEM63 proteins share a conserved potential to permeate ions and phospholipids</a></h4>

              
                The calcium-activated TMEM16 proteins and the mechanosensitive/osmolarity-activated OSCA/TMEM63 proteins belong to the Transmembrane Channel/Scramblase (TCS) superfamily. Within the superfamily, OSCA/TMEM63 proteins, as well as TMEM16A and TMEM16B, are thought to function solely as ion channels. However, most TMEM16 members, including TMEM16F, maintain an additional function as scramblases, rapidly exchanging phospholipids between leaflets of the membrane. Although recent studies have advanced our understanding of TCS structure–function relationships, the molecular determinants of TCS ion and lipid permeation remain unclear. Here, we show that single mutations along the transmembrane helix (TM) 4/6 interface allow non-scrambling TCS members to permeate phospholipids. In particular, this study highlights the key role of TM 4 in controlling TCS ion and lipid permeation and offers novel insights into the evolution of the TCS superfamily, suggesting that, like TMEM16s, the OSCA/TMEM63 family maintains a conserved potential to permeate ions and phospholipids.

">Antigen-Specific T Cell Receptor Discovery for Treating Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a frequently fatal disease of the central nervous system caused by JC virus (JCV). Survival is dependent on early diagnosis and ability to re-establish anti-viral T cell immunity. Adoptive transfer of polyomavirus-specific T cells has shown promise; however, there are no readily available HLA-matched anti-viral T cells to facilitate rapid treatment. Objective: Identify epitopes of the JCV major capsid protein VP1 that elicit an immune response in the context of human leukocyte antigen allele A*02:01 (HLA-A2) and isolate cognate T cell receptors (TCRs) from healthy donors. Evaluate individual VP1-specific TCRs for their capacity to be expressed in T cells and clear JCV in vitro. Methods: PBMCs from HLA-A2+ healthy donors were stimulated with peptide libraries tiled across the JCV VP1 protein. Multiple rounds of stimulation were performed to identify the antigens that induced the largest expansion and CD8+ T cell response (measured as INFg;, TNFa;, CD137, and CD69 expression). High-affinity, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were isolated based on intensity of tetramer binding for downstream single-cell TCR sequencing. Candidate TCRs were selected based on tetramer binding affinity and activation assays. Promising TCRs were introduced into the T cell genome via viral transduction for in vitro validation including peptide-pulsed K562 cells and astrocyte cells, and JCV-infected astrocytes. Results: Four conserved JCV VP1 epitopes (amino acids 100-108, 251-259, 253-262, and 274-283) presented by HLA-A2 were identified. VP1(100-108) consistently elicited the highest level of IFNg; production from multiple donors and this peptide is in a highly conserved region of VP1. We next identified fourteen high avidity TCRs specific for VP1(100-108). When virally transduced into primary human T cells, seven of these TCRs demonstrated specific binding to VP1(100-108):HLA-A2 tetramers, and four showed increased IFNg; response when incubated with peptide. Primary CD8+ T cells expressing two of these TCRs cleared both HLA-A2 positive K562 cells and HLA-A2 positive SVG astrocyte cell line presenting exogenously added VP1 peptide at a range of E:T ratios. In addition, both TCR-transduced T cell populations effectively lysed JCV-infected astrocytes. Conclusions: We identified JCV VP1 epitopes that are immunogenic in the context of HLA-A2 MHC-I, including epitopes that have not been previously described. The VP1(100-108) epitope was used to isolate HLA-A2-restricted TCRs. When cloned into primary human CD8+ T cells, these TCRs recognized VP1 (100-108)-presenting targets, and the transduced T cells conferred cytotoxic activity and eliminated K562 and astrocyte cells displaying the VP1(100-108) peptide and not sham peptide, as well as JCV-infected astrocytes. Taken together, these data suggest that JCV VP1-specific TCRs could be appealing therapeutics for HLA-A2+ individuals with PML in whom intrinsic T cell immunity cannot be rescued.

">Suppression of Huntington's Disease Somatic Instability by Transcriptional Repression and Direct CAG Repeat Binding</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) arises from a CAG expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene beyond a critical threshold. A major thrust of current HD therapeutic development is lowering levels of mutant HTT mRNA (mHTT) and protein (mHTT) with the aim of reducing the toxicity of these product(s). Human genetic data also support a key role for somatic instability (SI) in HTT's CAG repeat -- whereby it lengthens with age in specific somatic cell types -- as a key driver of age of motor dysfunction onset. Thus, an attractive HD therapy would address both mHTT toxicity and SI, but to date the relationship between SI and HTT lowering remains unexplored. Here, we investigated multiple therapeutically-relevant HTT-lowering modalities to establish the relationship between HTT lowering and SI in HD knock-in mice. We find that repressing transcription of mutant Htt (mHtt) provides robust protection from SI, using diverse genetic and pharmacological approaches (antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, the Lac repressor, and virally delivered zinc finger transcriptional repressor proteins, ZFPs). However, we find that small interfering RNA (siRNA), a potent HTT-lowering treatment, lowers HTT levels without influencing SI and that SI is also normal in mice lacking 50% of total HTT levels, suggesting HTT levels, per se, do not modulate SI in trans. Remarkably, modified ZFPs that bind the mHtt locus, but lack a repressive domain, robustly protect from SI, despite not reducing HTT mRNA or protein levels. These results have important therapeutic implications in HD, as they suggest that DNA-targeted HTT-lowering treatments may have significant advantages compared to other HTT-lowering approaches, and that interaction of a DNA-binding protein and HTT's CAG repeats may provide protection from SI while sparing HTT expression.

">Chimeric music reveals an interaction of pitch and time in electrophysiological signatures of music encoding</a></h4>

              
                Pitch and time are the essential dimensions defining musical melody. Recent electrophysiological studies have explored the neural encoding of musical pitch and time by leveraging probabilistic models of their sequences, but few have studied how the features might interact. This study examines these interactions by introducing "chimeric music," which pairs two distinct melodies, and exchanges their pitch contours and note onset-times to create two new melodies, thereby distorting musical pattern while maintaining the marginal statistics of the original pieces' pitch and temporal sequences. Through this manipulation, we aimed to dissect the music processing and the interaction between pitch and time. Employing the temporal response function (TRF) framework, we analyzed the neural encoding of melodic expectation and musical downbeats in participants with varying levels of musical training. Our findings revealed differences in the encoding of melodic expectation between original and chimeric stimuli in both dimensions, with a significant impact of musical experience. This suggests that the structural violation due to decoupling the pitch and temporal structure affect expectation processing. In our analysis of downbeat encoding, we found an enhanced neural response when participants heard a note that aligned with the downbeat during music listening. In chimeric music, responses to downbeats were larger when the note was also a downbeat in the original music that provided the pitch sequence, indicating an effect of pitch structure on beat perception. This study advances our understanding of the neural underpinnings of music, emphasizing the significance of pitch-time interaction in the neural encoding of music.

">dArc1 controls sugar reward valuation in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                The Arc genes, which include Drosophila Arc1 and Arc2 (dArc), evolved from Ty3 retrotransposons and encode proteins that form virus-like capsids. These capsids enable a novel form of intercellular communication by transferring RNAs between cells. However, the specific neuronal circuits and brain processes Arc intercellular signaling regulates remain unknown. Here, we show that loss of both dArc genes in Drosophila melanogaster enhances associative learning in an appetitive conditioning paradigm, where flies associate an odor with sugar rewards. This increased learning performance arises from an increased valuation of sugar rewards: unlike wild-type flies, dArc-/- flies form abnormally strong associations even when the sugar reward is small or has no caloric value. We found that the gamma5-dopaminergic neurons of the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster, which encode the positive valence of sugar rewards, show heightened activity in response to sucrose in dArc-/- flies. We further show that the learning phenotype of dArc-/- flies depends on the formation of capsids, underscoring a direct role for capsid-mediated Arc signaling in sugar valuation. Our findings establish dArc genes as critical regulators of reward valuation in D. melanogaster, acting through a non-cell autonomous mechanism that relies on capsid-mediated communication between cells.

">Modulating Neurotoxic Effects of Prenatal Chlorpyrifos Exposure Through Probiotic and Vitamin D Gestational Supplementation: Unexpected Effects on Neurodevelopment and Sociability</a></h4>

              
                Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in sociability and communication. Prenatal exposure to Chlorpyrifos has been associated with autism-like behaviors in preclinical models. Interest has grown in the gut-brain axis and the role of microbiota modulation through dietetic supplementation to reduce this ASD-like phenotype. This study examines the effects of prenatal CPF exposure in Wistar Rats and assesses the potential of gestational probiotic and vitamin D supplementation to mitigate these effects in offspring. CPF exposure significantly impaired sociability in adolescence, and supplementation did not reverse these deficits. However, in control animals, supplementation induced neurodevelopmental changes, including alterations in metabolic status, the pattern of expression of ASD-related genes, the regulation of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors, and the GABAergic system in the brain. Additionally, supplementation accelerated overall development, increased ultrasonic vocalization emission and modified the typical responses to social novelty. CPF exposure blocked most of these effects at both behavioral and molecular levels. While supplementation did not block CPF-induced impairments, CPF exposure altered the observed effects of supplementation in controls, possibly indicating shared molecular mechanisms. These findings highlight the need for further research into the safety of probiotic and vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.

">Multi-omics analysis in mouse primary cortical neurons reveals complex positive and negative biological interactions between constituent compounds in Centella asiatica</a></h4>

              
                Background: A water extract of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica (CAW) improves cognitive function in mouse models of aging and Alzheimers disease, and affects dendritic arborization, mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in mouse primary neurons. Triterpenes (TT) and caffeoylquinic acids (CQA) are constituents associated with these bioactivities of CAW although little is known about how interactions between these compounds contribute to the plants therapeutic benefit. Methods: Mouse primary cortical neurons were treated with CAW, or equivalent concentrations of four TT combined, eight CQA combined, or these twelve compounds combined (TTCQA). Treatment effects on the cell transcriptome (18,491 genes) and metabolome (192 metabolites) relative to vehicle control were evaluated using RNAseq and metabolomic analyses respectively. Results: Extensive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were seen with all treatments, as well as evidence of interactions between compounds. Notably many DEGs seen with TT treatment were not observed in the TTCQA condition, possibly suggesting CQA reduced the effects of TT. Moreover, additional gene activity seen with CAW as compared to TTCQA indicate the presence of additional compounds in CAW that further modulate TTCQA interactions. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 4 gene co-expression modules altered by treatments that were associated with extracellular matrix organization, fatty acid metabolism, cellular response to stress and stimuli, and immune function. Compound interaction patterns were seen at the eigengene level in these modules. Interestingly, in metabolomics analysis, the TTCQA treatment saw the highest number of changes in individual metabolites (20), followed by CQA (15), then TT (8) and finally CAW (3). WGCNA analysis found two metabolomics modules with significant eigenmetabolite differences for TT and CQA, and possible compound interactions at this level. Conclusions: Four gene expression modules and two metabolite modules were altered by the four types of treatments applied. This methodology demonstrated the existence of both negative and positive interactions between TT, CQA and additional compounds found in CAW on the transcriptome and metabolome of mouse primary cortical neurons.

	<p>Background: Accounting for dementia risk factors is essential in identifying people who would benefit most from intervention programs. The CAIDE dementia risk score is commonly applied, but its link to brain function remains unclear. This study aims to determine whether the variation in this score is associated with neurophysiological changes and cognitive measures in normative individuals. Methods: The sample comprised 38 participants aged between 54 and 79 (M = 67.05; SD = 6.02). Data were collected using paper-and-pencil tests and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the resting state, channels FP1 and FP2. The EEG signals were analyzed using Power Spectral Density (PSD)-based features. Results: The CAIDE score is positively correlated with the relative power activation of the &amp;amp;theta; band and negatively correlated with the MMSE cognitive test score, and MMSE variations align with those found in distributions of EEG-extracted PSD-based features. Conclusions: The findings suggest that CAIDE scores can identify individuals without noticeable cognitive changes who already exhibit brain activity similar to that seen in people with dementia. They also contribute to the convergent validity between CAIDE and the risk of cognitive decline. This underscores the importance of early monitoring of these factors to reduce the incidence of dementia.</p>

	<p>Background: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) represents one of the most common and debilitating effects in patients surviving after cancer treatments. Neurocognitive deficits are important causes of disability and burden in cancer survivors. The true magnitude of CRCI is difficult to define due to significant heterogeneity of literature data. At present, there is no agreement on the gold standard for detection and grading of CRCI in clinical trials, and there is a lack of clear knowledge of its pathophysiology. Objectives: In this review, we aim to discuss some perspectives for future research to pursue in order to cover the gaps in knowledge in the CRCI field. Methods: We focused our literature research on the following relevant issues: neuroradiological correlates of CRCI; objective neuropsychological evaluation and subjective complaint assessment and their correlation with objective measures; timing of assessment; and possible treatments. Results: The correct methodology for evaluating cognitive deficits induced by anti-tumor treatments still requires a definition based on quality scientific evidence, and literature data are currently scarce. Conclusions: This review highlights the need for further research to understand the causes and consequences of cancer-related cognitive impairment using standardized and sensitive measures of cognitive functions and the long-term effects of chemotherapy on cognitive functions and to develop effective interventions.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively studied asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers, identifying those developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 56 asymptomatic family members (AFM) with a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation (AFM C9+), 132 non-carriers (AFM C9−), and 359 population-based controls. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cortical thickness, gyrification, and subcortical volumes longitudinally. Linear mixed-effects models on non-converting AFM C9+ scans (n = 107) created a reference for these measurements, establishing individual atrophy patterns. Atrophy patterns from presymptomatic phenoconverters (n = 10 scans) served as a template for group comparisons and similarity assessments. Similarity with phenoconverters was quantified using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for cortical and Kullback–Leibler similarity (KLS) for subcortical measures. Using longitudinal similarity assessments, we predicted when participants would reach the average similarity level of phenoconverters at their first post-onset scan.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five AFM C9+ converted to ALS or ALS-FTD. Up to 6 years before symptoms, these phenoconverters exhibited significant atrophy in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex, along with smaller thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala compared to other AFM C9+. Some non-converted AFM C9+ had high DSC and KLS, approaching values of phenoconverters, whereas others, along with AFM C9− and controls, had lower values. At age 80, we predicted 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 13.2–40.1%) of AFM C9+ and no AFM C9− would reach the same DSC as phenoconverters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Distinctive atrophy patterns are visible years before symptom onset on presymptomatic scans of phenoconverters. Combining baseline and follow-up similarity measures may serve as a promising imaging biomarker for identifying those at risk of ALS or ALS-FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Extensive research has been focused in the past century on structural, physiological, and molecular attributes of the hippocampus. This interest was created by the unique involvement of the hippocampus in cognitive and affective functions of the brain. Functional analysis revealed that the hippocampus has divergent properties along its axial dimension to the extent that the dorsal sector (dorsal hippocampus, DH) has different connections with the rest of the brain than those of the ventral sector (VH). Still, longitudinal pathways connect the DH with the VH and dampen the functional differences between the sectors. To be able to identify the intrinsic functional difference between the DH and VH, we produced dissociated monolayer cultures from prenatal DH and VH and examined their properties at 10–20 days after plating by imaging the spontaneous activity of the network using Fluo-2 AM, a calcium indicator. Surprisingly, while DH and VH sectors produced dissociated cultures with similar morphological attributes, VH cultures were more active spontaneously than DH cultures. Furthermore, when stimulated to produce action potentials, VH neurons triggered network bursts in postsynaptic neurons more often than DH cultures. Finally, in both DH and VH cultures, electrical stimulation of single cells produced network bursts in response to a burst of action potentials rather than to single spikes. These experiments indicate that even in dissociated cultures, neurons of the VH are more excitable and sensitive to electrical stimulation than DH; hence, they are more likely to generate network bursts and epileptic seizures, as suggested for in vivo brains.</p>

                Background The response of heart rate to changes in exercise intensity is comprised of several dynamic modes with differing magnitudes and temporal characteristics. Investigations of empirical identification of dynamic models of heart rate showed that second-order models gave substantially and significantly better model fidelity compared to the first order case. In the present work, we aimed to reanalyse data from previous studies to more closely consider the effect of including a zero and a pure delay in the model. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 22 treadmill (TM) and 54 cycle ergometer (CE) data sets from a total of 38 healthy participants. A linear, time-invariant plant model structure with up to two poles, a zero and a dead time is considered. Empirical estimation of the free parameters was performed using least-squares optimisation. The primary outcome measure is model fit, which is a normalised root-mean-square model error. Results A model comprising parallel connection of two first-order transfer functions, one with a dead time and one without, was found to give the highest fit (56.7 % for TM, 54.3 % for CE), whereby the non-delayed component appeared to merely capture initial transients in the data and the part with dead time likely represented the true dynamic response of heart rate to the excitation. In comparison, a simple first-order model without dead time gave substantially lower fit than the parallel model (50.2 % for TM, 47.9 % for CE). Conclusions This preliminary analysis points to a linear first-order system with dead time as being an appropriate model for heart rate response to exercise using treadmill and cycle ergometer modalities. In order to avoid biased estimates, it is vitally important that, prior to parameter estimation and validation, careful attention is paid to data preprocessing in order to eliminate transients and trends.

                Background We analysed the prevalence of depression under among pregnant women both in the immigrant and native populations in a Health Region of Spain, and evaluated the maternal factors associated with it. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study in pregnant women in the Health Region of Lleida between 2012 and 2018. We analysed the following variables: age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, country of origin, and antidepressant drug prescribed. We performed a multivariate analysis and obtained the linear regression coefficients and their 95% confidence interval (CI). Results In a sample of 17177 pregnant women, 2.5% had a diagnosis of depression. The patients with depression had an average age of 32 years (SD 5.56) compared to the rest of the women who had an average age of 30 (SD 5.85) years of age. Obesity was present in 17.7% of patients with depression compared to 14.3% in the rest. A high percentage of women from Western Europe presented depression (2.9%); followed by women from Latin America (2.6%) and Eastern Europe (2.3%). The values for Africa, (0.8%) and Asia and the Middle East (0.5%) were significantly lower. We did not observe any relationship between depression and hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Conclusions In our study, we found a prevalence of depression similar to the one found in other publications. As main risk factors, we identified age, weight, and geographical origin.

                Background of the study This study intends to contribute to the continuing discussion about green economic growth by objectively investigating the consequences of clean energy generation, cutting-edge green practices, and ethical business on global sustainability. This study also examines how green finance laws effectively handle the financial limitations that companies face when pursuing green innovation. Green finance enables the development and implementation of sustainable business models, investments, trade, economic, environmental, and social projects through the effective utilization of financial resources. Methods This article offers a complete evaluation of the current state and advancements in green finance research using a mixed-methods approach, which includes bibliometric and qualitative analysis. We analysed a big dataset of research papers after entering the keywords into the Scopus database. Results This study found that green bank products include green securities, investments, climate financing, carbon finance, insurance, credit, and infrastructure bonds. Sustainability, sustainable development, investments, environmental economics, sustainable finance, green bonds, and the green economy dominate as a most prevalent theme. China has the strongest bibliometric linkages to other nations, followed by the US and UK. This study also examines whether green finance policies address firm financial restrictions while pursuing green innovation.

Conclusion Green finance strives to increase funding flows to sustainable development goals while mitigating environmental and social hazards. “Going green,” pricing, forecasting, modelling, picking the most efficient tool, and influencing investor behaviour toward environmentally friendly operations are all challenges. Environmental policies, interest rates, religion, risks, social inclusion, and banking laws all have an impact on bank green financing initiatives. The study’s main contribution is an overview of green finance breakthroughs for sustainability, which may help scholars and practitioners understand the trend and future research directions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1311/v1?src=rss">Global trends in research of Work-related musculoskeletal disorders among surgeons: Bibliometric analysis and visualization from 1991 to 2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Surgeons are highly exposed to Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Assessing the prevalence of these disorders, both overall and by body area, has become a focus of interest, and numerous articles have been published on the subject. Methods Journal articles and reviews focused on WMSDs published until today and referenced in PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, Science.gov, Mendeley and Google Scholar were analysed. VOSviewer version 1.6.20 and Microsoft Excel were used to perform a bibliometric and visualization analyses. Overall distribution of publications by year, sources with country and related indicators, research areas, authors with their affiliations, references and keywords were studied. Results Of the total 2338 items identified, 184 articles (174 articles and 10 reviews) published between 1991 and 2024 were included. Results showed an increase in the number of publications over the years, with a significant increase from 2016 onwards (R2 = 0.8693). The United States is the leader in the field, with 89 publications (37.6%) and 2,631 citations. Hallbeck MS (USA) is the most prolific author (11 publications and 601 citations). World Neurosurgery and Work were the journals with the highest number of publications (n=7). Applied ergonomics has the highest number of citations. Medicine is the research area most present. Epstein’s work has the most citations worldwide, while Park et al’s work is the most cited of the 184 studies considered. “Ergonomics”, “musculoskeletal disorders”, “surgeons”, and “work-related musculoskeletal disorders” are the keywords most used by authors. Their use increased significantly since 2016, with an average year of publication around 2020. Conclusions The study of WMSDs in surgeons is a young research topic that is evolving significantly. North America, Europe and Asia have been the main contributors, with the USA in the lead. Subjective prevalence analysis based on questionnaires and ergonomic assessment using quantitative tools are the two main lines of research.

                Cortical activity is constantly fluctuating between distinct spatiotemporal activity patterns denoted by changes in brain state. States of cortical desynchronization arise during motor generation, increased attention, and high cognitive load. Synchronized brain states comprise spatially widespread, coordinated low-frequency neural activity during rest and sleep when disengaged from the external environment or ‘offline’. The claustrum is a small subcortical structure with dense reciprocal connections with the cortex suggesting modulation by, or participation in, brain state regulation. Here, we highlight recent work suggesting that neural activity in the claustrum supports cognitive processes associated with synchronized brain states characterized by increased low-frequency network activity. As an example, we outline how claustrum activity could support episodic memory consolidation during sleep.

                How does the brain represent the structure of a visual scene (the relations among items, e.g., the cardinality) independent of scene contents (the objects in the scene, e.g., item identity)? Thompson et al. propose a dual-stream neural network model based on the parallel pathways of the primate visual system.

                piRNAs protect germline genomes by repressing transposons. Daedalus and Gasz bind to each other and form a mitochondrial scaffold for Armitage, a factor required for endonuclease Zucchini-dependent piRNA maturation. Their roles are distinct: Daedalus interacts with Armitage, while Gasz supports Daedalus. Daedalus binds to Armitage through an extended coiled-coil domain, which tethers it to mitochondria, and a SAM domain, which controls piRNA length. Without the Daedalus SAM domain, piRNAs cannot fully silence transposons. Daedalus is Dipteran specific, unlike other species, where exonucleases regulate piRNA length.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89572">Calcineurin inhibition enhances Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan by defecation defects-mediated calorie restriction and nuclear hormone signaling</a></h4>

              
                Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> through multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in <i>C. elegans</i>. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the <i>C. elegans</i> DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.

                Addiction is commonly characterized by escalation of drug intake, compulsive drug seeking, and continued use despite harmful consequences. However, the factors contributing to the transition from moderate drug use to these problematic patterns remain unclear, particularly regarding the role of sex. Many preclinical studies have been limited by small sample sizes, low genetic diversity, and restricted drug access, making it challenging to model significant levels of intoxication or dependence and translate findings to humans. To address these limitations, we characterized addiction-like behaviors in a large sample of &gt;500 outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats using an extended cocaine self-administration paradigm (6 hr/daily). We analyzed individual differences in escalation of intake, progressive ratio (PR) responding, continued use despite adverse consequences (contingent foot shocks), and irritability-like behavior during withdrawal. Principal component analysis showed that escalation of intake, progressive ratio responding, and continued use despite adverse consequences loaded onto a single factor that was distinct from irritability-like behaviors. Categorizing rats into resilient, mild, moderate, and severe addiction-like phenotypes showed that females exhibited higher addiction-like behaviors, with a lower proportion of resilient individuals compared to males. These findings suggest that, in genetically diverse rats with extended drug access, escalation of intake, continued use despite adverse consequences, and PR responding are highly correlated measures of a shared underlying construct. Furthermore, our results highlight sex differences in resilience to addiction-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88322">Evidence for a role of human blood-borne factors in mediating age-associated changes in molecular circadian rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with a number of physiologic changes including perturbed circadian rhythms; however, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain unknown. To test the idea that circulating factors mediate age-dependent changes in peripheral rhythms, we compared the ability of human serum from young and old individuals to synchronize circadian rhythms in culture. We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25–30) and old (age 70–76) individuals at 14:00 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts. We found that young and old sera are equally competent at initiating robust ~24 hr oscillations of a luciferase reporter driven by clock gene promoter. However, cyclic gene expression is affected, such that young and old sera promote cycling of different sets of genes. Genes that lose rhythmicity with old serum entrainment are associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer’s Disease as identified by STRING and IPA analyses. Conversely, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increased in the cells entrained with old serum. Genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions. We did not observe a global difference in the distribution of phase between groups, but found that peak expression of several clock-controlled genes (<i>PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2,</i> and <i>TEF</i>) lagged in the cells synchronized ex vivo with old serum. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that age-dependent blood-borne factors affect circadian rhythms in peripheral cells and have the potential to impact health and disease via maintaining or disrupting rhythms respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92914">A scenario for an evolutionary selection of ageing</a></h4>

              
                Signs of ageing become apparent only late in life, after organismal development is finalized. Ageing, most notably, decreases an individual’s fitness. As such, it is most commonly perceived as a non-adaptive force of evolution and considered a by-product of natural selection. Building upon the evolutionarily conserved age-related Smurf phenotype, we propose a simple mathematical life-history trait model in which an organism is characterized by two core abilities: reproduction and homeostasis. Through the simulation of this model, we observe (1) the convergence of fertility’s end with the onset of senescence, (2) the relative success of ageing populations, as compared to non-ageing populations, and (3) the enhanced evolvability (i.e. the generation of genetic variability) of ageing populations. In addition, we formally demonstrate the mathematical convergence observed in (1). We thus theorize that mechanisms that link the timing of fertility and ageing have been selected and fixed over evolutionary history, which, in turn, explains why ageing populations are more evolvable and therefore more successful. Broadly speaking, our work suggests that ageing is an adaptive force of evolution.

                Interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons are critical to computations in cortical circuits but their organization is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological approaches. Within the medial entorhinal cortex, representation of location by grid and other spatial cells involves circuits in layer 2 in which excitatory stellate cells interact with each other via inhibitory parvalbumin expressing interneurons. Whether this connectivity is structured to support local circuit computations is unclear. Here, we introduce strategies to address the functional organization of excitatory-inhibitory interactions using crossed Cre- and Flp-driver mouse lines to direct targeted presynaptic optogenetic activation and postsynaptic cell identification. We then use simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from postsynaptic neurons to assess their shared input from optically activated presynaptic populations. We find that extensive axonal projections support spatially organized connectivity between stellate cells and parvalbumin interneurons, such that direct connections are often, but not always, shared by nearby neurons, whereas multisynaptic interactions coordinate inputs to neurons with greater spatial separation. We suggest that direct excitatory-inhibitory synaptic interactions may operate at the scale of grid cell clusters, with local modules defined by excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, while indirect interactions may coordinate activity at the scale of grid cell modules.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98096">FGF8-mediated gene regulation affects regional identity in human cerebral organoids</a></h4>

              
                The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses <i>via</i> modulation of early target genes. The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development. We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an <i>in vitro </i>platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic domains, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103035">Distinct functions of three Wnt proteins control mirror-symmetric organogenesis in the C. elegans gonad</a></h4>

              
                Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs; Z1 and Z4). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins (CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1(RNAi) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99643">Conservation of the cooling agent binding pocket within the TRPM subfamily</a></h4>

              
                Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a large and diverse family of tetrameric cation-selective channels that are activated by many different types of stimuli, including noxious heat or cold, organic ligands such as vanilloids or cooling agents, or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Structures available for all subtypes of TRP channels reveal that the transmembrane domains are closely related despite their unique sensitivity to activating stimuli. Here, we use computational and electrophysiological approaches to explore the conservation of the cooling agent binding pocket identified within the S1–S4 domain of the Melastatin subfamily member TRPM8, the mammalian sensor of noxious cold, with other TRPM channel subtypes. We find that a subset of TRPM channels, including TRPM2, TRPM4, and TRPM5, contain pockets very similar to the cooling agent binding pocket in TRPM8. We then show how the cooling agent icilin modulates activation of mouse TRPM4 to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, enhancing the sensitivity of the channel to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diminishing outward-rectification to promote opening at negative voltages. Mutations known to promote or diminish activation of TRPM8 by cooling agents similarly alter activation of TRPM4 by icilin, suggesting that icilin binds to the cooling agent binding pocket to promote opening of the channel. These findings demonstrate that TRPM4 and TRPM8 channels share related ligand binding pockets that are allosterically coupled to opening of the pore.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94811">Human DCP1 is crucial for mRNA decapping and possesses paralog-specific gene regulating functions</a></h4>

              
                The mRNA 5'-cap structure removal by the decapping enzyme DCP2 is a critical step in gene regulation. While DCP2 is the catalytic subunit in the decapping complex, its activity is strongly enhanced by multiple factors, particularly DCP1, which is the major activator in yeast. However, the precise role of DCP1 in metazoans has yet to be fully elucidated. Moreover, in humans, the specific biological functions of the two DCP1 paralogs, DCP1a and DCP1b, remain largely unknown. To investigate the role of human DCP1, we generated cell lines that were deficient in DCP1a, DCP1b, or both to evaluate the importance of DCP1 in the decapping machinery. Our results highlight the importance of human DCP1 in decapping process and show that the EVH1 domain of DCP1 enhances the mRNA-binding affinity of DCP2. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses outline the distinct functions of DCP1a and DCP1b in human cells, regulating specific endogenous mRNA targets and biological processes. Overall, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of human DCP1 in mRNA decapping and shed light on the distinct functions of its paralogs.

	<p>Background: In this systematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we aimed to assess differences in the cognitive processes associated with social cognition&amp;amp;mdash;namely language, theory of mind (ToM), and executive functions (EFs)&amp;amp;mdash;between ADHD and control groups. Methods: The review included studies indexed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO up until May 2024. Eligible original peer-reviewed articles met the following criteria: they were written in English, included a clinical group with a current primary ADHD diagnosis, were empirical, included quantitative data, and utilized standardized and validated measures with adequate psychometric properties to assess social cognitive processes. Results and Discussion: A total of 1215 individuals with ADHD participated in the selected studies. Out of the 22 articles reviewed, 17 reported significant differences between ADHD and the controls across several cognitive processes related to language and EF rather than ToM. These processes included pragmatic skills, verbal and nonverbal communication, emotional prosody, interaction skills, sarcasm, paradoxical sarcasm recognition, ambiguous situations, emotion recognition, false belief, social problem solving, social behaviors, and gesture codification. We also discuss the limitations of the research and the implications of our findings. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42023474681.</p>

	<p>Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) impacts not only diagnosed individuals, but also significantly affects the quality of life of both primary and secondary caregivers. These effects are particularly pronounced when compared to caregivers of individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders. The emotional and physical demands of caring for someone with ASD can profoundly alter family dynamics and interpersonal relationships, creating challenges that require a comprehensive approach to be understood and addressed. Methods: The methodological design is a narrative review study, based on a search conducted during May, June, July, and August 2024 in the Scopus, Dialnet, and WoS databases concerning the object of study. As a result, a total of 197 articles were qualitatively analyzed. Of these, 36 articles were selected for a more detailed qualitative analysis, leading to a final sample of 14 documents. The selected studies were examined through qualitative content analysis. The inclusion criteria for this selection were as follows: empirical studies or research published in English or Spanish; open access via the Internet; categories limited to &amp;amp;ldquo;education/educational research&amp;amp;rdquo; relevant to the proposed objectives; and specific documents related to students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Results: The care of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has a significant and multifaceted impact on family life, deeply affecting the mental health of caregivers. These effects manifest in the form of chronic stress, anxiety, and interpersonal difficulties, altering family dynamics. The quality of life of caregivers varies depending on the coping strategies they employ, which are crucial for their emotional well-being. Conclusions: Understanding and optimizing these strategies is essential to mitigate the negative effects of caregiving and improving the overall well-being of families living with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research is lacking about the development of personality disorders (PDs) from adolescence to early adulthood. This study aimed to characterize the profile of high-risk adolescents compared to adolescents with full-blown PDs and adolescents with other psychiatric disorders and to identify clinical markers that constitute a risk profile. Methods: We evaluated 99 adolescents (12&amp;amp;ndash;17 years old) through DSM-5-based semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, cognitive tasks, and scales regarding functioning and disorder severity. We divided patients into three groups: 22 adolescents with full-blown personality disorder (FBPD), 57 adolescents at high risk for personality disorders (HPD), and 20 adolescents with other DSM-5 psychiatric disorders (OTH). At follow-up, 56 patients completed the assessment. Possible developmental trajectories of FBPD and HPD patients were remission (total or partial) of PD-related symptoms, stability of symptoms, or transition from HPD to FBPD. Results: FBPD adolescents had more impaired family backgrounds. At baseline, the HPD group was mainly composed of female patients, younger than the FBPD ones. Externalizing symptoms may represent prodromal symptoms of FBPD. High-risk patients who made the transition were younger than those who did not, and their mothers reported higher internalizing symptoms at baseline. None of the FBPD patients remitted. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of a PD &amp;amp;ldquo;at-risk mental state&amp;amp;rdquo; and the importance of the implementation of PD early detection and treatment in adolescents, regardless of patient age.</p>

	<p>Background: LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy is a social development protocol that uses LEGO&amp;amp;reg; activities to support the development of a wide range of interaction skills, enhancing prosocial behaviors and mitigating the challenges associated with mental health difficulties and behavioral issues commonly observed in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives: This study aimed to explore the effects of LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy on the social behavior and mental health of children with ASD, comparing stimulation mediated by expert and stimulation mediated by non-autistic peers. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Mackenzie Presbyterian University, ensuring adherence to ethical standards throughout the research process. Methods: This study involved 18 children with ASD, levels 1 or 2, with an intelligence quotient (IQ) above 70, and three typically developing peers, intelligence quotient (IQ) above 80, aged between 5 and 8 years old, of both sexes. Participants were randomized into three groups for stimulation (stimulation mediated by expert, by a non-autistic peer and control group). The measures were the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (parent and teacher versions), the Inventory of Difficulties in Executive Functions, Regulation, and Aversion to Delay&amp;amp;mdash;Child Version, the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Autistic Behavior Inventory. Results: After 14 sessions of 45 min in school settings, the participants of both groups (mediated by experts and non-autistic children) showed significant gains on social behavior. A statistically significant difference was observed between baseline sessions and probes (&amp;amp;chi;2 (5) = 25.905, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These gains were maintained in both follow-up points, 30 and 90 days after the completion of the stimulation sessions. Additionally, maladaptive behavior showed a significant decline when compared pre- and post-intervention. These improvements were sustained during follow-up assessments at 30 and 90 days. Conclusions: The results suggest that a structured intervention combined with peer-mediated stimulation may be an effective method for promoting adaptive and prosocial behaviors in children with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Elder abuse, and more specifically financial exploitation, is expected to be a major problem in modern societies as the worldwide population is getting older. Neuropsychological protocols regarding financial capacity assessment are the only available window allowing us to view the cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;emotional&amp;amp;ndash;behavioral strengths/deficits and vulnerabilities of individuals. Given the paucity of relevant research in Greece in the most vulnerable individuals such as older adults suffering from neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), this systematic review attempts to investigate whether NCDs impair financial capacity and to highlight the most important factors that can predict financial incapacity in Greek older patients and the likelihood of financial abuse. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Results: The search identified n = 21 relevant research articles. The synthesis of available evidence supports that financial incapacity is clearly demonstrated in the group of Greek older adults suffering from NCDs of different severity and etiology; thus, such changes can assist diagnosis, treatment, and care of these individuals, but the implications for elder abuse in the Greek cultural context have not been examined in detail so far. Conclusions: Given the unique source of information that neuropsychological assessments represent by revealing the importance of factors such as arithmetic cognition and relevant brain volume changes in the left angular gyrus, depressive mood, apathy, frailty, vascular risk factors, and financial illiteracy, forensic neuropsychology can play a vital role in protecting older individuals from financial abuse.</p>

	<p>Background: Our understanding of the relationship between neural activity and psychological states has advanced greatly in recent decades. But we are still unable to explain conscious experience in terms of physical processes occurring in our brains. Methods: This paper introduces a conceptual framework that may contribute to an explanation. All physical processes entail the transfer, transduction, and transformation of energy between portions of matter as work is performed in material systems. If the production of consciousness in nervous systems is a physical process, then it must entail the same. Here the nervous system, and the brain in particular, is considered as a material system that transfers, transduces, and transforms energy as it performs biophysical work. Conclusions: Evidence from neuroscience suggests that conscious experience is produced in the organic matter of nervous systems when they perform biophysical work at classical and quantum scales with a certain level of dynamic complexity or organization. An empirically grounded, falsifiable, and testable hypothesis is offered to explain how energy processing in nervous systems may produce conscious experience at a fundamental physical level.</p>

                Background This study examined the effect of thermocycling on the flexural strength properties of four CAD/CAM ceramic materials at different thicknesses. Methods Four CAD/CAM ceramics of different types: advanced lithium disilicate (ALD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) lithium disilicate (LD), and leucite reinforced (LE), and at three varying thicknesses 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were examined. After subjecting all specimens to 5000 thermomechanical cycles, flexural strength was determined using a universal testing apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for analysis. Two factorial ANOVA models assessed the association of different factors (ceramic type and thickness) with flexural strength and elastic modulus. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted means were computed. A p-value < 0.05 was designated significant. Results ZLS exhibited the highest flexural strength at 1.5 mm thickness, while LD showed the highest Young’s modulus of elasticity. The lowest flexural strength was observed in the 0.5 mm thickness group. There were notable variations in flexural strength across all ceramic materials, with the highest adjusted mean strength in the ZLS group, ALD, LD, and LE, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were noted in ceramic thickness, with 1.5 mm thickness showing the highest strength and 0.5 mm thickness the lowest. Conclusions Ceramic material thickness significantly impacts flexural strength, with 1.5 mm thickness deemed suitable for posterior restorations. Ceramic materials with zirconia fillers or matrix demonstrated higher flexural strength than other ceramics.

                Background Different usage scenarios and design guidelines were considered when planning a factory building and its ventilation system. Accordingly, it often makes sense to analyze the actual operating conditions again during subsequent operations in order to optimally adapt the air supply to the respective conditions in terms of demand-responsive ventilation. The aim is to ensure good indoor air quality and thermal comfort while significantly reducing energy consumption. Methods For this purpose, in addition to the sensors in the building management system, approximately 120 wireless sensors were installed in the occupied areas to measure the air temperature, operating temperature, humidity, and CO2. In this way the spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, humidity, and CO2 in the hall were visualized and evaluated to reduce the volume flows of the ventilation systems. The recorded data and findings were used to optimize ventilation systems by gaining a deeper understanding of indoor air flow. Results As part of the investigation, a considerable reduction in the air volume flows and thus the required energy consumption of the air handling units was achieved while maintaining the same thermal comfort. It was shown that the temperature field and indoor air quality were not negatively affected by the change in the air volume flow over a wide range. Conclusions This was made possible by the well-designed ventilation system, which achieves a low-pulse, slightly stratified indoor airflow, and a structural envelope with very good thermal insulation.

                Background Global environmental degradation is increasingly driving poor health outcomes worldwide. Healthcare systems and services are often not environmentally sustainable and compound the problem, while healthcare professionals are also recognised as key leaders in advancing sustainable healthcare. To adopt this leadership position, healthcare professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding environmental sustainability in healthcare must be established. This article reports the development and validation of a new instrument for this purpose that corresponds to the specificities of the Southern African context. Methods Questionnaire development followed a seven-stage process. Information was obtained from a 2021 study titled ‘South African Healthcare Professionals’ Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare: A Mixed-Methods Study’ to develop the instrument. Information was also sourced from the literature regarding environmental sustainability and healthcare to generate the first questionnaire with 29 items. The following stages included two rounds of expert input, separated by a pilot study with the target population to receive feedback regarding the instrument’s structure, relevance, and length. Content validity was determined through statistical analysis. Results Feedback was received from nine experts in stage two and 13 pilot-study participants in stage four and incorporated to improve the questionnaire. In stage six, the questionnaire was rated by seven experts. The content validity index of the questionnaire was calculated at two different stages, after which the indices were compared. Following a final edit, the questionnaire has 24 questionnaire items. The closing analysis calculated the scale content validity index average (S-CVI/Ave) of 0,922; this indicates that the final questionnaire has excellent content validity. Conclusion A questionnaire that assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals regarding environmental sustainability in Southern Africa has been developed and validated. This questionnaire can now be used for further studies in Southern Africa.

                Background Concerns regarding academic efficiency at the postgraduate level in university programs require attention from those responsible for making university administrative decisions. This study aimed to determine the terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students enrolled in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years. Methods This cross-sectional study considered all records of documents submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty in the programs offered by a dental school, published in its institutional repository between 2017 and 2023. The study variable was terminal efficiency (TE), considered both as a quantitative and qualitative variable. Additionally, some covariates were included, such as the year of formal document submission, the mode of document preparation, the second professional specialty in dentistry, and sex. Descriptive analysis was conducted to obtain absolute and relative frequencies. Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results From the evaluation of TE between 2017 and 2023, it was observed that 72.09% (n=186) of students with a document submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty and published in the repository had a TE categorized of “Up to 1 year”. Likewise, the mean TE was 0.95 years (SD=1.25), with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) between medians when evaluated based on the year of formal document submission and the dental specialty program. Conclusion The mean terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years was 0.95 years.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                Background The discoveries of Mulatu’s numbers, better known as Mulatu’s sequence, represent revolutionary contributions to the mathematical world. His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, beautiful and incredible patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. GNU Octave (version 9, (1)) software was applied to verify the existence, classify, and conduct computational investigations of findings prior to formal proofs. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these fascinating numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers also give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties. Furthermore, these findings play a vital role in the boarder context of mathematical sequences, contributing significantly to the field.

                <p>by Gabriel A. A. Silva, Avril M. Harder, Kenneth B. Kirksey, Samarth Mathur, Janna R. Willoughby</p>

Wild populations are increasingly threatened by human-mediated climate change and land use changes. As populations decline, the probability of inbreeding increases, along with the potential for negative effects on individual fitness. Detecting and characterizing runs of homozygosity (ROHs) is a popular strategy for assessing the extent of individual inbreeding present in a population and can also shed light on the genetic mechanisms contributing to inbreeding depression. Here, we analyze simulated and empirical datasets to demonstrate the downstream effects of program selection and long-term demographic history on ROH inference, leading to context-dependent biases in the results. Through a sensitivity analysis we evaluate how various parameter values impact on ROH-calling results, highlighting its utility as a tool for parameter exploration. Our results indicate that ROH inferences are sensitive to factors such as sequencing depth and ROH length distribution, and with bias direction and magnitude varying with demographic history and the programs used. Estimation biases are particularly pronounced at lower sequencing depths, potentially leading to either underestimation or overestimation of inbreeding. These results are particularly important for the management of endangered species, as underestimating inbreeding signals in the genome can substantially undermine conservation initiatives. We also found that small true ROHs can be incorrectly lumped together and called as longer ROHs, leading to erroneous inference of recent inbreeding. To address these challenges, we suggest using a combination of ROH detection tools and ROH length-specific inferences, along with sensitivity analysis, to generate robust and context-appropriate population inferences regarding inbreeding history. We outline these recommendations for ROH estimation at multiple levels of sequencing effort, which are typical of conservation genomics studies.

                <p>by Lingxia Qiao, Michael Getz, Ben Gross, Brian Tenner, Jin Zhang, Padmini Rangamani</p>

The nanoscale organization of enzymes associated with the dynamics of second messengers is critical for ensuring compartmentation and localization of signaling molecules in cells. Specifically, the spatiotemporal orchestration of cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations is critical for many cellular functions. Previous experimental studies have shown that the formation of nanodomains of A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP150) and adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) on the surface of pancreatic MIN6 β cells modulates the phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP oscillations from out-of-phase to in-phase. In this work, we develop computational models of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP pathway and AKAP/AC nanodomain formation that give rise to the two important predictions: instead of an arbitrary phase difference, the out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation reaches Ca<sup>2+</sup> trough and cAMP peak simultaneously, which is defined as inversely out-of-phase; the in-phase and inversely out-of-phase oscillations associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP dynamics on and away from the nanodomains can be explained by an incoherent feedforward loop. Factors such as cellular surface-to-volume ratio, compartment size, and distance between nanodomains do not affect the existence of in-phase or inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation, but cellular surface-to-volume ratio and compartment size can affect the time delay for the inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation while the distance between two nanodomains does not. Finally, we predict that both the Turing pattern-generated nanodomains and experimentally measured nanodomains demonstrate the existence of in-phase and inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation when the AC8 is at a low level, consistent with the behavior of an incoherent feedforward loop. These findings unveil the key circuit motif that governs cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and advance our understanding of how nanodomains can lead to spatial compartmentation of second messengers.

                <p>by Emmanouil Giannakakis, Oleg Vinogradov, Victor Buendía, Anna Levina</p>

Cortical neurons are versatile and efficient coding units that develop strong preferences for specific stimulus characteristics. The sharpness of tuning and coding efficiency is hypothesized to be controlled by delicately balanced excitation and inhibition. These observations suggest a need for detailed co-tuning of excitatory and inhibitory populations. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that a combination of plasticity rules can lead to the emergence of excitation/inhibition (E/I) co-tuning in neurons driven by independent, low-noise signals. However, cortical signals are typically noisy and originate from highly recurrent networks, generating correlations in the inputs. This raises questions about the ability of plasticity mechanisms to self-organize co-tuned connectivity in neurons receiving noisy, correlated inputs. Here, we study the emergence of input selectivity and weight co-tuning in a neuron receiving input from a recurrent network via plastic feedforward connections. We demonstrate that while strong noise levels destroy the emergence of co-tuning in the readout neuron, introducing specific structures in the non-plastic pre-synaptic connectivity can re-establish it by generating a favourable correlation structure in the population activity. We further show that structured recurrent connectivity can impact the statistics in fully plastic recurrent networks, driving the formation of co-tuning in neurons that do not receive direct input from other areas. Our findings indicate that the network dynamics created by simple, biologically plausible structural connectivity patterns can enhance the ability of synaptic plasticity to learn input-output relationships in higher brain areas.

In 2008–2011 Forsyth County, North Carolina experienced a four-fold increase in syphilis rising to over 35 cases per 100,000 mirroring the 2021 state syphilis rate. Our methodology extends current models with: 1) donut geomasking to enhance resolution while protecting patient privacy; 2) a moving window uniform grid to control the modifiable area unit problem, edge effect and remove kriging islands; and 3) mitigating the “small number problem” with Uniform Model Bayesian Maximum Entropy. Data is 2008–2011 early syphilis cases reported to the NC Department of Health and Human Services for Forsyth County. Results were assessed using latent rate theory cross validation. We show combining a moving window and a UMBME analysis with geomasked data effectively predicted the true or latent syphilis rate 5% to 26% more accurate than the traditional, geopolitical boundary method. It removed kriging islands, reduced background incidence rate to 0, relocated nine outbreak hotspots to more realistic locations, and elucidated hotspot connectivity producing more realistic geographical patterns for targeted insights. Using the Forsyth outbreak as a case study showed how the outbreak emerged from endemic areas spreading through sexual core transmitters and contextualizing the outbreak to current and past outbreaks. As the dynamics of sexually transmitted infections spread have changed to online partnership selection and demographically to include more women, partnership selection continues to remain highly localized. Furthermore, it is important to present methods to increase interpretability and accuracy of visual representations of data.

Curiosity-driven exploration involves actively engaging with the environment to learn from it. Here, we hypothesize that the cognitive mechanisms underlying exploratory behavior may differ across individuals depending on personal characteristics such as autistic traits. In turn, this variability might influence successful exploration. To investigate this, we collected self- and other-reports of autistic traits from university students, and tested them in an exploration task in which participants could learn the hiding patterns of multiple characters. Participants’ prediction errors and learning progress (i.e., the decrease in prediction error) on the task were tracked with a hierarchical delta-rule model. Crucially, participants could freely decide when to disengage from a character and what to explore next. We examined whether autistic traits modulated the relation of prediction errors and learning progress with exploration. We found that participants with lower scores on other-reports of insistence-on-sameness and general autistic traits were less persistent, primarily relying on learning progress during the initial stages of exploration. Conversely, participants with higher scores were more persistent and relied on learning progress in later phases of exploration, resulting in better performance in the task. This research advances our understanding of the interplay between autistic traits and exploration drives, emphasizing the importance of individual traits in learning processes and highlighting the need for personalized learning approaches.

                <p>by Malin Ramne, Jon Sensinger</p>

Pain perception is influenced not only by sensory input from afferent neurons but also by cognitive factors such as prior expectations. It has been suggested that overly precise priors may be a key contributing factor to chronic pain states such as neuropathic pain. However, it remains an open question how overly precise priors in favor of pain might arise. Here, we first verify that a Bayesian approach can describe how statistical integration of prior expectations and sensory input results in pain phenomena such as placebo hypoalgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, chronic pain, and spontaneous neuropathic pain. Our results indicate that the value of the prior, which is determined by the internal model parameters, may be a key contributor to these phenomena. Next, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian approach to update the parameters of the internal model based on the difference between the predicted and the perceived pain, to reflect that people integrate prior experiences in their future expectations. In contrast with simpler approaches, this hierarchical model structure is able to show for placebo hypoalgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia how these phenomena can arise from prior experiences in the form of a classical conditioning procedure. We also demonstrate the phenomenon of offset analgesia, in which a disproportionally large pain decrease is obtained following a minor reduction in noxious stimulus intensity. Finally, we turn to simulations of neuropathic pain, where our hierarchical model corroborates that persistent non-neuropathic pain is a risk factor for developing neuropathic pain following denervation, and additionally offers an interesting prediction that complete absence of informative painful experiences could be a similar risk factor. Taken together, these results provide insight to how prior experiences may contribute to pain perception, in both experimental and neuropathic pain, which in turn might be informative for improving strategies of pain prevention and relief.

                <p>by Tamjid A. Chowdhury, David A. Luy, Garrett Scapellato, Dorian Farache, Amy S. Y. Lee, Christopher C. Quinn</p>

Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be a key component of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that protect against mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment. Here, we address this question through the investigation of <i>rbm-26</i>, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ortholog of the <i>RBM27</i> autism candidate gene, which encodes an RNA-binding protein whose role in neurons is unknown. We report that RBM-26 (RBM26/27) protects against axonal defects by negatively regulating expression of the MALS-1 (MALSU1) mitoribosomal assembly factor. Autism-associated missense variants in RBM-26 cause a sharp decrease in RBM-26 protein expression along with defects in axon overlap and axon degeneration that occurs during larval development. Using a biochemical screen, we identified the mRNA for the MALS-1 mitoribosomal assembly factor as a binding partner for RBM-26. Loss of RBM-26 function causes a dramatic overexpression of <i>mals-1</i> mRNA and MALS-1 protein. Moreover, genetic analysis indicates that this overexpression of MALS-1 is responsible for the mitochondrial and axon degeneration defects in <i>rbm-26</i> mutants. These observations reveal a mechanism that regulates expression of a mitoribosomal assembly factor to protect against axon degeneration during neurodevelopment.

                <p>by F. Chris Bennett, Mariko L. Bennett</p>

Clearance of dying neurons by microglia is critical to healthy neurodevelopment, but what else do microglia eat? A new study in PLOS Biology demonstrates that microglia not only eat neurons but each other, and that this “microglia cannibalism” causes necroptotic cell death.

During brain development, neurons are selectively cleared by microglia to sculpt neural circuits. This primer discusses a recent study in PLOS Biology showing that microglia also clear away debris from other microglia, which is followed by microglial necroptosis.

The spinal cord is of fundamental importance for integrative processing in brain–body communication, yet routine noninvasive recordings in humans are hindered by vast methodological challenges. Here, we overcome these challenges by developing an easy-to-use electrophysiological approach based on high-density multichannel spinal recordings combined with multivariate spatial-filtering analyses. These advances enable a spatiotemporal characterization of spinal cord responses and demonstrate a sensitivity that permits assessing even single-trial responses. To furthermore enable the study of integrative processing along the neural processing hierarchy in somatosensation, we expand this approach by simultaneous peripheral, spinal, and cortical recordings and provide direct evidence that bottom-up integrative processing occurs already within the spinal cord and thus after the first synaptic relay in the central nervous system. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by providing noninvasive recordings of nociceptive spinal cord responses during heat-pain stimulation. Beyond establishing a new window on human spinal cord function at millisecond timescale, this work provides the foundation to study brain–body communication in its entirety in health and disease.

                <p>by Philipp Huettemann, Pavithra Mahadevan, Justine Lempart, Eric Tse, Budheswar Dehury, Brian F. P. Edwards, Daniel R. Southworth, Bikash R. Sahoo, Ursula Jakob</p>

Aberrant aggregation of α-Synuclein is the pathological hallmark of a set of neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have led to the structural determination of the first synucleinopathy-derived α-Synuclein fibrils, which contain a non-proteinaceous, “mystery density” at the core of the protofilaments, hypothesized to be highly negatively charged. Guided by previous studies that demonstrated that polyphosphate (polyP), a universally conserved polyanion, significantly accelerates α-Synuclein fibril formation, we conducted blind docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments to model the polyP binding site in α-Synuclein fibrils. Here, we demonstrate that our models uniformly place polyP into the lysine-rich pocket, which coordinates the mystery density in patient-derived fibrils. Subsequent in vitro studies and experiments in cells revealed that substitution of the 2 critical lysine residues K43 and K45 with alanine residues leads to a loss of all previously reported effects of polyP binding on α-Synuclein, including stimulation of fibril formation, change in filament conformation and stability as well as alleviation of cytotoxicity. In summary, our study demonstrates that polyP fits the unknown electron density present in in vivo α-Synuclein fibrils and suggests that polyP exerts its functions by neutralizing charge repulsion between neighboring lysine residues.

                Reproducibility is a basis of scientific integrity, yet it remains a significant challenge across disciplines in computational science. This reproducibility crisis is now being met with an Open Science movement, which has risen to prominence within the scientific community and academic libraries especially. To address the need for reproducible computational research and promote Open Science within the community, members of the Open Science and Data Collaborations Program at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries organized a single-day hackathon centered around reproducibility. Partnering with a faculty researcher in English and Digital Humanities, this event allowed several students an opportunity to interact with real research outputs, test the reproducibility of data analyses with code, and offer feedback for improvements. With Python code and data shared by the researcher in an open repository, we revealed that students could successfully reproduce most of the data visualizations, but they required completing some manual setup and modifications to address depreciated libraries to successfully rerun the code. During the event, we also investigated the option of using ChatGPT to debug and troubleshoot rerunning this code. By interacting with a ChatGPT API in the code, we found and addressed the same roadblocks and successfully reproduced the same figures as the participating students. Assessing a second option, we also collaborated with the researcher to publish a compute capsule in Code Ocean. This option presented an alternative to manual setup and modifications, an accessible option for more limited devices like tablets, and a simple solution for outside researchers to modify or build on existing research code.

                Background Coffee-growing communities in Yayu, Southwestern Ethiopia, are perceived to be food secure due to income from coffee production. However, while income ensures caloric sufficiency, it does not necessarily translate into complete food security, especially in terms of nutrient intake. Our study assessed the food and nutrition security of smallholder farm households in Yayu, with a particular focus on dietary diversity and hidden hunger. We found significant gaps in nutritional intake, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and children under five. Policy and Implications Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) targets food-insecure areas based on economic status, assuming that income ensures food security. However, our findings suggest that this approach may be flawed, as households in coffee-growing regions are often labeled food secure despite significant deficiencies in essential nutrients such as heme iron. This calls for a re-evaluation of food security policies in cash-crop-dominated areas to address not only income but also access to diverse and nutrient-rich foods. Recommendations 1. Enhance Nutritional Education: Implement targeted educational programs focusing on the importance of dietary diversity, particularly in coffee-producing areas. 2. Diversify Agriculture: Encourage smallholder farmers to diversify crops, integrating nutrient-dense foods alongside coffee cultivation. 3. Improve Market Access: Strengthen local markets to ensure that nutrient-rich foods are available and affordable during both surplus and shortage seasons. 4. Revise PSNP Criteria: Use localized food and nutrition data rather than income alone to identify food insecurity in cash-crop regions. Conclusion Income from coffee production in Yayu improves caloric sufficiency but does not guarantee nutritional adequacy. To combat hidden hunger, policies must move beyond income-based indicators of food security and prioritize access to diverse, nutrient-rich foods. This will ensure a more comprehensive approach to food and nutrition security in Ethiopia’s coffee-growing regions.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses high mortality and morbidity rates with limited evidence-based therapeutic approaches. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the management of ICH.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This systematic review and meta-analysis followed recommended guidelines and protocols. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to April 12, 2024. The inclusion was restricted to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of high quality, ensuring they were not deemed to have a high risk of bias in any of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) domains. Primary outcomes were good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0–3) and mortality beyond 90 days. Secondary outcomes were early mortality within 30 days and rebleeding rates. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fourteen high-quality RCTs were included. There were 3,027 patients with ICH (1,475 randomized to MIS, and 1,452 randomized to medical management or craniotomy). Of included patients, 1,899 (62.7%) were males. MIS resulted in higher odds of achieving long-term good functional outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.25–1.82]), lower odds of long-term mortality (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90]) and lower odds of early mortality (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.95]). Rebleeding rates were similar (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.55–2.19]). The treatment effect of MIS was consistent across multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including individuals with deep ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This meta-analysis provides high-quality clinical trial evidence supporting the use of MIS as a primary treatment strategy in the management of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background During pregnancy, the placenta is an extremely important organ as it secretes its own hormones, e.g. insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), to ensure proper intrauterine fetal growth and development. Ethanol, an addictive and widely used drug, has numerous adverse effects during pregnancy, including fetal growth restriction (FGR). To date, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol triggers its toxic effects during pregnancy, particularly in the placenta, are not entirely known. For this reason, a murine model of partial IGF-1 deficiency was used to determine ethanol alterations in placental morphology and aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase (AAH) expression. Methods Wild type (WT, Igf1 +/+) and heterozygous (HZ, Igf1 +/-) female mice were given 10% ethanol in water during 14 days as an acclimation period and throughout pregnancy. WT and HZ female mice given water were used as controls. At gestational day 19, pregnant dams were sacrificed, placentas were collected and genotyped for subsequent studies. Results IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption during pregnancy altered placental morphology, and decreased placental efficiency and AAH expression in placentas from all genotypes. No differences were found in Igf1, Igf2, Igf1r and Igf2r mRNA expression in placentas from all groups. Conclusions IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption throughout gestation altered placental development, suggesting the crucial role of IGF-1 in the establishment of an adequate intrauterine environment that allows fetal growth. However, more studies are needed to study the precise mechanism to stablish the relation between both insults.

                Background Disregulation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) preformance status at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. We also observe that some glioma patients have increased prothrombin time compared to reference values. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from altered coagulation states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance, measurement, and treatment of abnormal coagulation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background People need critical thinking skills to make well-informed health choices and avoid waste and unnecessary suffering. However, educational interventions can have adverse effects, which is often overlooked. We created a framework of potential harms of interventions to improve critical thinking about health choices. The objective was to identify potential effects and articulate potential mechanisms. We intended to use the framework to inform the development and evaluation of an intervention in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Methods We created an initial framework drawing on two earlier frameworks. We surveyed external experts using Likert-scale and open-ended items, including researchers, educators, and others, in a variety of relevant fields. We emailed the survey to an international advisory network, and all other experts recommended by respondents. We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We revised the framework based on those results. To identify any effects missing from the revised framework, we individually interviewed a convenience sample of one teacher from each of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Results We received responses from 38 of 70 external experts (54%). The quantitative survey data suggested respondents agreed with the initial framework overall. However, the qualitative data led to substantial revisions. The revised framework consists of categories of adverse outcomes; outcomes within each category; sub-outcomes; individuals, groups, and populations that might experience each adverse outcome; beneficial outcomes corresponding with adverse outcomes; and potential mechanisms of adverse effects. There are six categories: decision-making harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, waste, and other harms. In the interviews with teachers, we did not identify any effects missing from the revised framework. Conclusions As far as we know, the framework is the first tool of its kind for education research. It can be improved upon and adapted.
