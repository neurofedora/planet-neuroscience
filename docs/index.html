              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Molecular ontology of the parabrachial nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Diverse neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PB) communicate with widespread brain regions. Despite evidence linking them to a variety of homeostatic functions, it remains difficult to determine which PB neurons influence which functions because their subpopulations intermingle extensively. An improved framework for identifying these intermingled subpopulations would help advance our understanding of neural circuit functions linked to this region. Here, we present the foundation of a developmental-genetic ontology that classifies PB neurons based on their intrinsic, molecular features. By combining transcription factor labeling with Cre fate-mapping, we find that the PB is a blend of two, developmentally distinct macropopulations of glutamatergic neurons. Neurons in the first macropopulation express <i>Lmx1b</i> (and, to a lesser extent, <i>Lmx1a</i>) and are mutually exclusive with those in a second macropopulation, which derive from precursors expressing <i>Atoh1</i>. This second, <i>Atoh1</i>-derived macropopulation includes many <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing neurons, but <i>Foxp2</i> also identifies a subset of <i>Lmx1b</i>-expressing neurons in the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) and a population of GABAergic neurons ventrolateral to the PB (“caudal KF”). Immediately ventral to the PB, <i>Phox2b</i>-expressing glutamatergic neurons (some co-expressing <i>Lmx1b</i>) occupy the KF, supratrigeminal nucleus, and reticular formation. We show that this molecular framework organizes subsidiary patterns of adult gene expression (including <i>Satb2</i>, <i>Calca</i>, <i>Grp</i>, <i>Pdyn</i>) and predicts output projections to the amygdala (<i>Lmx1b</i>), hypothalamus (<i>Atoh1</i>), and hindbrain (<i>Phox2b</i>/<i>Lmx1b</i>). Using this molecular ontology to organize, interpret, and communicate PB-related information could accelerate the translation of experimental findings from animal models to human patients.</p>

                Abstract Background Childbirth is a life-transforming intense event to a woman and her family. Even though a variety of non-pharmacological techniques are readily available to alleviate the distress of women in labour, the majority of women are unaware of its benefits. The objective of the study was to explore the impact of a simple non-pharmacological technique i.e., antepartum breathing exercises on maternal outcomes of labour among primigravid women. Methods A single centre prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at the antenatal outpatient clinic of a secondary healthcare institution. Eligible primigravid women were randomized into intervention and standard care groups. Both groups received standard obstetrical care. In addition, the intervention group were taught antepartum breathing exercises and were advised to practise daily and also during the active stage of labour. The primary outcome of the trial was the maternal outcome of labour measured in terms of onset of labour, nature of delivery, duration of labour, and need for augmentation of labour. Data was collected using World Health Organization (WHO) partograph, structured observational record on the outcome of labour. Results A total of 98 (70%) primigravid women who practised antepartum breathing exercises had spontaneous onset of labour. The odds of spontaneous onset of labour after randomization in the intervention group was 2.192 times more when compared to standard care at a (95% confidence interval 1.31–3.36, p<.001). Also, the requirement for augmentation of labour was minimal and there was a reduction in the rate of caesarean deliveries (p <.05) based on the χ2 test. The overall mean duration of labour was less compared to standard care group F(1)= 133.800, p <.001. Conclusion Antepartum breathing exercises during labour can facilitate spontaneous vaginal birth, shorten the duration of labour, and reduce the need for operative interference.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">All eyes on COVID-19, let's not forget Tuberculosis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis (TB) is a severe global threat killing more than one million people annually (WHO). With a successful TB control programme in place, there has been a decrease in the number of TB cases and deaths globally over recent years. The World Health Organisation (WHO) End TB Strategy has been momentously shocked by the COVID-19 pandemic and it seems that any success made over recent years is likely to be reversed. We are now more than one year into the pandemic, and the effect COVID-19 has had on TB services is devastating. Hospitals typically dedicated to TB have been converted to COVID-19 hospitals and diagnostic laboratories focus on COVID-19 testing rather than TB. Delivery of TB care is being prioritised for people who have active TB disease whereas prevention and diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI) is being put on hold. This pause can lead to an increase in TB cases and transmission. Here, we discuss the connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and latent TB and highlight the importance of TB prevention management in LTBI post-COVID-19 patients. Community engagement and contact tracing are of high importance in fighting TB in the post-COVID19 era. Getting back on track with TB progress is essential, thus further modelling on the COVID-19 impact on TB burden and its determinants is critical.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inference of trajectory presence by tree dimension and subset specificity by subtree cover</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lovemore Tenha, Mingzhou Song</p>

The complexity of biological processes such as cell differentiation is reflected in dynamic transitions between cellular states. Trajectory inference arranges the states into a progression using methodologies propelled by single-cell biology. However, current methods, all returning a best trajectory, do not adequately assess statistical significance of noisy patterns, leading to uncertainty in inferred trajectories. We introduce a tree dimension test for trajectory presence in multivariate data by a dimension measure of Euclidean minimum spanning tree, a test statistic, and a null distribution. Computable in linear time to tree size, the tree dimension measure summarizes the extent of branching more effectively than globally insensitive number of leaves or tree diameter indifferent to secondary branches. The test statistic quantifies trajectory presence and its null distribution is estimated under the null hypothesis of no trajectory in data. On simulated and real single-cell datasets, the test outperformed the intuitive number of leaves and tree diameter statistics. Next, we developed a measure for the tissue specificity of the dynamics of a subset, based on the minimum subtree cover of the subset in a minimum spanning tree. We found that tissue specificity of pathway gene expression dynamics is conserved in human and mouse development: several signal transduction pathways including calcium and Wnt signaling are most tissue specific, while genetic information processing pathways such as ribosome and mismatch repair are least so. Neither the tree dimension test nor the subset specificity measure has any user parameter to tune. Our work opens a window to prioritize cellular dynamics and pathways in development and other multivariate dynamical systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In silico prediction of HIV-1-host molecular interactions and their directionality</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Haiting Chai, Quan Gu, Joseph Hughes, David L. Robertson</p>

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) continues to be a major cause of disease and premature death. As with all viruses, HIV-1 exploits a host cell to replicate. Improving our understanding of these molecular interactions between virus and human host proteins is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of virus biology, infection and host antiviral activities. This knowledge will potentially permit the identification of host molecules for targeting by drugs with antiviral properties. Here, we propose a data-driven approach for the analysis and prediction of the HIV-1 interacting proteins (VIPs) with a focus on the directionality of the interaction: host-dependency versus antiviral factors. Using support vector machine learning models and features encompassing genetic, proteomic and network properties, our results reveal some significant differences between the VIPs and non-HIV-1 interacting human proteins (non-VIPs). As assessed by comparison with the HIV-1 infection pathway data in the Reactome database (sensitivity > 90%, threshold = 0.5), we demonstrate these models have good generalization properties. We find that the ‘direction’ of the HIV-1-host molecular interactions is also predictable due to different characteristics of ‘forward’/pro-viral versus ‘backward’/pro-host proteins. Additionally, we infer the previously unknown direction of the interactions between HIV-1 and 1351 human host proteins. A web server for performing predictions is available at http://hivpre.cvr.gla.ac.uk/.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low back pain and associated risk factors among medical students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Different studies showed the high prevalence of LBP among medical students. However, no study has been conducted on Bangladeshi medical students to estimate the prevalence of LBP. This study determined the prevalence, characteristics, and associated risk factors of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 among randomly selected 270 medical students and medical interns in Faridpur Medical College, Bangladesh, using an online questionnaire. In data analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression were performed, and a p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 207 participants responded fully to the survey, and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 22.4 ± 1.9 years. The point, 6-month, and 12-month prevalence of LBP was 25.6%, 46.9%, and 63.3%, respectively. In most participants, LBP was localized (53.2%), recurrent (64.9%), non-specific (70.8%), affected for a short period (55%), and relieved without receiving any treatment (60.4%). Participants who had a significantly higher 12-month prevalence of LBP included females (72.2% vs 52.2%), with BMI >25 kg/m2 (73.2% vs 56.7%), those who performed physical activity at low to moderate frequency (72.4% vs 29.5%), those who spent > 6 hours/day by sitting (71.3% vs 45.3%), and those who did not have enough rest time (92.7% vs 56%). Ergonomic features of chairs, such as having back support, adjustable back support, and adjustable sitting surface, significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the outcomes. Conclusion: The prevalence of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh was high, and most of the risk factors associated with the high prevalence of LBP were modifiable. Hence, LBP can be prevented by implementing preventive strategies and providing ergonomic training and physical activity facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trap of weights: The reuse of weights in the floating catchment area (FCA) methods to measuring accessibility [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Geographic weights are vital in the floating catchment area (FCA) method of accessibility measurements due to their simulation of spatial barriers in various ways. When modelling population demand, geographical weights with different distance decay coefficients can reflect diverse distance tolerances in facility utilization and could lead to erratic accessibility results. Quantifying accessibility as the sum of weighted supply-demand ratios can alleviate the distance decay coefficient's influence and generate stable geographic patterns. However, the effects of weighted ratios on different FCA models and resources have not been investigated. Methods: To identify impacts of weighted ratios on various FCA variants, this study contrasted the accessibility calculated from the sum of ratios (access) and the sum of weighted ratios (access ratios) within three prevalent FCA models: enhanced two-step FCA (E2SFCA), modified two-step FCA (M2SFCA), and three-step FCA (3SFCA). In addition, the accessibilities of various resources evaluate the stability of the weighted ratios' effect. This study therefore examined the accessibilities to primary schools, job opportunities, and major hospitals in Shanghai. Shanghai is a case study that provides lessons on using big data to measure accessibility in metropolitan areas. Results: Geographic weights can not only mitigate the impact of the distance decay coefficients, but can also eliminate model features, which reduces the performance of the M2SFCA's supply decay and the 3SFCA's population demand adjustment in accessibility results. Moreover, weighted ratios tend to overestimate accessibility in marginal communities that lie within fewer catchments, regardless of the resource type. This tendency can lead to an epistemological trap that creates an inaccurate and counter-intuitive perception of resource distribution in a given area. Conclusions: The results identify a gap between the methodological logic and the empirical perception in accessibility measurements. This study concludes that the use of geographic weights needs to be cautious and epistemologically consistent.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mucosal microbiome is predictive of pediatric Crohn’s disease across geographic regions in North America [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) have an altered intestinal microbiome, which may facilitate novel diagnostic testing. However, accuracy of microbiome classification models across geographic regions may be limited. Therefore, we sought to examine geographic variation in the microbiome of patients with CD from North America and test the performance of a machine learning classification model across geographic regions. Methods: The RISK cohort included 447 pediatric patients with CD and 221 non-inflammatory bowel disease controls from across North America. Terminal ileum, rectal and fecal samples were obtained prior to treatment for microbiome analysis. We divided study sites into 3 geographic regions to examine regional microbiome differences. We trained and tested the performance of a machine learning classification model across these regions. Results: No differences were seen in the mucosal microbiome of patients with CD across regions or in either the fecal or mucosal microbiomes of controls. Machine learning classification algorithms for patients with CD performed well across regions (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] range of 0.85-0.91) with the best results from terminal ileum. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of microbiome based diagnostic testing in pediatric patients with CD within North America, independently from regional influences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Scopus based bibliometric and scientometric analysis of occupational therapy publications from 2001 to 2020 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Occupational therapy (OT) is one of the allied health professions that had its first journals way back in 1920. The main objective of this study was to find out the publication trend in the field of OT research for the period of 2001-2020 using the principles of bibliometrics and scientometrics. Methods: The data was retrieved from Scopus from the past 20-years (2001-2020). VOSviewer software was used to find year-wise publications in OT-specific and non-OT-specific Journals along with top journals, countries, organisations, authors, cited articles, and highly used keywords. Results: There was a steady growth of OT articles from the past 20-years. Scopus indexes 16 OT-specific journals are identified. American Journal of Occupational Therapy, British Journal of Occupational Therapy Journal, Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy and Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy are the leading publications and citations. Comparison of OT-specific and non-OT journals inferred that the OT-specific papers are three times more published in non-OT journals. There is a trend in publishing multidisciplinary medical journals than OT journals. The US publishes the highest number of articles, followed by the UK, Australia, Canada, and Germany. Though the US alone produced a considerable number of articles (9517), only five organisations are listed in the top-20, compared to Canada (n=6) and Australia (n=5). Australia represents the highest published authors (n=11/20), and Canada represents a highly cited author from the top-cited publications. The “occupational therapy”, “rehabilitation”, “stroke”, “physical therapy,” and “activities of daily living” are the five common keywords used by OT authors. This study lists top-20 journals along with their CiteScore and Journal Impact Factor. Conclusions: This study will help the budding researchers in OT to select a suitable quality journal for publication and, further, helpful for research promotion, researcher incentivising, grant allocations, and policymakers in the OT field.

                MicroRNA-encoded peptides (miPEPs) increase transcription of their nascent pri-miRNA. Lauressergues et al. show that pri-miRNAs are transcribed in different transcripts with different fates: maturation in miRNAs or translation in miPEPs. We reveal that specificity of miPEPs for their pri-miRNA relies on the presence of their encoding ORF in the pri-miRNA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reversing chemorefraction in colorectal cancer cells by controlling mucin secretion</a></h4>

              
                15% of colorectal cancers (CRC) cells exhibit a mucin hypersecretory phenotype, which is suggested to provide resistance to immune surveillance and chemotherapy. We now formally show that colorectal cancer cells build a barrier to chemotherapeutics by increasing mucins' secretion. We show that low levels of KChIP3, a negative regulator of mucin secretion (Cantero-Recasens <i>et al.</i>, 2018), is a risk factor for CRC patients' relapse in subset of untreated tumours. Our results also reveal that cells depleted of KChIP3 are four times more resistant (measured as cell viability and DNA damage) to chemotherapeutics 5-Fluorouracil plus Irinotecan (5-FU+iri.) compared to control cells, whereas KChIP3 overexpressing cells are 10 times more sensitive to killing by chemotherapeutics. Similar increase in tumour cell death is observed upon chemical inhibition of mucin secretion by the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) blockers (Mitrovic <i>et al.</i>, 2013). Finally, sensitivity of CRC patient-derived organoids to 5-FU+iri increases 40-fold upon mucin secretion inhibition. Reducing mucin secretion thus provides a means to control chemoresistance of mucinous colorectal cancer cells and other mucinous tumours.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein-lipid interaction at low pH induces oligomerization of the MakA cytotoxin from Vibrio cholerae</a></h4>

              
                The α-pore-forming toxins (α-PFTs) from pathogenic bacteria damage host cell membranes by pore formation. We demonstrate a remarkable, hitherto unknown mechanism by an α-PFT protein from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. As part of the MakA/B/E tripartite toxin, MakA is involved in membrane pore formation similar to other α-PFTs. In contrast, MakA in isolation induces tube-like structures in acidic endosomal compartments of epithelial cells in vitro. The present study unravels the dynamics of tubular growth, which occurs in a pH-, lipid-, and concentration-dependent manner. Within acidified organelle lumens or when incubated with cells in acidic media, MakA forms oligomers and remodels membranes into high-curvature tubes leading to loss of membrane integrity. A 3.7 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of MakA filaments reveals a unique protein-lipid superstructure. MakA forms a pinecone-like spiral with a central cavity and a thin annular lipid bilayer embedded between the MakA transmembrane helices in its active α-PFT conformation. Our study provides insights into a novel tubulation mechanism of an α-PFT protein and a new mode of action by a secreted bacterial toxin.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coupling of pupil- and neuronal population dynamics reveals diverse influences of arousal on cortical processing</a></h4>

              
                Fluctuations in arousal, controlled by subcortical neuromodulatory systems, continuously shape cortical state, with profound consequences for information processing. Yet, how arousal signals influence cortical population activity in detail has so far only been characterized for a few selected brain regions. Traditional accounts conceptualize arousal as a homogeneous modulator of neural population activity across the cerebral cortex. Recent insights, however, point to a higher specificity of arousal effects on different components of neural activity and across cortical regions. Here, we provide a comprehensive account of the relationships between fluctuations in arousal and neuronal population activity across the human brain. Exploiting the established link between pupil size and central arousal systems, we performed concurrent magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and pupillographic recordings in a large number of participants, pooled across three laboratories. We found a cascade of effects relative to the peak timing of spontaneous pupil dilations: Decreases in low-frequency (2-8 Hz) activity in temporal and lateral frontal cortex, followed by increased high-frequency (&gt;64 Hz) activity in mid-frontal regions, followed by monotonic and inverted-U relationships with intermediate frequency-range activity (8-32 Hz) in occipito-parietal regions. Pupil-linked arousal also coincided with widespread changes in the structure of the aperiodic component of cortical population activity, indicative of changes in the excitation-inhibition balance in underlying microcircuits. Our results provide a novel basis for studying the arousal modulation of cognitive computations in cortical circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phosphoproteomics of ATR signaling in mouse testes</a></h4>

              
                The phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase (PI3K)‐related kinase ATR is crucial for mammalian meiosis. ATR promotes meiotic progression by coordinating key events in DNA repair, meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), and checkpoint-dependent quality control during meiotic prophase I. Despite its central roles in meiosis, the ATR-dependent meiotic signaling network remains largely unknown. Here, we used phosphoproteomics to define ATR signaling events in testes from mice following chemical and genetic ablation of ATR signaling. Quantitative analysis of phosphoproteomes obtained after germ cell-specific genetic ablation of the ATR activating 9-1-1 complex or treatment with ATR inhibitor identified over 14,000 phosphorylation sites from testes samples, of which 401 phosphorylation sites were found to be dependent on both the 9-1-1 complex and ATR. Our analyses identified ATR-dependent phosphorylation events in crucial DNA damage signaling and DNA repair proteins including TOPBP1, SMC3, MDC1, RAD50, and SLX4. Importantly, we identified ATR and RAD1-dependent phosphorylation events in proteins involved in mRNA regulatory processes, including SETX and RANBP3, whose localization to the sex body was lost upon ATR inhibition. In addition to identifying the expected ATR-targeted S/T-Q motif, we identified enrichment of an S/T-P-X-K motif in the set of ATR-dependent events, suggesting that ATR promotes signaling via proline-directed kinase(s) during meiosis. Indeed, we found that ATR signaling is important for the proper localization of CDK2 in spermatocytes. Overall, our analysis establishes a map of ATR signaling in mouse testes and highlights potential meiotic-specific actions of ATR during prophase I progression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Connexin hemichannels with prostaglandin release in anabolic function of bone to mechanical loading</a></h4>

              
                Mechanical stimulation, such as physical exercise, is essential for bone formation and health. Here, we demonstrate the critical role of osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels in anabolic function of bone in response to mechanical loading. Two transgenic mouse models, R76W and Δ130–136, expressing dominant-negative Cx43 mutants in osteocytes were adopted. Mechanical loading of tibial bone increased cortical bone mass and mechanical properties in wild-type and gap junction-impaired R76W mice through increased PGE<sub>2</sub>, endosteal osteoblast activity, and decreased sclerostin. These anabolic responses were impeded in gap junction/hemichannel-impaired Δ130–136 mice and accompanied by increased endosteal osteoclast activity. Specific inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels by Cx43(M1) antibody suppressed PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion and impeded loading-induced endosteal osteoblast activity, bone formation and anabolic gene expression. PGE<sub>2</sub> administration rescued the osteogenic response to mechanical loading impeded by impaired hemichannels. Together, osteocytic Cx43 hemichannels could be a potential new therapeutic target for treating bone loss and osteoporosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathway specific effects of ADSL deficiency on neurodevelopment</a></h4>

              
                Adenylosuccinate Lyase (ADSL) functions in <i>de novo </i>purine biosynthesis (DNPS) and the purine nucleotide cycle. ADSL deficiency (ADSLD) causes numerous neurodevelopmental pathologies, including microcephaly and autism spectrum disorder. ADSLD patients have normal serum purine nucleotide levels but exhibit accumulation of dephosphorylated ADSL substrates, S-Ado and SAICAr, the latter being implicated in neurotoxic effects through unknown mechanisms. We examined the phenotypic effects of ADSL depletion in human cells and their relation to phenotypic outcomes. Using specific interventions to compensate for reduced purine levels or modulate SAICAr accumulation, we found that diminished AMP levels resulted in increased DNA damage signaling and cell cycle delays, while primary ciliogenesis was impaired specifically by loss of ADSL or administration of SAICAr. ADSL deficient chicken and zebrafish embryos displayed impaired neurogenesis and microcephaly. Neuroprogenitor attrition in zebrafish embryos was rescued by pharmacological inhibition of DNPS, but not increased nucleotide concentration. Zebrafish also displayed phenotypes commonly linked to ciliopathies. Our results suggest that both reduced purine levels and impaired DNPS contribute to neurodevelopmental pathology in ADSLD and that defective ciliogenesis may influence the ADSLD phenotypic spectrum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple 9-1-1 complexes promote homolog synapsis, DSB repair, and ATR signaling during mammalian meiosis</a></h4>

              
                DNA damage response mechanisms have meiotic roles that ensure successful gamete formation. While completion of meiotic double-strand break (DSB) repair requires the canonical RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1 (9A-1-1) complex, mammalian meiocytes also express RAD9A and HUS1 paralogs, RAD9B and HUS1B, predicted to form alternative 9-1-1 complexes. The RAD1 subunit is shared by all predicted 9-1-1 complexes and localizes to meiotic chromosomes even in the absence of HUS1 and RAD9A. Here, we report that testis-specific disruption of RAD1 in mice resulted in impaired DSB repair, germ cell depletion, and infertility. Unlike <i>Hus1</i> or <i>Rad9a</i> disruption, <i>Rad1</i> loss in meiocytes also caused severe defects in homolog synapsis, impaired phosphorylation of ATR targets such as H2AX, CHK1, and HORMAD2, and compromised meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Together, these results establish critical roles for both canonical and alternative 9-1-1 complexes in meiotic ATR activation and successful prophase I completion.

                Some neurons express a plateau of spike activity greatly outlasting a stimulus, whereas others do not. This difference could be due to differential expression of ion channels (e.g., persistent Na+, and Ca2+) or similar expression of channels that differ in their properties. We compared three Aplysia neurons with varying capacity to generate plateau potentials: B51 with self-terminating plateaus, B64 with plateau potentials that do not self-terminate, and the regular spiking neuron B8. Our results indicate the three neurons expressed outward currents IA and ID, voltage-gated Ca2+ currents ICaL and ICaR, and persistent inward INaP. The most notable difference observed was a larger IA, ID, and IKCa currents in B8, and the plateau generating B64 did not express IKCa. Computational models suggest outward currents suppress and temporally constrain the plateau potential and that inward Ca2+ currents suppress plateau potentials when coupled with IKCa.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NMNAT2 in cortical glutamatergic neurons exerts both cell and non-cell autonomous influences to shape cortical development and to maintain neuronal health</a></h4>

              
                Here we show that deleting NMNAT2 from cortical glutamatergic neurons (NMNAT2 cKO) results in progressive axonal loss, neuroinflammation, small hippocampi and enlarged ventricles. Interestingly, dramatic neuroinflammation responses were observed around the long-range axonal tracts of NMNAT2 cKO cortical neurons. In addition to the neurodegenerative-like phenotype, we also found the absence of whisker-representation patterns (barrels) in the primary somatosensory cortex of NMNAT2 cKO mice. These observations suggest that NMNAT2 is required in developing cortical circuits and in maintaining the health of cortical neurons. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis suggests that NMNAT2 loss in cortical neurons after axonal outgrowth phase upregulates mitochondria function while greatly reducing synaptogenesis pathways. Complete loss of Sarm1 function in NMNAT2 cKO mice restores barrel map formation and axonal integrity and abolishes the inflammatory response. Interestingly, reducing Sarm1 function in NMNAT2 cKO mice by deleting only one copy of Sarm1 restores barrel map formation but did not diminish the neurodegenerative-like phenotype. Only complete loss of Sarm1 prevents neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural responses to broadband visual flicker in marmoset primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Temporal information is ubiquitous in natural vision and must be represented accurately in the brain to allow us to interact with a constantly changing world. Recent studies have employed a random stimulation paradigm to map the temporal response function (TRF) to luminance changes in the human EEG. This approach has revealed that the visual system, when presented with broadband visual input, actively selects distinct temporal frequencies, and retains their phase-information for prolonged periods of time. This non-linear response likely originates in primary visual cortex (V1), yet, so far it has not been investigated on a neural level. Here, we characterize the steady-state response to random broadband visual flicker in marmoset V1. In two experiments, we recorded from i) marmosets passively stimulated under general anesthesia, and ii) awake marmosets, under free viewing conditions. Our results show that LFP coupling to the stimulus was broadband and unselective under anesthesia, whereas in awake animals, it was restricted to two distinct frequency components, in the alpha and beta range. Within these frequency bands, coupling adhered to the receptive field (RF) boundaries of the local populations. The responses outside the RF did not provide evidence for a propagation of stimulus information across the cortex, contrary to results in human EEG studies. This result may be explained by short fixation durations, warranting further investigation. In summary, our findings show that during awake behavior V1 neural responses to broadband information are selective for distinct frequency bands, and that this selectivity is likely controlled actively by top-down mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A longitudinal CA2/3 to CA1 circuit for initiating context-dependent associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Associating environmental context with emotional experience is a vital brain function that requires the activity in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus. While only ventral hippocampus connects with the amygdala, a hub for fear learning, it remains unclear how the two hippocampal areas interact during contextual fear conditioning (CFC). We found that projections from dorsal CA2/CA3 (dCA2/3) to the dorsal part of ventral CA1 (vCA1d) contributed significantly to CFC. Deep-brain Ca2+ imaging revealed a CFC-enhanced difference in neuronal activities evoked by conditioned vs. neutral environmental context in both dCA2/3 and vCA1d areas. Notably, contextual fear retrieval correlated with changes in conditioned context-evoked activity in vCA1d, but not in dCA2/3. Furthermore, slice recordings showed that CFC potentiated dCA2/3-to-vCA1d projection strength, in line with coordinated elevation of monosynaptic excitation and reduction of disynaptic inhibition mediated by somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Thus, vCA1d represents a critical site for initiating emotional association with contextual information from dCA2/3.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuroaffective profiles are associated with e-cigarette use</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Identifying the psychophysiological underpinnings of cue-induced compulsive nicotine use will provide new targets for relapse prevention treatments. We tested whether neuroaffective responses to motivationally relevant stimuli are associated with cue-induced nicotine self-administration. We hypothesized that smokers with stronger neuroaffective responses to nicotine-related cues than to pleasant stimuli (C>P) are more vulnerable to cue-induced nicotine self-administration than smokers with stronger neuroaffective responses to pleasant stimuli than to nicotine-related cues (P>C). METHODS: Smokers (N=36) looked at pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, and nicotine-related images signaling that an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) was immediately available for use. We measured event-related potentials (a direct measure of cortical activity) and computed the amplitude of the late positive potential, a robust index of motivational salience. We used k-means cluster analysis to identify individuals characterized by the C>P or the P>C neuroaffective profile. We compared the ENDS use frequency in the two groups using quantile regression for counts. RESULTS: Cluster analysis assigned 18 smokers to the C>P profile and 18 smokers to the P>C profile. Smokers with the C>P neuroaffective profile used the ENDS significantly more often than smokers with the P>C profile. Significant differences in the number of puffs persisted across different quantiles. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that individual differences in the tendency to attribute motivational salience to drug-related cues underlie vulnerability to cue-induced drug self-administration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An orderly sequence of autonomic and neural events at transient arousal changes</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) allows the study of functional brain connectivity based on spatially structured variations in neuronal activity. Proper evaluation of connectivity requires removal of non-neural contributions to the fMRI signal, in particular hemodynamic changes associated with autonomic variability. Regression analysis based on autonomic indicator signals has been used for this purpose, but may be inadequate if neuronal and autonomic activity covary. To investigate this potential co-variation, we performed rsfMRI experiments while concurrently acquiring electroencephalography and autonomic indicator signals, including heart rate, respiratory depth, and peripheral vascular tone. We identified a recurrent and systematic pattern of fMRI, EEG, and autonomic changes coincidental with intermittent arousal, suggesting arousal modulation. The temporal relationship between the various signals indicated combined neural and autonomic contribution to the fMRI signal, both of which involve widespread brain areas. The fMRI changes included brief signal reductions in salience and default-mode networks, and the thalamus, followed by a biphasic global change. These results suggest that proper measurement of functional connectivity with fMRI requires accounting for the full spectrum of autonomic and neural changes, as well as their co-variation during arousal state transitions.

                Background: A positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer to neuroimage -synuclein aggregates would be a crucial addition for early diagnosis and treatment development in disorders such as Parkinson's disease, where elevated aggregate levels is a histopathological hallmark. The radiotracer (d3)-[11C]MODAG-001 has recently shown promise for visualization of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (-PFF) in rodents. We here test the radiotracer in a pig model where proteins are intracerebrally injected immediately before scanning. Four pigs were injected in one hemisphere with 150 g -PFF, and in the other hemisphere, either 75 g -PFF or human brain homogenate from either dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) was injected. All pigs underwent one or two (d3)-[11C]MODAG-001 PET scans, quantified with the non-invasive Logan graphical analysis using the occipital cortex as a reference region. Results: The -PFF and AD homogenate injected brain regions had high uptake of (d3)-[11C]MODAG-001 compared to the occipital cortex or cerebellum. BPND values in 150 g -PFF injected regions was 0.78, and in the AD homogenate injected regions was 0.73. By contrast, the DLB homogenate injected region did not differ in uptake and clearance compared to the reference regions. The time-activity curves and BPND values in the 150 g and 75 g injected region of -PFFs show a dose-dependent effect, and the PET signal could be blocked by pretreatment with unlabeled MODAG-001. Conclusion: We find that both -PFF and AD brain homogenates give rise to increased binding of (d3)-[11C]MODAG-001 when injected into the pig brain. Despite its limited specificity for cerebral -synuclein pathology, (d3)-[11C]MODAG-001 shows promise as a lead tracer for future radiotracer development.

                Advancements in technologies that can record and stimulate deep-brain activity in humans have led to impactful discoveries within the field of neuroscience and contributed to the development of novel therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Further progress, however, has been hindered by device limitations in that recording of single-neuron activity during freely-moving behaviors in humans has not been possible. Additionally, implantable neurostimulation devices, currently approved for human use, have limited stimulation programmability and lack full-duplex bi-directional capability. Here, we report a wearable bi-directional closed-loop neuromodulation system (Neuro-stack) that allows for the recording of single-neuron and local field potential activity during ambulatory behavior in humans. Together with a highly flexible and customizable stimulation capability, the Neuro-stack provides an opportunity to develop improved responsive neuromodulation therapies, investigation of brain function during naturalistic behaviors in humans, and consequently, the bridging of decades of neuroscientific findings across species.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective influence of dopamine on electrocortical signatures of error monitoring: a combined EEG and immersive virtual reality study in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The saliency of detecting errors in one's own and other's actions is likely linked to the discrepancy between intended or expected and produced or observed output. Salient events seem related to dopamine, the balance of which is profoundly altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). EEG studies in healthy participants indicate that the occurrence of errors in observed actions triggers a variety of electrocortical indices (like mid-frontal theta activity and the Error Positivity, oPe), that seem to map different aspects of error detection and performance monitoring. Whether these indices are differently modulated by dopamine in the same individual has never been investigated. To explore this issue, we recorded EEG markers of error detection by asking healthy controls (HCs) and PD patients to observe ecological reach-to-grasp a glass actions performed by a virtual arm seen in first person perspective. PD patients were tested under their dopaminergic medication ('on-condition'), and after dopaminergic withdrawal ('off-condition'). HCs showed a clear oPe and an increase of theta power during the observation of erroneous vs. correct actions. In PD patients, oPe responses were always preserved. Crucially, however, an error-related increase of theta power was found in 'on' but not in 'off' state PD patients. Thus, different EEG error signatures may index the activity of independent systems and error-related theta power is selectively modulated by dopamine depletion. Our findings may pave the way to the discovery of dopamine-related biomarkers of higher-order motor cognition dysfunctions that may have crucial theoretical and applied implications.

                Cross cultural neuroimaging work has demonstrated differences in neural correlates of some cognitive processes between individuals from different cultures, often comparing American and Chinese subjects. In contrast, a limited number of studies examined Arab and/or Filipino participants. This fMRI study aimed to demonstrate neural activations during animal and tool picture naming by 18 healthy Arabs and 18 healthy Filipino participants. In animal naming contrasted with tool naming, Arabs preferentially activated regions in the right lateral occipital and fusiform cortices, whereas Filipinos recruited bilateral visual areas. Cross-group comparisons of animal naming revealed that Arabs recruited right visual areas more than Filipinos, who in turn recruited the cerebellum more than Arabs. In tool naming, Arabs preferentially activated a predominantly left frontoparietal network, whereas no regions were identified in Filipinos, and no differences in activation between groups were found. Using a low-demand picture-naming task, this study revealed category-specific neural activations during picture naming by Arabs and Filipinos, as well as between-group differences in animal naming. The results suggest that Arabs and Filipinos may have culture-specific differences in processing animate and inanimate pictures, and caution against generalizing findings from the more commonly studied populations, especially in verbal tasks such as picture naming.

                Systemic immunity supports healthy brain homeostasis. Accordingly, conditions causing systemic immune deregulation may accelerate onset of neurodegeneration in predisposed individuals. Here we show that, in the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), high-fat diet-induced obesity accelerated cognitive decline, which was associated with immune deviations comprising increased splenic frequencies of exhausted CD4+ T effector memory cells and CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Non-targeted plasma metabolomics identified N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), the predominant sialic acid, as the major obesity-induced metabolite in 5xFAD mice, the levels of which directly correlated with Tregs abundance and inversely correlated with cognitive performance. Visceral adipose tissue macrophages were identified by sNuc-Seq as one potential source of NANA. Exposure to NANA led to immune deregulation in middle-aged wild-type mice, and ex vivo in human T cells. Our study identified diet-induced immune deregulation, potentially via sialic acid, as a previously unrecognized link between obesity and AD.

                Huntington's disease is caused by expanded trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT), and a higher number of repeats is associated with an earlier age of disease onset. Although the causative gene has been identified, its connections to the observed disease phenotypes is still unclear. Mouse models engineered to contain increasing numbers of trinucleotide repeats were sacrificed at different ages to detect RNA-level and protein-level changes specific to each repeat length and age in order to examine the transcriptional and translational characteristics of the disease. RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics data were collected on 14 types of tissues at up to 8 repeat lengths and in up to 3 different ages, and differential gene and protein expression were examined. A modified method of imputing missing proteomics data was employed and is described here. The most dysregulated tissue at both the RNA and protein levels was the striatum, and a strong gender effect was observed in all of the liver experiments. The full differential expression results are available to the research community on the HDinHD.org website. The results of multiple expression tests in the striatum were combined to generate an RNA disease signature and a protein disease signature, and the signatures were validated in external data sets. These signatures represent molecular readouts of disease progression in HD mice, which further characterizes their HD-related phenotype and can be useful in the preclinical evaluation of candidate therapeutic interventions.

                Memory-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations show characteristic age-related differences, but their use as biomarkers for neurocognitive aging and ultimately dementia risk states is complicated by their high dimensionality. Here, we make a step towards biomarker validation of two single-value scores reflecting deviations from prototypical fMRI activity patterns of young adults computed for the novelty and subsequent memory contrasts from an incidental visual memory encoding fMRI experiment. To optimize procedures of fMRI phenotyping we compared associations of the scores with dementia-relevant variables: cognitive performance in multiple domains and brain structure in 153 healthy older adults. While novelty-driven scores specifically correlated with hippocampus-dependent memory performance, memory-driven scores additionally correlated with global cognition and medial temporal gray matter volumes. Our results reveal complementary associations of reductionist fMRI-based scores with cognitive and structural measures relevant for future validation studies in (pre-)clinical samples, paving the way towards biomarker validation.

                Objective. Implanted electrical stimulators with sensing capabilities have enabled the development of closed-loop neuromodulation therapies capable of responding to patient needs in real-time. Through a combination of rechargeable technologies and wireless data transmission, it is now possible for researchers to acquire extensive neural recordings from human participants in naturalistic settings using these bidirectional devices. However, data losses during wireless transmission hamper processing and the identification of neural signals of interest, driving the need for methodologies to properly estimate the impact of data loss. Approach. To accurately reconstruct the timing of data containing losses, we have developed a method called Periodic Estimation of Lost Packets (PELP) to precisely determine the number of samples lost from implanted recordings during active stimulation. PELP leverages a data-driven procedure for determining the period of stimulation and the knowledge that stimulation continues identically during periods where data are missing to accurately account for the number of samples lost. Main results. Using simulated stimulation added to collected human EEG data, we show that PELP is robust to a range of stimulation waveforms and noise characteristics. Lastly, we successfully applied PELP to local field potential (LFP) recordings from an implanted, bidirectional device using data recorded in the clinic and the patient's own home. Significance. By effectively accounting for the timing of missing data, PELP enables the analysis of complex, naturalistic neural time series data from bidirectional implanted devices aiding in the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

                Objective: In temporal interference (TI) deep brain stimulation (DBS), the neurons of mice react to two interfering sinusoids with a slightly different frequency. This is called a temporal interference (TI) signal. It was previously seen that for the same input intensity, the neurons do not react to a purely sinusoidal signal. This study aims to get a better understanding into the mechanism for this, which is largely unknown. Methods: This study makes use of single compartment models to computationally simulate the response of neurons to the sinusoidal and TI-waveform. This study also compares different neuron models to get insight in which models are able to model the experimental behavior. Results: It was found that integrate-and-fire models do not reflect the experimental behavior while the Hodgkin-Huxley and Frankenhaeuer-Huxley model do reflect this behavior. It was seen that changing the characteristics of the ion gates in the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley model alters the response to both sinusoidal and TI signal. It can even make sure that the firing threshold of the sinusoidal input becomes lower than that of the TI input. Conclusion: The results show that the ion-gates have a big influence on the behavior and their characteristics can define the way the neuron reacts to sinusoidal and TI inputs. Significance: This paper makes advances both in terms of biophysical insight of the neuron as well as the insight in computational modelling of TI-stimulation.

                Spatial navigation and orientation are emerging as promising markers for altered cognition in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and even in cognitively normal individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. The different APOE gene alleles confer various degrees of risk. The APOE2 allele is considered protective, APOE3 is seen as control, while APOE4 carriage is the major known genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. We have used mouse models carrying the three humanized APOE alleles and tested them in a spatial memory task in the Morris water maze. We introduce a new metric, the absolute winding number, to characterize the spatial search strategy, through the shape of the swim path. We show that this metric is robust to noise, and works for small group samples. Moreover, the absolute winding number better differentiated APOE3 carriers, through their straighter swim paths relative to both APOE2 and APOE4 genotypes. Finally, this novel metric was sensitive to sex differences, supporting increased vulnerability in females. We hypothesized differences in spatial memory and navigation strategies are linked to differences in brain networks, and showed that different genotypes have different reliance on the hippocampal and caudate putamen circuits, pointing to a role for white matter connections. Moreover, differences were most pronounced in females. This departure from a hippocampal centric to a brain network approach may open avenues for identifying regions linked to increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, before overt disease manifestation. Further exploration of novel biomarkers based on spatial navigation strategies may enlarge the windows of opportunity for interventions. The proposed framework will be significant in dissecting vulnerable circuits associated with cognitive changes in prodromal Alzheimer's disease.

                In analogy to the friction ridges of a human finger, the functional connectivity patterns of the human brain can be used to identify a given individual from a population. In other words, functional connectivity patterns constitute a marker of human identity, or a brain fingerprint. Notably, very little is known about whether brain fingerprints are preserved in brain ageing and in the presence of cognitive decline. Using fMRI data of 96 memory clinic subjects, here we show that individuals functional connectivity profiles remain unique even when cognitive impairment occurs. Yet, the patterns of functional connectivity that make the healthy subjects more identifiable change during cognitive decline, suggesting that the brain undergoes functional reconfiguration. Notably, the functional connections that were the most reliable in healthy cohorts disappeared during cognitive decline, leaving room for other stable connections, adapting to the process of neurodegeneration. We believe that these findings could help in moving towards a more personalised medicine and treatment during cognitive decline, and we hope they will set the ground for clinical fingerprinting of brain disease.

                Communication between the basal ganglia (BG) and cortex is crucial for behavior as it allows learning through external reinforcement. Non-REM sleep benefits learning in the corticostriatal system through the sleep spindle-associated reactivation of previously active neuronal ensembles and the subsequent modification of synaptic weights. However, how sleep spindles coordinate cross-region spiking, and whether spindle-driven reactivation occurs in other BG structures, remains unknown. We recorded field potentials (FP) and spiking activity in cortex and BG during sleep in two non-human primates immediately following a task that involved the learning of new cue-reward contingencies. FP sleep spindles were widespread in the BG, and they were similar to cortical spindles in morphology, spectral content and response to learning prior to sleep. Further, BG FP spindles were concordant with EEG spindles and associated with increased cortico-BG correlation. However, spindles across the BG differed markedly in their entrainment of local spiking. The spiking activity of striatal projection neurons exhibited consistent phase locking to striatal FP spindles and EEG spindles, producing phase windows of peaked cross-region spindling. In contrast, in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which like the striatum receives substantial thalamocortical input, and in BG nuclei downstream to the striatum and STN, neuronal firing was not entrained to either local or EEG sleep spindles. These results dissociate striatal projection neurons from the rest of the BG, and suggest corticostriatal synapses as the main hub for offline communication between cortex and BG.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Non-synaptic alterations in striatal excitability and cholinergic modulation in a SAPAP3 mouse model of compulsive motor behavior</a></h4>

              
                Deletion of the OCD-associated gene SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein 3 (Sapap3), which encodes a postsynaptic anchoring protein at corticostriatal synapses, causes OCD-like motor behaviors in mice. While corticostriatal synaptic dysfunction is central to this phenotype, the striatum efficiently adapts to pathological changes, often in ways that expand upon the original circuit impairment. Here we show that SAPAP3 deletion causes non-synaptic and pathway-specific alterations in dorsolateral striatum circuit function. While somatic excitability was elevated in striatal projection neurons (SPNs), dendritic excitability was exclusively enhanced in direct pathway SPNs. Layered on top of this, cholinergic modulation was altered in opposing ways: striatal cholinergic interneuron density and evoked acetylcholine release were elevated, while basal muscarinic modulation of SPNs was reduced. These data describe how SAPAP3 deletion alters the striatal landscape upon which impaired corticostriatal inputs will act, offering a basis for how pathological synaptic integration and unbalanced striatal output underlying OCD-like behaviors may be shaped.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic vesicle proteins are selectively delivered to axons in mammalian neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles (SV) mediate synaptic transmission and are a hallmark specialization in neuronal axons. Yet, how SV proteins are sorted to presynaptic nerve terminals remains the subject of debate. The leading models posit that these proteins are randomly trafficked throughout neurons and are selectively retained in presynaptic boutons. Here, we used the RUSH system, in conjunction with HaloTag labeling approaches, to study the egress of two distinct SV proteins from the soma of cultured neurons. In sharp contrast to the selective retention model, both proteins selectively and specifically entered axons and did not traffic through dendrites; only upon overexpression do SV proteins spillover into other compartments. Moreover, we observed that SV constituents were first delivered to the presynaptic plasma membrane before incorporation into SVs. These experiments reveal a new-found membrane trafficking pathway in classically polarized mammalian neurons and provide a glimpse at the first steps of SV biogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) promotes synaptic targeting of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell adhesion molecule encoded by an obesity susceptibility gene. We demonstrate that NEGR1 accumulates in GABAergic inhibitory synapses in hypothalamic neurons, a GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD65 attaches to the plasma membrane, and NEGR1 promotes clustering of GAD65 at the synaptic plasma membrane. GAD65 is removed from the plasma membrane with newly formed vesicles. The association of GAD65 with vesicles results in increased GABA synthesis. In NEGR1 deficient mice, the synaptic targeting of GAD65 is decreased, the GABAergic synapse densities are reduced, and the reinforcing effects of food rewards are blunted. In mice fed a high fat diet, levels of NEGR1 are increased and GAD65 abnormally accumulates at the synaptic plasma membrane. Our results indicate that NEGR1 regulates a previously unknown step required for synaptic targeting and functioning of GAD65, which can be affected by bidirectional changes in NEGR1 levels causing disruptions in the GABAergic signaling controlling feeding behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ACh signaling modulates activity of the GABAergic signaling network in the basolateral amygdala and behavior in stress-relevant paradigms.</a></h4>

              
                Balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) signaling is important for maintaining homeostatic function in the brain. Indeed, dysregulation of inhibitory GABA interneurons in the amygdala has been implicated in human mood disorders. We hypothesized that acetylcholine (ACh) signaling in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) might alter E/I balance resulting in changes in stress-sensitive behaviors. We therefore measured ACh release as well as activity of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII)-, parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SOM)- and vasoactive intestinal protein (VIP)-expressing neurons in the BLA of awake, behaving mice. ACh levels and activity of both excitatory and inhibitory BLA neurons increased when animals were actively coping, and decreased during passive coping, in the light-dark box, tail suspension and social defeat. Changes in neuronal activity preceded behavioral state transitions, suggesting that BLA activity may drive the shift in coping strategy. In contrast to exposure to escapable stressors, prolonging ACh signaling with a cholinesterase antagonist changed the balance of activity among BLA cell types, significantly increasing activity of VIP neurons and decreasing activity of SOM cells, with little effect on CaMKII or PV neurons. Knockdown of 7 or {beta}2-containing nAChR subtypes in PV and SOM, but not CaMKII or VIP, BLA neurons altered behavioral responses to stressors, suggesting that ACh signaling through nAChRs on GABA neuron subtypes contributes to stress-induced changes in behavior. These studies show that ACh modulates the GABAergic signaling network in the BLA, shifting the balance between SOM, PV, VIP and CaMKII neurons, which are normally activated coordinately during active coping in response to stress. Thus, prolonging ACh signaling, as occurs in response to chronic stress, may contribute to maladaptive behaviors by shifting the balance of inhibitory signaling in the BLA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High Fat Diet Blunts Stress-Induced Hypophagia and Activation of Glp1r Dorsal Lateral Septum Neurons in Male but not in Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                While stress typically reduces caloric intake (hypophagia) in chow-fed rodents, presentation of palatable, high calorie substances during stress can increase caloric consumption (i.e. comfort feeding) and promote obesity. However, little is known about how obesity itself affects feeding behavior in response to stress and the mechanisms that can influence stress-associated feeding in the context of obesity. We show that lean male mice display the expected hypophagic response following acute restraint stress, but obese male mice are resistant to this acute stress-induced hypophagia. Activation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (Glp1) receptor (Glp1r) in various brain regions leads to hypophagia in response to stress. Here we show that Glp1r-positive neurons in the dorsal lateral septum (dLS) are robustly activated during acute restraint stress in lean but not in obese male mice. This raises the possibility that activation of dLS Glp1r neurons during restraint stress contributes to subsequent hypophagia. Supporting this, we show that chemogenetic inhibition of dLS Glp1r neurons attenuates acute restraint stress hypophagia in male mice. Surprisingly, we show that both lean and obese female mice are resistant to acute restraint stress-induced hypophagia and activation of dLS Glp1r neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that dLS Glp1r neurons contribute to the hypophagic response to acute restraint stress in male mice, but not in female mice, and that obesity disrupts this response in male mice. Broadly, these findings show sexually dimorphic mechanisms and feeding behaviors in lean vs. obese mice in response to acute stress.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Let's face it: The lateralization of the face perception network as measured with fMRI is not clearly right dominant</a></h4>

              
                The neural face perception network is distributed across both hemispheres. However, the dominant role in humans is virtually unanimously attributed to the right hemisphere. Interestingly, there are, to our knowledge, no imaging studies that systematically describe the distribution of hemispheric lateralization in the core system of face perception across subjects in large cohorts so far. To address this, we determined the hemispheric lateralization of all core system regions (i.e., occipital face area (OFA), fusiform face area (FFA), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS)) in 108 healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We were particularly interested in the variability of hemispheric lateralization across subjects and explored how many subjects can be classified as right-dominant based on the fMRI activation pattern. We further assessed lateralization differences between different regions of the core system and analyzed the influence of handedness and sex on the lateralization with a generalized mixed effects regression model. As expected, brain activity was on average stronger in right-hemispheric brain regions than in their left-hemispheric homologues. This asymmetry was, however, only weakly pronounced in comparison to other lateralized brain functions (such as language and spatial attention) and strongly varied between individuals. Only half of the subjects in the present study could be classified as right-hemispheric dominant. Additionally, we did not detect significant lateralization differences between core system regions. Our data did also not support a general leftward shift of hemispheric lateralization in left-handers. Only the interaction of handedness and sex in the FFA revealed that specifically left-handed men were significantly more left-lateralized compared to right-handed males. In essence, our fMRI data did not support a clear right-hemispheric dominance of the face perception network. Our findings thus ultimately question the dogma that the face perception network - as measured with fMRI - can be characterized as "typically right lateralized".

                Mounting evidence identifies layer 1 (L1) as a central site of memory in sensory neocortex. While this work revealed plasticity in several excitatory brain-wide afferent systems, the existence, connectivity and memory-related signaling of long-range inhibitory input to L1 remains elusive. We report that inhibitory afferents from zona incerta project specifically to auditory cortex L1, where they connect selectively to interneurons to disinhibit the cortical circuit and facilitate behavioral memory. Chronic calcium imaging of these synapses identifies a balanced form of plasticity that develops rapidly during threat learning and is characterized by the de novo appearance of negative stimulus responses which transmit most information. Our results therefore pinpoint malleability of long-range (dis)inhibitory afferents to L1 as a key factor for the exquisite computational flexibility of this unique layer.

	<p>Everyday life&amp;amp;rsquo;s hygiene and professional realities, especially in economically developed countries, indicate the need to modify the standards of pro-health programs as well as modern hygiene and work ergonomics programs. These observations are based on the problem of premature death caused by civilization diseases. The biological mechanisms associated with financial risk susceptibility are well described, but there is little data explaining the biological basis of neuroaccounting. Therefore, the aim of the study was to present relationships between personality traits, cognitive competences and biological factors shaping behavioral conditions in a multidisciplinary aspect. This critical review paper is an attempt to compile biological and psychological factors influencing the development of professional competences, especially decent in the area of accounting and finance. We analyzed existing literature from wide range of scientific disciplines (including economics, psychology, behavioral genetics) to create background to pursuit multidisciplinary research models in the field of neuroaccounting. This would help in pointing the best genetically based behavioral profile of future successful financial and accounting specialists.</p>

	<p>This paper investigates the effects of the repetitive block-wise training process on the classification accuracy for a code-modulated visual evoked potentials (cVEP)-based brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI). The cVEP-based BCIs are popular thanks to their autocorrelation feature. The cVEP-based stimuli are generated by a specific code pattern, usually the m-sequence, which is phase-shifted between the individual targets. Typically, the cVEP classification requires a subject-specific template (individually created from the user&amp;amp;rsquo;s own pre-recorded EEG responses to the same stimulus target), which is compared to the incoming electroencephalography (EEG) data, using the correlation algorithms. The amount of the collected user training data determines the accuracy of the system. In this offline study, previously recorded EEG data collected during an online experiment with 10 participants from multiple sessions were used. A template matching target identification, with similar models as the task-related component analysis (TRCA), was used for target classification. The spatial filter was generated by the canonical correlation analysis (CCA). When comparing the training models from one session with the same session&amp;amp;rsquo;s data (intra-session) and the model from one session with the data from the other session (inter-session), the accuracies were (94.84%, 94.53%) and (76.67%, 77.34%) for intra-sessions and inter-sessions, respectively. In order to investigate the most reliable configuration for accurate classification, the training data blocks from different sessions (days) were compared interchangeably. In the best training set composition, the participants achieved an average accuracy of 82.66% for models based only on two training blocks from two different sessions. Similarly, at least five blocks were necessary for the average accuracy to exceed 90%. The presented method can further improve cVEP-based BCI performance by reusing previously recorded training data.</p>

	<p>In recent years, deep learning models have demonstrated an inherently better ability to tackle non-linear classification tasks, due to advances in deep learning architectures. However, much remains to be achieved, especially in designing deep convolutional neural network (CNN) configurations. The number of hyper-parameters that need to be optimized to achieve accuracy in classification problems increases with every layer used, and the selection of kernels in each CNN layer has an impact on the overall CNN performance in the training stage, as well as in the classification process. When a popular classifier fails to perform acceptably in practical applications, it may be due to deficiencies in the algorithm and data processing. Thus, understanding the feature extraction process provides insights to help optimize pre-trained architectures, better generalize the models, and obtain the context of each layer&amp;amp;rsquo;s features. In this work, we aim to improve feature extraction through the use of a texture amortization map (TAM). An algorithm was developed to obtain characteristics from the filters amortizing the filter&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect depending on the texture of the neighboring pixels. From the initial algorithm, a novel geometric classification score (GCS) was developed, in order to obtain a measure that indicates the effect of one class on another in a classification problem, in terms of the complexity of the learnability in every layer of the deep learning architecture. For this, we assume that all the data transformations in the inner layers still belong to a Euclidean space. In this scenario, we can evaluate which layers provide the best transformations in a CNN, allowing us to reduce the weights of the deep learning architecture using the geometric hypothesis.</p>

	<p>Difficulty sleeping in a novel environment is a common phenomenon that is often described as the first night effect (FNE). Previous works have found FNE on sleep architecture and sleep power spectra parameters, especially during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. However, the impact of FNE on sleep parameters, including local differences in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity across nights, has not been systematically assessed. Here, we performed high-density EEG sleep recordings on 27 healthy individuals on two nights and examined differences in sleep architecture, NREM (stages 2 and 3) EEG power spectra, and NREM power topography across nights. We found higher wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), reduced sleep efficiency, and less deep NREM sleep (stage 3), along with increased high-frequency NREM EEG power during the first night of sleep, corresponding to small to medium effect sizes (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d &amp;amp;le; 0.5). Furthermore, study individuals showed significantly lower slow-wave activity in right frontal/prefrontal regions as well as higher sigma and beta activities in medial and left frontal/prefrontal areas, yielding medium to large effect sizes (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d &amp;amp;ge; 0.5). Altogether, these findings suggest the FNE is characterized by less efficient, more fragmented, shallower sleep that tends to affect especially certain brain regions. The magnitude and specificity of these effects should be considered when designing sleep studies aiming to compare across night effects.</p>

	<p>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) without skull fracturing is the most common occurrence of all TBIs and is considered as a serious public health concern. Animal models of mTBI are essential to investigation of TBI and its effects. In the current study, we developed and characterized a reproducible mouse model of mild TBI, meanwhile, the effects of this mTBI model, as well as repetitive mTBIs (rmTBIs), on the endothelial function of mouse aortas were also studied. In variety of closed-head models of mTBI, impact velocity, weight, and dwell time are the main parameters that affect the severities of injury. Here, we used a device, converting parameters of velocity, tip weight, and dwell time into impact force, to develop a mouse model of close-head mTBI. Mice were subjected to a mild TBI induced by the impact forces of 500, 600, 700, and 800 kdyn, respectively. Later, brain injuries were assessed histologically and molecularly. Systemic and brain inflammation were measured by plasma cytokine assay and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. The composite neurobehavioral test revealed significant acute functional deficits in mice after mTBI, corresponding to the degree of injury. Mice brain undergoing mTBI had significant elevated GFAP staining. Plasma cytokines interleukin-1&amp;amp;beta; (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly increased within 2 h after mTBI. Taken together, these data suggest that the mTBI mouse model introduce within our study exhibits good repeatability and comparable pathological characters. Moreover, we used this mTBI mouse model to determine the effect of single or rmTBIs on systemic vasoconstriction and relaxation. The isometric-tension results indicate that rmTBIs induce a pronounced and long-lasting endothelial dysfunction in mouse aorta.</p>

	<p>Hyperammonaemic encephalopathy in adults is a rare condition in the absence of liver disease and is associated with a high mortality and risk of permanent neurological deficits. Seldomly, the condition is caused by an inborn error of metabolism in the urea cycle, triggered by an exogenic factor such as gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastric bypass surgery, starvation, seizures, vigorous exercise, burn injuries, or drugs hampering the elimination of ammonia. Here, we present a fatal case of an unrecognized genetic ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) presenting with a subacute progressive encephalopathy. We review the current literature and discuss the differential diagnosis and treatment options. As swift diagnosis and initiation of treatment is vital, awareness of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy and its possible causes can help improve the prognosis of this condition.</p>

	<p>Developmental prosopagnosia (DP)&amp;amp;mdash;or &amp;amp;lsquo;face blindness&amp;amp;rsquo;&amp;amp;mdash;refers to life-long problems with facial recognition in the absence of brain injury. We know that neurodevelopmental disorders tend to co-occur, and this study aims to explore if individuals with self-reported DP also report indications of other neurodevelopmental disorders, deficits, or conditions (developmental comorbidity). In total, 115 individuals with self-reported DP participated in this online cross-sectional survey. Face recognition impairment was measured with a validated self-report instrument. Indications of difficulties with navigation, math, reading, or spelling were measured with a tailored questionnaire using items from published sources. Additional diagnoses were measured with direct questions. We also included open-ended questions about cognitive strengths and difficulties. Results: Overall, 57% reported at minimum one developmental comorbidity of interest, with most reflecting specific cognitive impairment (e.g., in memory or object recognition) rather than diagnostic categories (e.g., ADHD, dyslexia). Interestingly, many participants reported cognitive skills or strengths within the same domains that others reported impairment, indicating a diverse pattern of cognitive strengths and difficulties in this sample. The frequency and diversity of self-reported developmental comorbidity suggests that face recognition could be important to consider in future investigations of neurodevelopmental comorbidity patterns.</p>

                Background: Simultaneous multiple intra-cerebral hemorrhages (SMICHs) and its occurrences in different territories of arterial disposition has been viewed as uncommon clinical occurrences, since the pathophysiological and predisposing factors as mechanisms aren’t vividly defined. This research primarily aims for demographic stratification and dichotomization pertaining to risk factors, etiological classifications, anatomical distributions and outcome analysis by focusing on management strategies and pertinent stroke care. Methods: 40 patients presenting to the College of Medical Sciences, Chitwan, Nepal in the last two years were included in the study. The patients with two-or-more SMICHs with affected arterial territories with similar tomographic density based profiling were chosen as samples. Regression analysis was chosen to test three hypotheses. Results: Among our study cohorts, cortical and cortical territory (60%) was the major anatomical patterns of involvement. A conservative approach was undertaken in nine patients (22.5%), whereas surgical intervention was needed in five others (12.5%). A total of 14(35%) patients leaving against medical advice and a further seven (17.5%) patients were referred for adjuvant oncologic care. Mortality was observed among five (12.5%) patients. Hypertension was seen as a significant variable in its pathogenesis. Male patients were more affected. Age groups comprising of 36-45years and 56-65 years were involved in 32.5% and 30% cases respectively. Conclusion: This study proves the need for a national stroke data bank pertaining to SMICH. This will help foster effective patient education during preoperative counselling; as well as formatting a management algorithm combating them.

                Background: Human Givens (HG) Rewind is a relatively unknown trauma-focussed treatment. This paper aimed to provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of Rewind to treat posttraumatic stress (PTS) in a variety of clinical settings in Great Britain. Methods: An observational prospective design was used in each of the four studies. Standardised questionnaires were administered in every session. Pre- and post-treatment means and effect sizes were calculated for each study, as were ‘recovery rates’ and ‘reliable change’ rates. Results: Across four studies, a total of 274 clients completed treatment and had complete data. The data capture rate ranged from 80-100%. The mean pre-treatment scores were in the severe range. The pre-post treatment effects sizes ranged from 1.90-2.68. The percentage of clients who were below the clinical cut-off after treatment ranged from 46-56% for the more conservative lower cut-offs, and ranged between 71-82% for the higher clinical cut-offs as used by Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT). Across the four studies, 83-96% of clients had ‘reliably improved’ (88-94% on trauma-specific questionnaires), with 4-17% having no reliable change on those questionnaires. The mean number of HG treatment sessions ranged from 5-6.5 sessions (range 1–24 sessions), with between 73% and 84% of participants completing treatment in six sessions or less. Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that HG Rewind appears to be a promising trauma treatment in a variety of settings. A randomised controlled trial is now required to determine the efficacy of this treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment—A green-building rating system for catalysing climate-change mitigation/adaptation in India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Green-building rating systems (GBRSs) are critical for implementing climate change (CC) mitigation strategies because they can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the building sector. From the Indian policy perspective, the ClimateSMART Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF) provides cities a roadmap toward mitigating CC while planning/implementing their actions and facilitates realising energy efficiency and green buildings through GBRS adoption and incentivisation. Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) is a comprehensive GBRS aligned with CSCAF and India’s climate goals, facilitating the implementation of Government of India’s relevant policies and climate-adaptation measures within a building project’s different phases. This paper examines existing institutional mechanisms for incentivising GRIHA-rated projects and provides recommendations for municipal bodies, regional developmental authorities, and state governments for strengthening resource efficiency in the built environment through GRIHA. Residential buildings are considered because their contribution to GHG emissions is the greatest among buildings. Data were collected through literature review, reviewing smart-city proposals and latest state annual action plans, Right to Information queries, and structured interviews of stakeholders. Feedback from green-building certification agencies, project proponents, and government officials revealed a need for local-level information dissemination and guidance on institutional mechanisms for incentivising green-rated projects. Further, to understand the implementation mechanisms for GRIHA-linked incentives, residential projects under some local-government agencies were documented as case studies, providing useful insights into prevalent mechanisms for availing incentives while facilitating GRIHA compliance. The information provided herein can be useful for local governments in other developing countries for guiding the building sector toward mitigating climate change.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Testosterone level correlates significantly with luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone ratio among women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an endocrinological problem among women in the reproductive age, is characterized by chronic ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and elevated luteinizing hormone: follicle stimulating hormone (LH-FSH) ratio. The goal of this study was to examine if the blood LH-FSH ratio and total testosterone (TT) levels in Sudanese women with PCOS were linked. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 300 women with confirmed PCOS based on Rotterdam criteria.  PCOS women mean (standard deviation): age 29.1(5.8) years; body mass index (BMI) 27.9±4.6 kg/m2. Each participant underwent a clinical history, physical examination, and ovaries ultrasonogram.  ASYS Expert Plus Microplate was used to quantify serum LH, FSH, and TT levels in fasting blood specimen drawn during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle of women with PCOS. Results: More than two-thirds of the participants (71.0%) had an aberrant LH-FSH ratio (cut-off>1.0), and 58.3% had hyperandrogenemia (TT>109.5 ng/dL). Hyperandrogenemic women had significantly increased LH-FSH ratio (P= 0.000). The LH-FSH ratio and serum TT were significantly positive correlated (r= 0.329, P= 0.000). Overall, 52.0% of women with PCOS exhibited menstrual cycle irregularity, and 59.0 % had a positive family history of PCOS. On logistic regression analysis, the LH-FSH ratio (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 2.308 (1.698- 3.139, P= 0.000) was found to be positively related to hyperandrogenemia independently. Furthermore, when the LH-FSH ratio is greater than one, hyperandrogenemia can be distinguished from normoandrogenemia, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.726, P= 0.000, 95% CI: (0.668-0.785) with a serum TT threshold of 109.5 ng/dL (sensitivity 70.0%, specificity 77.1%). Conclusions: In women with PCOS, the serum LH-FSH ratio and TT have a strong relationship. Furthermore, LH-FSH ratio of greater than one can be used to distinguish between hyperandrogenic and non-hyperandrogenic PCOS women.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Concomitant chronic subdural hematomas and arachnoid cysts in young adults [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between arachnoid cysts and chronic subdural hematomas in young adults. Methods: This retrospective study evaluated ten patients having concomitant chronic subdural hematomas and arachnoid cysts. Patients were evaluated with the data of age and gender, location of hematoma and arachnoid cyst, trauma history, symptoms at admission, maximum hematoma diameter, contiguity between arachnoid cyst and hematoma, and treatment  methods. Results: We treated 285 patients who were diagnosed with cSDH between January 2013 and December 2019. 22 patients were under the age of 40 years. Ten of them had both cSDH and arachnoid cysts. The mean age of patients was 24.8±3.9 years. Patients with only chronic subdural hematoma had higher mean age than the patients with arachnoid cyst-related chronic subdural hematoma. In four patients, the onset of chronic subdural hematoma was reported after arachnoid cyst diagnosis. Four of the patients did not have causative trauma history, and two patients suffered minor sports-related traumas. All patients had headache, and only two patients had hemiparesis. The location of arachnoid cysts were in the middle fossa in eight patients. All patients had chronic subdural hematomas on the ipsilateral side of arachnoid cyst. Four patients who had smaller than 10 mm maximal cSDH diameter underwent conservative management. They were followed by serial neuroimaging studies and it was noted that the hematoma disappered and the size of the arachnoid cysts decreased over time without any neurological complication. In six cases, craniotomy was required, and all recovered completely. cSDH did not recur during 5–60 months of follow-up period (median 12 months). Conclusions: It seems that presence of an arachnoid cyst in young adults is a predisposing factor for the formation of chronic subdural hematoma. Coincidentally diagnosed arachnoid cyst patients may be followed up with periodical clinical examinations and neuroimaging studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Patients and family members perspectives on the use of bedside whiteboards and its implication to treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction: A pilot survey in general and tertiary hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer </a></h4>

              
                Background: Effective communication between the members of the healthcare team and the patient and families are essential components for patient-centered care. It improves patient outcomes. Likewise, poor communication between healthcare team members and the patient and families is associated with poor patient outcomes. Due to several communication challenges, the use of visual tools such as bedside whiteboards to enhance communication has been widely implemented; however, the exact benefit of its use from the patient perspective is still understudied. Thus, this study aims to determine the impact of bedside whiteboard use in facilitating patient’s involvement in achieving the day’s goal, adherence to pain medication schedule and use, tests, and procedures schedule, patients and family engagement with the healthcare team, and discharge planning. Methods: This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among 335 patients and/or family members admitted in six hospitals in Makkah city: Al Noor hospital, Hera hospital, King Abdul-Aziz hospital, King Abdullah Medical City, King Faisal specialist hospital, and Maternity and Children hospital. The survey questionnaire used was adapted from previous studies and revalidated to ensure its suitability to the study subjects. Data collection was performed from August 1 to 31, 2020, and data analysis was done with SPSS software. Results: Of the 335 participants, the majority were satisfied with bedside whiteboards for their use (4.36), and they recommended it to be used in hospitals because they perceived that through this medium of communication, their connection with the healthcare team would be easier (4.35). In regression analysis, the day’s goal and patient and/or family engagement are found to be significant predictors of patient satisfaction. Conclusions: Whiteboards are a valuable tool to help patients achieve their daily goals and improve their engagement with the healthcare team, impacting patient satisfaction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Connectivity and dynamics in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David E. Chen Kersen, Gaia Tavoni, Vijay Balasubramanian</p>

Dendrodendritic interactions between excitatory mitral cells and inhibitory granule cells in the olfactory bulb create a dense interaction network, reorganizing sensory representations of odors and, consequently, perception. Large-scale computational models are needed for revealing how the collective behavior of this network emerges from its global architecture. We propose an approach where we summarize anatomical information through dendritic geometry and density distributions which we use to calculate the connection probability between mitral and granule cells, while capturing activity patterns of each cell type in the neural dynamical systems theory of Izhikevich. In this way, we generate an efficient, anatomically and physiologically realistic large-scale model of the olfactory bulb network. Our model reproduces known connectivity between sister vs. non-sister mitral cells; measured patterns of lateral inhibition; and theta, beta, and gamma oscillations. The model in turn predicts testable relationships between network structure and several functional properties, including lateral inhibition, odor pattern decorrelation, and LFP oscillation frequency. We use the model to explore the influence of cortex on the olfactory bulb, demonstrating possible mechanisms by which cortical feedback to mitral cells or granule cells can influence bulbar activity, as well as how neurogenesis can improve bulbar decorrelation without requiring cell death. Our methodology provides a tractable tool for other researchers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evaluating supervised and unsupervised background noise correction in human gut microbiome data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leah Briscoe, Brunilda Balliu, Sriram Sankararaman, Eran Halperin, Nandita R. Garud</p>

The ability to predict human phenotypes and identify biomarkers of disease from metagenomic data is crucial for the development of therapeutics for microbiome-associated diseases. However, metagenomic data is commonly affected by technical variables unrelated to the phenotype of interest, such as sequencing protocol, which can make it difficult to predict phenotype and find biomarkers of disease. Supervised methods to correct for background noise, originally designed for gene expression and RNA-seq data, are commonly applied to microbiome data but may be limited because they cannot account for unmeasured sources of variation. Unsupervised approaches address this issue, but current methods are limited because they are ill-equipped to deal with the unique aspects of microbiome data, which is compositional, highly skewed, and sparse. We perform a comparative analysis of the ability of different denoising transformations in combination with supervised correction methods as well as an unsupervised principal component correction approach that is presently used in other domains but has not been applied to microbiome data to date. We find that the unsupervised principal component correction approach has comparable ability in reducing false discovery of biomarkers as the supervised approaches, with the added benefit of not needing to know the sources of variation apriori. However, in prediction tasks, it appears to only improve prediction when technical variables contribute to the majority of variance in the data. As new and larger metagenomic datasets become increasingly available, background noise correction will become essential for generating reproducible microbiome analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantifying cumulative phenotypic and genomic evidence for procedural generation of metabolic network reconstructions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas J. Moutinho Jr., Benjamin C. Neubert, Matthew L. Jenior, Jason A. Papin</p>

Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are valuable tools for understanding microbial metabolism. The process of automatically generating GENREs includes identifying metabolic reactions supported by sufficient genomic evidence to generate a draft metabolic network. The draft GENRE is then gapfilled with additional reactions in order to recapitulate specific growth phenotypes as indicated with associated experimental data. Previous methods have implemented absolute mapping thresholds for the reactions automatically included in draft GENREs; however, there is growing evidence that integrating annotation evidence in a continuous form can improve model accuracy. There is a need for flexibility in the structure of GENREs to better account for uncertainty in biological data, unknown regulatory mechanisms, and context-specificity associated with data inputs. To address this issue, we present a novel method that provides a framework for quantifying combined genomic, biochemical, and phenotypic evidence for each biochemical reaction during automated GENRE construction. Our method, Constraint-based Analysis Yielding reaction Usage across metabolic Networks (CANYUNs), generates accurate GENREs with a quantitative metric for the cumulative evidence for each reaction included in the network. The structuring of CANYUNs allows for the simultaneous integration of three data inputs while maintaining all supporting evidence for biochemical reactions that may be active in an organism. CANYUNs is designed to maximize the utility of experimental and annotation datasets and to ultimately assist in the curation of the reference datasets used for the automatic construction of metabolic networks. We validated CANYUNs by generating an <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> K-12 model and compared it to the manually curated reconstruction iML1515. Finally, we demonstrated the use of CANYUNs to build a model by generating an <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> Nissle CANYUNs model using novel phenotypic data that we collected. This method may address key challenges for the procedural construction of metabolic networks by leveraging uncertainty and redundancy in biological data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">INTEGRATE: Model-based multi-omics data integration to characterize multi-level metabolic regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marzia Di Filippo, Dario Pescini, Bruno Giovanni Galuzzi, Marcella Bonanomi, Daniela Gaglio, Eleonora Mangano, Clarissa Consolandi, Lilia Alberghina, Marco Vanoni, Chiara Damiani</p>

Metabolism is directly and indirectly fine-tuned by a complex web of interacting regulatory mechanisms that fall into two major classes. On the one hand, the expression level of the catalyzing enzyme sets the maximal theoretical flux level (i.e., the net rate of the reaction) for each enzyme-controlled reaction. On the other hand, metabolic regulation controls the metabolic flux through the interactions of metabolites (substrates, cofactors, allosteric modulators) with the responsible enzyme. High-throughput data, such as metabolomics and transcriptomics data, if analyzed separately, do not accurately characterize the hierarchical regulation of metabolism outlined above. They must be integrated to disassemble the interdependence between different regulatory layers controlling metabolism. To this aim, we propose INTEGRATE, a computational pipeline that integrates metabolomics and transcriptomics data, using constraint-based stoichiometric metabolic models as a scaffold. We compute differential reaction expression from transcriptomics data and use constraint-based modeling to predict if the differential expression of metabolic enzymes directly originates differences in metabolic fluxes. In parallel, we use metabolomics to predict how differences in substrate availability translate into differences in metabolic fluxes. We discriminate fluxes regulated at the metabolic and/or gene expression level by intersecting these two output datasets. We demonstrate the pipeline using a set of immortalized normal and cancer breast cell lines. In a clinical setting, knowing the regulatory level at which a given metabolic reaction is controlled will be valuable to inform targeted, truly personalized therapies in cancer patients.

                Background: The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with caregivers’ knowledge of kitchen hygiene in San Juan de Lurigancho (SJL). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. We surveyed 250 mothers at comedores populares (a sort of community kitchens which are very popular in Lima) and who were part of mothers' clubs in the areas of Huascar V and San Pablo, in SJL in Lima. The sample was selected through non-probability convenience sampling. A questionnaire with three dimensions (cleanliness, storage and contamination of children) was administered. Results: On average, in Huascar and San Pablo, most caregivers were the children’s mothers (93.2%); most of the caregivers were between 21 and 30 years old (54%); they had secondary level of education (70.4%); they were living in free union with their partners (69.2%); they were mainly housewives (80.4%); their houses were constructed with materials different from brick and cement (68.4%); and their houses had a bare floor (70.0%). They did not have drinking water in the kitchen (88.4%); they did not use a gas stove (88.4%), a refrigerator (50.0%), a radio (82.0%), or a microwave (16.4%). A good level of knowledge of food hygiene was found in 63.2% of caregivers. No predictive capacity of the assessed sociodemographic characteristics on the level of knowledge of kitchen hygiene was identified. Conclusions: This study determined that the assessed sociodemographic variables were not significantly associated with the level of knowledge about kitchen hygiene. It is necessary to improve mothers' knowledge about the handling and consumption of spoiled food and their effect on children's health.

                Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the DMD gene. The full mutation spectrum of the DMD gene in Indonesian patients is currently unknown. Mutation-specific therapies are currently being developed, such as exon skipping or stop codon read-through therapy.  This study was conducted with the aim of identifying the mutation spectrum of the DMD gene in Indonesia to guide future development and application of feasible therapeutic strategies.   Methods: This study is a cross sectional study that enrolled 43 male patients with a clinical suspicion of DMD or BMD. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) reaction was performed to screen for the common mutations in the DMD gene.   Results: Out of 43 subjects, deletions accounted for 69.77% (n=30) cases, while duplications were found in 11.63% (n=5) cases. One novel duplication spanning exons 2 to 62 was identified. Deletion mutations clustered around the distal (66.67%) and proximal (26.67%) hot spot regions of the DMD gene while duplication mutations were observed solely at the proximal region. Two false positive cases of single exon deletion detected through MLPA were attributed to sequence mutations affecting primer ligation sites, confirming the need to validate all single exon deletions when using this screening method. Analysis of available maternal DNA samples showed that the rate of de novo mutations (48.15%) appears higher than expected in this population. Out of 31 patients who were classified as DMD based on clinical and genotype characterizations, 60.47% (n=26) of cases were suitable for exon skipping therapy.   Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive study showing the feasibility of implementing the MLPA method for routine screening of DMD patients in Indonesia.  This is also the first study showing the potential applicability of exon skipping therapy in the majority of DMD cases in the country.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Academic entrepreneurial engagement for frugal innovation in higher education institutions: a systematic literature review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Higher education institutions (HEI) are faced with increasing challenges related to shrinking resources, high operation costs, the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing student enrolment rates, and pressure to contribute to regional development and economic growth. To overcome such challenges, academics must move beyond their traditional functions of research and teaching and engage in entrepreneurial activities. Through engagement in entrepreneurial activities, academics can contribute to frugal innovation (FI) in private HEI (PHEI). The literature in this context emphasizes that academic entrepreneurial engagement (AEE) will lead to innovation, the identification of opportunities for new business ventures, financial rewards for institutions and academics, an impact on the economy, and the enhancement of social welfare. This study presents a systematic review of the literature and adopts the Transfield five-phase strategy to review the literature on AEE from the past two decades (2000–2020). A total of 1,067 papers on FI are obtained, only five of which focus on AEE. Moreover, papers related to AEE for FI are few. The study presents the research gaps, challenges, and potential factors for further research in this context. We conclude that FI for AEE in PHEI can be a game-changer for future sustainability. Moreover, we believe that the outcome of this review warrants further research.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Regulation of AMPAR trafficking in synaptic plasticity by BDNF and the impact of neurodegenerative disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Research demonstrates that the neural mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and learning and memory involve mobilization of AMPA-type neurotransmitter receptors at glutamatergic synaptic contacts, and that these mechanisms are targeted during neurodegenerative disease. Strengthening neural transmission occurs with insertion of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) into synapses while weakening results from receptor withdrawal. A key player in the trafficking of AMPARs during plasticity and learning is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling system. BDNF is a neurotrophic factor that supports neuronal growth and is required for learning and memory. Significantly, a primary feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is a reduction in BDNF protein as well as disrupted neuronal surface expression of synaptic AMPARs. The resulting weakening of synaptic contacts leads to synapse loss and neuronal degeneration that underlies the cognitive impairment and dementia observed in patients with progressive neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s. In the face of these data, one therapeutic approach is to increase BDNF bioavailability in brain. While this has been met with significant challenges, the results of the research have been promising. In spite of this, there are currently no clinical trials to test many of these findings on patients. Here, research showing that BDNF drives AMPARs to synapses, AMPAR trafficking is essential for synaptic plasticity and learning, and that neurodegenerative disease results in a significant decline in BDNF will be reviewed. The aim is to draw attention to the need for increasing patient-directed clinical studies to test the possible benefits of increasing levels of neurotrophins, specifically BDNF, to treat brain disorders. Much is known about the cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory in brain. It can be concluded that signaling by neurotrophins like BDNF and AMPA-type glutamate receptor synaptic trafficking are fundamental to these processes. Data from animal models and patients reveal that these mechanisms are adversely targeted during neurodegenerative disease and results in memory loss and cognitive decline. A brief summary of our understanding of these mechanisms indicates that it is time to apply this knowledge base directly to development of therapeutic treatments that enhance neurotrophins for brain disorders in patient populations.</p>

                The term autophagy encompasses different pathways enabling lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic material, such as macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy. Fleming et al. review how different autophagic pathways protect against neurodegeneration and consider recently described therapeutic strategies exploiting autophagic upregulation.
