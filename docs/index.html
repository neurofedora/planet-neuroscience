              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13467">How Metacognitive Architectures Remember Their Own Thoughts: A Systematic Review</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by human cognition, metacognition has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance autonomy, adaptability, and robust learning in artificial agents. Yet research on Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) remains fragmented: diverse theories, terminologies, and design choices have led to disjointed developments and limited comparability across systems. Existing overviews and surveys often remain at a broad, conceptual level, making it difficult to synthesize deeper insights into the underlying algorithms and representations, and their respective success. We address this gap by performing an explorative systematic review of how CMAs model, store, remember and process their metacognitive experiences, one of Flavell's (1979) three foundational components of metacognition. Following this organizing principle, we identify 35 CMAs that feature episodic introspective data ranging from symbolic event traces to sub-symbolic arousal metrics. We consider different aspects - ranging from the underlying psychological theories to the content and structure of collected data, to the algorithms used and evaluation results - and derive a unifying perspective that allows us to compare in depth how different Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) leverage metacognitive experiences for tasks such as error diagnosis, self-repair, and goal-driven learning. Our findings highlight both the promise of metacognitive experiences - in boosting adaptability, explainability, and overall system performance - and the persistent lack of shared standards or evaluation benchmarks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13702">Subthreshold moment analysis of neuronal populations driven by synchronous synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even when driven by the same stimulus, neuronal responses are well-known to exhibit a striking level of spiking variability. In-vivo electrophysiological recordings also reveal a surprisingly large degree of variability at the subthreshold level. In prior work, we considered biophysically relevant neuronal models to account for the observed magnitude of membrane voltage fluctuations. We found that accounting for these fluctuations requires weak but nonzero synchrony in the spiking activity, in amount that are consistent with experimentally measured spiking correlations. Here we investigate whether such synchrony can explain additional statistical features of the measured neural activity, including neuronal voltage covariability and voltage skewness. Addressing this question involves conducting a generalized moment analysis of conductance-based neurons in response to input drives modeled as correlated jump processes. Technically, we perform such an analysis using fixed-point techniques from queuing theory that are applicable in the stationary regime of activity. We found that weak but nonzero synchrony can consistently explain the experimentally reported voltage covariance and skewness. This confirms the role of synchrony as a primary driver of cortical variability and supports that physiological neural activity emerges as a population-level phenomenon, especially in the spontaneous regime.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13981">Neural Constraints on Cognitive Experience and Mental Health</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how neural dynamics shape cognitive experiences remains a central challenge in neuroscience and psychiatry. Here, we present a novel framework leveraging state-to-output controllability from dynamical systems theory to model the interplay between cognitive perturbations, neural activity, and subjective experience. We demonstrate that large-scale fMRI signals are constrained to low-dimensional manifolds, where affective and cognitive states are naturally organized. Furthermore, we provide a theoretically robust method to estimate the controllability Gramian from steady-state neural responses, offering a direct measure of the energy required to steer cognitive outcomes. In five healthy participants viewing 2,185 emotionally evocative short videos, our analyses reveal a strong alignment between neural activations and affective ratings, with an average correlation of $r \approx 0.7$. In a clinical cohort of 255 patients with major depressive disorder, biweekly Hamilton Rating Scale trajectories over 11 weeks significantly mapped onto these manifolds, explaining approximately 20% more variance than chance ($p < 10^{-10}$, numerically better than chance in 93% reaching statistical significance in one-third of subjects). Our work bridges dynamical systems theory and clinical neuroscience, providing a principled approach to optimize mental health treatments by targeting the most efficient neural pathways for cognitive change.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14333">Revealing higher-order neural representations with generative artificial intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.14333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies often aim to reveal how neural representations encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as its contents or structure. These are ``first-order" representations (FORs), because they're ``about" the external world. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- their contents, stability, or uncertainty. HORs of uncertainty appear critically involved in adaptive behaviors including learning under uncertainty, influencing learning rates and internal model updating based on environmental feedback. However, HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting estimation processes which may be lossy, bias-prone, or distortive and which may also incorporate estimates of distributions of uncertainty the observer is likely to experience. While some research has targeted neural representations of ``instantaneously" estimated uncertainty, how the brain represents \textit{distributions} of expected uncertainty remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to explore neural representations of uncertainty distributions. We use existing functional magnetic resonance imaging data, where humans learned to `de-noise' their brain states to achieve target neural patterns, to train denoising diffusion genAI models with RL algorithms to learn noise distributions similar to how humans might learn to do the same. We then explore these models' learned noise-distribution HORs compared to control models trained with traditional backpropagation. Results reveal model-dependent differences in noise distribution representations -- with the RL-based model offering much higher explanatory power for human behavior -- offering an exciting path towards using genAI to explore neural noise-distribution HORs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05002">Deep Jansen-Rit Parameter Inference for Model-Driven Analysis of Brain Activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.05002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling effective connectivity (EC) is critical for understanding how the brain processes and integrates sensory information. Yet, it remains a formidable challenge due to complex neural dynamics and noisy measurements such as those obtained from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Model-driven EC infers local (within a brain region) and global (between brain regions) EC parameters by fitting a generative model of neural activity onto experimental data. This approach offers a promising route for various applications, including investigating neurodevelopmental disorders. However, current approaches fail to scale to whole-brain analyses and are highly noise-sensitive. In this work, we employ three deep-learning architectures--a transformer, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a convolutional neural network and bidirectional LSTM (CNN-BiLSTM) network--for inverse modeling and compare their performance with simulation-based inference in estimating the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) parameters from simulated EEG data under various noise conditions. We demonstrate a reliable estimation of key local parameters, such as synaptic gains and time constants. However, other parameters like local JR-NMM connectivity cannot be evaluated reliably from evoked-related potentials (ERP). We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to characterize the influence of JR-NMM parameters on ERP and evaluate their learnability. Our results show the feasibility of deep-learning approaches to estimate the subset of learnable JR-NMM parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00777">CATD: Unified Representation Learning for EEG-to-fMRI Cross-Modal Generation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.00777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal neuroimaging analysis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of brain function and pathology, as it allows for the integration of different imaging techniques, thus overcoming the limitations of individual modalities. However, the high costs and limited availability of certain modalities pose significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposed the Condition-Aligned Temporal Diffusion (CATD) framework for end-to-end cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging, enabling the generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-detected Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals from more accessible Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By constructing Conditionally Aligned Block (CAB), heterogeneous neuroimages are aligned into a potential space, achieving a unified representation that provides the foundation for cross-modal transformation in neuroimaging. The combination with the constructed Dynamic Time-Frequency Segmentation (DTFS) module also enables the use of EEG signals to improve the temporal resolution of BOLD signals, thus augmenting the capture of the dynamic details of the brain. Experimental validation demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework in improving the accuracy of neural activity prediction, identifying abnormal brain regions, and enhancing the temporal resolution of BOLD signals. The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal synthesis of neuroimaging by unifying heterogeneous neuroimaging data into a potential representation space, showing promise in medical applications such as improving Parkinson's disease prediction and identifying abnormal brain regions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14298">Recursive Self-Similarity in Deep Weight Spaces of Neural Architectures: A Fractal and Coarse Geometry Perspective</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conceptualizes the Deep Weight Spaces (DWS) of neural architectures as hierarchical, fractal-like, coarse geometric structures observable at discrete integer scales through recursive dilation. We introduce a coarse group action termed the fractal transformation, $T_{r_k} $, acting under the symmetry group $G = (\mathbb{Z}, +) $, to analyze neural parameter matrices or tensors, by segmenting the underlying discrete grid $\Omega$ into $N(r_k)$ fractals across varying observation scales $ r_k $. This perspective adopts a box count technique, commonly used to assess the hierarchical and scale-related geometry of physical structures, which has been extensively formalized under the topic of fractal geometry. We assess the structural complexity of neural layers by estimating the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension of their layers and evaluating a degree of self-similarity. The fractal transformation features key algebraic properties such as linearity, identity, and asymptotic invertibility, which is a signature of coarse structures. We show that the coarse group action exhibits a set of symmetries such as Discrete Scale Invariance (DSI) under recursive dilation, strong invariance followed by weak equivariance to permutations, alongside respecting the scaling equivariance of activation functions, defined by the intertwiner group relations. Our framework targets large-scale structural properties of DWS, deliberately overlooking minor inconsistencies to focus on significant geometric characteristics of neural networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, VGG-16, and a custom CNN validate our approach, demonstrating effective fractal segmentation and structural analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13492">Event-Driven Implementation of a Physical Reservoir Computing Framework for superficial EMG-based Gesture Recognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.13492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable health devices have a strong demand in real-time biomedical signal processing. However traditional methods often require data transmission to centralized processing unit with substantial computational resources after collecting it from edge devices. Neuromorphic computing is an emerging field that seeks to design specialized hardware for computing systems inspired by the structure, function, and dynamics of the human brain, offering significant advantages in latency and power consumption. This paper explores a novel neuromorphic implementation approach for gesture recognition by extracting spatiotemporal spiking information from surface electromyography (sEMG) data in an event-driven manner. At the same time, the network was designed by implementing a simple-structured and hardware-friendly Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) framework called Rotating Neuron Reservoir (RNR) within the domain of Spiking neural network (SNN). The spiking RNR (sRNR) is promising to pipeline an innovative solution to compact embedded wearable systems, enabling low-latency, real-time processing directly at the sensor level. The proposed system was validated by an open-access large-scale sEMG database and achieved an average classification accuracy of 74.6\% and 80.3\% using a classical machine learning classifier and a delta learning rule algorithm respectively. While the delta learning rule could be fully spiking and implementable on neuromorphic chips, the proposed gesture recognition system demonstrates the potential for near-sensor low-latency processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13942">Structured Knowledge Accumulation: An Autonomous Framework for Layer-Wise Entropy Reduction in Neural Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.13942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework, which reinterprets entropy as a dynamic, layer-wise measure of knowledge alignment in neural networks. Instead of relying on traditional gradient-based optimization, SKA defines entropy in terms of knowledge vectors and their influence on decision probabilities across multiple layers. This formulation naturally leads to the emergence of activation functions such as the sigmoid as a consequence of entropy minimization. Unlike conventional backpropagation, SKA allows each layer to optimize independently by aligning its knowledge representation with changes in decision probabilities. As a result, total network entropy decreases in a hierarchical manner, allowing knowledge structures to evolve progressively. This approach provides a scalable, biologically plausible alternative to gradient-based learning, bridging information theory and artificial intelligence while offering promising applications in resource-constrained and parallel computing environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14434">LLM-FE: Automated Feature Engineering for Tabular Data with LLMs as Evolutionary Optimizers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated feature engineering plays a critical role in improving predictive model performance for tabular learning tasks. Traditional automated feature engineering methods are limited by their reliance on pre-defined transformations within fixed, manually designed search spaces, often neglecting domain knowledge. Recent advances using Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the integration of domain knowledge into the feature engineering process. However, existing LLM-based approaches use direct prompting or rely solely on validation scores for feature selection, failing to leverage insights from prior feature discovery experiments or establish meaningful reasoning between feature generation and data-driven performance. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-FE, a novel framework that combines evolutionary search with the domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automatically discover effective features for tabular learning tasks. LLM-FE formulates feature engineering as a program search problem, where LLMs propose new feature transformation programs iteratively, and data-driven feedback guides the search process. Our results demonstrate that LLM-FE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular prediction models across diverse classification and regression benchmarks.

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant research attention in algorithm design and perception applications. However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multi-compartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a Spiking World Model (Spiking-WM), to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network (ANN)-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including SHD, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multi-compartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences. Our findings underscore the critical role of dendritic information integration in shaping neuronal function, emphasizing the importance of cooperative dendritic processing in enhancing neural computation.

                arXiv:2310.17042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StochGradAdam, a novel optimizer designed as an extension of the Adam algorithm, incorporating stochastic gradient sampling techniques to improve computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance. StochGradAdam optimizes by selectively sampling a subset of gradients during training, reducing the computational cost while preserving the advantages of adaptive learning rates and bias corrections found in Adam. Our experimental results, applied to image classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrate that StochGradAdam can achieve comparable or superior performance to Adam, even when using fewer gradient updates per iteration. By focusing on key gradient updates, StochGradAdam offers stable convergence and enhanced exploration of the loss landscape, while mitigating the impact of noisy gradients. The results suggest that this approach is particularly effective for large-scale models and datasets, providing a promising alternative to traditional optimization techniques for deep learning applications.

                arXiv:2402.16562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning algorithms, the hyperparameters tuning method refers to choosing the optimal parameters that may increase the overall performance. Manual or random hyperparameter tuning methods can lead to different results in the reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new method called QF-tuner for automatic hyperparameter tuning in the Q learning algorithm using the FOX optimization algorithm (FOX). Furthermore, a new objective function has been employed within FOX that prioritizes reward over learning error and time. QF tuner starts by running the FOX and tries to minimize the fitness value derived from observations at each iteration by executing the Q-learning algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated using two control tasks from the OpenAI Gym: CartPole and FrozenLake. The empirical results indicate that the QF-tuner outperforms other optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), bees algorithm (BA), genetic algorithms (GA), and the random method. However, on the FrozenLake task, the QF-tuner increased rewards by 36% and reduced learning time by 26%, while on the CartPole task, it increased rewards by 57% and reduced learning time by 20%. Thus, the QF-tuner is an essential method for hyperparameter tuning in Q-learning algorithms, enabling more effective solutions to control task problems.

                arXiv:2409.19606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present hyper-connections, a simple yet effective method that can serve as an alternative to residual connections. This approach specifically addresses common drawbacks observed in residual connection variants, such as the seesaw effect between gradient vanishing and representation collapse. Theoretically, hyper-connections allow the network to adjust the strength of connections between features at different depths and dynamically rearrange layers. We conduct experiments focusing on the pre-training of large language models, including dense and sparse models, where hyper-connections show significant performance improvements over residual connections. Additional experiments conducted on vision tasks also demonstrate similar improvements. We anticipate that this method will be broadly applicable and beneficial across a wide range of AI problems.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Accumulating evidence suggests that individuals with high sensory processing sensitivity often experience sensory overload and have difficulty sustaining attention, which can particularly resemble attention deficit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, due to the lack of understanding about the potential neural pathways involved in those processes, a comprehensive view of how sensory processing sensitivity and attention deficit are related is generally limited. Here, we quantified the sensory processing sensitivity and attention deficit using the Highly Sensitive Person Scale and the Adult Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale, respectively, to investigate the association between sensory processing sensitivity and attention deficit and further identify the corresponding neural substrates via the use of resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) analyses. On the behavioral level, the results indicated a significantly positive correlation between sensory processing sensitivity and attention deficit traits, while on the neural level, the sensory processing sensitivity score was positively correlated with functional connectivity between the rostral hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule, which is the core regions of the attention network. Mediation analysis revealed that hippocampus–Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL) connectivity can further influence attention deficit through a mediating role of sensory processing sensitivity. Overall, these findings suggest that enhanced functional coupling between the hippocampus and attention network regions may heighten sensitivity to environmental stimuli, leading to increased distractibility and potentially contributing to attention deficit.</span>

This study employed an ultra-high-field 5.0 T MRI to acquire high-resolution anatomical and multishell diffusion imaging data from 376 healthy adults aged 18 to 85. The aim was to correlate fornix characteristics with cognitive performance across multiple domains and map its lifespan trajectories. Using these data, we quantified fornix volume and tractography. Lifespan trajectories were identified by computing age-specific average patterns, which revealed distinct changes. Notably, nonlinear declines in fornix volume were observed, contrasting with fiber tract peaks between ages 18 to 40, which subsequently influenced volume-connectivity interactions. Additionally, a shift from predominant left-side to right-side fornix dominance was noted with aging. Regression analyses indicated that variations in fornix structure significantly moderated, rather than mediated, age-related differences in cognitive performance. These high-resolution imaging results provide novel insights into the role of the fornix’s morphology and structural connectivity in individual cognitive differences and aging.</span>

We collected behavioral and electroencephalography data using a novel inhibitory control task. Results showed that individuals with high negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale exhibited significantly greater restraint eating behavior compared to controls. Both theta and beta power differed between groups, with higher theta power in the high negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale group than in the obese group and more negative beta power in the high negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale group compared to both other groups. Theta power was greater in no-go than go conditions, while beta power was more negative in response to high-calorie versus low-calorie food stimuli. Importantly, theta power successfully decoded go/no-go conditions across all groups using multivariate pattern analysis, while beta power distinguished these conditions only in the negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale and control groups. These findings suggest that theta and beta power, along with multivariate pattern analysis, can reliably distinguish inhibitory control ability among the three groups, highlighting the importance of considering negative physical self-perception on the fatness subscale when assessing inhibitory control differences between normal-weight and obese individuals.</span>

This functional magnetic resonance imaging study tested the hypothesis that these models are encoded in the extrastriate body area. Participants were first introduced with the maximal amplitude of arm and leg movements of a “rigid” and a “flexible” actor. Then, we measured the blood oxygenation level dependent response in 25 participants while they watched video clips depicting these actors performing either “small” movements that were “possible” to perform for both actors, “large” ones that were “impossible” for both actors and “intermediate” ones that were possible only for the “flexible” actor. Results aligned with the 2 predictions of our hypothesis: (i) extrastriate body area responded more strongly to impossible than possible movements; (ii) extrastriate body area categorized intermediate movements as “possible” or “impossible” depending on each actor’s specific range of motion. The results of additional analyses suggested that extrastriate body area encodes actor-specific range of motion at the level of specific body parts, and as a probability function. Finally, the results of whole brain and functional connectivity analyses suggested that the right posterior superior temporal sulcus may also play an important role in encoding information about actor-specific biomechanical limits.</span>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-220/v3?src=rss">Assessing socioeconomic status through dental and associated tissue characteristics: A cross-sectional study for human identification [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Dental identification methods are employed to determine a person’s identity in forensic odontology. Additionally, analyzing a person’s teeth can provide insights into their socioeconomic status, which may assist in the process of identification. Our study aimed to assess the correlation between dental health status and SES among individuals, with a focus on identifying predictors of SES based on dental health indicators Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between dental health status and socioeconomic status among 135 individuals. who had visited the Department of Oral Medicine for various forms of dental care. SES was measured according to a modified Kuppuswamy scale. The associations between SES and dental health indicators were analyzed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results Dental caries is more common in lower SES groups, attributed to factors like poor nutrition and hygiene. Partial and complete edentulism are also more prevalent in lower SES populations, often due to financial constraints and lack of awareness, leading to extractions rather than restorations. However, urban populations, regardless of SES, show greater utilization of dental restorations, likely due to the concentration of dentists in cities and access to community-based dental camps offering low-cost treatments. Periodontal diseases further reflect SES disparities. Studies show that individuals from lower SES backgrounds report more severe periodontal issues, such as gingival swelling, while higher SES groups report milder symptoms like gingival bleeding, indicating earlier intervention. Conclusion SES plays a vital role in shaping health and lifestyle outcomes. The findings in our study demonstrate the value of incorporating SES indicators, such as education, occupation, marital status, and residence, into forensic investigations to enhance the precision of identification processes.

                Background Although modern phacoemulsification is considered a highly safe surgery, cystoid macular edema (CME) is the common factor contributing to poor visual results following successful surgery. Bromfenac drops may be effective in treating both acute and chronic pseudophakic CME. Objectives Evaluate the effects of the non–steroidal anti-inflammatory drug bromfenac 0.09% ophthalmic solution on macular thickness after phacoemulsification surgery and report any side effects. Method This is a prospective study done in an ophthalmic center in Iraq involving adult patients with senile or iatrogenic cataracts prepared for cataract surgery by phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and were divided into two groups: • Group one: who received 0.09% bromfenac ophthalmic solution twice daily in addition to Moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic drops every 6hrs and Dexamethasone phosphate 0.1% ophthalmic drops every 4-6hrs post-operatively. • Group two: who received only Moxifloxacin 0.5% every 6 hours and Dexamethasone phosphate 0.1% ophthalmic drop every 4-6 hours without administering bromfenac 0.09% ophthalmic drops post-operatively. Results Eighty-seven eyes of 87 patients were enrolled in the study. The preoperative mean of central retinal thickness in groups one and two was 248.53±35.6μm and 262.40±20.7μm, respectively, with a p-value of 0.029. The postoperative mean of central retinal thickness in groups one and two was 255.78±36.6 μm and 278.18±29.06 μm, respectively, with a p-value of 0.004, which is clinically significant. The only side effect reported was punctate epithelial corneal erosion in five patients in group one. Conclusion This study demonstrated that bromfenac has shown significant efficacy in preventing cystoid macular edema (CME) following cataract surgery as compared to corticosteroids alone but might cause punctate epithelium corneal erosion in some patients. Clinical trial Trial number: NCT06785090 registration date: 2025-01-15 registration URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06785090?cond=Cataract&rank=8 The registration was completed after the study commenced due to administrative and institutional requirements. As this trial was conducted as part of a master’s thesis, priority was given to obtaining ethical approval and ensuring compliance with institutional protocols, which led to an unintentional delay in registration. Once the importance of early registration for transparency and compliance was recognized, the process was promptly completed.

                Background/Purpose There are approximately 18.94 million visually impaired children worldwide, with 90% of them living in low-middle income countries. Research shows that visual impairment (VI) has a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of those affected. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how VI affects the daily activities of these children to develop management strategies that can help minimize its impact on their QoL. Therefore, qualitative research design was utilized to explore the perceived impact of VI on the daily activities of children living with VI. Methods Using a qualitative approach, purposive sampling was used to identify information-rich participants to partake in focus group discussions (FGDs) and address the aim of the study adequately. Identified data sources were divided into two groups: one with ‘experts’ who worked with children regularly, and another with school-age children aged 6-17 years, from three rural schools in Sekhukhune district, South Africa. The FGDs were guided by semi-structured interview questions. All sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, cleaned, coded, and analysed under ten domains, identified from the literature. Results A total of 477 statements and comments related to children’s vision were generated through the nine FGDs. Participants were nine experts working with children, and 49 children living with or without VI. Of the total number of statements, 60% (n = 287) were generated from FGDs with children, 63% (n = 299) were negative statements, and the remaining 19% (n = 92), and 18% (n = 86) were neutral and positive statements respectively. The most generated statements fell under the domains ‘Hobbies, Leisure and Sport’ 21% (n = 101), ‘Education’ 21% (n = 100), and ‘Psychological and Emotional’ 12.8% (n = 61). Conclusion This study offered comprehensive insights into the impact of VI on the daily activities of rural school-aged children and young people.

                Background The management of diabetes mellitus (DM) extends beyond clinical care, with self-care being equally important to achieve optimal treatment outcomes and prevent complications. Self-care in diabetes includes appropriate diet, regular exercise, blood glucose monitoring, medication adherence and foot care. The purpose of the study was to assess the obstacles faced by diabetes patients for self-care practices and to determine the factors associated with these obstacles. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 107 type 2 DM patients aged >18 years using the Diabetes Obstacles Questionnaire-30. Patients scoring a mean score >3 were considered to have an obstacle. We included age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), duration of DM and blood glucose levels as factors for regression analysis and a p-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results A large majority (64.5%, n = 69) of our participants were aged above 55 years and belonged to lower socioeconomic status (65.4%, n = 70). Family history of DM was present in 41% (n=44) of the participants. The median duration of DM among the participants was 10 (4 – 7) years. In our study, the participants faced obstacles for two items in the domains: Support from friends & family (mean score: 3.73) and knowledge of the disease (mean score: 3.58). A multinominal regression analysis revealed SES was a predictive factor for participants who could not understand information from literature with a p-value of 0.002 (OR: 3.65, CI: 1.60-8.338). Conclusion The two major obstacles to diabetes self-management practices were in the domains of support from friends and family, and knowledge of the disease. Socioeconomic status was identified as a predictive factor associated with the participants who could not understand information from the literature.

                The Raman effect originates from spontaneous inelastic scattering of photons by matter. These photons provide a characteristic fingerprint of this matter, and are extensively utilized for chemical and biological sensing. The inherently lower generation of these Raman scattered photons, do not hold potential for their direct use in sensing applications. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) overcomes the low sensitivity associated with Raman spectroscopy and assists the sensing of diverse analytes, including ions, small molecules, inorganics, organics, radionucleotides, and cells. Plasmonic nanoparticles exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and when they are closely spaced, they create hotspots where the electromagnetic field is significantly enhanced. This amplifies the Raman signal and may offer up to a 1014-fold SERS signal enhancement. The development of SERS active substrates requires further consideration and optimization of several critical features such as surface periodicity, hotspot density, mitigation of sample or surface autofluorescence, tuning of surface hydrophilicities, use of specific (bio) recognition elements with suitable linkers and bioconjugation chemistries, and use of appropriate optics to obtain relevant sensing outcomes in terms of sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, limit of detection, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), stability, shelf-life, and disposability. This article comprehensively reviews the recent advancements on the use of disposable materials such as commercial grades of paper, textiles, glasses, polymers, and some specific substrates such as blue-ray digital versatile discs (DVDs) for use as SERS-active substrates for point-of-use (POU) sensing applications. The advancements in these technologies have been reviewed and critiqued for analyte detection in resource-limited settings, highlighting the prospects of applications ranging from single-molecule to single-cell detection. We conclude by highlighting the prospects and possible avenues for developing viable field deployable sensors holding immense potential in environmental monitoring, food safety and biomedical diagnostics.

                <p>by Sui Huang, Ana M. Soto, Carlos Sonnenschein</p>

Genome sequencing of cancer and normal tissues, alongside single-cell transcriptomics, continues to produce findings that challenge the idea that cancer is a ‘genetic disease’, as posited by the somatic mutation theory (SMT). In this prevailing paradigm, tumorigenesis is caused by cancer-driving somatic mutations and clonal expansion. However, results from tumor sequencing, motivated by the genetic paradigm itself, create apparent ‘paradoxes’ that are not conducive to a pure SMT. But beyond genetic causation, the new results lend credence to old ideas from organismal biology. To resolve inconsistencies between the genetic paradigm of cancer and biological reality, we must complement deep sequencing with deep thinking: embrace formal theory and historicity of biological entities, and (re)consider non-genetic plasticity of cells and tissues. In this Essay, we discuss the concepts of cell state dynamics and tissue fields that emerge from the collective action of genes and of cells in their morphogenetic context, respectively, and how they help explain inconsistencies in the data in the context of SMT.

                <p>by Ashley T. Simkins, William J. Sutherland, Lynn V. Dicks, Craig Hilton-Taylor, Molly K. Grace, Stuart H. M. Butchart, Rebecca A. Senior, Silviu O. Petrovan</p>

Understanding the consequences of past conservation efforts is essential to inform the means of maintaining and restoring species. Data from the IUCN Red List for 67,217 animal species were reviewed and analyzed to determine (i) which conservation actions have been implemented for different species, (ii) which types of species have improved in status and (iii) which actions are likely to have driven the improvements. At least 51.8% (34,847) of assessed species have actions reported, mostly comprising protected areas (82.7%). Proportionately more actions were reported for tetrapods and warm-water reef-building corals, and fewer for fish, dragonflies and damselflies and crustaceans. Species at greater risk of extinction have a wider range of species-targeted actions reported compared with less threatened species, reflecting differences in documentation and conservation efforts. Six times more species have deteriorated than improved in status, as reflected in their IUCN Red List category. Almost all species that improved have conservation actions in place, and typically were previously at high risk of extinction, have smaller ranges and were less likely to be documented as threatened by hunting and habitat loss or degradation. Improvements in status were driven by a wide range of actions, especially reintroductions; for amphibians and birds, area management was also important. While conservation interventions have reduced the extinction risk of some of the most threatened species, in very few cases has full recovery been achieved. Scaling up the extent and intensity of conservation interventions, particularly landscape-scale actions that benefit broadly distributed species, is urgently needed to assist the recovery of biodiversity.

                Background Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined as tumors that lack the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It exhibits unique clinical and pathological features, demonstrates high aggressiveness, and has a relatively poor prognosis and clinical outcome. Objective To identify a novel drug target protein against TNBC and potential phytochemical lead molecules against the identified target. Methods In this study, we retrieved TNBC samples from NGS and microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We employed a combination of differential gene expression studies, protein-protein interaction analysis, and network topology investigation to identify the target protein. Additionally, the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies followed by Molecular Mechanics with Generalised Born Surface Area salvation was used to identify potential lead molecule. Result The upregulated genes with LogFC > 1.25 and P-value < 0.05 from the TNBC gene expression dataset were identified. Androgen receptor (AR) was found to be an appropriate hub target in the protein-protein interaction network. Phytochemicals that inhibit breast cancer target were retrieved from the PubChem database and virtual screening was performed using PyRx against the AR protein. Thereby, the AR was found to be the target protein and 2-hydroxynaringenin was discovered to be a possible phytochemical lead molecule for combating TNBC. Moreover, the AR and the 2-hydroxynaringenin complex showed structural stability and higher binding affinity through molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA studies. Conclusion AR was identified as a hub protein that is highly expressed in breast cancer and 2-hydroxynaringenin efficacy of counter TNBC requires further investigation both in vitro and in vivo.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Transitive inference, a process that involves drawing logical conclusions based on preliminary information, is considered a cornerstone of human deductive reasoning. Furthermore, transitive inference is a clear instance of representational flexibility as it implies the novel expression of learned information. In mammals and birds, both episodic memory and transitive inference critically depend on the integrity of the hippocampus. Comparative neurobiological evidence indicates that a hippocampus homologue can also be found in the telencephalic pallium of teleost fish. Here, we investigated whether goldfish demonstrate inferential behavior in a standard transitive inference task, and whether the hippocampal pallium of goldfish, akin to the hippocampus in mammals and birds, plays a role in transitive responding. We trained goldfish with hippocampal pallium lesions and sham-operated controls on a series of overlapping two-item visual premise pairs: A+B−, B+C−, C+D−, D+E−. The sham-operated animals readily learned the premise pair discriminations and responded transitively during the crucial test involving a novel pair of nonadjacent elements (B vs. D). However, hippocampal pallium-lesioned goldfish were impaired in the critical transitive inference test, although they successfully learned to discriminate the premise pairs. These findings suggest that a relational memory function, which supports the novel expression of learned information, could be a primitive feature of the vertebrate hippocampus. Such outcome contributes significantly to the ongoing debate regarding the evolutionary origins of episodic memory in vertebrates.</p>

     alt="Transcriptomic and Histological Characterization of Telocytes in the Human Dorsal Root Ganglion"/>
<p>Schematic summary of the presence and characteristics of putative telocytes in human dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In-depth in silico analysis of sequencing data suggests the presence of nine distinct telocyte subtypes in human DRG and defined more than 3000 predicted receptor–ligand interactions between neurons and telocytes. Immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the presence of CD34+ve cells with ultrastructural characteristics of telocytes next to the neuron (N)–satellite glia cell (SGC) complexes, bordering the perivascular space of small blood vessels (BVs) and separating nerve fiber bundles (Nf bundles).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Telocytes are interstitial cells characterized by long processes that span considerable distances within tissues, likely facilitating coordination and interaction with various cell types. Although present in central and peripheral neuronal tissues, their role remains elusive. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) house pseudounipolar afferent neurons responsible for transmitting signals related to temperature, proprioception, and nociception. This study aimed to investigate the presence and function of telocytes in human DRG by examining their transcriptional profile, anatomical location, and ultrastructure.</p>
<p>Combined expression of <i>CD34</i> and <i>PDGFRA</i> is a marker gene set for telocytes, and our sequencing data revealed CD34 and PDGFRA expressing cells comprise roughly 1.5%–3% of DRG cells. Combined expression of <i>CD34</i> and <i>PDGFRA</i> is a putative marker gene set for telocytes. Further analysis identified nine subclusters with enriched cluster-specific genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) pathway analysis suggested vascular, immune, and connective tissue-associated putative telocyte subtypes, mapping over 3000 potential receptor–ligand interactions between sensory neurons and these <i>CD34</i> and <i>PDGFRA</i> expressing putative telocytes were identified using a ligand–receptors interactome platform. Immunohistochemistry identified CD34+ve telocytes in the endoneural space of DRGs, next to neuron–satellite complexes, in perivascular spaces and in the endoneural space between nerve fiber bundles, consistent with pathway analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed their location identifying characteristic elongated nucleus, long and thin telopodes containing vesicles, often surrounded by a basal lamina. This study provides the first gene expression analysis of telocytes in complex human tissue, specifically the DRG, highlighting functional differences based on tissue location while revealing no significant ultrastructural variations.</p>

                Zou et al. showed that TMEM63B is required for thirst-driven water intake. TMEM63B is a pore-forming subunit of the hyperosmosensitive channel and mediates the hypertonic-induced currents in SFO thirst-initiation neurons, supporting TMEM63B as a mammalian hyperosmolar sensor for thirst.

                Rao et al. found that lactylation stimulates the proteasomal degradation of cGAS independent of ubiquitin, which is compromised by phosphorylation of PSMA4 via disrupting its association with cGAS. Lactylation rewires PIK3CB activity and impairs ULK1-driven phosphorylation of PSMA4. Consequently, lactylation of cGAS sustains tumor growth and indicates the prognosis of LUAD.

                Wang et al. show that AGO2 suppresses tumor cell responses to IFN-γ by promoting its interaction with miR-1246, thereby impairing STAT1 activation and subsequently inhibiting CD8+ T cell anti-tumor immunity. Inhibiting AGO2 re-sensitizes tumors to IFN-γ, restoring CD8+ T cell function and enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy.

                How cells ensure that they enter mitosis after completing replication of their genome is not fully resolved. Sobkowiak et al. describe a checkpoint involving REV7. This checkpoint has mechanistic similarities to the spindle anaphase checkpoint mediated by MAD2, a protein structurally related to REV7.

                <p>Nature Methods, Published online: 18 March 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02628-z">doi:10.1038/s41592-025-02628-z</a></p>We introduce a dual-view graph neural network (GNN) framework called scNET that integrates scRNA-seq data with protein–protein interaction networks. This approach enhances the characterization of gene functions, pathways and gene–gene relationships and improves cell clustering and the identification of differentially activated biological pathways across conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93754">Pain persists in mice lacking both Substance P and CGRPα signaling</a></h4>

              
                The neuropeptides Substance P and CGRPα have long been thought important for pain sensation. Both peptides and their receptors are expressed at high levels in pain-responsive neurons from the periphery to the brain making them attractive therapeutic targets. However, drugs targeting these pathways individually did not relieve pain in clinical trials. Since Substance P and CGRPα are extensively co-expressed, we hypothesized that their simultaneous inhibition would be required for effective analgesia. We therefore generated <i>Tac1</i> and <i>Calca</i> double knockout (DKO) mice and assessed their behavior using a wide range of pain-relevant assays. As expected, Substance P and CGRPα peptides were undetectable throughout the nervous system of DKO mice. To our surprise, these animals displayed largely intact responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical, and visceral pain stimuli, as well as itch. Moreover, chronic inflammatory pain and neurogenic inflammation were unaffected by loss of the two peptides. Finally, neuropathic pain evoked by nerve injury or chemotherapy treatment was also preserved in peptide-deficient mice. Thus, our results demonstrate that even in combination, Substance P and CGRPα are not required for the transmission of acute and chronic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96892">Untargeted pixel-by-pixel metabolite ratio imaging as a novel tool for biomedical discovery in mass spectrometry imaging</a></h4>

              
                Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technology used to define the spatial distribution and relative abundance of metabolites across tissue cryosections. While software packages exist for pixel-by-pixel individual metabolite and limited target pairs of ratio imaging, the research community lacks an easy computing and application tool that images any metabolite abundance ratio pairs. Importantly, recognition of correlated metabolite pairs may contribute to the discovery of unanticipated molecules in shared metabolic pathways. Here, we describe the development and implementation of an untargeted R package workflow for pixel-by-pixel ratio imaging of all metabolites detected in an MSI experiment. Considering untargeted MSI studies of murine brain and embryogenesis, we demonstrate that ratio imaging minimizes systematic data variation introduced by sample handling, markedly enhances spatial image contrast, and reveals previously unrecognized metabotype-distinct tissue regions. Furthermore, ratio imaging facilitates identification of novel regional biomarkers and provides anatomical information regarding spatial distribution of metabolite-linked biochemical pathways. The algorithm described herein is applicable to any MSI dataset containing spatial information for metabolites, peptides or proteins, offering a potent hypothesis generation tool to enhance knowledge obtained from current spatial metabolite profiling technologies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100830">Enhanced neural speech tracking through noise indicates stochastic resonance in humans</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity in auditory cortex tracks the amplitude-onset envelope of continuous speech, but recent work counterintuitively suggests that neural tracking increases when speech is masked by background noise, despite reduced speech intelligibility. Noise-related amplification could indicate that stochastic resonance – the response facilitation through noise – supports neural speech tracking, but a comprehensive account is lacking. In five human electroencephalography experiments, the current study demonstrates a generalized enhancement of neural speech tracking due to minimal background noise. Results show that (1) neural speech tracking is enhanced for speech masked by background noise at very high signal-to-noise ratios (~30 dB SNR) where speech is highly intelligible; (2) this enhancement is independent of attention; (3) it generalizes across different stationary background maskers, but is strongest for 12-talker babble; and (4) it is present for headphone and free-field listening, suggesting that the neural-tracking enhancement generalizes to real-life listening. The work paints a clear picture that minimal background noise enhances the neural representation of the speech onset-envelope, suggesting that stochastic resonance contributes to neural speech tracking. The work further highlights non-linearities of neural tracking induced by background noise that make its use as a biological marker for speech processing challenging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97325">The autophagy protein ATG14 safeguards against unscheduled pyroptosis activation to enable embryo transport during early pregnancy</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent pregnancy loss, characterized by two or more failed clinical pregnancies, poses a significant challenge to reproductive health. In addition to embryo quality and endometrial function, proper oviduct function is also essential for successful pregnancy establishment. Therefore, structural abnormalities or inflammation resulting from infection in the oviduct may impede the transport of embryos to the endometrium, thereby increasing the risk of miscarriage. However, our understanding of the biological processes that preserve the oviductal cellular structure and functional integrity is limited. Here, we report that autophagy-related protein ATG14 plays a crucial role in maintaining the cellular integrity of the oviduct by controlling inflammatory responses, thereby supporting efficient embryo transport. Specifically, the conditional depletion of the autophagy-related gene <i>Atg14</i> in the oviduct causes severe structural abnormalities compromising its cellular integrity, leading to the abnormal retention of embryos. Interestingly, the selective loss of <i>Atg14</i> in oviduct ciliary epithelial cells did not impact female fertility, highlighting the specificity of ATG14 function in distinct cell types within the oviduct. Mechanistically, loss of <i>Atg14</i> triggered unscheduled pyroptosis via altering the mitochondrial integrity, leading to inappropriate embryo retention and impeded embryo transport in the oviduct. Finally, pharmacological activation of pyroptosis in pregnant mice phenocopied the genetically induced defect and caused impairment in embryo transport. Together, we found that ATG14 safeguards against unscheduled pyroptosis activation to enable embryo transport from the oviduct to uterus for the successful implantation. Of clinical significance, these findings provide possible insights into the underlying mechanism(s) of early pregnancy loss and might aid in developing novel prevention strategies using autophagy modulators.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100990">Mistargeted retinal axons induce a synaptically independent subcircuit in the visual thalamus of albino mice</a></h4>

              
                In albino mice and EphB1 knockout mice, mistargeted retinal ganglion cell axons form dense islands of axon terminals in the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei (dLGN). The formation of these islands of retinal input depends on developmental patterns of spontaneous retinal activity. We reconstructed the microcircuitry of the activity-dependent islands and found that the boundaries of the island represent a remarkably strong segregation within retinogeniculate connectivity. We conclude that when sets of retinal input are established in the wrong part of the dLGN, the developing circuitry responds by forming a synaptically isolated subcircuit within the otherwise fully connected network. The fact that there is a developmental starting condition that can induce a synaptically segregated microcircuit has important implications for our understanding of the organization of visual circuits and our understanding of the implementation of activity-dependent development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92618">Spatial transcriptomics in the adult Drosophila brain and body</a></h4>

              
                Recently, we have achieved a significant milestone with the creation of the Fly Cell Atlas. This single-nuclei atlas encompasses the entire fly, covering the entire head and body, in addition to all major organs. This atlas catalogs many hundreds of cell types, of which we annotated 250. Thus, a large number of clusters remain to be fully characterized, in particular in the brain. Furthermore, by applying single-nuclei sequencing, all information about the spatial location of the cells in the body and of about possible subcellular localization of the mRNAs within these cells is lost. Spatial transcriptomics promises to tackle these issues. In a proof-of-concept study, we have here applied spatial transcriptomics using a selected gene panel to pinpoint the locations of 150 mRNA species in the adult fly. This enabled us to map unknown clusters identified in the Fly Cell Atlas to their spatial locations in the fly brain. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics discovered interesting principles of mRNA localization and transcriptional diversity within the large and crowded muscle cells that may spark future mechanistic investigations. Furthermore, we present a set of computational tools that will allow for easier integration of spatial transcriptomics and single-cell datasets.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent advances in theoretical biology suggest that key definitions of basal cognition and sentient behavior may arise as emergent properties of in vitro cell cultures and neuronal networks. Such neuronal networks reorganize activity to demonstrate structured behaviors when embodied in structured information landscapes. In this article, we characterize this kind of self-organization through the lens of the free energy principle, that is, as self-evidencing. We do this by first discussing the definitions of reactive and sentient behavior in the setting of active inference, which describes the behavior of agents that model the consequences of their actions. We then introduce a formal account of intentional behavior that describes agents as driven by a preferred end point or goal in latent state-spaces. We then investigate these forms of (reactive, sentient, and intentional) behavior using simulations. First, we simulate the in vitro experiments, in which neuronal cultures modulated activity to improve gameplay in a simplified version of Pong by implementing nested, free energy minimizing processes. The simulations are then used to deconstruct the ensuing predictive behavior, leading to the distinction between merely reactive, sentient, and intentional behavior with the latter formalized in terms of inductive inference. This distinction is further studied using simple machine learning benchmarks (navigation in a grid world and the Tower of Hanoi problem) that show how quickly and efficiently adaptive behavior emerges under an inductive form of active inference.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We construct a thermodynamic potential that can guide training of a generative model defined on a set of binary degrees of freedom. We argue that upon reduction in description, so as to make the generative model computationally manageable, the potential develops multiple minima. This is mirrored by the emergence of multiple minima in the free energy proper of the generative model itself. The variety of training samples that employ N binary degrees of freedom is ordinarily much lower than the size 2N of the full phase space. The nonrepresented configurations, we argue, should be thought of as comprising a high-temperature phase separated by an extensive energy gap from the configurations composing the training set. Thus, training amounts to sampling a free energy surface in the form of a library of distinct bound states, each of which breaks ergodicity. The ergodicity breaking prevents escape into the near continuum of states comprising the high-temperature phase; thus, it is necessary for proper functionality. It may, however, have the side effect of limiting access to patterns that were underrepresented in the training set. At the same time, the ergodicity breaking within the library complicates both learning and retrieval. As a remedy, one may concurrently employ multiple generative models—up to one model per free energy minimum.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Forecasting electroencephalography (EEG) signals, that is, estimating future values of the time series based on the past ones, is essential in many real-time EEG-based applications, such as brain–computer interfaces and closed-loop brain stimulation. As these applications are becoming more and more common, the importance of a good prediction model has increased. Previously, the autoregressive model (AR) has been employed for this task; however, its prediction accuracy tends to fade quickly as multiple steps are predicted. We aim to improve on this by applying probabilistic deep learning to make robust longer-range forecasts.For this, we applied the probabilistic deep neural network model WaveNet to forecast resting-state EEG in theta- (4–7.5 Hz) and alpha-frequency (8–13 Hz) bands and compared it to the AR model.WaveNet reliably predicted EEG signals in both theta and alpha frequencies 150 ms ahead, with mean absolute errors of 1.0 ± 1.1 µV (theta) and 0.9 ± 1.1 µV (alpha), and outperformed the AR model in estimating the signal amplitude and phase. Furthermore, we found that the probabilistic approach offers a way of forecasting even more accurately while effectively discarding uncertain predictions.We demonstrate for the first time that probabilistic deep learning can be used to forecast resting-state EEG time series. In the future, the developed model can enhance the real-time estimation of brain states in brain–computer interfaces and brain stimulation protocols. It may also be useful for answering neuroscientific questions and for diagnostic purposes.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>From biological and artificial network perspectives, researchers have started acknowledging astrocytes as computational units mediating neural processes. Here, we propose a novel biologically inspired neuron-astrocyte network model for image recognition, one of the first attempts at implementing astrocytes in spiking neuron networks (SNNs) using a standard data set. The architecture for image recognition has three primary units: the preprocessing unit for converting the image pixels into spiking patterns, the neuron-astrocyte network forming bipartite (neural connections) and tripartite synapses (neural and astrocytic connections), and the classifier unit. In the astrocyte-mediated SNNs, an astrocyte integrates neural signals following the simplified Postnov model. It then modulates the integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons via gliotransmission, thereby strengthening the synaptic connections of the neurons within the astrocytic territory. We develop an architecture derived from a baseline SNN model for unsupervised digit classification. The spiking neuron-astrocyte networks (SNANs) display better network performance with an optimal variance-bias trade-off than SNN alone. We demonstrate that astrocytes promote faster learning, support memory formation and recognition, and provide a simplified network architecture. Our proposed SNAN can serve as a benchmark for future researchers on astrocyte implementation in artificial networks, particularly in neuromorphic systems, for its simplified design.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We propose a sparse deep ReLU network (SDRN) estimator of the regression function obtained from regularized empirical risk minimization with a Lipschitz loss function. Our framework can be applied to a variety of regression and classification problems. We establish novel nonasymptotic excess risk bounds for our SDRN estimator when the regression function belongs to a Sobolev space with mixed derivatives. We obtain a new, nearly optimal, risk rate in the sense that the SDRN estimator can achieve nearly the same optimal minimax convergence rate as one-dimensional nonparametric regression with the dimension involved in a logarithm term only when the feature dimension is fixed. The estimator has a slightly slower rate when the dimension grows with the sample size. We show that the depth of the SDRN estimator grows with the sample size in logarithmic order, and the total number of nodes and weights grows in polynomial order of the sample size to have the nearly optimal risk rate. The proposed SDRN can go deeper with fewer parameters to well estimate the regression and overcome the overfitting problem encountered by conventional feedforward neural networks.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neocortical layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells are prone to exhibiting burst firing on receipt of coincident basal and apical dendritic inputs. These inputs carry different information, with basal inputs coming from feedforward sensory pathways and apical inputs coming from diverse sources that provide context in the cortical hierarchy. We explore the information processing possibilities of this burst firing using computer simulations of a noisy compartmental cell model. Simulated data on stochastic burst firing due to brief, simultaneously injected basal and apical currents allow estimation of burst firing probability for different stimulus current amplitudes. Information-theory-based partial information decomposition (PID) is used to quantify the contributions of the apical and basal input streams to the information in the cell output bursting probability. Four different operating regimes are apparent, depending on the relative strengths of the input streams, with output burst probability carrying more or less information that is uniquely contributed by either the basal or apical input, or shared and synergistic information due to the combined streams. We derive and fit transfer functions for these different regimes that describe burst probability over the different ranges of basal and apical input amplitudes. The operating regimes can be classified into distinct modes of information processing, depending on the contribution of apical input to output bursting: apical cooperation, in which both basal and apical inputs are required to generate a burst; apical amplification, in which basal input alone can generate a burst but the burst probability is modulated by apical input; apical drive, in which apical input alone can produce a burst; and apical integration, in which strong apical or basal inputs alone, as well as their combination, can generate bursting. In particular, PID and the transfer function clarify that the apical amplification mode has the features required for contextually modulated information processing.</span>

">Hitting the right pitch: Cortical tracking of fundamental frequency changes across speech rates in auditory and sensorimotor regions</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal entrainment to speech properties is essential for language processing, particularly through oscillatory tracking of slower rhythms corresponding to the syllabic rate. However, it remains less explored whether brain rhythms also synchronize with higher-frequency speech components, particularly the fundamental frequency (F0) or pitch. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate cortical tracking of F0 while participants listened to sentences produced at natural normal and fast rates, but also to time-compressed speech. We examined how pitch changes accompanying natural increases in speech rate modulate brain-to-speech coupling and compared this with artificially accelerated speech, where F0 is unchanged. We also explored whether this coupling is confined to the auditory cortex or involves a broader cortical network. We computed whole-brain cortico-acoustic coupling between the MEG source time-series and the speech signal, alongside spectral power modulations in frequency bands centered on the mean F0 of the speech material. We found significant brain-to-F0 coupling in the right auditory, inferior parietal, insular, and pre- and postcentral regions across all speech rate conditions. Importantly, the peak neuro-acoustic coupling frequency adjusted to reflect the F0 increase due to natural rate acceleration. Interestingly, we found significant brain-speech coupling around F0 not only in the primary auditory cortex but also in a postcentral somatosensory region likely corresponding to the ventral larynx area. These findings provide new insights into frequency-specific cortical tracking of F0 during the perception of naturally-produced speech at varying rates and suggest the involvement of an auditory-somato-motor network that may facilitate the recognition of articulatory features during speech perception.

">Second-Scale Neural Dynamics Shape Hormonal Outputs in Hypothalamic CRH Neurons</a></h4>

              
                The elevation of glucocorticoids is a hallmark of stress, arising from the integration of rapid neuronal signals into sustained hormonal outputs. A key interface for this neuroendocrine signal translation is corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), which release CRH at the median eminence (ME). We recently discovered that CRHPVN neurons exhibit a characteristic shift in firing patterns from rhythmic short-bursts (low-activity state) to tonic firing (high-activity state) in response to stress. This raised a critical question: how are these distinct firing patterns are integrated into slower, sustained hormonal outputs at neuroendocrine terminals? Here, we implemented optical approaches to detect CRH release ex vivo and in vivo. Using newly developed sniffer cells for CRH, we measured CRH release at ME ex vivo, triggered by the distinct, in vivo-like firing patterns. Our results demonstrated that the primary determinant of neuroendocrine CRH release was the firing rate sustained over the timescale of seconds, with little contribution from specific firing patterns. These results collaborated with second-scale increase in firing rate triggered by stress stimuli. Additionally, we recorded the dynamics of CRH at the ME in the freely moving mice using genetically-encoded GPCR-activation based (GRAB) sensors for CRH. Foot shock stress triggered transient, time-locked increases in CRH release on the timescale of seconds. Importantly, these second-scale CRH pulses, when elicited during repeated foot shocks, were integrated over minutes to scale downstream hormone releases. Together, our data revealed critical roles of second-scale dynamics in CRHPVN neuron activity for the neuroendocrine translation of stress signals.

">Visualization of functional and effective connectivity underlying auditory descriptive naming</a></h4>

              
                Objective: We visualized functional and effective connectivity within specific white matter networks in response to auditory descriptive questions. Methods: We investigated 40 Japanese-speaking patients with focal epilepsy and estimated connectivity measures using cortical high-gamma dynamics and MRI tractography. Results: Hearing a wh-interrogative at question onset enhanced inter-hemispheric functional connectivity, with left-to-right callosal facilitatory flows between the superior-temporal gyri, contrasted by functional connectivity diminution with right-to-left callosal suppressive flows between dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Processing verbs associated with concrete objects or adverbs increased left intra-hemispheric connectivity, with bidirectional facilitatory flows through extensive white matter pathways. Questions beginning with what, compared to where, induced greater neural engagement in the left posterior inferior-frontal gyrus at question offset, linked to enhanced functional connectivity and bidirectional facilitatory flows to the temporal lobe neocortex via the arcuate fasciculus. During overt responses, inter-hemispheric functional connectivity was enhanced, with bidirectional callosal flows between Rolandic areas, and individuals with higher IQ scores exhibited less prolonged neural engagement in the left posterior middle frontal gyrus. Conclusions: Visualization of directional neural interactions within white matter networks during overt naming is feasible. Significance: Phrase order may influence network dynamics in listeners, even when presented with auditory descriptive questions conveying similar meanings.

">Sex-specific and age-related progression of auditory neurophysiological deficits in the Cln3 mouse model of Batten disease</a></h4>

              
                CLN3 disease is a prevalent form of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) caused by inherited mutations in the CLN3 gene, with symptoms such as vision loss, language impairment, and cognitive decline. The early onset of visual deficits complicates neurological assessment of brain pathophysiology underlying cognitive decline, while the small number of CLN3 mutation cases in humans hinders the study of sex differences. Building on our recent progress in assessing auditory neurophysiological changes in CLN3 patients, we developed a parallel approach using electroencephalography arrays in Cln3 knockout (Cln3-/-) mice to investigate the longitudinal progression of auditory processing deficits in both sexes. We employed a duration mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm, similar to that used in our CLN3 patient studies, to assess the automatic detection of pattern changes in a sequence of stimuli. Wild-type mice of both sexes showed robust duration MMN responses when assessed longitudinally in the same subjects from 3 to 9 months of age. In contrast, female Cln3-/- mice developed consistent MMN deficits throughout this age range, while male Cln3-/- mice exhibited MMN deficits at younger ages that were mitigated at older ages. Analyses of auditory brainstem responses indicate that MMN abnormalities in Cln3-/- mice are not due to peripheral hearing loss. Instead, these deficits originate centrally from sex-specific and age-related changes in auditory evoked potentials elicited by standard and deviant stimuli. Our findings reveal a sex-specific progression of central auditory processing deficits in Cln3-/- mice, supporting auditory duration MMN as a translational neurophysiological biomarker for mechanistic studies and therapeutic development.

">Associative coding of conditioned fear in the thalamic nucleus reuniens in rodents and humans</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus reuniens (RE) is a midline thalamic structure interconnecting the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC). Recent work in both rodents and humans implicates the RE in the adaptive regulation of emotional memories, including the suppression of learned fear. However, the neural correlates of aversive learning in the RE of rodents and humans remains unclear. To address this, we recorded RE activity in humans (BOLD fMRI) and rats (fiber photometry) during Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction. In both rats and humans, we found that conditioned stimulus (CS)-evoked activity in RE reflects the associative value of the CS. In rats, we additionally found that spontaneous neural activity in RE tracks defensive freezing and shows anticipatory increases in calcium activity that precede the termination of freezing behavior. Single-unit recordings in rats confirmed that individual RE neurons index both the associative value of the CS and defensive behavior transitions. Moreover, distinct neuronal ensembles in the RE encode fear versus extinction memories. These findings suggest a conserved role of the RE across species in modulating defensive states and emotional memory processes, providing a foundation for future translational re-search on fear-related disorders.

">Atrophin-1 Antisense Oligonucleotide Provides Robust Protection from Pathology in a Fully Humanized DRPLA Model</a></h4>

              
                Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease arising from a CAG repeat expansion in the atrophin-1 (ATN1) gene. Because DRPLA, like many repeat expansion disorders (REDs), arises predominantly from toxic gain-of-function mechanisms, we hypothesized that ATN1 knockdown would have therapeutic potential. To test this, we established the first fully-humanized mouse model of a RED, in which one allele of mouse Atn1 is completely replaced by human ATN1, including 112 pure CAG repeats. This novel approach to exploring RED biology provides significant advantages, notably the ability to test sequence-specific therapeutics targeting human sequences, even in introns and untranslated regions of pre-mRNA. We found that our model, the Atn1Q112/+ mouse, recapitulates key features of human DRPLA, including behavioral alterations, reduced brain size and aggregate accumulation. We treated Atn1Q112/+ mice with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting mouse Atn1 (to probe for loss of function concerns), human ATN1, or a combination. Treatment with human, but not mouse, ATN1-targeting ASOs provides remarkable protection from a range of disease-related behavioral phenotypes, including aggregation of mutant ATN1 (mATN1), and marked rescue of transcriptional dysregulation in the cerebellum. These results have helped motivate an ongoing human clinical study of ASOs targeting ATN1 for DRPLA.

">Utility of the Recombinase Driver CX3CR1::Cre Rat Strain to Evaluate Microglial Contributions to Nicotine Addiction</a></h4>

              
                Smoking remains a leading preventable cause of death, and nicotine is the primary substance responsible for maintaining use of tobacco products. Preclinical rodent models have shown that neuroimmune signaling is dysregulated by nicotine self-administration (SA) within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), which is a key region within the mesolimbic brain reward pathway. Microglia are the resident brain immune cell and prior studies have shown that they play an important role in nicotine-related behaviors. However, while there are transgenic mouse lines that allow for specific evaluations of microglia to neurobiology and behavior, there are fewer tools available for rats as a model species thus limiting our ability to evaluate specific contributions of microglia to nicotine SA. Using transgenic rats expressing Cre under the control of the CX3CR1 promoter bred on a Long Evans (LE) background, we show that NAcore microglia can be specifically transduced with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). We further show that CX3CR1::Cre rats readily self-administer nicotine, and display a characteristic extinction curve that is not different from outbred LE or Cre-negative littermates. Together, these validation studies lay the foundation for future use of this transgenic rat line to evaluate the specific contributions of microglia in the brain to neurobehavioral underpinnings of nicotine addiction.

">Beyond Pairwise Connections in Complex Systems: Insights into the Human Multiscale Psychotic Brain</a></h4>

              
                Complex biological systems, like the brain, exhibit intricate multiway and multiscale interactions that drive emergent behaviors. In psychiatry, neural processes extend beyond pairwise connectivity, involving higher-order interactions critical for understanding mental disorders. Conventional brain network studies focus on pairwise links, offering insights into basic connectivity but failing to capture the complexity of neural dysfunction in psychiatric conditions. This study aims to bridge this gap by applying a matrix-based entropy functional to estimate total correlation, a mathematical framework that incorporates multivariate information measures extending beyond pairwise interactions. We apply this framework to fMRI-ICA-derived multiscale brain networks, enabling the investigation of interactions beyond pairwise relationships in the human multiscale brain. Additionally, this approach holds promise for psychiatric studies, providing a new lens through which to explore beyond pairwise brain network interactions. By examining both triple interactions and the latent factors underlying the triadic relationships among intrinsic brain connectivity networks through tensor decomposition, our study presents a novel approach to understanding higher-order brain dynamics. This framework not only enhances our understanding of complex brain functions but also offers new opportunities for investigating pathophysiology, potentially informing more targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the methodology of analyzing multiway interactions beyond pairwise connections can be applied to any signal analysis. In this study, we specifically explore its application to neural signals, demonstrating its power in uncovering complex multiway interaction patterns of brain activity, which provide a window to explore connectivity beyond pairwise interactions in the multiscale functionality of the brain.

">T1-weighted fMRI in mouse visual cortex using an Iron Oxide Nanoparticle contrast agent and Ultrashort Echo Time (UTE) imaging at 9.4 T</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using T1-weighted fMRI with an iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent and Ultrashort Echo Time (UTE) imaging at 9.4T to measure functional hyperaemia in the mouse visual cortex. The goal is to capture positive signal changes in both the parenchyma and pial surface, and to test whether surface vessels respond during neuronal activation. Methods: The study involved scanning of nine mice after administration of iron oxide-based superparamagnetic contrast agent (Molday ION) via the tail vein. Two functional imaging experiments were conducted: one to investigate the effect of echo time on the functional response, and another to characterize the impact of higher resolution on UTE functional contrast. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in the parenchyma and pial surface of the visual cortex. Results: The administration of the contrast agent produced a bright-blood signal in the vasculature in structural MRI when using a UTE acquisition. Positive signal changes were observed at the shortest echo time (0.164 ms) in both the parenchyma (0.2% +/- 0.08) and pial surface (0.2% +/- 0.1 %), providing evidence that UTE fMRI experiments can detect changes in both pial and parenchymal vessels. Measurements using longer echo times ([&ge;]1 ms) showed negative signal changes. Higher spatial resolution resulted in increased percent signal change at the pial surface, suggesting less partial volume effects and better delineation of surface vessels. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that T1-weighted fMRI with UTE imaging and iron oxide nanoparticles captures positive signal changes across all vascular compartments, providing additional insights into the involvement of surface vessels during functional hyperemia.

">Interpersonal Neural Synchrony Across Levels of Interpersonal Closeness and Social Interactivity</a></h4>

              
                Interpersonal neural synchrony is a key marker of social interactions, offering insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human connection and developmental outcomes. So far, hyperscanning studies have examined synchrony across diverse dyads and tasks, leading to inconsistencies and limiting cross-study comparability. This variability challenges the establishment of a unified theoretical framework for neural synchrony. This study investigated the effects of interpersonal closeness and social interactivity on neural synchrony using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning. We recorded brain activity from 142 dyads (70 close-friend, 39 romantic-partner, and 33 mother-child dyads) across three interaction conditions: video co-watching (passive), a cooperative game (structured active), and free interaction (unstructured active). Neural synchrony was computed between participants' bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) using wavelet transform coherence. Results showed that true dyads exhibited significantly higher synchrony than non-interacting surrogate dyads (q < .001), particularly in combinations involving the right IFG, left IFG, and left TPJ. Mother-child dyads displayed lower synchrony than adult-adult dyads at the global (p < .001) and local level of analysis. At the global level, synchrony was highest during video co-watching, followed by the cooperative game and free interaction (p < .001). However, left IFG-left IFG and left IFG-right TPJ synchrony peaked during the cooperative game. These findings highlight the role of brain maturation and social task structure in shaping neural synchrony. By providing an experimental framework, this study lays the groundwork for future hypothesis-driven hyperscanning research, advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying human social interactions.

">KCa3.1 Contributes to Neuroinflammation and Nigral Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in Experimental models of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Chronic neuroinflammation and misfolded -synuclein (Syn) have been identified as key pathological correlates driving Parkinsons disease (PD) pathogenesis; however, the contribution of ion channels to microglia activation in the context of -synucleinopathy remains elusive. Herein, we show that KCa3.1, a calcium-activated potassium channel, is robustly upregulated within microglia in multiple preclinical models of PD and, most importantly, in human PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) brains. Pharmacological inhibition of KCa3.1 via senicapoc or TRAM-34 inhibits KCa3.1 channel activity and the associated reactive microglial phenotype in response to aggregated Syn, as well as ameliorates of PD like pathology in diverse PD mouse models. Additionally, proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of microglia revealed that senicapoc ameliorates aggregated Syn-induced, inflammation-associated pathways and dysregulated metabolism in primary microglial cells. Mechanistically, FYN kinase in a STAT1 dependent manner regulates KCa3.1 mediated the microglial reactive activation phenotype after -synucleinopathy. Moreover, reduced neuroinflammation and subsequent PD-like neuropathology were observed in SYN AAV inoculated KCa3.1 knockout mice. Together, these findings suggest that KCa3.1 inhibition represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating patients with PD and related -synucleinopathies.

">Catecholamine Precursor Modulation of Human Exploration:Evidence From a Large Gender-Balanced Sample</a></h4>

              
                The catecholamine precursor tyrosine has been linked to improved cognitive performance, but investigations into decision-making and reinforcement learning processes known to be under catecholamine control are sparse. We examined the impact of a single dose of Tyrosine (2g) on reinforcement learning and exploration in a large (n=63) gender-balanced sample in a within-subjects preregistered study. Reinforcement learning performance was improved under Tyrosine, and computational modeling revealed that this performance increase was due to a stabilization of choice behavior reflected in increased value-driven exploitation. Further non-preregistered modeling analyses confirmed that accounting for higher-order perseveration substantially improved model fit, and substantiated the observation of increased value-driven exploitation under Tyrosine. Furthermore, it revealed a more fine-grained computational impact of Tyrosine, showing attenuated effects of directed exploration and value-independent perseveration. Supplementation with Tyrosine therefore improved reinforcement learning performance by stabilizing choice patterns in the service of optimizing reward accumulation. Results confirm that Tyrosine supplementation modulates specific computational mechanisms thought to be under catecholamine control.

">Overexpression of alpha synuclein in Midbrain Dopamine Neurons Reduces Dopamine Release Without Cell Loss and Drives Mild Motor Deficits in Mice</a></h4>

              
                It has proven challenging to faithfully recapitulate the key pathological, physiological, and behavioral features of Parkinson Disease (PD) in animals. Here we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to achieve cell type-specific overexpression of wild-type human -synuclein (syn) and a fluorophore (mCherry) in midbrain dopamine neurons to model PD in mice. We found that AAVs drove selective expression of both syn and mCherry in midbrain dopamine neurons. In conjunction with approximately 2-fold overexpression of syn, we found several histopathological markers of PD-like pathology, including progressive accumulation of phosphorylated and aggregated syn, ubiquitin, and a reduction in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, without overt cell loss. In parallel, syn overexpression drove a profound loss of evoked dopamine release, without a substantive change in the intrinsic properties of dopamine neurons, nor in striatal dopamine content. Finally, syn overexpression led to mild locomotor deficits. Together, these findings suggest that moderate syn overexpression can mimic some aspects of premotor and early symptomatic phases of PD, including markers of Lewy Body-like pathology and functional loss of evoked dopamine release. This model may be useful for investigating cellular and circuit mechanisms related to PD pathogenesis and progression.

">A corticostriatal learning mechanism linking excess striatal dopamine and auditory hallucinations</a></h4>

              
                Auditory hallucinations are linked to elevated striatal dopamine, but their underlying computational mechanisms have been obscured by regional heterogeneity in striatal dopamine signaling. To address this, we developed a normative circuit model in which corticostriatal plasticity in the ventral striatum is modulated by reward prediction errors to drive reinforcement learning while that in the sensory-dorsal striatum is modulated by sensory prediction errors derived from internal belief to drive self-supervised learning. We then validate the key predictions of this model using dopamine recordings across striatal regions in mice, as well as human behavior in a hybrid learning task. Finally, we find that changes in learning resulting from optogenetic stimulation of the sensory striatum in mice and individual variability in hallucination proneness in humans are best explained by selectively enhancing dopamine levels in the model sensory striatum. These findings identify plasticity mechanisms underlying biased learning of sensory expectations as a biologically plausible link between excess dopamine and hallucinations.

">Medial temporal lobe encodes cognitive maps of real-world social networks</a></h4>

              
                People routinely navigate their complex social networks[1]: From gossiping strategically with others[2-4] to brokering connections between siloed groups[5,6], our ability to make adaptive social choices hinges on whether we can construct useful mental representations of the social ties within our communities[7]. While decades of neuroscience research have shown that the medial temporal lobe encodes cognitive maps of physical[8-10] or conceptual space[11], how the brain represents our social networks in the wild to solve social problems remains unknown. By combining computational models with functional neuroimaging and longitudinal measurement of an evolving and densely interconnected real-world human network (N=187), we show that the entorhinal cortex encodes a cognitive map of the long-range connectivity between pairs of network members. This social map reflects the particular demands of social navigation and is specifically formatted to encode the simultaneous connectivity between network members, which critically enables tracking how information diffuses across the network. Moreover, the strength of its encoding in the entorhinal cortex aids in brokering connections that improve cohesion within people's social communities. Our results illuminate how a domain-general neural mechanism[12,13] is tailored to prioritize the natural dynamics of social phenomena in order to support adaptive navigation through these highly complex environments.

                Sustained labeling of fluids is crucial for their investigation in animal models. Here, we introduce a mouse line (Alb-mSc-ST), where blood and interstitial fluid are labeled with the red fluorescent protein mScarlet and SpyTag. The SpyTag-SpyCatcher technology is exploited to monitor circulating fluid properties by biosensors or detect blood-brain barrier disruption. This approach represents a valuable tool for studying vascular structure, permeability and microenvironment in body organs in vivo.

">Genetic targeting of myelinated primary afferent neurons using a new NefhCreERT2 knock-in mouse</a></h4>

              
                Primary afferent neurons that convey somatosensory modalities comprise two large, heterogeneous populations: small-diameter neurons that give rise to slowly conducting unmyelinated axonal C fibers and medium-to-large diameter neurons with fast myelinated A fibers. Despite these two major groupings, tools to differentiate between unmyelinated and myelinated primary afferent fibers by genetic targeting have not been available; in particular, whereas numerous mouse driver lines exist to target different C fiber populations, genetic tools that target myelinated primary afferent populations are scarce. Here we describe a knock-in mouse line expressing tamoxifen-dependent CreERT2 under control of the Nefh gene, which encodes neurofilament heavy chain (NFH or NF200), a protein that is highly enriched in myelinated fibers. This mouse enables highly selective and efficient recombination of Cre-dependent reporters for functional and anatomical interrogation of myelinated fibers while excluding unmyelinated C fibers. In combination with other recombinase-expressing mouse lines, this genetic tool will be valuable for intersectional targeting of subpopulations of myelinated primary afferent fibers.

">Intrinsic fluctuations in global connectivity reflect transitions between states of high and low prediction error</a></h4>

              
                While numerous researchers claim that the minimization of prediction error (PE) is a general force underlying most brain functions, others argue instead that PE minimization drives low-level, sensory-related neuronal computations but not high-order, abstract cognitive operations. We investigated this issue using behavioral, fMRI, and EEG data. Studies 1A/1B examined semantic- and reward-processing PE using task-fMRI, yielding converging evidence of PE's global effects on large-scale connectivity: high-PE states broadly upregulated ventral-dorsal connectivity, and low-PE states upregulated posterior-anterior connectivity. Investigating whether these global patterns characterize cognition generally, Studies 2A/2B used resting-state fMRI and showed that individuals continuously fluctuate between ventral-dorsal (high-PE) and posterior-anterior (low-PE) dynamic connectivity states. Additionally, individual differences in PE task responses track differences in resting-state fluctuations, further endorsing that these fluctuations represent PE minimization at rest. Finally, Study 3 used combined fMRI-EEG and showed that these resting-state ventral-dorsal and posterior-anterior PE networks specifically oscillate at 3-6 Hz. This whole-brain layout and timeline together speak to high/low-PE fluctuations playing a role in integrative and general sub-second cognitive operations.

">How the Heart Shapes the Mind: The Role of Cardiac Interoception in the Interaction between Autonomic Nervous Activity and Self-related Thoughts</a></h4>

              
                Our thoughts often drift away from the tasks at hand. Various factors influence this phenomenon, including changes in the external environment, individual cognitive characteristics, and fluctuations in bodily responses. This study investigated the relationship between autonomic nervous fluctuations and thought state transitions, focusing on individual differences such as cardiac interoception. First, the heartbeat counting task was conducted, and the difference between the reported and actual number of heartbeats was used as an index of interoceptive accuracy. The participants then completed an auditory attention task while their cardiac activities were monitored. During the task, thought probes were randomly presented, and participants selected their thought content from eight categories and rated aspects such as task concentration and arousal. We estimated trial-by-trial thought states in a data-driven manner and examined how the current thought state, autonomic nervous activity, and individual cardiac interoceptive accuracy influenced the thought state in the next trial. The results demonstrated a strong association between higher cardiac interoceptive accuracy and the maintenance of similar states in subsequent trials when accelerated heart rates occurred during self-related thought states. Furthermore, the participants with higher depressive tendencies and interoceptive accuracy exhibited an increased likelihood of transitioning to self-related states when experiencing decreased heart rate during task-concentrated states. These results suggest that accurately detecting heart rate changes associated with specific thought states facilitates updates in first-person conscious experience, thereby biasing the transition patterns of subsequent thought states. This study provides new insights into the cognitive and physiological mechanisms underlying the dynamics of spontaneous thought.

">Optimal Neuromuscular Performance Requires Motor Neuron Phosphagen Kinases</a></h4>

              
                Phosphagen systems are crucial for muscle bioenergetics - rapidly regenerating ATP to support the high metabolic demands of intense musculoskeletal activity. However, their roles in motor neurons that drive muscle contraction have received little attention. Here, we knocked down expression of the primary phosphagen kinase [Arginine Kinase 1; ArgK1] in Drosophila larval motor neurons and assessed the impact on presynaptic energy metabolism and neurotransmission in situ. Fluorescent metabolic probes showed a deficit in presynaptic energy metabolism and some glycolytic compensation. Glycolytic compensation was revealed through a faster elevation in lactate at high firing frequencies, and the accumulation of pyruvate subsequent to firing. Our performance assays included two tests of endurance: enforced cycles of presynaptic calcium pumping, and, separately, enforced body-wall contractions for extended periods. Neither test of endurance revealed deficits when ArgK1 was knocked down. The only performance deficits were detected at firing frequencies that approached, or exceeded, twice the firing frequencies recorded during fictive locomotion, where both electrophysiology and SynaptopHluorin imaging showed an inability to sustain neurotransmitter release. Our computational modeling of presynaptic bioenergetics indicates that the phosphagen systems contribution to motor neuron performance is likely through the removal of ADP in microdomains close to sites of ATP hydrolysis, rather than the provision of a deeper reservoir of ATP. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, as in muscle fibers, motor neurons rely on phosphagen systems during activity that imposes intense energetic demands.

">Proteomic Analysis Links Truncated Tau to Lysosome Motility, Autophagy and Endo-lysosomal Dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal tau species, which disrupt the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), a critical system for degrading intracellular macromolecules and aggregated proteins, causing toxicity and cell death. This study investigates the impact of the N-terminally truncated Tau35 protein overexpression on proteolytic pathways, including effects on autophagy and endo-lysosomal processes. Using a Tau35 mouse model and SH-SY5Y cell lines stably expressing either the Tau35 fragment or full-length tau, we employed western blotting, proteomic analysis of lysosome-enriched brain fractions, proteolysis/endocytosis assays, and live-cell imaging with the lysotracker reporter to assess protein degradation and lysosomal function. Our findings identify early pathological changes in endo-lysosomal processes, including increased endocytosis, proteolytic dysfunction and lysosomal motility abnormalities, associated with Tau35-induced toxicity. This work extends previous research by providing new insights into the mechanisms of Tau35-induced neurotoxicity, offering a foundation for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to address tauopathies.

">Lower GABA levels in the posterior cingulate are linked with poorer episodic memory in healthy older adults</a></h4>

              
                Age-related deficits in episodic memory and mnemonic discrimination are associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Stark et al., 2013). While much research has focused on hippocampal contributions to these age-related changes (Stark et al., 2019), less is known about the role of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) especially reduced inhibition in episodic memory deficit. PCC has connections to the medial temporal lobe and is linked to memory declines (Greicius et al., 2004). It is also one of the most vulnerable regions to amyloid deposition in AD (Yokoi et al., 2018). This study hypothesized and found that age-related declines in GABAergic function (brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter) within the PCC contributes to individual differences in memory performance in healthy older adults. Using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, we measured GABA levels in the PCC in 22 healthy younger and 30 older adults. We assessed episodic memory using Rey Delayed Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). We found that both raw GABA levels and episodic memory performance are lower in older adults compared to young. This reduction in GABA levels is subserved by age-related changes in tissue-composition as evidenced by no age-group differences in corrected GABA levels. More importantly, lower GABA levels (independent of tissue-correction) were associated with poorer episodic performance including delayed recall and mnemonic discrimination. This research suggests that therapeutically targeting posterior cingulate GABA levels might help slow or alleviate memory decline.

">Electrophysiological classification of CACNA1G gene variants associated with neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders</a></h4>

              
                This study highlights the complementarity of automated patch-clamp (APC) and manual patch-clamp (MPC) approaches to describe the electrophysiological properties of eighteen Cav3.1 calcium channel variants associated with various neurological conditions. Current density was measured efficiently for all variants in APC experiments, with four variants (p.V184G, p.N1200S, p.S1263A and p.D2242N) showing high current densities, compared to wild-type Cav3.1 channel, while six variants (p.M197R, p.V392M, p.F956del, p.I962N, p.I1412T, and p.G1534D) displayed low current densities, and were therefore preferentially studied using MPC. The electrophysiological properties were well conserved in APC (e.g. inactivation and deactivation kinetics, steady-state properties), with only the APC-MPC correlation for the activation kinetics being less robust. In addition, neuronal modeling, using a deep cerebellar neuron (DCN) environment, revealed that most of the variants localized in the intracellular gate (S5 and S6 segments) could increase DCN spike frequencies. This DCN firing was critically dependent on the current density and further pointed to the gain-of-function (GOF) properties of p.A961T and p.M1531V, the recurrent variants associated with Spinocerebellar Ataxia type-42 with Neurodevelopmental Deficit (SCA42ND). Action-potential (AP) clamp experiments performed using cerebellar and thalamic neuron activities further established the GOF properties of p.A961T and p.M1531V variants. Overall, this study demonstrates that APC is well-suited to high-throughput analysis of Cav3.1 channel variants, and that MPC complements APC for characterizing low-expression variants. Furthermore, in silico modeling and AP clamp experiments establish that the gain- or loss-of-function properties of the variants are determined by how the Cav3.1 channel decodes the electrophysiological context of a neuron.

">Slow scission of single synaptic vesicles by Dynamin at physiological temperature</a></h4>

              
                Compensatory endocytosis is crucial for the presynapse to maintain a functional pool of fusion-competent vesicles. Slow Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been widely regarded as the primary mechanism of retrieval but this has been challenged by competing Clathrin-independent endocytic models, most notably sub-second ultra-fast endocytosis, reported to be predominant at physiological temperature. Here, we sought to resolve the salience of the respective endocytic modes by using a purely presynaptic preparation, the Xenapse, amenable to total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). While the role of Clathrin is in dispute, Dynamin is widely acknowledged to figure as the scission protein at the invaginated vesicle neck. Hence, we labelled the endogenous Dynamin I with EGFP by CRISPR-Cas9 techniques and visualized single synaptic Dynamin-mediated scission events at very high temporal resolution. This revealed only a single slow mode of Dynamin-dependent retrieval with a half time of ~ 9 seconds at physiological temperature. Cross-correlational analysis with fluorescently labelled Clathrin confirmed these Dynamin events to be Clathrin-dependent. We thereby affirm Clathrin-mediated endocytosis as the primary mode of compensatory retrieval.

">Widely used CaMKII regulatory segment mutations cause tight actinin binding and dendritic spine enlargement in unstimulated neurons</a></h4>

              
                Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is essential for long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses that underlies learning. CaMKII responds to Ca2+ influx into postsynaptic spines by phosphorylating proteins and forming new protein interactions. The relative importance of these enzymatic and structural functions is debated. LTP induction triggers CaMKII docking to NMDA receptors, and recent evidence suggests that LTP can proceed without kinase activity after this event. Furthermore, CaMKII interaction with -actinin-2 is required for dendritic spine enlargement following LTP induction. CaMKII can auto-phosphorylate at T286, which enables autonomous activity after Ca2+/CaM dissociation. CaMKII also bears threonine at positions 305 and 306 in its regulatory segment. Experiments with CaMKII variants including a T305A/T306A (AA) double substitution have led to a model whereby T305/T306 phosphorylation by autonomously active CaMKII prevents further Ca2+/CaM activation. However, this mechanism is not compatible with some existing data including CaMKII phospho-proteomics and measurements with reporters of CaMKII conformation. Furthermore, autonomous CaMKII activity is now thought to only endure for seconds after LTP induction. In this study, we show that the AA substitution has an unintended gain-of-function property - it enables tight binding to -actinin-2 in unstimulated neurons. In situ labelling shows that the AA substitution elevates CaMKII-actinin interactions in neurons to a level only normally observed after induction of LTP. The AA CaMKII variant also elevates the proportion of enlarged spines in unstimulated neurons without altering synaptic currents. Calorimetric measurements with purified protein confirm that -actinin-2 binds tightly to the AA variant of CaMKII with no requirement for kinase activation. Using x-ray crystallography, we show that the AA substitution enables -actinin-2 to adopt a different tighter binding mode. Our findings reinforce the notion that CaMKII primarily fulfils a structural role in LTP.

">Axonal distribution of Layers IV-VI Connections in Human Visual Cortex Revealed by in-vitro extracellular injections of Biocytin.</a></h4>

              
                The organization of interlaminar axonal connections was studied in slices of adult human visual association cortex. Cortical tissue was obtained during surgical glioma treatment in three subjects. Slices were injected with the highly sensitive anterograde tracer biocytin. In some cases, tract tracing was combined with laminar recordings of electrically evoked potentials, employing current-source density analysis. This study is based on 23 injections placed at various cortical layers and analyzed in detail. The results reveal a striking columnar architecture of local axons organized in vertically oriented bundles as well as vertical columns of neuronal cells bodies. A high degree of specificity was observed in the connectional patterns of various layers. This specificity was reflected in the tendency of lateral connections to spread into different cortical layers, and in the large variations in the axonal bouton densities in different layers. More specifically. Layer IV injections resulted in a more circular projection pattern including massive projections into layer II-III. Layer V injections produced extensive intra-laminar lateral connections while layer VI injections resulted in a vertical projection leading up to layer IV and a lateral intra-laminar projection. Thus, our results reveal highly specific connectional patterns in the different cortical layers in adult human association visual cortex.

">Mitofusin 2 controls mitochondrial and synaptic dynamics of suprachiasmatic VIP neurons and related circadian rhythms including sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sustaining the strong rhythmic interactions between cellular adaptations and environmental cues has been posited as essential for preserving the physiological and behavioral alignment of an organism to the proper phase of the daily light/dark cycle. Here, we show that mitochondria and synaptic input organization of suprachiasmatic (SCN) vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons show circadian rhythmicity. Perturbed mitochondrial dynamics achieved by conditional ablation of the fusogenic protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) in VIP neurons cause disrupted circadian oscillation in mitochondria and synapses in SCN VIP neurons leading to desynchronization of entrainment to the light/dark cycle in Mfn2 deficient mice that resulted in advanced phase angle of their locomotor activity onset, alterations in core body temperature and sleep-wake amount and architecture. Our data provide direct evidence of circadian SCN clock machinery dependence on high-performance Mfn2-regulated mitochondrial dynamics in VIP neurons for maintaining the coherence in daily biological rhythms of the mammalian organism.

">Neural signatures of recollection are sensitive to memory quality and specific event features</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by electroencephalography (EEG), where recollection has been associated with changes in event-related potential (ERP) and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multi-feature paradigm previously reported in Cooper & Ritchey (2019) with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in left posterior regions, called the late positive component (LPC), was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. Analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection, and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.

">Replicating the facilitatory effects of transcranial random noise stimulation on motion processing: A registered report</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have the potential to demonstrate the causal impact of targeted brain regions on specific behaviors, and to regulate or facilitate behavior in clinical applications. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is one form of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) in which an alternating current is passed between electrodes at random frequencies. High-frequency tRNS (hf-tRNS) is thought to enhance excitability and has been reported to have facilitatory effects on behavior in healthy and clinical populations. Due to the potential application of tRNS, clear demonstrations of the efficacy and replicability of stimulation are critical. Here, we focused on replicating the facilitatory effect of hf-tRNS over the human middle temporal complex (hMT+) on contralateral motion processing, initially demonstrated by Ghin et al. (2018). In this prior study, the improvement in performance was specific to global motion processing in the visual field contralateral to stimulation. The motivation to replicate this effect was reinforced by the well-supported hypothesis that hMT+ is critical for contralateral global motion processing. However, our results indicated that hf-tRNS does not improve motion discrimination. Specifically, we were unable to replicate a contralateral global motion processing facilitation following hf-tRNS to hMT+. In our within-subject controls, we also found no difference between hf-tRNS to hMT+ on contralateral global motion processing in comparison to sham stimulation, or in comparison to hf-tRNS to the forehead. While it remains possible that our lack of replication could be due to minor changes in the protocol from the original Ghin et al., study, for hf-tRNS to become a widely applied method, the modulatory effect of hf-tRNS should be robust to slight adjustments to the procedure.

">Mechanistic Variability in Corneal Nerve Recovery Linked to Injury Type</a></h4>

              
                The cornea, a transparent tissue covering the eye, is essential for clear vision and represents the most densely innervated tissue in the body. Its extensive sensory innervation provides both sensory perception and crucial trophic support, maintaining corneal health and integrity. Disruption of corneal innervation leads to neurotrophic keratitis (NK), a pathological condition caused by ocular injury, surgical procedures, or underlying diseases. The limited understanding of NK pathophysiological mechanisms has hindered the development of innovative therapeutic approaches. In this study, we comparatively analyzed corneal innervation morphogenesis and regeneration across two clinically relevant injury models, highlighting both commonalities and differences among these contexts. Our results demonstrate that corneal nerve morphogenesis and maturation span approximately 13 weeks, from embryonic day 12 (E12) through three months of age. Additionally, we observed that the specification of distinct nerve fiber types coincided temporally with a significant enhancement in corneal sensitivity. Furthermore, we found that the type of innervation loss, either via axotomy or abrasion, differentially affected corneal sensitivity and epithelial cell homeostasis. Importantly, the regeneration mechanisms following injury were also distinctly dependent on the type of nerve damage sustained. Collectively, these findings underscore both the shared characteristics and unique aspects inherent in each NK model, highlighting the necessity for tailored therapeutic strategies specific to individual patterns of corneal innervation disruption.

However, little is known about microstructural abnormalities and cellular dyshomeostasis in acute mild traumatic brain injury in humans, particularly in the cortex. To address this gap, we designed the first architectonically motivated quantitative susceptibility mapping study to assess regional patterns of net positive (iron-related) and net negative (myelin-, calcium-, and protein-related) magnetic susceptibility across 34 cortical regions of interest following mild traumatic brain injury. Bilateral, between-group analyses sensitive to cortical depth and curvature were conducted between 25 males with acute (<span style="font-style:italic;">&lt;</span>14 d) sports-related mild traumatic brain injury and 25 age-matched male controls. Results suggest a trauma-induced increase in net positive susceptibility focal to superficial, perivascular-adjacent spaces in the parahippocampal sulcus. Decreases in net negative susceptibility values in distinct voxel populations within the same region indicate a potential dual pathology of neural substrates. These mild traumatic brain injury–related patterns were distinct from age-related processes revealed by correlation analyses. Our findings suggest depth- and curvature-specific deposition of biological substrates in cortical tissue convergent with features of misfolded proteins in trauma-related neurodegeneration.</span>

In this study, we asked participants to carry out 2 risk tasks with outcome evaluation—the monetary gambling task and mixed lottery task twice, with simultaneous recording of behavioral and electroencephalography data. Regarding risk behavior, we observed both individual-specific risk attitudes and outcome-contingent risky inclination following a loss outcome, which remained stable across sessions. In terms of event-related potential (ERP) results, low outcomes, compared to high outcomes, induced a larger feedback-related negativity, which was modulated by the magnitude of the outcome. Similarly, high outcomes evoked a larger deflection of the P300 compared to low outcomes, with P300 amplitude also being sensitive to outcome magnitude. Intraclass correlation coefficient analyses indicated that both the feedback-related negativity and P300 exhibited modest to good test–retest reliability across both tasks. Regarding choice prediction, we found that neural responses—especially those following a loss outcome—predicted subsequent risk-taking behavior at the single-trial level for both tasks.

Conversely, poor social cognition is associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases. Although brain regions that mediate understanding of the social hierarchy are poorly understood, recent evidence implicates the insula. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired in twelve individually housed male cynomolgus monkeys to determine whether structural and functional characteristics of the insular cortex predicted the social rank that monkeys would attain once they formed stable social hierarchies. Structural MRI revealed that left insular volume was significantly larger in monkeys that would become dominant vs. subordinate. No differences were observed in other areas including amygdala, caudate nucleus, or prefrontal cortex. Volumetric differences were localized to dorsal anterior regions of both left and right insulae. Functional MRI revealed that global correlation, a measure of connectedness to the rest of the brain, was significantly lower in the left insula of monkeys who would become dominant vs. subordinate. Moreover, the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, a reflection of spontaneous brain activity, trended lower in bilateral insula in the future dominant monkeys.

                Background The Elekta micro-multileaf collimator (mMLC) known as apex for planning stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)/stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT)/stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) provides excellent dose distribution; however, it offers disadvantages such as prolonged treatment duration and technical errors in terms of mMLC and gantry calibration, which adds to the total treatment duration. Hence, we aimed to compare the treatment planning performed with the 2.5mm mMLC and 5mm MLC known as Agility for brain and lung targets treated with SRS and SBRT in Elekta Versa high definition (HD). Methods The study included 10 patients, five each with brain and lung targets. Two treatment plans were performed for each case using Elekta’s Monaco (5.11.03) treatment planning system (TPS) with 2.5mm and 5mm MLC. An X-ray photon beam of energy 6FFF was used for planning purposes with various gantry, couch, and collimator combinations. These two plans were compared using target coverage (TC), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), and organ at risk (OAR) doses. Results No significant differences were found in the target coverage, CI, HI, or OAR doses in either MLC design. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with a 5 mm MLC provided equivalent tumor coverage with an additional number of monitor units. OAR doses were comparable in both MLC widths for brain targets, whereas for lung targets, OAR doses were slightly lower with 2.5mm mMLC. GI was superior in the 2.5mm mMLC compared to the 5mm MLC giving a steep falloff in the dose distributions (p = 0.158). Conclusions The TC, CI, HI, and OAR doses were similar in both 2.5mm and 5mm based VMAT plans. The gradient index was better in the 2.5mm mMLC resulting in steep dose gradients, which further reduced the isodose volumes. Therefore, a 5mm MLC (agility) can also be used for SRS/SBRT treatment planning, with a further reduction in the gradient index. However, the study must be extended further with more samples and multiple comparison parameters.

                We discuss how epidemiology has been and can continue to be used to advance understanding of the links between urban areas and health informed by an existing urban-health conceptual framework. This framework considers urban areas as contexts for health, determinants of health and modifiers of health pathways, and part of a complex system that affects health. We highlight opportunities for descriptive epidemiology to inform the context of urban health, for example, by characterizing the social and physical environments that give rise to health and the actions that change those conditions. We then describe inferential tools for evaluating the impact of group-level actions (e.g., interventions, policies) on urban health, providing some examples, and describing assumptions and challenges. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges of applying systems thinking and methods to advance urban health. While different conceptual frames lead to different insights, each perspective demonstrates that urban health is a major and growing challenge. The effectiveness of urban health knowledge, action, and policy as the world continues to urbanize can be informed by applying and expanding upon research and surveillance methods described here.

                Background Orthodox microeconomic theory establishes a positive link between employee wages and productivity in competitive markets. However, this perspective often overlooks gender and treats the workforce as a homogeneous category labelled as labor, potentially obscuring issues of gender discrimination. This article addresses the gender wage gap by analyzing, for the first time, at least in an emerging economy such as Colombia, the impact of manufacturing firm’s productivity on wages explicitly including gender. Method First, we use the GMM two-equation system proposed by Wooldridge (2009) to obtain consistent and unbiased estimates of output elasticities and TFP, respectively. Secondly, we explore wages-productivity linkage by gender, implementing a dynamic random effect generalized least squares model (GLS) with panel data to deal with endogeneity issues. Results Our main findings reveal, among others, that firms with a higher proportion of female workers (female firms) generally have higher productivity than those with a higher proportion of male workers (male firms). Conclusions The effect of female firm’s productivity on wages is lower than that of male firm’s productivity, which could indicate gender wage discrimination

                <p>The external globus pallidus (GPe) is a central part of the basal ganglia indirect pathway implicated in movement and decision-making. As a hub connecting the dorsal striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN), the GPe guides repetitive and routine behaviors. However, it remains unknown how diverse GPe cells engage in routine formation while learning action sequences in repetitive reward-seeking conditioning. Here, in male mice, we investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics of two GPe cell types, astrocytes and parvalbumin-expressing neurons, during routine formation. Our findings show that the dynamics of GPe astrocytes may be involved in action sequence refinement, a characteristic potentially contributing to more efficient reward-seeking behavior.</p>

                Background Maxillofacial prosthetic materials exhibit a range of qualities that vary considerably, including the hardness and stiffness of alloys and polymers, as well as the flexibility of elastomers and soft polymers. Silicone elastomers are the primary materials employed for maxillofacial prostheses due to their physical properties, which allow for adaptation to the movement of soft tissue. They also exhibit exceptional tensile and tear strength across a broad temperature range. Silicone elastomers can be classified according to the vulcanization process: High-temperature vulcanization (HTV) silicones, and Room temperature vulcanization (RTV) silicones. The addition of nanoparticle enhances thermal and tear strength of maxillofacial silicon. This study estimates the influence of addition tantalum oxide nanoparticle on thermal conductivity and tear strength after addition on maxillofacial silicone. Method Tantalum oxide nanoparticles were added into VST-50F platinum silicone elastomer at two weight percentages: 1wt% and 1.5wt%. 60 specimens were prepared and classified into two groups: one control group for each property and two experimental groups. All collected data underwent statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, with significance set at p < 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test and Bartlett’s test were employed to assess the normality and homogeneity of the data, respectively. Result The one-way ANOVA test found a very significant difference between all groups, while Bonferroni’s test revealed a highly significant difference between the control and experimental groups. Thermal conductivity test found no significant difference between the 1wt% and 1.5wt% groups, however the tear strength test was highly significant. Conclusions The addition tantalum oxide nano particles improve tear strength and thermal conductivity.

                Background Today’s approaches to regulating AI diverge from countries and regions. For instance, Japan’s framework emphasizes agile governance, relying on soft law, corporate cooperation, and a deregulatory approach. In contrast, the EU adopts a hard law model with a risk-based approach centered on protecting human rights. Discussing the benefits and downsides of each will be deemed valuable for LATAM’s journey to regulating AI. Methods The authors identified guidelines and laws from Japan and the European Union by searching official websites and Google Scholar through 2023 and 2024. We divided the search between both researchers, one of us in charge of the Japanese documents and the other of the EU and Latin America ones. The relevant documents were selected when containing soft laws, hard laws, and independent reports about AI. The authors then proceeded to conduct a document analysis of the current situation in the LATAM region as well as a comparison between the Japanese and EU approaches to AI. Through this process, the logic behind each approach was deduced and then evaluated for suitability for the LATAM region. Results LATAM faces unique challenges in regulating AI. Limited investment in innovation and research, along with insufficient venture capital, places the region below global averages in technological development. Overly restrictive regulations risk worsening this disparity. A Japanese approach appears more convenient for the region rather than a European one. In this realm, it is crucial to avoid a binary logic that positions technological growth and human rights protection as opposing objectives. Conclusions The study proposes five principles for future AI regulation in LATAM: fostering innovation, balancing risks, and benefits, tailoring frameworks to regional needs, avoiding restrictive measures, and incorporating both Western and Asian perspectives. Ultimately, this study underscores the importance of context-specific, balanced regulations that address LATAM’s unique challenges and opportunities in AI governance.

                Introduction Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are typically characterized by the proliferation of CD34-positive specialized fibroblasts. While these tumors are most found in the pleura, they can also present in extra-pleural sites, including the orbit, particularly in adults. Herein, we report a rare case of SFT of the eyelid in a pediatric patient and review the existing literature on similar cases. Methods A case of a 5-year-old male with a nodule on the eyelid margin is presented. The nodule was completely resected and histopathologically confirmed as SFT. A comprehensive review of the published cases of eyelid SFT was conducted. Results The case represents the second reported instance of eyelid SFT in a pediatric patient and is the youngest case documented to date. The tumor’s histopathological examination revealed characteristics consistent with SFT. The review of the literature identified only 10 cases of eyelid SFT in English literature, with just one previously reported in the pediatric population. Conclusion SFT of the eyelid is extremely rare, especially in pediatric patients. Despite its rarity, SFT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vascular spindle-cell tumors of the eyelid in this age group. Early recognition and complete resection are crucial for effective management.

                Background The human ear is unique to individuals, and ear prints, like fingerprints, are discrete enough to distinguish identical twins. Therefore, the external ear could be used to identify both living and deceased individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the stature and sexual dimorphism of the external ear using various morphometric parameters and morphological features for forensic identification. Methods This study included 40 participants (20 males and 20 females). Participants were between the age of 18-25yrs. Measurements were taken with the subject’s head in the Frankfort horizontal plane. 18 measurements were taken like ear length and width, lobule height and width, concha length and width, tragus length, morphological ear length, helical mastoid distal length, thickness of ear lobe, auricular inclination angle, antihelical take off angle, concha mastoid angle, auricular index, lobular index, concha index, ear attachment length index and conchal bowl depth on external ear were taken and the morphological features like shape of ear, ear lobe, darwin’s tubercle and ear tragus, attachment of ear lobe and form of helix of both the right and left ears were noted. A digital Vernier caliper was used to measure all parameters. The angles were measured using a goniometer. Normal distribution was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For normally distributed parameters, an independent t-test was used, and for non-normally distributed parameters, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare sexes. To compare the right and left parameters, independent t-tests (for normally distributed data) and Mann-Whitney U tests (for non-normally distributed data) were applied. Sex determination and stature estimation were performed using logistic regression analysis. Results In males and females, the most common shape was oval, and the ear lobe was free. The most common shape of the ear lobe in males was arched, while in females, it was triangular. In males and females, the most common form of the helix was the concave marginal. In males, the most common shape of the tragus was round, whereas in females, it was long. In males and females, the most common shape of Darwin’s tubercle was enlarged. It was seen that the right lobe width showed perfect separation, indicating its potential as an extremely reliable predictor. It was noted that in females, the strongest correlation with height was with the ear inclination angle on both sides. Conclusion The results of this study can help forensic anthropologists identify the sex and stature of a person from various ear measurements.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health professions education, particularly in developing and middle-income countries. Despite the implementation of alternative educational strategies to facilitate remote learning while maintaining physical distancing, challenges persist in ensuring the effectiveness. Methods This qualitative cross-sectional study explored the learning experiences of medical students at a Ghanaian institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were drawn from four departments within the medical school, using a cluster-based sampling approach. A voluntary response sampling method was employed to recruit students, who completed self-administered online surveys containing interview questions about their educational experiences during the pandemic. Results The study identified several barriers to effective online learning, including inadequate supervision, limited access to library resources, overburdened syllabi, and interference from household responsibilities. A significant majority of participants (n=133, 67%) reported that online learning was insufficient, ineffective, and financially burdensome, undermining the development of essential competencies and skills needed for clinical practice. Conclusions Notwithstanding these challenges, nearly all participants expressed the belief that a combination of face-to-face and online learning could enhance medical education. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of online learning in health professions, highlighting the need to address the ongoing challenges faced by students to ensure the effectiveness of this mode of instruction.

                Background Over 500 million people worldwide rely on sorghum as a main food crop. About 10% of the daily caloric intake of households in Ethiopia’s northwest and eastern regions, including Benishangul Gumuz, comes from sorghum. A hemi-biotrophic fungal pathogen called Colletotrichum sublineolum caused anthracnose disease is among the biotic constraints of sorghum production. Methods Ten selected sorghum genotypes were assessed for sorghum anthracnose severity and its temporal and spatial dynamics on field plots in the districts of Assosa and Bambasi. The performance of the chosen sorghum genotypes was assessed using the following metrics: AUDPC, disease progress rate, yield-related trait, sorghum grain yield, and mean severity index. Anthracnose severity was evaluated using a 1–5 disease rating scale and assessments conducted at seven consecutive time points. Results The result found that the mean anthracnose severity index ranging from 60-77 PSI and 53-82 PSI, respectively. AUDPC varied from 351 to 470 % days and 316 to 499 % days at Assosa and Bambasi districts, respectively. Bambasi district achieved a larger grain yield than the Assosa district. Assosa-1 demonstrated a significant level of disease pressure, yet the current investigation found that this genotype is the highest performing genotype in both locations. Conclusions There is a considerable positive link between the severity of anthracnose and the weekly total rainfall and relative humidity. At both trial sites, Mersa-1 continuously produced higher grain yields and reduced disease levels. Breeders might utilize the Baco Striga sorghum genotype as a check line in a breeding effort to resist anthracnose disease because it shown a high vulnerability to the disease at both locations.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Since 2009 Recovery Colleges have offered in the UK co-produced holistic recovery educative courses for ‘social recovery’ or ‘recovery’, different from ‘clinical recovery’ as cure or symptom reduction with psychiatric medication or clinical interventions. In the wake of the UK Department of Health policy ‘No Health Without Mental Health’ (2011) for mental health ‘self-management’ and recovery, the definition of ‘recovery’ expanded to include ‘becoming an expert in your own self-care’ (Perkins et al., 2012). Instrumental in advancing the ‘recovery approach’, we know little about how Recovery Colleges facilitate students’ ‘self-care’ learning. Method Co-produced rapid ethnographic research examines Recovery College students’ understandings and practices of ‘self-care’ and ‘self-management’; students’ ‘self-care’ investments, materiality, embodied feeling; and its role in preventing mental health crises and maintaining mental health and wellbeing. Nine Camden & Islington Recovery College students, the North London NHS Foundation Trust, and one clinical professional to co-deliver workshops are recruited. Study participants recruitment seeks diversity, including the Recovery College’s population demographics and under-represented communities. Data from study participants, the clinical co-facilitator, and the Chief Investigator is collected. Analysis Rapid data analysis follows guidance for reflexible thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke 2019, 2006). Data accurately transcribed, coded by topics, is clustered in themes, to inform report writing, employing study participant’s descriptive examples or cases for each identified theme. All relevant data is uploaded into NVivo. Ethics and Dissemination The Northern Ireland Research Ethical Committee (24-NI-0127 - HSC REC A) gave ethical approval to the study. The Chief Investigator is a Camden & Islington Recovery College Senior Peer Recovery Tutor and ‘Embedded Researcher’, funded by the NIHR Mental Health For All programme and an NIHR Springboard Awardee, with a PhD in Anthropology. Ethical considerations include study participants’ disclosure of harm or distress; power imbalances between the Chief Investigator and study participants; pseudonymity and data management.

Although the cerebellum is typically associated with supervised learning algorithms, it also exhibits extensive involvement in reward processing. In this study, we investigated the cerebellum’s role in executing reinforcement learning algorithms, with a particular emphasis on essential reward-prediction errors. We employed the Q-learning model to accurately reproduce the licking responses of mice in a Go/No-go auditory-discrimination task. This method enabled the calculation of reinforcement learning variables, such as reward, predicted reward, and reward-prediction errors in each learning trial. Through tensor component analysis of two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data from more than 6,000 Purkinje cells, we found that climbing fiber inputs of the two distinct components, which were specifically activated during Go and No-go cues in the learning process, showed an inverse relationship with predictive reward-prediction errors. Assuming bidirectional parallel-fiber Purkinje-cell synaptic plasticity, we constructed a cerebellar neural-network model with 5,000 spiking neurons of granule cells, Purkinje cells, cerebellar nuclei neurons, and inferior olive neurons. The network model qualitatively reproduced distinct changes in licking behaviors, climbing-fiber firing rates, and their synchronization during discrimination learning separately for Go/No-go conditions. We found that Purkinje cells in the two components could develop specific motor commands for their respective auditory cues, guided by the predictive reward-prediction errors from their climbing fiber inputs. These results indicate a possible role of context-specific actors in modular reinforcement learning, integrating with cerebellar supervised learning capabilities.

                <p>by Russell Dinnage, Marian Kleineberg</p>

Data on the three dimensional shape of organismal morphology is becoming increasingly available, and forms part of a new revolution in high-throughput phenomics that promises to help understand ecological and evolutionary processes that influence phenotypes at unprecedented scales. However, in order to meet the potential of this revolution we need new data analysis tools to deal with the complexity and heterogeneity of large-scale phenotypic data such as 3D shapes. In this study we explore the potential of generative Artificial Intelligence to help organize and extract meaning from complex 3D data. Specifically, we train a deep representational learning method known as DeepSDF on a dataset of 3D scans of the bills of 2,020 bird species. The model is designed to learn a continuous vector representation of 3D shapes, along with a ’decoder’ function, that allows the transformation from this vector space to the original 3D morphological space. We find that approach successfully learns coherent representations: particular directions in latent space are associated with discernible morphological meaning (such as elongation, flattening, etc.). More importantly, learned latent vectors have ecological meaning as shown by their ability to predict the trophic niche of the bird each bill belongs to with a high degree of accuracy. Unlike existing 3D morphometric techniques, this method has very little requirements for human supervised tasks such as landmark placement, increasing it accessibility to labs with fewer labour resources. It has fewer strong assumptions than alternative dimension reduction techniques such as PCA. Once trained, 3D morphology predictions can be made from latent vectors very computationally cheaply. The trained model has been made publicly available and can be used by the community, including for finetuning on new data, representing an early step toward developing shared, reusable AI models for analyzing organismal morphology.

Neutrophils, an essential innate immune cell type with a short lifespan, rely on continuous replenishment from bone marrow (BM) precursors. Although it is established that neutrophils are derived from the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), the molecular regulators involved in the differentiation process remain poorly understood. Here we developed a random forest-based machine-learning pipeline, NeuRGI (Neutrophil Regulatory Gene Identifier), which utilized Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PU-learning) and neural network-based <i>in silico</i> gene knockout to identify neutrophil regulators. We interrogated features including gene expression dynamics, physiological characteristics, pathological relatedness, and gene conservation for the model training. Our identified pipeline leads to identifying Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-4 (<i>MAP4K4</i>) as a novel neutrophil differentiation regulator. The loss of MAP4K4 in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors in mice induced neutropenia and impeded the differentiation of neutrophils in the bone marrow. By modulating the phosphorylation level of proteins involved in cell apoptosis, such as STAT5A, MAP4K4 delicately regulates cell apoptosis during the process of neutrophil differentiation. Our work presents a novel regulatory mechanism in neutrophil differentiation and provides a robust prediction model that can be applied to other cellular differentiation processes.

                <p>by Lilly May, Alice Dauphin, Julijana Gjorgjieva</p>

The ability to process visual stimuli rich with motion represents an essential skill for animal survival and is largely already present at the onset of vision. Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, when we merely replaced the initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with retinal waves, keeping the total training time the same, we still found that an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.

                <p>by Emma Von Hoene, Amira Roess, Hamdi Kavak, Taylor Anderson</p>

Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate the behaviors, interactions, and disease transmission between individual “agents” within their environment, enabling the investigation of the underlying processes driving disease dynamics and how these processes may be influenced by policy interventions. Despite the critical role that characteristics such as health attitudes and vaccination status play in disease outcomes, the initialization of agent populations with these variables is often oversimplified, overlooking statistical relationships between attitudes and other characteristics or lacking spatial heterogeneity. Leveraging population synthesis methods to create populations with realistic health attitudes and protective behaviors for spatial ABMs has yet to be fully explored. Therefore, this study introduces a novel application for generating synthetic populations with protective behaviors and associated attitudes using public health surveys instead of traditional individual-level survey datasets from the census. We test our approach using two different public health surveys to create two synthetic populations representing individuals aged 18 and over in Virginia, U.S., and their COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and uptake as of December 2021. Results show that integrating public health surveys into synthetic population generation processes preserves the statistical relationships between vaccine uptake and attitudes in different demographic groups while capturing spatial heterogeneity at fine scales. This approach can support disease simulations that aim to explore how real populations might respond to interventions and how these responses may lead to demographic or geographic health disparities. Our study also demonstrates the potential for initializing agents with variables relevant to public health domains that extend beyond infectious diseases, ultimately advancing data-driven ABMs for geographically targeted decision-making.

                <p>by Chaya Mushka Fridman, Kinga Keppel, Vladislav Rudenko, Jon Altuna-Alvarez, David Albesa-Jové, Eran Bosis, Dor Salomon</p>

Gram-negative bacteria employ the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to deliver toxic effectors into neighboring cells and outcompete rivals. Although many effectors have been identified, their secretion mechanism often remains unknown. Here, we describe WHIX, a domain sufficient to mediate the secretion of effectors via the T6SS. Remarkably, we find WHIX in T6SS effectors that contain a single toxic domain, as well as in effectors that contain two distinct toxic domains fused to either side of WHIX. We demonstrate that the latter, which we name double-blade effectors, require two cognate immunity proteins to antagonize their toxicity. Furthermore, we show that WHIX can be used as a chassis for T6SS-mediated secretion of multiple domains. Our findings reveal a new class of polymorphic T6SS cargo effectors with a unique secretion domain that can deploy two toxic domains in one shot, possibly reducing recipients’ ability to defend themselves.

                Background In a district of the Lambayeque province, considerable levels of political disaffection are evident, manifesting not only in the alienation from power but also in a significant gap between citizens and government institutions. Although efforts have been made to continue the participatory trend in democratic institutions, innovative proposals for social intervention in political processes and decision-making are still needed. The study aimed to propose a model of conventional participation to mitigate political disaffection in Lambayeque, Peru. Methods The research was quantitative, with a non-experimental, descriptive-propositional design. It employed a survey technique applied to a randomly selected sample of 506 citizens from a total universe of 19,342 voters. Results The results indicate that the implementation of a conventional participatory practice, tailored to the sociocultural peculiarities of the district, positively impacts the political perception of the population. The findings reveal that a large portion of the Lambayeque population has disconnected from politics in everyday life, registering a general malaise that may reflect in future elections, as interest that does not translate into action is meaningless. Conclusions General distrust in institutions, particularly the sentiment of corruption, has fostered this detachment; moreover, the results reflect a rejection of the political system. Despite many being informed about politics, the feeling of participation remains impotent.

                Background The significant challenge in adolescent and young adult therapy lies in the fact that research in this field does not provide many clinical indications. This study addresses domains contributing to the establishment and sustenance of engagement, satisfaction, and progress among adolescents and young adults in their treatment by delving into the impact of events that, from the perspective of clients, have positively influenced their therapeutic process. Methods Employing a qualitative research approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 adolescents and young adults undergoing therapy, recounting positive and constructive events during their treatment. Results A structured thematic analysis revealed six primary domains of positive events: events linked to the management of the setting, events shaping the definition of therapy goals, occurrences tied to the therapist’s active role, collaborative events between therapists and clients, and events associated with both clients’ external and internal worlds. Conclusions The findings suggest that working with adolescents shares similarities with psychotherapy involving adult clients but demands specific attention to adolescents and young adults’ families, surrounding environment, and rapidly changing needs.

                Abstract Currently, machine learning applications in marketing allow to optimize strategies, personalize experiences and improve decision making. However, there are still several research gaps, so the objective is to examine the research trends in the use of machine learning in marketing. A bibliometric analysis is proposed to assess the current scientific activity, following the parameters established by PRISMA-2020. Machine learning applications in marketing have experienced steady growth and increased attention in the academic community. Key references, such as Miklosik and Evans, and prominent journals, such as IEEE Access and Journal of Business Research, have been identified. A thematic evolution towards big data and digital marketing is observed, and thematic clusters such as “digital marketing”, “interpretation”, “prediction”, and “healthcare" stand out.

                Background Stunting still represents a major public health problem in Egypt, impacting around one-third of children under five and leading to a 2-3% drop in Gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, this study examined the trends in the prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among children aged 0-23 months, 24-59 months and 0-59 months in Egypt. Methods The study used combined data from the 2005, 2008, and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS), with a total sample of 39,857 children aged 0-59 months. A multilevel logistic regression that adjusts for sampling weights and clustering was performed to analyse the factors associated with stunting among children in Egypt. Results The prevalence of stunting was 24.8% in children aged 0-23 months, 24.3% in children aged 24-59 months, and 24.5 % in children aged 0-59 months. After controlling for potential confounders, the common factors associated with stunting in three age groups were mothers with primary education and mothers who did not have an antenatal care (ANC) visit during pregnancy. Maternal short stature (height < 155 cm) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in three age groups compared to mothers taller than 160 cm. Conclusion Addressing the causes of stunting in Egypt necessitates sectoral collaboration, including health, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, and social protection. Interventions should prioritise and be accessible to families with low socioeconomic status, focusing on improved healthcare access, parent education, and infant and young child feeding practices. A systematic nutrition monitoring framework that enables routine data collection on nutritional outcomes to monitor and improve child health is recommended.

     alt="Amyloid PET in Sporadic Early- Versus Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease: Comparison of the LEADS and ADNI Cohorts"/>
<p>Higher amyloid positivity rate and amyloid load in patients with a clinical diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (Longitudinal early-onset Alzheimer's disease study [LEADS], n = 399) than late-onset AD (Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative [ADNI], n = 450).
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) differ in many respects. Here, we address the issue of possible differences in fibrillar amyloid pathology as measured by positron emission tomography (PET), which remains unresolved due to the lack of large-scale comparative studies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three hundred ninety-nine cognitively impaired participants younger than 65 years of age from the multicenter Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) and 450 cognitively impaired participants older than 65 years from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent clinical assessment, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET and were included in this study. We compared amyloid PET outcomes (positivity rate based on visual read and quantified tracer uptake expressed as Centiloids [CLs]) between the 2 cohorts and studied their association with age, sex, <i>APOE</i> genotype, and cognition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The amyloid positivity rate was higher in LEADS (78%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 74–82) than in ADNI (71%, 95% CI = 67–75, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and APOE4 genotype increased the odds of amyloid positivity in both cohorts. Visually positive scans had higher CLs in LEADS (EOAD, mean = 95.3 ± 26.1) than in ADNI (LOAD, mean = 80.9 ± 36.8, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), predominantly in parietal cortex/precuneus, superior temporal, and frontal cortices. In amyloid-positive patients, (1) CLs were higher in female patients in both cohorts; (2) APOE4 carriership was associated with <i>lower</i> CLs in EOAD, which was not observed in LOAD; and (3) correlations between CLs and MMSE scores were significantly stronger in EOAD than in LOAD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Differences in the burden of amyloid pathology may contribute to differences in clinical and anatomic patterns in sporadic EOAD and LOAD, and have implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in each group. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="Brainwide Projections of Mouse Dopaminergic Zona Incerta Neurons"/>
<p>Cre-dependent viral tracing from medial dopaminergic ZI neurons revealed abundant fiber projections rostrocaudally throughout the brain. Interestingly, the midbrain motor regions, including the periaqueductal gray area and superior colliculus, contained the densest accumulation of fiber projections, and this fiber density was independent of the region size. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The zona incerta (ZI) supports diverse behaviors including binge feeding, sleep–wake cycles, nociception, and hunting. Diverse ZI functions can be attributed to its heterogeneous neurochemical characterization, cytoarchitecture, and efferent connections. The ZI is predominantly GABAergic, but we recently identified a subset of medial ZI GABA cells that are marked by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and produce dopamine (DA). While the role of GABA within the ZI is well studied, less is known about the functions of ZI DA cells. To identify potential roles of ZI DA cells, we further phenotyped them and mapped their efferent fiber projections. We showed that wild-type TH-immunoreactive (-ir) ZI cells did not express somatostatin or calretinin immunoreactivity. We next validated a <i>Th-cre;L10-Egfp</i> mouse line and found that medial <i>Egfp</i> ZI cells were more likely to be TH-ir. We therefore delivered a Cre-dependent virus into the medial ZI of <i>Th-cre</i> or <i>Th-cre;L10-Egfp</i> mice and selected two injection cases for full brain mapping, namely, cases with the lowest and highest colocalization between TH-ir and virally transduced, DsRed-labeled cells, to identify common target sites. Overall, DsRed-labeled fibers were distributed brainwide and were most prominent within the motor-related midbrain (MBmot), notably the periaqueductal gray area and superior colliculus. We also observed numerous DsRed-labeled fibers within the polymodal association cortex-related thalamus (DORpm), like paraventricular thalamic nucleus and nucleus of reunions, that processes external and internal sensory input. Overall, ZI DA cells displayed a similar fiber profile to ZI GABA cells and may integrate sensory input to coordinate motor output at their target sites.</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural Contributions to Extrasynaptic Glutamatergic Signaling in Olfactory Bulb Glomeruli"/>
<p>Within olfactory bulb glomeruli, glutamate released from the dendrites of external tufted cells (eTCs) can excite mitral cells (MCs) through an atypical “extrasynaptic” mechanism. Here, we used serial section electron microscopy images of rat bulb glomeruli with biocytin-labeled MC and eTC dendrites to evaluate the potential ultrastructural underpinnings. Two features of the environment around eTC dendrodendritic synapses that could support extrasynaptic signaling included an unusually short distance to nearby excitatory dendrites as well as an absence of nearby astroglial processes.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Olfactory bulb glomeruli have a complex organization that includes axodendritic synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and excitatory mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs), as well as dendrodendritic synapses between MCs/TCs and GABAergic periglomerular cells (PGCs). MCs also receive excitatory signals from one subclass of TCs, the external tufted cells (eTCs). While these signals are driven by glutamate released from eTC dendrites, they appear not to reflect direct eTC &gt; MC synaptic connections but rather “spill-over” of glutamate released at eTC &gt; PGC synapses acting on nearby MC dendrites. Here, we used serial section electron microscopy images of rat olfactory bulb glomeruli with biocytin-labeled MC and eTC dendrites to evaluate potential ultrastructural underpinnings of “extrasynaptic” signaling. We compared the environment around eTC &gt; PGC synapses with that of MC &gt; PGC synapses using several quantitative measures and, as a further point of comparison, also evaluated axodendritic OSN &gt; MC and OSN &gt; eTC synapses. Across the four synapse types, one unique feature of eTC &gt; PGC synapses was their much closer distance to the nearest dendrites of excitatory cells (including MCs), averaging ∼160 nm. In contrast, astroglial processes were positioned quite far away from eTC &gt; PGC synapses, with a mean distance of ∼500 nm. These distance values would suggest that glutamate released from eTC &gt; PGC synapses may access nearby excitatory dendrites without interference from glial glutamate transporters, thus providing an ultrastructural basis for extrasynaptic signaling. Our battery of ultrastructural measures, which included brick analyses, also supported a long-standing model for the organization of glomeruli in which OSN and dendrodendritic synapses are segregated into discrete compartments.</p>

                Forster, Jakob, et al. perform transcriptional profiling of gut-innervating neurons during intestinal inflammation characterized by a different cytokine milieu. The data reveal a conserved neuronal response to inflammation, including activation of the interferon and ferroptosis pathways.

                Dimakou et al.’s review examines how spontaneous brain activity across species from C. elegans to humans encodes behaviorally relevant sensory, motor, metabolic, and interoceptive states. They hypothesize that these states reflect priors of generative predictive models supporting adaptive behavior.
