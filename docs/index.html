     alt="Theropod dinosaurs had primate-like numbers of telencephalic neurons"/><p>Theropod dinosaurs had the brain × body mass relationship of the earliest birds, which implies that the same neuronal scaling rules applied to their brains, making theropod numbers of telencephalic neurons comparable to modern primates—and <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> comparable to a baboon in cognitive capacity and longevity. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the neuronal composition of the brains of dinosaurs and other fossil amniotes would offer fundamental insight into their behavioral and cognitive capabilities, but brain tissue is only rarely fossilized. However, when the bony brain case is preserved, the volume and therefore mass of the brain can be estimated with computer tomography; and if the scaling relationship between brain mass and numbers of neurons for the clade is known, that relationship can be applied to estimate the neuronal composition of the brain. Using a recently published database of numbers of neurons in the telencephalon of extant sauropsids (birds, squamates, and testudines), here I show that the neuronal scaling rules that apply to these animals can be used to infer the numbers of neurons that composed the telencephalon of dinosaur, pterosaur, and other fossil sauropsid species. The key to inferring numbers of telencephalic neurons in these species is first using the relationship between their estimated brain and body mass to determine whether bird-like (endothermic) or squamate-like (ectothermic) rules apply to each fossil sauropsid species. This procedure shows that the notion of “mesothermy” in dinosaurs is an artifact due to the mixing of animals with bird-like and squamate-like scaling, and indicates that theropods such as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and <i>Allosaurus</i> were endotherms with baboon- and monkey-like numbers of telencephalic neurons, respectively, which would make these animals not only giant but also long-lived and endowed with flexible cognition, and thus even more magnificent predators than previously thought.</p>

                Background: We live in a time where traditional education has rapidly incorporated online modalities due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) safety measures such as social distancing. Regardless of these challenges, health education constantly strives to implement the best technologies available for an effective student deep learning outcome. Virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in the dental pre-clinical stage may help stimulate students to better understand the foundation material prescribed in the curriculum. Most visual material available for students is still mainly based on 2D graphics. Thus, this study will attempt to evaluate the students' perceptions about implementing VR/AR technologies in the learning setting. Methods: A single-group pretest-posttest design will be implemented where students will be exposed to VR/AR and fill out two questionnaires, one before and one after the exposure. Conclusions: This project is intended to start once the institutional ethical approval is obtained. It is expected that the analysis from the current project will provide recommendations to improve the students' academic curriculum pre-clinical experience. The recommendations will be provided in the form of at least three scientific publications, with one publication for each subject area intended to be evaluated (i.e., head and neck anatomy, dental anatomy, and removable prosthodontics).

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Injuries to peripheral nerves are frequent, yet no drug therapies are available for effective nerve repair. The slow growth rate of axons and inadequate access to growth factors challenge natural repair of nerves. A better understanding of the molecules that can promote the rate of axon growth may reveal therapeutic opportunities. Molecular profiling of injured neurons at early intervals of injury, when regeneration is at the maximum, has been the gold standard for exploring growth promoters. A complementary <I>in vitro</I> regenerative priming model was recently shown to induce enhanced outgrowth in adult sensory neurons. In this work, we exploited the <I>in vitro</I> priming model to reveal novel candidates for adult nerve regeneration. We performed a whole-tissue proteomics analysis of the <I>in vitro</I> primed dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from adult SD rats and compared their molecular profile with that of the <I>in vivo</I> primed, and control DRGs. The proteomics data generated are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD031927. From the follow-up analysis, Bioinformatics interventions, and literature curation, we identified several molecules that were differentially expressed in the primed DRGs with a potential to modulate adult nerve regrowth. We then validated the growth promoting roles of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), one of the hits we identified, in adult rat sensory neurons. Overall, in this study, we explored two growth priming paradigm and shortlisted several candidates, and validated MANF, as potential targets for adult nerve regeneration. We also demonstrate that the <I>in vitro</I> priming model is a valid tool for adult nerve regeneration studies.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Long-term memory formation requires anterograde transport of proteins from the soma of a neuron to its distal synaptic terminals. This allows new synaptic connections to be grown and existing ones remodeled. However, we do not yet know which proteins are transported to synapses in response to activity and temporal regulation. Here, using quantitative mass spectrometry, we have profiled anterograde protein cargos of a learning-regulated molecular motor protein kinesin [<I>Aplysia</I> kinesin heavy chain 1 (ApKHC1)] following short-term sensitization (STS) and long-term sensitization (LTS) in <I>Aplysia californica</I>. Our results reveal enrichment of specific proteins associated with ApKHC1 following both STS and LTS, as well as temporal changes within 1 and 3 h of LTS training. A significant number of proteins enriched in the ApKHC1 complex participate in synaptic function, and, while some are ubiquitously enriched across training conditions, a few are enriched in response to specific training. For instance, factors aiding new synapse formation, such as synaptotagmin-1, dynamin-1, and calmodulin, are differentially enriched in anterograde complexes 1 h after LTS but are depleted 3 h after LTS. Proteins including gelsolin-like protein 2 and sec23A/sec24A, which function in actin filament stabilization and vesicle transport, respectively, are enriched in cargos 3 h after LTS. These results establish that the composition of anterograde transport complexes undergo experience-dependent specific changes and illuminate dynamic changes in the communication between soma and synapse during learning.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability to interrogate specific representations in the brain, determining how, and where, difference sources of information are instantiated can provide invaluable insight into neural functioning. Pattern component modeling (PCM) is a recent analytic technique for human neuroimaging that allows the decomposition of representational patterns in brain into contributing subcomponents. In the current study, we present a novel PCM variant that tracks the contribution of prespecified representational patterns to brain representation across areas, thus allowing hypothesis-guided employment of the technique. We apply this technique to investigate the contributions of hedonic and nonhedonic information to the neural representation of tactile experience. We applied aversive pressure (AP) and appetitive brush (AB) to stimulate distinct peripheral nerve pathways for tactile information (C-/CT-fibers, respectively) while patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We performed representational similarity analyses (RSAs) with pattern component modeling to dissociate how discriminatory versus hedonic tactile information contributes to population code representations in the human brain. Results demonstrated that information about appetitive and aversive tactile sensation is represented separately from nonhedonic tactile information across cortical structures. This also demonstrates the potential of new hypothesis-guided PCM variants to help delineate how information is instantiated in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-1145/v2?src=rss">Nutrient dynamics in water and soil under conventional rice cultivation in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The evaluation of nutrient variability plays a crucial role in accessing soil potentials and practical intervention responses in rice production systems. Synthetic fertilizer applications and cultivation practices are considered key factors affecting nutrient dynamics and availability. Here, we assessed the nutrient dynamics in surface, subsurface water and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Methods We implemented a field experiment (200 m  2) in the 2018 wet season and the 2019 dry season in a triple rice-cropping field. Surface water, subsurface water (30–45 cm), and topsoil (0–20 cm) were collected eight samples during the rice-growing seasons to clarify its nutrient dynamic. Results The results showed that N-NH  4 +, P-PO  4 3- and total P peaks were achieved after fertilizing. Irrespective of seasons, the nutrient content in surface water was always greater than that of subsurface water ( P<0.001), with the exception of N-NO  3 -, no significant difference was disclosed ( P>0.05). When comparing the wet and dry seasons, nutrient concentrations exhibited minor differences ( P>0.05). Under conventional rice cultivation, the effects of synthetic fertilizer topdressing on the total N, soil organic matter (SOM), and total P were negligible in the soil. Higher rates of N fertilizer application did not significantly increase soil N-NH  4 +, total N, yet larger P fertilizer amounts substantially enhanced soil total P ( P<0.001). Conclusions Under conventional rice cultivation, the low concentration of N-NH  4 +, P-PO  4 3- and total P in the subsurface water indicated that nutrient losses mainly occur through runoff rather than leaching. Notably, nutrient content in soil was fairly high, whilst SOM was varied from low to medium between seasons. Future work should consider the nutrient balance and nutrient dynamic simulation on surface and subsurface.

                Aims and objectives: Purpose of this study is to detect the presence of SAR-CoV-2 viral RNA in conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients and to compare the RT-PCR positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab. Materials and method: Eighty hospitalised COVID-19 patients whose nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were included in the study. Conjunctival swab was collected from eyes of these patients and sent for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR method. Results: Among the eighty patients, 51 (63.7%) were males and 29 (36.3%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 55.93 ± 16.59. Six patients had ocular manifestations. Eleven (13.75%) patients tested positive on conjunctival swab for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and only one of them had ocular manifestations out of the eleven. Conclusion: In our study the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients was detected and this was not dependent on presence of ocular manifestations or duration of disease. Though the conjunctival positivity is lower compared to the nasopharyngeal swab sampling, ocular surface and secretions can be a potential route of viral transmission.

Methods:  Data was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry 17 were available to assess trends of pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality from 2000 to 2019. Results:  The pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates consistently increased over time from 2000 to 2019. Incidence of pancreatic cancer was highest in males (14; 95% Cl, 13.9,14.1) and blacks (15.4 95% Cl,15.2, 15.6). The incidence was highest in Alaska (16.2; 95% Cl, 14.1, 18.5), and lowest in Utah (10.7; 95% Cl, 10.4, 11.0). Incidence increased at 0.85% per year (95% Cl, 0.76, 0.92; P < .001). Overall incidence increased significantly for all sex, race, stage sub-groups except for Blacks (APC of 0.04%; 95% Cl, -0.14, 0.22; P = 0.649), and American Indian/Alaska natives (APC of -0.22 %; 95% Cl, -1.33, 0.89; P= 0.679). There was an overall significant increase in incidence across all states except for Alaska. Incidence-based mortality of pancreatic cancer was highest in males (12.6; 95% Cl, 12.5,12.7) and blacks (14.1; 95% Cl, 13.9, 14.3). Mortality was highest in Alaska (15.1; 95% Cl, 13.1,17.3), and lowest in Utah (9.6; 95% Cl, 9.3,9.9). Mortality increased at 0.91% per year (95% Cl, 0.32, 1.50; P = .005). The overall incidence-based mortality increased significantly only in the males APC, 0.95% (95% Cl, 0.36, 1.54; P = 0.003), females APC 1.18 (95% Cl, 0.47, 1.89; P = 0.002) and whites APC 1.05% (95% Cl, 0.45, 1.66; P = 0.002). Furthermore, there was an overall significant increase in incidence-based mortality across all states except for Alaska, Hawaii and Washington. Conclusion: Pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates increased overall but differed by demographics and geographic location.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-14/v1?src=rss">Artificial intelligence based glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy detection using MATLAB — retrained AlexNet convolutional neural network [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes of blindness due to an irreversible damage to the retina which results in vision loss. Early detection of these diseases through regular screening is especially important to prevent progression. The image of retinal fundus is the main evaluating strategy for the glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy detection. Then, automated eye disease detection is an important application of retinal image analysis. Compared with classical diagnostic techniques, image classification by convolutional neural networks (CNN) have the potential for better cost-effective performance. Methods: In this paper, we propose the use of MATLAB – retrained AlexNet CNN for computerized eye diseases identification, particularly glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, by employing retinal fundus images. The acquisition of the database was carried out through free access databases and access upon request. A transfer learning technique is used for retraining the AlexNet CNN. Specifically, the model divides the fundus image dataset into training and testing data. Results: As datasets were added by network training, different values were reported for validation accuracy, false positives and false negatives, precision, and recall. Thus, having NetTransfer I with a validation accuracy value of 94.3% for two classes. NetTransfer II with a validation accuracy value of 91.8% for two classes. NetTransfer III with a validation accuracy value of 89.7% for three classes. Net transfer IV with a validation accuracy value of 93.1% for three classes. Finally, NetTransfer V with a validation accuracy value of 92.1% for three classes. Conclusions: Re-training of the AlexNet network proved to be a powerful tool to create disease detection systems having high accuracy values and being able to discern between more than two diseases.

                Background: Genetic mutations cause 50-75% of congenital deafness. Congenital deafness is a disease divided into syndromic and non-syndromic types. Type B special schools facilitate children with deafness in Surabaya. This study aimed to identify a mutation gene that causes non-syndromic hearing impairment in school students. Methods: This research was an analytic observational study using a cross-sectional method applying simple random sampling of non-syndromic deaf children. The applied tests were pure tone audiometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and hybridization tests. Subjects were evaluated on the pedigree route and then analyzed. Results: A total of 138 participants with non-syndromic hearing loss were enrolled in this study and 49 patients met the inclusion criteria. The subject’s average age was 16.16 years, with more male subjects than female.  The hybridization results obtained six genetic mutations, one subject with mtDNA 1555, one subject with GJB2-299, two subjects with SLC26A4-IVS(7)2, and 3 subjects with unknown mutations. In pedigree analysis, the same genetic mutation was found in two generations of subjects with mtDNA 1555 and GJB2-299 mutations, and mutations of more than one genetic type were found in two generations of subjects with the SLC26A4-IVS(7)2 mutation. Conclusions: This study obtained six genetic mutations in non-syndromic congenital deaf children. Non-syndromic congenital deafness in Indonesia was found to have genetic mutations as a health risk. The risk was heredity with diverse inheritance patterns.

                Background: As the most abundant coffee by-product, cascara pulp has been considered a good source of antioxidants which could be used to prevent photoaging. The aim of this study was to determine the phytometabolite profiles, antioxidant and photoaging properties of the ethanolic extract of Coffea arabica cascara pulp. Methods: Ethanolic maceration was performed on the fine powder of C. arabica cascara pulp collected from Gayo Highland, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The filtrate obtained was evaluated for its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), and total flavonoid content (TFC). The phytometabolite profiling was conducted qualitatively using reagents and quantitatively using gas chromatography—mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The potential of the cascara pulp phytometabolites in inhibiting activator protein-1 (AP-1) was evaluated through molecular docking. Results: The extract had TPC and TFC of 2.04 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract and 91.81 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract, respectively. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the DPPH inhibition reached as low as 9.59 mg/L. Qualitative phytocompound screening revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, steroids, quinones, polyphenols, and triterpenoids. GC-MS revealed the extract containing 5-hydroxy-methylfurfural (22.31%); 2,5 dimethyl 4 hidroxy 3(2H) furanone (0.74%); and caffeine (21.07%), which could form interaction with AP-1 with binding energies of -172.8, -150.8, and -63.188 kJ/mol, respectively. Conclusion: Ethanolic extract from C. arabica cascara pulp potentially have anti-photoaging properties which is worthy for further investigations in the future.

                <p>by Davide Chicco, Rakesh Shiradkar</p>

Medical imaging is a great asset for modern medicine, since it allows physicians to spatially interrogate a disease site, resulting in precise intervention for diagnosis and treatment, and to observe particular aspect of patients’ conditions that otherwise would not be noticeable. Computational analysis of medical images, moreover, can allow the discovery of disease patterns and correlations among cohorts of patients with the same disease, thus suggesting common causes or providing useful information for better therapies and cures. Machine learning and deep learning applied to medical images, in particular, have produced new, unprecedented results that can pave the way to advanced frontiers of medical discoveries. While computational analysis of medical images has become easier, however, the possibility to make mistakes or generate inflated or misleading results has become easier, too, hindering reproducibility and deployment. In this article, we provide ten quick tips to perform computational analysis of medical images avoiding common mistakes and pitfalls that we noticed in multiple studies in the past. We believe our ten guidelines, if taken into practice, can help the computational–medical imaging community to perform better scientific research that eventually can have a positive impact on the lives of patients worldwide.

Open, reproducible, and replicable research practices are a fundamental part of science. Training is often organized on a grassroots level, offered by early career researchers, for early career researchers. Buffet style courses that cover many topics can inspire participants to try new things; however, they can also be overwhelming. Participants who want to implement new practices may not know where to start once they return to their research team. We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process.

Knowledge of the cell-type-specific composition of the brain is useful in order to understand the role of each cell type as part of the network. Here, we estimated the composition of the whole cortex in terms of well characterized morphological and electrophysiological inhibitory neuron types (me-types). We derived probabilistic me-type densities from an existing atlas of molecularly defined cell-type densities in the mouse cortex. We used a well-established me-type classification from rat somatosensory cortex to populate the cortex. These me-types were well characterized morphologically and electrophysiologically but they lacked molecular marker identity labels. To extrapolate this missing information, we employed an additional dataset from the Allen Institute for Brain Science containing molecular identity as well as morphological and electrophysiological data for mouse cortical neurons. We first built a latent space based on a number of comparable morphological and electrical features common to both data sources. We then identified 19 morpho-electrical clusters that merged neurons from both datasets while being molecularly homogeneous. The resulting clusters best mirror the molecular identity classification solely using available morpho-electrical features. Finally, we stochastically assigned a molecular identity to a me-type neuron based on the latent space cluster it was assigned to. The resulting mapping was used to derive inhibitory me-types densities in the cortex.

                <p>by Christina M. Kelliher, Elizabeth-Lauren Stevenson, Jennifer J. Loros, Jay C. Dunlap</p>

Compensation is a defining principle of a true circadian clock, where its approximately 24-hour period length is relatively unchanged across environmental conditions. Known compensation effectors directly regulate core clock factors to buffer the oscillator’s period length from variables in the environment. Temperature Compensation mechanisms have been experimentally addressed across circadian model systems, but much less is known about the related process of Nutritional Compensation, where circadian period length is maintained across physiologically relevant nutrient levels. Using the filamentous fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, we performed a genetic screen under glucose and amino acid starvation conditions to identify new regulators of Nutritional Compensation. Our screen uncovered 16 novel mutants, and together with 4 mutants characterized in prior work, a model emerges where Nutritional Compensation of the fungal clock is achieved at the levels of transcription, chromatin regulation, and mRNA stability. However, eukaryotic circadian Nutritional Compensation is completely unstudied outside of <i>Neurospora</i>. To test for conservation in cultured human cells, we selected top hits from our fungal genetic screen, performed siRNA knockdown experiments of the mammalian orthologs, and characterized the cell lines with respect to compensation. We find that the wild-type mammalian clock is also compensated across a large range of external glucose concentrations, as observed in <i>Neurospora</i>, and that knocking down the mammalian orthologs of the <i>Neurospora</i> compensation-associated genes <i>CPSF6</i> or <i>SETD2</i> in human cells also results in nutrient-dependent period length changes. We conclude that, like Temperature Compensation, Nutritional Compensation is a conserved circadian process in fungal and mammalian clocks and that it may share common molecular determinants.

Accumulating observations suggest that peripheral somatosensory ganglia may regulate nociceptive transmission, yet direct evidence is sparse. Here, in experiments on rats and mice, we show that the peripheral afferent nociceptive information in mice undergoes dynamic filtering within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and suggest that this filtering occurs at the axonal bifurcations (t-junctions). Using synchronous in vivo electrophysiological recordings from the peripheral and central processes of sensory neurons (in the spinal nerve and dorsal root), ganglionic transplantation of GABAergic progenitor cells, and optogenetics, we demonstrate existence of tonic and dynamic filtering of action potentials traveling through the DRG. Filtering induced by focal application of GABA or optogenetic GABA release from the DRG-transplanted GABAergic progenitor cells was specific to nociceptive fibers. Light-sheet imaging and computer modeling demonstrated that, compared to other somatosensory fiber types, nociceptors have shorter stem axons, making somatic control over t-junctional filtering more efficient. Optogenetically induced GABA release within DRG from the transplanted GABAergic cells enhanced filtering and alleviated hypersensitivity to noxious stimulation produced by chronic inflammation and neuropathic injury in vivo. These findings support “gating” of pain information by DRGs and suggest new therapeutic approaches for pain relief.

RNA processing and degradation shape the transcriptome by generating stable molecules that are necessary for translation (rRNA and tRNA) and by facilitating the turnover of mRNA, which is necessary for the posttranscriptional control of gene expression. In bacteria and the plant chloroplast, RNA degradosomes are multienzyme complexes that process and degrade RNA. In many bacterial species, the endoribonuclease RNase E is the central component of the RNA degradosome. RNase E-based RNA degradosomes are inner membrane proteins in a large family of gram-negative bacteria (β- and γ-Proteobacteria). Until now, the reason for membrane localization was not understood. Here, we show that a mutant strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, in which the RNA degradosome is localized to the interior of the cell, has high levels of 20S and 40S particles that are defective intermediates in ribosome assembly. These particles have aberrant protein composition and contain rRNA precursors that have been cleaved by RNase E. After RNase E cleavage, rRNA fragments are degraded to nucleotides by exoribonucleases. In vitro, rRNA in intact ribosomes is resistant to RNase E cleavage, whereas protein-free rRNA is readily degraded. We conclude that RNA degradosomes in the nucleoid of the mutant strain interfere with cotranscriptional ribosome assembly. We propose that membrane-attached RNA degradosomes in wild-type cells control the quality of ribosome assembly after intermediates are released from the nucleoid. That is, the compact structure of mature ribosomes protects rRNA against cleavage by RNase E. Turnover of a proportion of intermediates in ribosome assembly explains slow growth of the mutant strain. Competition between mRNA and rRNA degradation could be the cause of slower mRNA degradation in the mutant strain. We conclude that attachment of the RNA degradosome to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane prevents wasteful degradation of rRNA precursors, thus explaining the reason for conservation of membrane-attached RNA degradosomes throughout the β- and γ-Proteobacteria.

                <p>by Mirko Singer, Kathrin Simon, Ignasi Forné, Markus Meissner</p>

Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites. While most species are restricted to specific hosts and cell types, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> can invade every nucleated cell derived from warm-blooded animals. This broad host range suggests that this parasite can recognize multiple host cell ligands or structures, leading to the activation of a central protein complex, which should be conserved in all apicomplexans. During invasion, the unique secretory organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) are sequentially released and several micronemal proteins have been suggested to be required for host cell recognition and invasion. However, to date, only few micronemal proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for invasion, suggesting functional redundancy that might allow such a broad host range. Cysteine Repeat Modular Proteins (CRMPs) are a family of apicomplexan-specific proteins. In <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>, two CRMPs are present in the genome, CRMPA (TGGT1_261080) and CRMPB (TGGT1_292020). Here, we demonstrate that both proteins form a complex that contains the additional proteins MIC15 and the thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing protein (TSP1). Disruption of this complex results in a block of rhoptry secretion and parasites being unable to invade the host cell. In conclusion, this complex is a central invasion complex conserved in all apicomplexans.

                <p>by Tomoya Nakai, Cléa Girard, Léa Longo, Hanna Chesnokova, Jérôme Prado</p>

Number symbols, such as Arabic numerals, are cultural inventions that have transformed human mathematical skills. Although their acquisition is at the core of early elementary education in children, it remains unknown how the neural representations of numerals emerge during that period. It is also unclear whether these relate to an ontogenetically earlier sense of approximate quantity. Here, we used multivariate fMRI adaptation coupled with within- and between-format machine learning to probe the cortical representations of Arabic numerals and approximate nonsymbolic quantity in 89 children either at the beginning (age 5) or four years into formal education (age 8). Although the cortical representations of both numerals and nonsymbolic quantities expanded from age 5 to age 8, these representations also segregated with learning and development. Specifically, a format-independent neural representation of quantity was found in the right parietal cortex, but only for 5-year-olds. These results are consistent with the so-called symbolic estrangement hypothesis, which argues that the relation between symbolic and nonsymbolic quantity weakens with exposure to formal mathematics in children.

Use of rigorous study design methods and transparent reporting in publications are 2 key strategies proposed to improve the reproducibility of preclinical research. Despite promotion of these practices by funders and journals, assessments suggest uptake is low in preclinical research. Thirty preclinical scientists were interviewed to better understand barriers and enablers to rigorous design and reporting. The interview guide was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, which is a framework used to understand determinants of current and desired behavior. Four global themes were identified; 2 reflecting enablers and 2 reflecting barriers. We found that basic scientists are highly motivated to apply the methods of rigorous design and reporting and perceive a number of benefits to their adoption (e.g., improved quality and reliability). However, there was varied awareness of the guidelines and in implementation of these practices. Researchers also noted that these guidelines can result in disadvantages, such as increased sample sizes, expenses, time, and can require several personnel to operationalize. Most researchers expressed additional resources such as personnel and education/training would better enable the application of some methods. Using existing guidance (Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW); Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) project implementation strategies), we mapped and coded our interview findings to identify potential interventions, policies, and implementation strategies to improve routine use of the guidelines by preclinical scientists. These findings will help inform specific strategies that may guide the development of programs and resources to improve experimental design and transparent reporting in preclinical research.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study aimed to assess the possible association between cognitive impairment and two important biochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress, thiol-disulfide homeostasis (TDH), and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study included 85 patients with MS (38 treatment-naïve relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 31 RRMS on fingolimod therapy, and 16 secondary progressive MS (SPMS)) and 33 healthy controls. Cognitive evaluation was carried out by applying the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) test battery and the scores were adjusted for age and years of education. Plasma TDH was assessed using an automated method and plasma IMA levels were determined using the cobalt-albumin binding assay. Plasma native thiol and total thiol levels were significantly decreased in patients with SPMS when compared with the naïve patients and healthy controls. Cognitive impairment was detected in 47.4% of naïve patients, 64.5% of patients on fingolimod therapy, and 80% of patients with SPMS. Naïve patients or patients on fingolimod therapy who were cognitively impaired had significantly decreased levels of native thiol and total thiol compared to the cognitively normal patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed total thiol and native thiol to be significantly associated with cognitive impairment in naïve patients and patients on fingolimod therapy. Significant correlations were determined between BICAMS scores, TDH, IMA, clinical indices of disease severity (EDSS and MSSS), and magnetic resonance imaging parameters. This study has shown for the first time that plasma TDH parameters are associated with cognitive impairment in MS.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Several non-verbal cognitive and behavioral tests have been developed to assess learning deficits in humans with Down syndrome (DS). Here we used rodent touchscreen paradigms in adult male mice to investigate visual discrimination (VD) learning and inhibitory control in the Dp(16)1/Yey (C57BL/6J genetic background), Ts65Dn (mixed B6 X C3H genetic background) and Ts1Cje (C57BL/6J genetic background) mouse models of DS. Dp(16)1/Yey and Ts1Cje models did not exhibit motivation or learning deficits during early pre-training, however, Ts1Cje mice showed a significant learning delay after the introduction of the incorrect stimulus (late pre-training), suggesting prefrontal cortex defects in this model. Dp(16)1/Yey and Ts1Cje mice display learning deficits in VD but these deficits were more pronounced in the Dp(16)1/Yey model. Both models also exhibited compulsive behavior and abnormal cortical inhibitory control during Extinction compared to WT littermates. Finally, Ts65Dn mice outperformed WT littermates in pre-training stages by initiating a significantly higher number of trials due to their hyperactive behavior. Both Ts65Dn and WT littermates showed poor performance during late pre-training and were not tested in VD. These studies demonstrate significant learning deficits and compulsive behavior in the Ts1Cje and Dp(16)1/Yey mouse models of DS. They also demonstrate that the mouse genetic background (C57BL/6J vs. mixed B6 X C3H) and the absence of hyperactive behavior are key determinants of successful learning in touchscreen behavioral testing. These data will be used to select the mouse model that best mimics cognitive deficits in humans with DS and evaluate the effects of future therapeutic interventions.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Monkeypox virus (MPXV) disease has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, creating an urgent need for neurologists to be able to recognize, diagnosis, and treat MPXV-associated neurologic disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Three cases of MPXV-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease occurring during the 2022 outbreak and their associated imaging findings are presented, with two cases previously published in a limited capacity in a public health bulletin.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three previously healthy immunocompetent gay men in their 30s developed a febrile illness followed by progressive neurologic symptoms with presence of a vesiculopustular rash. MPXV nucleic acid was detected by PCR from skin lesions of two patients with the third patient having indeterminate testing but an epidemiologic link to a confirmed MPXV disease case. Cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and negative MPXV specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In two patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine demonstrated partially enhancing, longitudinally extensive central spinal cord lesions with multifocal subcortical, basal ganglia, thalamic, cerebellar, and/or brainstem lesions. The third patient had thalamic and basal ganglia lesions. All patients received 14 days of tecovirimat, and two patients also received multiple forms of immunotherapy, including intravenous immunoglobulin, pulsed high dose steroids, plasmapheresis, and/or rituximab. Good neurologic recovery was observed in all cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MPXV can be associated with CNS disease. It is unclear whether this is from a parainfectious immune-mediated injury or direct CNS viral invasion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26585?af=R">Ultrastructural Axon–Myelin Unit Alterations in Multiple Sclerosis Correlate with Inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) may contribute to disease progression. Here, we systematically quantified ultrastructural and subcellular characteristics of the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM and determined how this correlates with low-grade inflammation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human brain tissue obtained with short postmortem delay and fixation at autopsy enables systematic quantification of ultrastructural characteristics. In this study, we performed high-resolution immunohis tochemistry and quantitative transmission electron microscopy to study inflammation and ultrastructural characteristics of the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM (n = 8) and control white matter (WM) in the optic nerve.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the MS NAWM, there were more activated and phagocytic microglia cells (HLA<sup>+</sup>P2RY12<sup>−</sup> and Iba1<sup>+</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup>) and more T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>) compared to control WM, mainly located in the perivascular space. In MS NAWM compared to control WM, there were, as expected, longer paranodes and juxtaparanodes and larger overlap between paranodes and juxtaparanodes. There was less compact myelin wrapping, a lower g-ratio, and a higher frequency of axonal mitochondria. Changes in myelin and axonal mitochondrial frequency correlated positively with the number of active and phagocytic microglia and lymphocytes in the optic nerve.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data suggest that in MS NAWM myelin detachment and uncompact myelin wrapping occurs, potassium channels are unmasked at the nodes of Ranvier, and axonal energy demand is increased, or mitochondrial transport is stagnated, accompanied by increased presence of activated and phagocytic microglia and T cells. These subclinical alterations to the axon–myelin unit in MS NAWM may contribute to disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>

                Leprince et al. disentangle the respective contributions of the entorhinal and thalamic inputs to the coordination of local CA1 dynamics at the end of the first postnatal week in mice. Both inputs can significantly modulate the ex vivo and in vivo early CA1 dynamics but through different integration pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85246">Dalpiciclib partially abrogates ER signaling activation induced by pyrotinib in HER2+HR+ breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidences from clinical trials (NCT04486911) revealed that the combination of pyrotinib, letrozole and dalpiciclib exerted optimistic therapeutic effect in treating HER2<sup>+</sup>HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, however, the underlying molecular mechanism remained elusive. Through the drug sensitivity test, the drug combination efficacy of pyrotinib, tamoxifen and dalpiciclib to BT474 cells were tested. The underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated using immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining and cell cycle analysis. Potential risk factor which may indicate the responsiveness to drug treatment in HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer was identified using RNA-sequence and evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and in vivo drug susceptibility test. We found that pyrotinib combined with dalpiciclib exerted better cytotoxic efficacy than pyrotinib combined with tamoxifen in BT474 cells. Degradation of HER2 could enhance ER nuclear transportation, activating ER signaling pathway in BT474 cells whereas dalpiciclib could partially abrogate this process. This may be the underlying mechanism by which combination of pyrotinib, tamoxifen and dalpiciclib exerted best cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, CALML5 was revealed to be a risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer and the usage of dalpiciclib might overcome the drug resistance to pyrotinib + tamoxifen due to CALML5 expression. Our study provided evidence that the usage of dalpiciclib in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer could partially abrogate the estrogen signaling pathway activation caused by anti-HER2 therapy and revealed that CALML5 could serve as a risk factor in the treatment of HER2<sup>+</sup>/HR<sup>+</sup> breast cancer.

                Non-coding RNAs exert diverse functions in many cell types. In addition to transcription factors from coding genes, non-coding RNAs may also play essential roles in shaping and directing the fate of germ cells. The presence of many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which are specifically expressed in the germ cells during human gonadal development were reportedand one divergent lncRNA, <i>LNC1845</i>, was functionally characterized. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of these lncRNAs indicates that divergent lncRNAs occupied the majority of female and male germ cells. Integrating lncRNA expression into the bioinformatic analysis also enhances the cell-type classification of female germ cells. Functional dissection using <i>in vitro</i> differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to germ cells revealed the regulatory role of <i>LNC1845</i> on a transcription factor essential for ovarian follicle development, <i>LHX8</i>, by modulating the levels of histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac. Hence, bioinformatical analysis and experimental verification provide a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in developing germ cells and elucidate how a lncRNA function as a <i>cis</i> regulator during human germ cell development.

">The neuron mixer and its impact on human brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                A signal mixer made of a transistor facilitates rich computation that has been the building block of modern telecommunication. Here we report that a neural cell is also a signal mixer. We found through ex vivo and in vivo measurements that individual neurons mix exogenous (controlled) and endogenous (spontaneous) subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, thereby producing new oscillations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the neural mixing dynamic is evident in human brain activity and is associated with our cognitive functions. Neural network oscillations have been observed in nearly every cognitive domain and species. Signal mixing enables single neurons to actively sculpt their network oscillations and utilize them for computational operations, which have only been seen in modern telecommunication until now.

	<p>Flavonoids, a group of natural compounds with phenolic structure, are becoming popular as alternative medicines obtained from plants. These compounds are reported to have various pharmacological properties, including attenuation of inflammatory responses in multiple health issues. Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system implicated with the activation of the inflammatory cascade in the brain. The aim of the present study was to summarize the role of various neuroinflammatory mediators in the onset and progression of epilepsy, and, thereafter, to discuss the flavonoids and their classes, including their biological properties. Further, we highlighted the modulation of anti-inflammatory responses achieved by these substances in different forms of epilepsy, as evident from preclinical studies executed on multiple epilepsy models. Overall, the review summarizes the available evidence of the anti-inflammatory potential of various flavonoids in epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Cytoglobin (Cygb), a hemoprotein of the globin family, is expressed in the supportive tissue cells of the fibroblast lineage and in distinct neuronal cell populations. The expression pattern and regulatory parameters of fibroblasts and related cells were studied in organs such as the kidney and liver in a variety of animal models. In contrast, knowledge about cytoglobin-expressing neurons is sparse. Only a few papers described the distribution in the brain as ubiquitous with a restricted number of neurons in focal regions. Although there is evidence for cytoglobin involvement in neuronal hypoxia tolerance, its presence in the auditory system was not studied despite high metabolism rates and oxygen demands of the cochlea and related brainstem centers. In a continuation of a previous study demonstrating Cygb-neurons in, inter alia, auditory regions of the mouse brain, we concentrated on the superior olivary complex (SOC) in the present study. We sought to investigate the distribution, projection pattern and neurochemistry of Cygb-neurons in the SOC. We conducted immunohistochemistry using a Cygb antibody and found that this brainstem region, functionally competent for bilateral hearing and providing cochlear hair cell innervation, contains a considerable number of Cygb-expressing neurons (averaging 2067 &amp;amp;plusmn; 211 making up 10 &amp;amp;plusmn;1% percent of total neuron number) in rats, and 514 &amp;amp;plusmn; 138 (6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1%) in mice. They were observed in all regions of the SOC. Retrograde neuronal tract tracing with Fluorogold injected into the cochlea demonstrated that 1243 &amp;amp;plusmn; 100 (6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1% of total neuron number in rat SOC)) were olivocochlear neurons. Approximately 56% of total Cygb neurons were retrogradely labelled, while the majority of olivocochlear neurons of both lateral and medial systems were Cygb-immunoreactive. We also conducted double immunofluorescence staining for Cygb and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the enzyme responsible for nitric oxide production, and observed that cytoglobin in the SOC frequently co-localized with nNOS. Our findings suggest that cytoglobin plays an important physiologic role in the oxygen homeostasis of the peripheral and central auditory nervous system. Further studies, also including transgenic animal models, are required to shed more light on the function(s) of Cygb in neurons, in particular of the auditory system.</p>

	<p>Both short- and long-term memories decline with healthy ageing. The aims of the current study were twofold: firstly, to build on previous studies and investigate the presence of a relationship between short- and long-term memories and, secondly, to examine cross-sectionally whether there are changes in this relationship with age. In two experiments, participants across the age range were tested on contextual-spatial memories after short and long memory durations. Experimental control in stimulus materials and task demands enabled the analogous encoding and probing for both memory durations, allowing us to examine the relationship between the two memory systems. Across two experiments, in line with previous studies, we found both short-term memory and long-term memory declined from early to late adulthood. Additionally, there was a significant relationship between short- and long-term memory performance, which, interestingly, persisted throughout the age range. Our findings suggest a significant degree of common vulnerability to healthy ageing for short- and long-term memories sharing the same spatial-contextual associations. Furthermore, our tasks provide a sensitive and promising framework for assessing and comparing memory function at different timescales in disorders with memory deficits at their core.</p>

	<p>Background: Education is believed to contribute positively to brain structure and function, as well as to cognitive reserve. One of the brain regions most impacted by education is the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a region that houses the hippocampus, which has an important role in learning processes and in consolidation of memories, and is also known to undergo neurogenesis in adulthood. We aimed to investigate the influence of education on the absolute cell numbers of the MTL (comprised by the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus) of men without cognitive impairment. Methods: The Isotropic Fractionator technique was used to allow the anisotropic brain tissue to be transformed into an isotropic suspension of nuclei, and therefore assess the absolute cell composition of the MTL. We dissected twenty-six brains from men aged 47 to 64 years, with either low or high education. Results: A significant difference between groups was observed in brain mass, but not in MTL mass. No significant difference was found between groups in the number of total cells, number of neurons, and number of non-neuronal cells. Regression analysis showed that the total number of cells, number of neurons, and number of non-neuronal cells in MTL were not affected by education. Conclusions: The results indicate a resilience of the absolute cellular composition of the MTL of typical men to low schooling, suggesting that the cellularity of brain regions is not affected by formal education.</p>

	<p>Clinically oriented studies of mood as a function of the menstrual cycle mainly address the negative moods in the premenstrual phase of the cycle. However, a periovulatory increase in positive emotions and motivations related to reproduction has also been noted. Thus, it has been suggested that the drop in mood during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle might be a byproduct of elevated positive moods occurring mid-cycle. The aim of this prospective study was to compare both the positive and negative dimensions of mood across the menstrual cycle. A group of 60 healthy, normally cycling women assessed their mood throughout three phases of their menstrual cycles: the early follicular (low estradiol and progesterone), the late follicular (fertile phase; high estradiol, low progesterone) and the mid-luteal phase (high levels of both estradiol and progesterone). Repeated MANOVA evaluations showed a significant increase in positive (friendly, cheerful, focused, active) and a significant decrease in negative (anxious, depressed, fatigued, hostile) dimensions of mood mid-cycle, i.e., during the late follicular phase (&amp;amp;eta;2 = 0.072&amp;amp;ndash;0.174, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Contrary to the widespread belief that negative moods are characteristic of the luteal phase (preceding the onset of the next cycle), the post hoc Bonferroni tests showed that none of the mood dimensions differed between the mid-luteal and early follicular phases of the cycle. The results held when controlling for relationship status and order of testing. This pattern of fluctuations is in accordance with the ovulatory-shift hypothesis, i.e., the notion that the emotions of attraction rise during a short window during which the conception is likely.</p>

	<p>Background: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is widely used for the treatment of primary motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Further, recent evidence suggests that STN-DBS may relieve a few ophthalmic symptoms in PD, such as eye-blink rate and the flexibility of eye saccades. However, its exact effect on visual function remains unknown. Herein, we report the case of a patient with PD who underwent STN-DBS and experienced visual symptoms following levodopa reduction. Case presentation: A 63-year-old male patient with PD developed severe visual impairment after six months of high-frequency STN-DBS. His symptoms resolved after adjusting the levodopa dose prescribed to the patient. Conclusions: This case report suggests that DBS is beneficial in patients with PD in terms of eye-blink rate. However, the rapid reduction of medication after STN-DBS may lead to retinal atrophy and the shrinkage of vessel density in the ocular fundus. Thus, neurosurgeons should pay close attention to patients with visual symptoms when adjusting levodopa dosages.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/2?rss=1">Trapping of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Ligands Assayed by In Vitro Cellular Studies and In Vivo PET Imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>A question relevant to nicotine addiction is how nicotine and other nicotinic receptor membrane-permeant ligands, such as the anti-smoking drug varenicline (Chantix), distribute in brain. Ligands, like varenicline, with high pK<SUB>a</SUB> and high affinity for &alpha;4&beta;2-type nicotinic receptors (&alpha;4&beta;2Rs) are trapped in intracellular acidic vesicles containing &alpha;4&beta;2Rs <I>in vitro</I>. Nicotine, with lower pK<SUB>a</SUB> and &alpha;4&beta;2R affinity, is not trapped. Here, we extend our results by imaging nicotinic PET ligands <I>in vivo</I> in male and female mouse brain and identifying the trapping brain organelle <I>in vitro</I> as Golgi satellites (GSats). Two PET <sup>18</sup>F-labeled imaging ligands were chosen: [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA85380 (2-FA) with varenicline-like pK<SUB>a</SUB> and affinity and [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene with nicotine-like pK<SUB>a</SUB> and affinity. [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA PET-imaging kinetics were very slow consistent with 2-FA trapping in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing GSats. In contrast, [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene kinetics were rapid, consistent with its binding to &alpha;4&beta;2Rs but no trapping. Specific [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA and [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene signals were eliminated in &beta;2 subunit knock-out (KO) mice or by acute nicotine (AN) injections demonstrating binding to sites on &beta;2-containing receptors. Chloroquine (CQ), which dissipates GSat pH gradients, reduced [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA distributions while having little effect on [<sup>18</sup>F]Nifene distributions <I>in vivo</I> consistent with only [<sup>18</sup>F]2-FA trapping in GSats. These results are further supported by <I>in vitro</I> findings where dissipation of GSat pH gradients blocks 2-FA trapping in GSats without affecting Nifene. By combining <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> imaging, we mapped both the brain-wide and subcellular distributions of weak-base nicotinic receptor ligands. We conclude that ligands, such as varenicline, are trapped in neurons in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing GSats, which results in very slow release long after nicotine is gone after smoking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mechanisms of nicotine addiction remain poorly understood. An earlier study using <I>in vitro</I> methods found that the anti-smoking nicotinic ligand, varenicline (Chantix) was trapped in &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing acidic vesicles. Using a fluorescent-labeled high-affinity nicotinic ligand, this study provided evidence that these intracellular acidic vesicles were &alpha;4&beta;2R-containing Golgi satellites (GSats). <I>In vivo</I> PET imaging with F-18-labeled nicotinic ligands provided additional evidence that differences in PET ligand trapping in acidic vesicles were the cause of differences in PET ligand kinetics and subcellular distributions. These findings combining <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> imaging revealed new mechanistic insights into the kinetics of weak base PET imaging ligands and the subcellular mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/14?rss=1">Pharmacological Signature and Target Specificity of Inhibitory Circuits Formed by Martinotti Cells in the Mouse Barrel Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the neocortex, fast synaptic inhibition orchestrates both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. GABAergic interneurons (INs) inhibit pyramidal neurons (PNs) directly, modulating their output activity and thus contributing to balance cortical networks. Moreover, several IN subtypes also inhibit other INs, forming specific disinhibitory circuits, which play crucial roles in several cognitive functions. Here, we studied a subpopulation of somatostatin-positive INs, the Martinotti cells (MCs) in layer 2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex (both sexes). MCs inhibit the distal portion of PN apical dendrites, thus controlling dendrite electrogenesis and synaptic integration. Yet, it is poorly understood whether MCs inhibit other elements of the cortical circuits, and the connectivity properties with non-PN targets are unknown. We found that MCs have a strong preference for PN dendrites, but they also considerably connect with parvalbumin-positive, vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing, and layer 1 (L1) INs. Remarkably, GABAergic synapses from MCs exhibited clear cell type-specific short-term plasticity. Moreover, whereas the biophysical properties of MC-PN synapses were consistent with distal dendritic inhibition, MC-IN synapses exhibited characteristics of fast perisomatic inhibition. Finally, MC-PN connections used &alpha;5-containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs), but this subunit was not expressed by the other INs targeted by MCs. We reveal a specialized connectivity blueprint of MCs within different elements of superficial cortical layers. In addition, our results identify &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs as the molecular fingerprint of MC-PN dendritic inhibition. This is of critical importance, given the role of &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in cognitive performance and their involvement in several brain diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Martinotti cells (MCs) are a prominent, broad subclass of somatostatin-expressing GABAergic interneurons, specialized in controlling distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs) and taking part in several cognitive functions. Here we characterize the connectivity pattern of MCs with other interneurons in the superficial layers (L1 and L2/3) of the mouse barrel cortex. We found that the connectivity pattern of MCs with PNs as well as parvalbumin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and L1 interneurons exhibit target-specific plasticity and biophysical properties. The specificity of &alpha;5-GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs at MC-PN synapses and the lack or functional expression of this subunit by other cell types define the molecular identity of MC-PN connections and the exclusive involvement of this inhibitory circuits in &alpha;5-dependent cognitive tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/28?rss=1">Synaptic Development in Diverse Olfactory Neuron Classes Uses Distinct Temporal and Activity-Related Programs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Developing neurons must meet core molecular, cellular, and temporal requirements to ensure the correct formation of synapses, resulting in functional circuits. However, because of the vast diversity in neuronal class and function, it is unclear whether or not all neurons use the same organizational mechanisms to form synaptic connections and achieve functional and morphologic maturation. Moreover, it remains unknown whether neurons united in a common goal and comprising the same sensory circuit develop on similar timescales and use identical molecular approaches to ensure the formation of the correct number of synapses. To begin to answer these questions, we took advantage of the <I>Drosophila</I> antennal lobe (AL), a model olfactory circuit with remarkable genetic access and synapse-level resolution. Using tissue-specific genetic labeling of active zones, we performed a quantitative analysis of synapse formation in multiple classes of neurons of both sexes throughout development and adulthood. We found that olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons (LNs) each have unique time courses of synaptic development, addition, and refinement, demonstrating that each class follows a distinct developmental program. This raised the possibility that these classes may also have distinct molecular requirements for synapse formation. We genetically altered neuronal activity in each neuronal subtype and observed differing effects on synapse number based on the neuronal class examined. Silencing neuronal activity in ORNs, PNs, and LNs impaired synaptic development but only in ORNs did enhancing neuronal activity influence synapse formation. ORNs and LNs demonstrated similar impairment of synaptic development with enhanced activity of a master kinase, GSK-3&beta;, suggesting that neuronal activity and GSK-3&beta; kinase activity function in a common pathway. ORNs also, however, demonstrated impaired synaptic development with GSK-3&beta; loss-of-function, suggesting additional activity-independent roles in development. Ultimately, our results suggest that the requirements for synaptic development are not uniform across all neuronal classes with considerable diversity existing in both their developmental time frames and molecular requirements. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of synaptic development and lay the foundation for future work determining their underlying etiologies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Distinct olfactory neuron classes in <I>Drosophila</I> develop a mature synaptic complement over unique timelines and using distinct activity-dependent and molecular programs, despite having the same generalized goal of olfactory sensation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/56?rss=1">Preferential Modulatory Action of 5-HT2A Receptors on the Dynamic Regulation of Basal Ganglia Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>In rodents, cortical information is transferred to the <I>substantia nigra pars reticulata</I> (SNr) through motor and medial prefrontal (mPF) basal ganglia (BG) circuits implicated in motor and cognitive/motivational behaviors, respectively. The serotonergic 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors are located in both of these neuronal networks, displaying topographical differences with a high expression in the associative/limbic territories, and a very low expression in the subthalamic nucleus. This study investigated whether the stimulation of 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors could have a specific signature on the dynamic regulation of BG circuits, preferentially modulating the mPF information processing through trans-striatal pathways. We performed <I>in vivo</I> single-unit extracellular recordings to assess the effect of the 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> agonist TCB-2 on the spontaneous and cortically evoked activity of lateral and medial SNr neurons in male rats (involved in motor and mPF circuits, respectively). TCB-2 (50&ndash;200 &micro;g/kg, i.v.) increased the basal firing rate and enhanced the cortically evoked inhibitory response of medial SNr neurons (transmission through the direct striato-nigral pathway). A prior administration of the preferential 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptor antagonist MDL11939 (200 &micro;g/kg, i.v.) did not modify any electrophysiological parameter, but occluded TCB-2-induced effects. In animals treated with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor pCPA (4-chloro-<scp>dl</scp>-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride), TCB-2 failed to induce the above-mentioned effects, thus suggesting the contribution of endogenous 5-HT. However, the mobilization of 5-HT induced by the acute administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not mimic the effects triggered by TCB-2. Overall, these data suggest that 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors have a preferential modulatory action on the dynamic regulation of BG circuitry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor and medial prefrontal (mPF) basal ganglia (BG) circuits play an important role in integrative brain functions like movement control or cognitive/motivational behavior, respectively. Although these neuronal networks express 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors, the expression is higher in associative/limbic structures than in the motor ones. We show a topographical-dependent dissociation in the effects triggered by the 5HT<SUB>2A</SUB> agonist TCB-2, which specifically increases the medial <I>substantia nigra pars reticulata</I> neuron activity and has a preferential action on mPF information processing through the striato-nigral direct pathway. These are very likely to be 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptor-mediated effects that require mobilization of the endogenous 5-HT system. These findings provide evidence about the specific signature of 5-HT<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors on the dynamic regulation of BG circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/68?rss=1">Parallel Pathways Provide Hippocampal Spatial Information to Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long-range synaptic connections define how information flows through neuronal networks. Here, we combined retrograde and anterograde trans-synaptic viruses to delineate areas that exert direct and indirect influence over the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the rat (both sexes). Notably, retrograde tracing using pseudorabies virus (PRV) revealed that both dorsal and ventral areas of the PFC receive prominent disynaptic input from the dorsal CA3 (dCA3) region of the hippocampus. The PRV experiments also identified candidate anatomical relays for this disynaptic pathway, namely, the ventral hippocampus, lateral septum, thalamus, amygdala, and basal forebrain. To determine the viability of each of these relays, we performed three additional experiments. In the first, we injected the retrograde monosynaptic tracer Fluoro-Gold into the PFC and the anterograde monosynaptic tracer Fluoro-Ruby into the dCA3 to confirm the first-order connecting areas and revealed several potential relay regions between the PFC and dCA3. In the second, we combined PRV injection in the PFC with polysynaptic anterograde viral tracer (HSV-1) in the dCA3 to reveal colabeled connecting neurons, which were evident only in the ventral hippocampus. In the third, we combined retrograde adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections in the PFC with an anterograde AAV in the dCA3 to reveal anatomical relay neurons in the ventral hippocampus and dorsal lateral septum. Together, these findings reveal parallel disynaptic pathways from the dCA3 to the PFC, illuminating a new anatomical framework for understanding hippocampal&ndash;prefrontal interactions. We suggest that the representation of context and space may be a universal feature of prefrontal function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The known functions of the prefrontal cortex are shaped by input from multiple brain areas. We used transneuronal viral tracing to discover multiple prominent disynaptic pathways through which the dorsal hippocampus (specifically, the dorsal CA3) has the potential to shape the actions of the prefrontal cortex. The demonstration of neuronal relays in the ventral hippocampus and lateral septum presents a new foundation for understanding long-range influences over prefrontal interactions, including the specific contribution of the dorsal CA3 to prefrontal function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/82?rss=1">Creation of Neuronal Ensembles and Cell-Specific Homeostatic Plasticity through Chronic Sparse Optogenetic Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical computations emerge from the dynamics of neurons embedded in complex cortical circuits. Within these circuits, neuronal ensembles, which represent subnetworks with shared functional connectivity, emerge in an experience-dependent manner. Here we induced ensembles in <I>ex vivo</I> cortical circuits from mice of either sex by differentially activating subpopulations through chronic optogenetic stimulation. We observed a decrease in voltage correlation, and importantly a synaptic decoupling between the stimulated and nonstimulated populations. We also observed a decrease in firing rate during Up-states in the stimulated population. These ensemble-specific changes were accompanied by decreases in intrinsic excitability in the stimulated population, and a decrease in connectivity between stimulated and nonstimulated pyramidal neurons. By incorporating the empirically observed changes in intrinsic excitability and connectivity into a spiking neural network model, we were able to demonstrate that changes in both intrinsic excitability and connectivity accounted for the decreased firing rate, but only changes in connectivity accounted for the observed decorrelation. Our findings help ascertain the mechanisms underlying the ability of chronic patterned stimulation to create ensembles within cortical circuits and, importantly, show that while Up-states are a global network-wide phenomenon, functionally distinct ensembles can preserve their identity during Up-states through differential firing rates and correlations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The connectivity and activity patterns of local cortical circuits are shaped by experience. This experience-dependent reorganization of cortical circuits is driven by complex interactions between different local learning rules, external input, and reciprocal feedback between many distinct brain areas. Here we used an <I>ex vivo</I> approach to demonstrate how simple forms of chronic external stimulation can shape local cortical circuits in terms of their correlated activity and functional connectivity. The absence of feedback between different brain areas and full control of external input allowed for a tractable system to study the underlying mechanisms and development of a computational model. Results show that differential stimulation of subpopulations of neurons significantly reshapes cortical circuits and forms subnetworks referred to as neuronal ensembles.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/93?rss=1">A Redundant Cortical Code for Speech Envelope</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animal communication sounds exhibit complex temporal structure because of the amplitude fluctuations that comprise the sound envelope. In human speech, envelope modulations drive synchronized activity in auditory cortex (AC), which correlates strongly with comprehension (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B17">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B47">Peelle and Davis, 2012</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Haegens and Zion Golumbic, 2018</cross-ref>). Studies of envelope coding in single neurons, performed in nonhuman animals, have focused on periodic amplitude modulation (AM) stimuli and use response metrics that are not easy to juxtapose with data from humans. In this study, we sought to bridge these fields. Specifically, we looked directly at the temporal relationship between stimulus envelope and spiking, and we assessed whether the apparent diversity across neurons' AM responses contributes to the population representation of speech-like sound envelopes. We gathered responses from single neurons to vocoded speech stimuli and compared them to sinusoidal AM responses in auditory cortex (AC) of alert, freely moving Mongolian gerbils of both sexes. While AC neurons displayed heterogeneous tuning to AM rate, their temporal dynamics were stereotyped. Preferred response phases accumulated near the onsets of sinusoidal AM periods for slower rates (&lt;8 Hz), and an over-representation of amplitude edges was apparent in population responses to both sinusoidal AM and vocoded speech envelopes. Crucially, this encoding bias imparted a decoding benefit: a classifier could discriminate vocoded speech stimuli using summed population activity, while higher frequency modulations required a more sophisticated decoder that tracked spiking responses from individual cells. Together, our results imply that the envelope structure relevant to parsing an acoustic stream could be read-out from a distributed, redundant population code.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal communication sounds have rich temporal structure and are often produced in extended sequences, including the syllabic structure of human speech. Although the auditory cortex (AC) is known to play a crucial role in representing speech syllables, the contribution of individual neurons remains uncertain. Here, we characterized the representations of both simple, amplitude-modulated sounds and complex, speech-like stimuli within a broad population of cortical neurons, and we found an overrepresentation of amplitude edges. Thus, a phasic, redundant code in auditory cortex can provide a mechanistic explanation for segmenting acoustic streams like human speech.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/113?rss=1">Activity Patterns of Individual Neurons and Ensembles Correlated with Retrieval of a Contextual Memory in the Dorsal CA1 of Mouse Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampus is crucial for retrieval of contextual memories. The activation of a subpopulation of neurons in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) of the hippocampus is required for memory retrieval. Given that hippocampal neurons exhibit distinct patterns of response during memory retrieval, the activity patterns of individual neurons or ensembles may be critically involved in memory retrieval. However, this relation has been unclear. To investigate this question, we used an <I>in vivo</I> microendoscope calcium imaging technique to optically record neuronal activity in the dCA1 of male and female mice. We observed that a portion of dCA1 neurons increased their responses to the learned context after contextual fear conditioning (FC), resulting in overall increase in response of neuronal population compared with simple context exposure. Such increased response was specific to the conditioned context as it disappeared in neutral context. The magnitude of increase in neuronal responses by FC was proportional to memory strength during retrieval. The increases in activity preferentially occurred during the putative sharp wave ripple events and were not simply because of animal's movement and immobility. At the ensemble level, synchronous cell activity patterns were associated with memory retrieval. Accordingly, when such patterns were more similar between conditioned and neutral context, animals displayed proportionally more similar level of freezing. Together, these results indicate that increase in responses of individual neurons and synchronous cell activity patterns in the dCA1 neuronal network are critically involved in representing a contextual memory recall.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons in the dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus are crucial for memory retrieval. By using <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging methods for recording neuronal activity, we demonstrate that dCA1 neurons increased their responses to the learned context specifically by FC and such changes correlated with memory strength during retrieval. Moreover, distinct synchronous cell activity patterns were formed by FC and involved in representing contextual memory retrieval. These findings reveal dynamic activity features of dCA1 neurons that are involved in contextual memory retrieval.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/125?rss=1">Action Observation Network Activity Related to Object-Directed and Socially-Directed Actions in Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human action observation network (AON) encompasses brain areas consistently engaged when we observe other's actions. Although the core nodes of the AON are present from childhood, it is not known to what extent they are sensitive to different action features during development. Because social cognitive abilities continue to mature during adolescence, the AON response to socially-oriented actions, but not to object-related actions, may differ in adolescents and adults. To test this hypothesis, we scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) male and female typically-developing teenagers (<I>n</I> = 28; 13 females) and adults (<I>n</I> = 25; 14 females) while they passively watched videos of manual actions varying along two dimensions: sociality (i.e., directed toward another person or not) and transitivity (i.e., involving an object or not). We found that action observation recruited the same fronto-parietal and occipito-temporal regions in adults and adolescents. The modulation of voxel-wise activity according to the social or transitive nature of the action was similar in both groups of participants. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, revealed that decoding accuracies in intraparietal sulcus (IPS)/superior parietal lobe (SPL) for both sociality and transitivity were lower for adolescents compared with adults. In addition, in the lateral occipital temporal cortex (LOTC), generalization of decoding across the orthogonal dimension was lower for sociality only in adolescents. These findings indicate that the representation of the content of others' actions, and in particular their social dimension, in the adolescent AON is still not as robust as in adults.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The activity of the action observation network (AON) in the human brain is modulated according to the purpose of the observed action, in particular the extent to which it involves interaction with an object or with another person. How this conceptual representation of actions is implemented during development is largely unknown. Here, using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we discovered that, while the action observation network is in place in adolescence, the fine-grain organization of its posterior regions is less robust than in adults to decode the abstract social dimensions of an action. This finding highlights the late maturation of social processing in the human brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/142?rss=1">Rapid Interactions of Widespread Brain Networks Characterize Semantic Cognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Language comprehension requires the rapid retrieval and integration of contextually appropriate concepts ("semantic cognition"). Current neurobiological models of semantic cognition are limited by the spatial and temporal restrictions of single-modality neuroimaging and lesion approaches. This is a major impediment given the rapid sequence of processing steps that have to be coordinated to accurately comprehend language. Through the use of fused functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography analysis in humans (<I>n</I> = 26 adults; 15 females), we elucidate a temporally and spatially specific neurobiological model for real-time semantic cognition. We find that semantic cognition in the context of language comprehension is supported by trade-offs between widespread neural networks over the course of milliseconds. Incorporation of spatial and temporal characteristics, as well as behavioral measures, provide convergent evidence for the following progression: a hippocampal/anterior temporal phonological semantic retrieval network (peaking at ~300 ms after the sentence final word); a frontotemporal thematic semantic network (~400 ms); a hippocampal memory update network (~500 ms); an inferior frontal semantic syntactic reappraisal network (~600 ms); and nodes of the default mode network associated with conceptual coherence (~750 ms). Additionally, in typical adults, mediatory relationships among these networks are significantly predictive of language comprehension ability. These findings provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the examination of speech and language disorders, with additional implications for the characterization of cognitive processes and clinical populations in other cognitive domains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present study identifies a real-time neurobiological model of the meaning processes required during language comprehension (i.e., "semantic cognition"). Using a novel application of fused magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography in humans, we found that semantic cognition during language comprehension is supported by a rapid progression of widespread neural networks related to meaning, meaning integration, memory, reappraisal, and conceptual cohesion. Relationships among these systems were predictive of individuals' language comprehension efficiency. Our findings are the first to use fused neuroimaging analysis to elucidate language processes. In so doing, this study provides a new conceptual and methodological framework in which to characterize language processes and guide the treatment of speech and language deficits/disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/155?rss=1">Selective TLR4 Antagonism Prevents and Reverses Morphine-Induced Persistent Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction, Dysregulation of Synaptic Elements, and Impaired BDNF Signaling in Aged Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are characterized by confusion, difficulty with executive function, and episodic memory impairment in the hours to months following a surgical procedure. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) represents such impairments that last beyond 30 d postsurgery and is associated with increased risk of comorbidities, progression to dementia, and higher mortality. While it is clear that neuroinflammation plays a key role in PND development, what factors underlie shorter self-resolving versus persistent PNDs remains unclear. We have previously shown that postoperative morphine treatment extends POCD from 4 d (without morphine) to at least 8 weeks (with morphine) in aged male rats, and that this effect is likely dependent on the proinflammatory capabilities of morphine via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, we extend these findings to show that TLR4 blockade, using the selective TLR4 antagonist lipopolysaccharide from the bacterium <I>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</I> (LPS-RS Ultrapure), ameliorates morphine-induced POCD in aged male rats. Using either a single central preoperative treatment or a 1 week postoperative central treatment regimen, we demonstrate that TLR4 antagonism (1) prevents and reverses the long-term memory impairment associated with surgery and morphine treatment, (2) ameliorates morphine-induced dysregulation of the postsynaptic proteins postsynaptic density 95 and synaptopodin, (3) mitigates reductions in mature BDNF, and (4) prevents decreased activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB (tropomyosin-related kinase B), all at 4 weeks postsurgery. We also reveal that LPS-RS Ultrapure likely exerts its beneficial effects by preventing endogenous danger signal HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1) from activating TLR4, rather than by blocking continuous activation by morphine or its metabolites. These findings suggest TLR4 as a promising therapeutic target to prevent or treat PNDs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> With humans living longer than ever, it is crucial that we identify mechanisms that contribute to aging-related vulnerability to cognitive impairment. Here, we show that the innate immune receptor toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a key mediator of cognitive dysfunction in aged rodents following surgery and postoperative morphine treatment. Inhibition of TLR4 both prevented and reversed surgery plus morphine-associated memory impairment, dysregulation of synaptic elements, and reduced BDNF signaling. Together, these findings implicate TLR4 in the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction, providing mechanistic insight and novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cognitive impairments following immune challenges such as surgery in older individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/43/1/173?rss=1">The Neural Signature of Impaired Inhibitory Control in Individuals with Heroin Use Disorder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Heroin addiction imposes a devastating toll on society, with little known about its neurobiology. Excessive salience attribution to drug over nondrug cues/reinforcers, with concomitant inhibitory control decreases, are common mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Although inhibitory control alterations generally culminate in prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypoactivations across drugs of abuse, patterns in individuals with heroin addiction (iHUDs) remain unknown. We used a stop-signal fMRI task designed to meet recent consensus guidelines in mapping inhibitory control in 41 iHUDs and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Despite group similarities in the stop-signal response time (SSRT; the classic inhibitory control measure), compared with HCs, iHUDs exhibited impaired target detection sensitivity (proportion of hits in go vs false alarms in stop trials; <I>p</I> = 0.003). Additionally, iHUDs exhibited lower right anterior PFC (aPFC) and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity during successful versus failed stops (the hallmark inhibitory control contrast). Lower left dlPFC/supplementary motor area (SMA) activity was associated with slower SSRT specifically in iHUDs and lower left aPFC activity with worse target sensitivity across all participants (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05 corrected). Importantly, in iHUDs, lower left SMA and aPFC activity during inhibitory control was associated with shorter time since last use and higher severity of dependence, respectively (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05 corrected). Together, results revealed lower perceptual sensitivity and hypoactivations during inhibitory control in cognitive control regions (e.g., aPFC, dlPFC, SMA) as associated with task performance and heroin use severity measures in iHUDs. Such neurobehavioral inhibitory control deficits may contribute to self-control lapses in heroin addiction, constituting targets for prevention and intervention efforts to enhance recovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Heroin addiction continues its deadly impact, with little known about the neurobiology of this disorder. Although behavioral and prefrontal cortical impairments in inhibitory control characterize addiction across drugs of abuse, these patterns remain underexplored in heroin addiction. Here, we illustrate a significant behavioral impairment in target discrimination in individuals with heroin addiction compared with matched healthy controls. We further show lower engagement during inhibitory control in the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (key regions that regulate cognitive control) as associated with slower stopping, worse discrimination, and heroin use measures. Mapping the neurobiology of inhibitory control in heroin addiction for the first time, we identify potential treatment targets inclusive of prefrontal cortex-mediated cognitive control amenable for neuromodulation en route to recovery.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Postsynaptic scaffolding proteins function as central organization hubs, ensuring the synaptic localization of neurotransmitter receptors, trans-synaptic adhesion proteins, and signaling molecules. Gephyrin is the major postsynaptic scaffolding protein at glycinergic and a subset of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. In contrast to cells outside the CNS, where one gephyrin isoform is predominantly expressed, neurons express different splice variants. In this study, we characterized the expression and scaffolding of neuronal gephyrin isoforms differing in the inclusion of the C4 cassettes located in the central C-domain. In hippocampal and cortical neuronal populations, gephyrin P1, lacking additional cassettes, is the most abundantly expressed isoform. In addition, alternative splicing generated isoforms carrying predominantly C4a, and minor amounts of C4c or C4d cassettes. We detected no striking difference in C4 isoform expression between different neuron types and a single neuron can likely express all C4 isoforms. To avoid the cytosolic aggregates that are commonly observed upon exogenous gephyrin expression, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression to analyze the scaffolding behavior of individual C4 isoforms in murine dissociated hippocampal glutamatergic neurons. While all isoforms showed similar clustering at GABAergic synapses, a thorough quantitative analysis revealed localization differences for the C4c isoform (also known as P2). Specifically, synaptic C4c isoform clusters showed a more distal dendritic localization and reduced occurrence at P1-predominating synapses. Additionally, inhibitory currents displayed faster decay kinetics in the presence of gephyrin C4c compared with P1. Therefore, inhibitory synapse heterogeneity may be influenced, at least in part, by mechanisms relating to C4 cassette splicing.</p>

                <p>The study used machine learning to predict The American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) scores for newly injured spinal cord injury patients at hospital discharge time from hospital admission data. Additionally, machine learning was used to analyze the best model for feature importance to validate the criticality of the AIS score and highlight relevant demographic details. The data used for training machine learning models was from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (NSCISC) database of U.S. spinal cord injury patient details. Eighteen real features were used from 417 provided features, which mapped to 53 machine learning features after processing. Eight models were tuned on the dataset to predict AIS scores, and Shapely analysis was performed to extract the most important of the 53 features. Patients within the NSCISC database who sustained injuries were between 1972 and 2016 after data cleaning (<I>n</I> = 20,790). Outcomes were test set multiclass accuracy and aggregated Shapely score magnitudes. Ridge Classifier was the best performer with 73.6% test set accuracy. AIS scores and neurologic category at the time of admission were the best predictors of recovery. Demographically, features were less important, but age, sex, marital status, and race stood out. AIS scores on admission are highly predictive of patient outcomes when combined with patient demographic data. Promising results in terms of predicting recovery were seen, and Shapely analysis allowed for the machine learning model to be probed as a whole, giving insight into overall feature trends.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Environmental enrichment (EE) is beneficial for brain development and function, but our understanding of its capacity to drive circuit repair, the underlying mechanisms, and how this might vary with age remains limited. Ten-m3 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit a dramatic and stereotyped mistargeting of ipsilateral retinal inputs to the thalamus, resulting in visual deficits. We have recently shown a previously unexpected capacity for EE during early postnatal life (from birth for six weeks) to drive the partial elimination of miswired axonal projections, along with a recovery of visually mediated behavior, but the timeline of this repair was unclear. Here, we reveal that with just 3.5 weeks of EE from birth, Ten-m3 KOs exhibit a partial behavioral rescue, accompanied by pruning of the most profoundly miswired retinogeniculate terminals. Analysis suggests that the pruning is underway at this time point, providing an ideal opportunity to probe potential mechanisms. With the shorter EE-period, we found a localized increase in microglial density and activation profile within the identified geniculate region where corrective pruning was observed. No comparable response to EE was found in age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. These findings identify microglia as a potential mechanistic link through which EE drives the elimination of miswired neural circuits during early postnatal development. Activity driven, atypical recruitment of microglia to prune aberrant connectivity and restore function may have important therapeutic implications for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-10/v1?src=rss">Chinese culture became more individualistic: Evidence from family structure, 1953-2017 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has indicated that some aspects of Chinese culture became more individualistic. However, prior studies have suggested a decrease in individualism in other aspects of China. Thus, it was unclear whether China became more individualistic. Therefore, the current research investigated whether Chinese culture became more individualistic by examining historical changes in family structure. Specifically, I analyzed temporal shifts in the divorce rate and household size, which have been confirmed as valid representative indicators of individualism. Results showed that the divorce rate increased between 1978 and 2017 and household size decreased between 1953 and 2017, indicating a rise in individualism. Moreover, analyses suggested that the one-child policy was unlikely the sole and major factor in the decrease in household size. Additionally, the aggregated score of divorce rate and household size demonstrated a clear increase in individualism. Therefore, the present research provided further evidence of the rise in individualism in China.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-9/v1?src=rss">Judicial breakfast as an external factor in judicial decision making in courts [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The objective of this article is to establish whether the judges depend on relevant facts, judicial rules, and the law when making their judgments or they use extraneous factors such as what a judge eats, personal ideology, beliefs, or the cultural and political environment. The discourse between the two sides is incomplete without exploring the grand theories: formalism and realism. The antimony between the two theories resulted in theoretical analysis and empirical research. The realism challenged the existing logical reasoning and legal rules that judges use in making their judgment as they contend that judges applying rules and law in their decision-making process are irrational and mechanical. Formalism insists on using the judicial rules and the law in making decisions as opposed to extraneous factors, which realists contend should be the basis for decision making with laws and rules only to support the findings. The continental legal theory holds that legal realism is a hard-nosed, down-to-earth, and practical school of thought that is opposed to mechanical and scientific theories. The scholarly analysis of the judicial decision-making process brings into focus the conduct of judicial officers and whether they base their reasoning on extrajudicial issues. However, the discussion should avoid denigrating into an attack on the personality of judges as it undermines the rule of law.

                Background: Patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) have an altered intestinal microbiome, which may facilitate novel diagnostic testing. However, accuracy of microbiome classification models across geographic regions may be limited. Therefore, we sought to examine geographic variation in the microbiome of patients with CD from North America and test the performance of a machine learning classification model across geographic regions. Methods: The RISK cohort included 447 pediatric patients with CD and 221 non-inflammatory bowel disease controls from across North America. Terminal ileum, rectal and fecal samples were obtained prior to treatment for microbiome analysis. We divided study sites into 3 geographic regions to examine regional microbiome differences. We trained and tested the performance of a machine learning classification model across these regions. Results: No differences were seen in the mucosal microbiome of patients with CD across regions or in either the fecal or mucosal microbiomes of controls. Machine learning classification algorithms for patients with CD performed well across regions (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] range of 0.85-0.91) with the best results from terminal ileum. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of microbiome based diagnostic testing in pediatric patients with CD within North America, independently from regional influences.

                Background: The 44-question Thai Home Fall Hazard Assessment Tool (Thai-HFHAT) was developed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying the risk of falls among community-dwelling elderly from their home environment. However, the reliability of this tool has not been studied. This study aimed to examine reliability of the 44-question Thai-HFHAT and determine the person characteristics associated with home hazards. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used for this research. The participants in this study were 51 elderly people from various types of Thai houses: a one-story elevated house, a one-story non-elevated house, and a house with two or more floors, 51 caregivers of elderly patients and 5 village health volunteers (VHV). All participants answered 44 Thai-HFHAT questions to determine inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities. The reliabilities were analyzed using an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Personal characteristics including sex, occupation, and education were used to identify the factors affecting home hazard and linear regression was used to analyze. Results: The ICC of inter-rater reliability of the 44-question Thai-HFHAT was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.57-0.84) and the test-retest reliability was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.64-0.88) for the elderly, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65-0.89) for the caregivers and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.477-0.83) for the VHV. Personal business career and education level grade 1-3 are less than 0.05, which showed these factors had a significant relationship with the 44-question Thai-HFHAT score as dependent variable. Conclusions: The 44-question Thai-HFHAT is suitable for the home hazards assessment among the elderly in Thailand. Further studies are needed to investigate changes in the house environment after using the 44-question Thai-HFHAT to determine which changes can reduce the risk of fall.

                Foreign bodies (FB) in the aerodigestive tract are common, especially in children. The type of foreign body in the esophagus can vary and include magnets. A magnet that lodges in the esophagus should be extracted within 24 hours to prevent complications due to associated chemical reactions. In rural areas, there are several limitations to extracting FBs from the esophagus. We report a case of a magnetic FB that lodged in the esophagus of a three-year-old boy. The extraction was successfully done by esophagoscopy with the modification of a hook that was attached to the endoscope. This innovation may help otolaryngologists all over the world, especially in rural areas. In the future, this innovation could be produced on an industrial scale.

                Background: A growing body of research indicates that psychological coercive control poses a threat in academic environments. Little is known, however, about the process, the dynamics, and the phases used to impose silently a variety of non-violent assaults on students and academics. A lack of awareness of coercive intimidation and psychological coercive control obstructs a student’s path to academic achievement, which can have an impact on his or her emotional and mental well-being and diminishes the prosperity of society.   Methods: A methodological selection and review of the scientific literature, theories, and practice on psychological intimidation, coercive control, and systems thinking has been employed in this study. A comprehensive reflective analysis and critical synthesis of the relevant scientific literature were conducted to gain insight into the design of a model of psychological coercive control applicable to educational environments.   Results: This article identifies gaps in research theory and practice and examines critical issues of intimidation and psychological coercive control that is relevant to educational contexts. The article proposes a conceptual model of psychological coercive control as a direction for further research.   Conclusions: Adequate awareness, models, and training programmes in relation to coercive infiltration are missing at higher education institutions. There is an urgent need for a curriculum change that may serve to promote support systems thinking and security awareness in educational environments.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Polygenic variation accounts for a substantial portion of the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its effect on the rate of fibrillar-tau accumulation as a key driver of dementia symptoms is unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined the to-date largest number of genetic risk variants of AD (n = 85 lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to generate a polygenic score (PGS). We assessed longitudinal tau-positron emission tomography (PET), amyloid-PET, and cognition in 231 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Using the PGS, together with global amyloid-PET, we predicted the rate of tau-PET increases in Braak-stage regions-of-interest and cognitive decline. We also assessed PGS-risk enrichment effects on the required sample size in clinical trials targeting tau pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that a higher PGS was associated with higher rates of tau-PET accumulation, in particular at elevated amyloid-PET levels. The tau-PET increases mediated the association between PGS and faster cognitive decline. Risk enrichment through high PGS afforded sample size savings by 34%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the PGS predicts faster tau progression and thus cognitive decline, showing utility to enhance statistical power in clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>

     alt="Biomarkers of Migraine and Cluster Headache: Differences and Similarities"/>
<p>We aimed to identify interictal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers that differentiate migraine from cluster headache patients, using a machine learning approach, and clinical and multimodal MRI data. The accuracy for classifying headache patients from controls was 80%. The MRI and MRI–clinical combined classifiers distinguishing cluster headache from migraine yielded an accuracy of 78% and 99%. Hypothalamic and periaqueductal gray functional networks were the most important MRI features in classifying headache patients from controls. The thalamic network was the most discriminative MRI feature in classifying migraine from cluster headache.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers that differentiate migraine from cluster headache patients and imaging features that are shared.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical, functional, and structural MRI data were obtained from 20 migraineurs, 20 cluster headache patients, and 15 healthy controls. Support vector machine algorithms and a stepwise removal process were used to discriminate headache patients from controls, and subgroups of patients. Regional between-group differences and association between imaging features and patients' clinical characteristics were also investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The accuracy for classifying headache patients from controls was 80%. The classification accuracy for discrimination between migraine and controls was 89%, and for cluster headache and controls it was 98%. For distinguishing cluster headache from migraine patients, the MRI classifier yielded an accuracy of 78%, whereas MRI–clinical combined classification model achieved an accuracy of 99%. Bilateral hypothalamic and periaqueductal gray (PAG) functional networks were the most important MRI features in classifying migraine and cluster headache patients from controls. The left thalamic network was the most discriminative MRI feature in classifying migraine from cluster headache patients. Compared to migraine, cluster headache patients showed decreased functional interaction between the left thalamus and cortical areas mediating interoception and sensory integration. The presence of restlessness was the most important clinical feature in discriminating the two groups of patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Functional biomarkers, including the hypothalamic and PAG networks, are shared by migraine and cluster headache patients. The thalamocortical pathway may be the neural substrate that differentiates migraine from cluster headache attacks with their distinct clinical features. ANN NEUROL 2023</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Structural imaging of the cholinergic basal forebrain may provide a biomarker for cholinergic system integrity that can be used in motor and non-motor outcome studies in Parkinson's disease. However, no prior studies have validated these structural metrics with cholinergic nerve terminal in vivo imaging in Parkinson's disease. Here, we correlate cholinergic basal forebrain morphometry with the topography of vesicular acetylcholine transporter in a large Parkinson's sample.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>[<sup>18</sup>F]-Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol vesicular acetylcholine transporter positron emission tomography was carried out in 101 non-demented people with Parkinson's (76.24% male, mean age 67.6 ± 7.72 years, disease duration 5.7 ± 4.4 years). Subregional cholinergic basal forebrain volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging morphometry. Relationships were assessed via volume-of-interest based correlation analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Subregional volumes of the cholinergic basal forebrain predicted cholinergic nerve terminal loss, with most robust correlations occurring between the posterior cholinergic basal forebrain and temporofrontal, insula, cingulum and hippocampal regions, and with modest correlations in parieto-occipital regions. Hippocampal correlations were not limited to the cholinergic basal forebrain subregion Ch1-2. Correlations were also observed in the striatum, thalamus and brainstem.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cholinergic basal forebrain morphometry is a robust predictor of regional cerebral vesicular acetylcholine transporter bindings, especially in the anterior brain. The relative lack of correlation between parieto-occipital binding and basal forebrain volumes may reflect the presence of more diffuse synaptopathy in the posterior cortex due to etiologies that extend well beyond the cholinergic system.</p>

                Classically, microglia recognize and internalize amyloid-β (Aβ) via it binding to cell surface receptors. In this issue of Neuron, Hu et al.1 report that microglia “feel” and internalize Aβ plaques using the stiffness-sensing channel Piezo1. This could allow new approaches to treating Alzheimer’s disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80533">Disrupting the ciliary gradient of active Arl3 affects rod photoreceptor nuclear migration</a></h4>

              
                The small GTPase Arl3 is important for the enrichment of lipidated proteins to primary cilia, including the outer segment of photoreceptors. Human mutations in the small GTPase Arl3 cause both autosomal recessive and dominant inherited retinal dystrophies. We discovered that dominant mutations result in increased active G-protein—Arl3-D67V has constitutive activity and Arl3-Y90C is fast cycling—and their expression in mouse rods resulted in a displaced nuclear phenotype due to an aberrant Arl3-GTP gradient. Using multiple strategies, we go on to show that removing or restoring the Arl3-GTP gradient within the cilium is sufficient to rescue the nuclear migration defect. Together, our results reveal that an Arl3 ciliary gradient is involved in proper positioning of photoreceptor nuclei during retinal development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/82978">Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the zebrafish inner ear reveals molecularly distinct hair cell and supporting cell subtypes</a></h4>

              
                A major cause of human deafness and vestibular dysfunction is permanent loss of the mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear. In non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish, regeneration of missing hair cells can occur throughout life. While a comparative approach has the potential to reveal the basis of such differential regenerative ability, the degree to which the inner ears of fish and mammals share common hair cells and supporting cell types remains unresolved. Here we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the zebrafish inner ear at embryonic through adult stages to catalog the diversity of hair cells and non-sensory supporting cells. We identify a putative progenitor population for hair cells and supporting cells, as well as distinct hair and supporting cell types in the maculae versus cristae. The hair cell and supporting cell types differ from those described for the lateral line system, a distributed mechanosensory organ in zebrafish in which most studies of hair cell regeneration have been conducted. In the maculae, we identify two subtypes of hair cells that share gene expression with mammalian striolar or extrastriolar hair cells. In situ hybridization reveals that these hair cell subtypes occupy distinct spatial domains within the three macular organs, the utricle, saccule, and lagena, consistent with the reported distinct electrophysiological properties of hair cells within these domains. These findings suggest that primitive specialization of spatially distinct striolar and extrastriolar hair cells likely arose in the last common ancestor of fish and mammals. The similarities of inner ear cell type composition between fish and mammals validate zebrafish as a relevant model for understanding inner ear-specific hair cell function and regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/78188">Germline/soma distinction in Drosophila embryos requires regulators of zygotic genome activation</a></h4>

              
                In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> embryos, somatic versus germline identity is the first cell fate decision. Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) orchestrates regionalized gene expression, imparting specific identity on somatic cells. ZGA begins with a minor wave that commences at nuclear cycle (NC)8 under the guidance of chromatin accessibility factors (Zelda, CLAMP, GAF), followed by the major wave during NC14. By contrast, primordial germ cell (PGC) specification requires maternally deposited and posteriorly anchored germline determinants. This is accomplished by a centrosome coordinated release and sequestration of germ plasm during the precocious cellularization of PGCs in NC10. Here, we report a novel requirement for Zelda and CLAMP during the establishment of the germline/soma distinction. When their activity is compromised, PGC determinants are not properly sequestered, and specification is disrupted. Conversely, the spreading of PGC determinants from the posterior pole adversely influences transcription in the neighboring somatic nuclei. These reciprocal aberrations can be correlated with defects in centrosome duplication/separation that are known to induce inappropriate transmission of the germ plasm. Interestingly, consistent with the ability of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling to influence specification of embryonic PGCs, reduction in the transcript levels of a BMP family ligand, <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i>), is exacerbated at the posterior pole.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81198">Metformin protects trabecular meshwork against oxidative injury via activating integrin/ROCK signals</a></h4>

              
                This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of metformin on trabecular meshwork (TM) and explore its molecular mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. Ocular hypertension (OHT) mouse models were induced with dexamethasone and further treated with metformin to determine the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect. Cultured human TM cells (HTMCs) were pre-stimulated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) to induce oxidative damage and then supplemented with metformin for another 24 hr. The expression of fibrotic markers and integrin/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signals, including α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), fibronectin, integrin beta 1, ROCK 1/2, AMP-activated protein kinase, myosin light chain 1, and F-actin were determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) content was analysed using flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe microfilaments in HTMCs. It showed that metformin administration reduced the elevated IOP and alleviated the fibrotic activity of aqueous humour outflow in OHT models. Additionally, metformin rearranged the disordered cytoskeleton in the TM both in vivo and in vitro and significantly inhibited ROS production and activated integrin/ROCK signalling induced by tBHP in HTMCs. These results indicated that metformin reduced the elevated IOP in steroid-induced OHT mouse models and exerted its protective effects against oxidative injury by regulating cytoskeleton remodelling through the integrin/ROCK pathway. This study provides new insights into metformin use and preclinical evidence for the potential treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/82479">Improved ANAP incorporation and VCF analysis reveals details of P2X7 current facilitation and a limited conformational interplay between ATP binding and the intracellular ballast domain</a></h4>

              
                The large intracellular C-terminus of the pro-inflammatory P2X7 ion channel receptor (P2X7R) is associated with diverse P2X7R-specific functions. Cryo-EM structures of the closed and ATP-bound open full-length P2X7R recently identified a membrane-associated anchoring domain, an open-state stabilizing 'cap' domain, and a globular 'ballast domain' containing GTP/GDP and dinuclear Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites with unknown functions. To investigate protein dynamics during channel activation, we improved incorporation of the environment-sensitive fluorescent unnatural amino acid L-3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (ANAP) into <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocyte-expressed P2X7Rs and performed voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF). While we confirmed predicted conformational changes within the extracellular and the transmembrane domains, only three out of 41 mutants containing ANAP in the C-terminal domain resulted in ATP-induced fluorescence changes. We conclude that the ballast domain functions rather independently from the extracellular ATP binding domain and might require activation by additional ligands and/or protein interactions. Novel tools to study these are presented.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/77742">Mir155 regulates osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype via targeting S1pr1 gene</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNA-155 (miR155) is overexpressed in various inflammatory diseases and cancer, in which bone resorption and osteolysis are frequently observed. However, the role of miR155 on osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype is still unknown. Here, we report a low bone mass phenotype in the long bone of <i>Mir155</i>-Tg mice compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, <i>Mir155</i>-KO mice showed a high bone mass phenotype and protective effect against inflammation-induced bone loss. <i>Mir155</i>-KO mice showed robust bone regeneration in the ectopic and orthotopic model, but <i>Mir155</i>-Tg mice showed compromised bone regeneration compared with the wild-type mice. Similarly, the osteogenic differentiation potential of bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) from <i>Mir155</i>-KO mice was robust and <i>Mir155</i>-Tg was compromised compared with that of wild-type mice. Moreover, <i>Mir155</i> knockdown in BMSCs from wild-type mice showed higher osteogenic differentiation potential, supporting the results from <i>Mir155</i>-KO mice. TargetScan analysis predicted <i>S1pr1</i> as a target gene of <i>Mir155</i>, which was further confirmed by luciferase assay and <i>Mir155</i> knockdown. <i>S1pr1</i> overexpression in BMSCs robustly promoted osteogenic differentiation without affecting cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, osteoclastogenic differentiation of <i>Mir155</i>-Tg bone marrow-derived macrophages was inhibited compared with that of wild-type mice. Thus, <i>Mir155</i> showed a catabolic effect on osteogenesis and bone mass phenotype via interaction with the <i>S1pr1</i> gene, suggesting inhibition of <i>Mir155</i> as a potential strategy for bone regeneration and bone defect healing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84295">Dynamic metabolome profiling uncovers potential TOR signaling genes</a></h4>

              
                Although the genetic code of the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> was sequenced 25 years ago, the characterization of the roles of genes within it is far from complete. The lack of a complete mapping of functions to genes hampers systematic understanding of the biology of the cell. The advent of high-throughput metabolomics offers a unique approach to uncovering gene function with an attractive combination of cost, robustness, and breadth of applicability. Here, we used flow-injection time-of-flight mass spectrometry to dynamically profile the metabolome of 164 loss-of-function mutants in TOR and receptor or receptor-like genes under a time course of rapamycin treatment, generating a dataset with &gt;7000 metabolomics measurements. In order to provide a resource to the broader community, those data are made available for browsing through an interactive data visualization app hosted at <a href="https://rapamycin-yeast.ethz.ch">https://rapamycin-yeast.ethz.ch</a>. We demonstrate that dynamic metabolite responses to rapamycin are more informative than steady-state responses when recovering known regulators of TOR signaling, as well as identifying new ones. Deletion of a subset of the novel genes causes phenotypes and proteome responses to rapamycin that further implicate them in TOR signaling. We found that one of these genes, <i>CFF1,</i> was connected to the regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis through URA10. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for flagging novel potential TOR signaling-related genes and highlight the utility of dynamic perturbations when using functional metabolomics to deliver biological insight.

">Behavioral and Neuroanatomical Investigation of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Pathogenesis in Juvenile Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood, characterized by locomotor hyperactivity, impaired sustained attention, impulsivity, and distractibility. Recently, the dysfunction of different synaptic circuits in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been shown. Previous studies have attributed the pathophysiological mechanism of ADHD to disturbances in the dopaminergic system. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which are considered a validated animal model of ADHD, have altered dopaminergic innervation and increased locomotor activity. Here, we performed immunohistochemical tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) staining. The mesocortical dopaminergic system appears to be normal in juvenile SHR, as suggested by (i) no alteration in the area density of TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, (ii) no alterations in the volume density of TH-ir fibers in layer I of the PrL subregion of mPFC, (iii) no alteration in the percentage of TH-ir dopaminergic fibers in layer I of the PrL subregion of mPFC as revealed by TH and/or DBH immunoreactivity. Furthermore, the SHR showed increased locomotor activity than WKY in the open field test. The demonstration of no alteration in mesocortical dopaminergic neurons and fiber in SHR raises some concern about the position of SHR as an animal model of the inattentive subtype of ADHD. However, these results strengthen this strain as an animal model of hyperactive/impulsive subtype ADHD for future studies that may elucidate the underlying mechanism mediating hyperactivity and test various treatment strategies.

">MNK1 and MNK2 expression in the human dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Mitogen activated protein kinase interacting kinases (MNK) 1 and 2 are serine-threonine protein kinases that play an important role in translation of mRNAs through their phosphorylation of the RNA 5 prime-cap binding protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E. These kinases are downstream targets for mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular activity regulated protein kinase (ERK) and p38. MNKs have been implicated in the sensitization of peripheral nociceptors of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion (DRG and TG) using transgenic mouse lines and through the use of specific inhibitors of MNK1 and MNK2. While specific knockout of the Mknk1 gene suggests that it is the key isoform for regulation of nociceptor excitability and nociceptive behaviors in mice, both MKNK1 and MKNK2 genes are expressed in the DRG and TG of mice and humans based on RNA sequencing experiments. Single cell sequencing in mice suggests that Mknk1 and Mknk2 may be expressed in different populations of nociceptors. We sought to characterize mRNA expression in human DRG and TG for both MNK1 and MNK2. Our results show that both genes are expressed by nearly all neurons in both human ganglia with expression in other cell types as well. Our findings provide evidence that MNK1 and MNK2 are expressed by human nociceptors and suggest that efforts to pharmacologically target MNKs for pain would likely be translatable due its conserved expression in both species.

">Coordinated electrical and chemical signaling between two neurons orchestrates switching of motor states</a></h4>

              
                To survive in a complex environment, animals must respond to external cues, e.g., to escape threats or to navigate towards favorable locations. Navigating requires transition between motor states, e.g. switching from forward to backward movement. Here, we investigated how two classes of interneurons, RIS and RIM, fine-tune this transition in the nematode C. elegans. By Ca2+ imaging in freely moving animals, we found that RIS gets active slightly before RIM and likely biases decision-making towards a reversal. In animals lacking RIS, we observed lowered Ca2+-levels in RIM prior to a reversal. Combined photo-stimulation and voltage imaging revealed that FLP-11, a neuropeptide released by RIS, has an excitatory effect on RIM, while tyramine, released from RIM, inhibits RIS. Voltage imaging of intrinsic activity provided evidence for tight electrical coupling between RIS and RIM via gap junctions harboring UNC-7 innexins. Asymmetric junctional current flow was observed from RIS to RIM, and vice versa. We propose that the interplay of RIS and RIM is based on concerted electrical and chemical signaling, with a fast junctional current exchange early during the transition from forward to backward movement, followed by chemical signaling, likely during reversal execution.

                The fibrotic lesion formation is the main deterrent at regeneration of neurons in CNS injuries. In this paper we studied fibrotic scar formation in rat corticospinal tract lesion after one year survival time. The glial scar formation and Extracellular Matrix (ECM) fibronection derived scaffolds were investigated and the fore paw reaching task was performed during this period to see whether there is any regeneration of neurons along the lesion or not.

">Structural circuit plasticity by a neurotrophin with a Toll modifies dopamine-dependent behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Toll receptors are expressed in the distinct anatomical brain modules and can regulate structural brain plasticity in adult Drosophila. Structural plasticity in response to neuronal activity and experience could enable adaptation, and its deficit could underlie brain dysfunction and disease. Thus, a key goal is to understand how structural circuit changes modify behaviour. Subjective experience requires dopamine, a neuromodulator that controls arousal, motivation and locomotion, and assigns a value to stimuli. Toll-6 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons (DANs), raising the intriguing possibility that Toll-6 could regulate plasticity in dopaminergic circuits. Drosophila neurotrophin-2 (DNT-2) is the ligand for Toll-6, but it is unknown whether it is required for structural circuit plasticity. Here, we show that structural plasticity depends on the activity-dependent increase and activation of DNT-2, which in turn functions via its Toll-6 and kinase-less Trk-like Kek-6 receptors in DANs, modifying behaviour. DNT-2 expressing neurons are anatomically and functionally connected with DANs, and they modulate each other. Loss of DNT-2 or Toll-6 and kek-6 function caused DAN loss and synapse loss, and alterations in their levels compromised dendritic size and complexity and axonal targeting of analysed single neurons. Neuronal activity-dependent synapse formation required DNT-2, Toll-6 and Kek-6. Furthermore, structural plasticity in an associative, dopaminergic circuit modified dopamine-dependent behaviours, including locomotion and long-term memory. We conclude that an activity-dependent feedback loop involving dopamine and DNT-2 labelled the circuits engaged, and DNT-2 with Toll-6 and Kek-6 induced structural plasticity in this circuit, modifying behaviour.

">Altered hierarchical auditory predictive processing after lesions to the orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is classically linked to inhibitory control, emotion regulation and reward processing. Recent perspectives propose that the OFC also generates predictions about perceptual events, actions, and their outcomes. We tested the causal involvement of the OFC in detecting violations of prediction at two levels of abstraction (i.e., hierarchical predictive processing) by studying the event-related potentials (ERPs) of patients with focal OFC lesions (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 14) while they detected deviant sequences of tones in a Local-Global paradigm. The structural regularities of the tones were controlled at two hierarchical levels by rules defined at a local (i.e., between tones within sequences) and at a global (i.e., between sequences) level. In OFC patients, ERPs elicited by standard tones were unaffected at both local and global levels compared to controls. However, patients showed an attenuated mismatch negativity (MMN) to local prediction violation, as well as a diminished and delayed MMN/P3a complex to the combined local and global level prediction violation. Importantly, the subsequent P3b component to conditions involving violations of prediction at the level of global rules was preserved in the OFC group. The altered magnitudes and time courses of MMN/P3a responses after lesions to the OFC indicate fundamental impairments in detecting violation of auditory regularity at two hierarchical levels of stimuli abstraction.

">Distinct hypothalamus-habenula circuits govern risk preference</a></h4>

              
                Appropriate evaluation of risk is essential for survival in complex, uncertain environments. Confronted with choosing between a certain (safe) and an uncertain (risky) option, animals of various species show strong preferential traits which are stable across extended periods of time1-8. How such risk preference is encoded in the neural circuitry of the brain remains poorly understood. A candidate brain region is the lateral habenula (LHb), which has been shown to be prominently involved in various value-guided behaviors9-12. Here, using a balanced two-alternative choice task involving risk of loss, we find that neuronal activity in the LHb prior to action selection reflects risk preference and is governed by distinct inputs from hypothalamic subregions. Specifically, by employing multi-fiber photometry and targeted optogenetic perturbations, we identified glutamatergic LHb projections from both lateral and medial hypothalamus (LH/MH) that provide functionally distinct synaptic inputs to the LHb before action selection. Microendoscopic two-photon calcium imaging revealed risk-preference-selective LHb neurons that decreased their selectivity upon chemogenetic silencing of MH but not LH inputs. Finally, optogenetic stimulation of MH->LHb axons evoked both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses in LHb neurons (indicative of glutamate/GABA co-release for fine-tuned gain control13), whereas LH->LHb projections were purely excitatory. Our results thus reveal functionally distinct hypothalamus-habenula circuits that govern risk preference in situations of economic decision-making.

">Personalized alpha-tACS targeting left posterior parietal cortex modulates visuo-spatial attention and posterior evoked EEG activity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Covert visuo-spatial attention is marked by the anticipatory lateralization of neuronal alpha activity in the posterior parietal cortex. Previous applications of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at the alpha frequency, however, were inconclusive regarding the causal contribution of oscillatory activity during visuo-spatial attention. Objective: Attentional shifts of behavior and electroencephalography (EEG) after-effects were assessed in a cued visuo-spatial attention paradigm. We hypothesized that parietal alpha-tACS facilitates attention in the ipsilateral visual hemifield. Furthermore, we assumed that modulations of behavior and neurophysiology are related to individual electric field simulations. Methods: We applied personalized tACS at alpha and gamma frequencies to elucidate the role of oscillatory neuronal activity for visuo-spatial attention. Personalized tACS montages were algorithmically optimized to target individual left and right parietal regions that were defined by an EEG localizer. Results: Behavioral performance in the left hemifield was specifically increased by alpha-tACS compared to gamma-tACS targeting the left parietal cortex. This hemisphere-specific effect was observed despite the symmetry of simulated electric fields. In addition, visual event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes showed a reduced lateralization over posterior sites induced by left alpha-tACS. Neuronal sources of this effect were localized in the left premotor cortex. Interestingly, accuracy modulations induced by left parietal alpha-tACS were directly related to electric field magnitudes in the left premotor cortex. Conclusion: Overall, results corroborate the notion that alpha lateralization plays a causal role in covert visuo-spatial attention and indicate an increased susceptibility of parietal and premotor brain regions of the left dorsal attention network to subtle tACS-neuromodulation.

">Manipulating mitochondrial dynamics in the NTS prevents diet-induced deficits in brown fat morphology and activity</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potent thermogenic organ, activated by the central nervous system (CNS) through direct noradrenergic sympathetic innervation. Dysregulation of signalling modules in selective CNS areas such as the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS) are linked with altered BAT activity, obesity and diabetes. High-fat diet (HFD)-feeding increases mitochondrial fragmentation in the NTS triggering insulin resistance, hyperphagia and weight gain. Here we sought to determine whether changes in mitochondrial dynamics in the NTS can affect BAT activity. Methods: Eight-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats received DVC stereotactic surgery to facilitate brain infusion for local administration of viruses that express mutated Drp1 genes. PET/CT scans were used to measure BAT glucose uptake using. Biochemical assays and immunohistochemistry determined altered levels of key signalling molecules and neural innervation of BAT. Results: We show that short-term HFD-feeding decreases the ability of BAT to uptake glucose and decreases catecholaminergic innervation of BAT, observed by altered intensities and pools of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) labelling. HFD also increased the infiltration of enlarged white fat droplets in the BAT. We demonstrate that inhibiting mitochondrial fragmentation in NTS-astrocytes of HFD-fed rats can prevent the effects on BAT morphology and neural innervation, and increase BAT glucose uptake while lowering blood glucose and insulin levels. In regular chow-fed rats, increasing mitochondrial fragmentation in the NTS-astrocytes reduces BAT glucose uptake, TH and {beta}3-adrenergic receptor levels. Conclusions: Our data suggest that targeting mitochondrial dynamics in the NTS-astrocytes could be a beneficial strategy to increase energy expenditure and protect from developing obesity and diabetes.

">Cell-type-specific propagation of visual flicker</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic flicker stimulation has gained interest as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases and a method for frequency tagging neural activity in human EEG/MEG recordings. Yet, little is known about the way in which flicker-induced synchronization propagates across cortical levels and impacts different cell types. Here, we used Neuropixels to simultaneously record from LGN, V1, and CA1 while presenting visual flicker stimuli at different frequencies. LGN neurons showed strong phase locking up to 40Hz, whereas phase locking was substantially weaker in V1 units and absent in CA1 units. Laminar analyses revealed an attenuation of phase locking at 40Hz for each processing stage, with substantially weaker phase locking in the superficial layers of V1. Gamma-rhythmic flicker predominantly entrained fast-spiking interneurons. Optotagging experiments showed that these neurons correspond to either PV+ or narrow-waveform Sst+ neurons. A computational model could explain the observed differences in phase locking based on the neurons' capacitative low-pass filtering properties. In summary, the propagation of synchronized activity and its effect on distinct cell types strongly depend on its frequency.

">Deep brain stimulation and dopamine medication enhance free choice preference in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Human decisions are frequently explained as the balancing of potential rewards and punishments, such as food, money, or lost time. However, rational models of decision making based on this idea often fail to accurately predict human behavior. Humans and other animals appear to base decisions on value estimation that is often not clearly linked to extrinsic outcomes. For example, humans prefer to choose, even when doing so has no clear impact on impending rewards or punishments. Thus, choice opportunities may be intrinsically rewarding. There is limited evidence about the mechanisms underlying intrinsic rewards, and it is unclear how deficits in motivation for intrinsic rewards manifest themselves following impairment of brain networks involved in reward processing such as the dopaminergic and cortico-basal ganglia systems. Here we seek to understand how extrinsic and intrinsic rewards act together to guide decisions. We designed a decision-making task that separates the intrinsic value of free choice from the value of extrinsic rewards received for correct performance. We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying choice preference by asking Parkinson's disease patients to perform the task ON and OFF treatment. We tested two groups of patients to explore the effects of dopamine medication and potential modulation of wider cortical areas by deep brain stimulation. One group was treated with acute dopamine replacement therapy, and another group was treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. On average, patients ON dopaminergic treatment preferred to choose even when they risked losing extrinsic rewards (z=3.736, P=0.004). However, we found a significant interaction with the level of chronic levodopa therapy (z=2.643, P=0.008); patients with low doses of levodopa treatment in their daily lives did not prefer to choose (z=0.901, P=0.60), nor was this indifference modulated by acute levodopa administration (z=0.227, P=0.996). Deep brain stimulation patients were similarly indifferent to choice opportunities when OFF stimulation (z=-0.95, P=0.339). Like patients with low chronic levodopa treatment in the first group, all deep brain stimulation patients received low-dosage chronic levodopa treatment, which is one of the principal effects of this surgical intervention. Interestingly, in deep brain stimulation patients, choice preference could be re-established by subthalamic nucleus stimulation (z=3.07, P=0.011). This was associated with increased structural connectivity between subthalamic nucleus stimulation sites and the medial frontal cortex (including Brodmann areas 8, 9, and 32; P<0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons). In contrast to healthy humans who typically prefer choice, patients with the most severe dopamine depletion (advanced disease together with low chronic dopamine replacement therapy) did not prefer to choose. Our results suggests that higher levels of chronic dopamine medication or deep brain stimulation can increase motivation to seek choice opportunities. This is likely due to different mechanisms, with dopamine medication affecting sensitivity to all rewards and deep brain stimulation affecting impulsivity. These results advance our understanding of intrinsic reward and its interplay with general motivational processes associated with behavioral impairments observed in Parkinson's disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders involving the dopaminergic system.

">p38γMAPK delays myelination and remyelination and is abundant in multiple sclerosis lesions</a></h4>

              
                Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which disability results from the disruption of myelin and axons. During the initial stages of the disease, injured myelin is replaced by mature myelinating oligodendrocytes that differentiate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells. However, myelin repair fails in secondary and chronic progressive stages of the disease and with aging, as the environment becomes progressively more hostile. This may be attributable to inhibitory molecules in the multiple sclerosis environment including activation of the p38MAPK family of kinases. We explored oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and myelin repair using animals with conditional ablation of p38MAPKg from oligodendrocyte precursors. We found that p38{gamma}MAPK ablation accelerated oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and myelination. This resulted in an increase in both the total number of oligodendrocytes and the migration of progenitors ex vivo and faster remyelination in the cuprizone model of demyelination/remyelination. Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of myelination, p38{gamma}MAPK was significantly downregulated as oligodendrocyte precursor cells matured into oligodendrocytes. Notably, p38{gamma}MAPK was enriched in samples of leukocortical multiple sclerosis lesions from patients, which represent areas of failed remyelination. Our data suggest that p38{gamma} could be targeted to improve myelin repair in multiple sclerosis.

">Establishing a causal role for left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in value-directed memory encoding with high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation</a></h4>

              
                One critical approach for promoting the efficiency of memory is to adopt selective encoding strategies to prioritize more valuable information. Past neuroimaging studies have shown that value-directed modulation of verbal memory depends heavily on engagement of left-lateralized semantic processing regions, particularly in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). In the present study, we used high-definition direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to seek evidence for a causal role of left VLPFC in supporting the memory advantage for high-value items. Three groups of healthy young adult participants were presented with lists of words to remember, with each word accompanied by an arbitrarily assigned point value. During the first session, all participants received sham stimulation as they encoded five lists of 30 words each. Two of these lists were immediately tested with free recall, with feedback given to allow participants to develop metacognitive insight and strategies to maximize their point total. The second session had the exact same structure as the first, but the groups differed in whether they received continued sham stimulation (N=22) or anodal stimulation of the left VLPFC (N=21) or right VLPFC (N=20). Those lists not tested with immediate recall were tested with recognition judgments after a one-day delay. Since no brain stimulation was applied during this Day 2 test, any performance differences can be attributed to the effects of stimulation on Day 1 encoding processes. Anodal stimulation of left VLPFC significantly boosted participants' memory encoding selectivity. In comparison, no such effect was seen in participants who received right VLPFC or sham stimulation. Estimates of recollection- and familiarity-based responding revealed that left VLPFC stimulation specifically amplified the effects of item value on recollection. These results demonstrate a causal role for left VLPFC in the implementation of selective value-directed encoding strategies, putatively by boosting deep semantic processing of high-value words. Our findings also provide further evidence on the hemispheric lateralization of value-directed verbal memory encoding.

">Aging Decreases the Precision of Visual Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Working memory (WM) is a cognitive ability that enables us to hold information temporarily. As age increases during life, cognitive abilities such as WM performance decrease. Errors in WM tasks arise from different sources, such as decreasing precision and random response. In the current study, we investigated the effect of age on WM and elucidated sources of errors. Method: A total of 102 healthy individuals aged 18 to 71, participated in the study. A face-based visual WM task was designed and performed. Responses were collected using a graded scale in a delayed match-to-sample reproduction task. Results: The error of participants increased significantly as they aged. According to our analysis of the source of error, the standard deviation of error distribution increased considerably with age. However, there was no significant change in uniform probability with age. These observations were similar between male and female participants. Conclusion: We found that WM performance declines through the lifespan. Investigating the sources of error, we found that the precision of WM decreased with age. This decline was monotonous without any particular age at which a significant drop-off occurred. The results also indicated that the probability of guessing the response as a measure of random response is not affected by age.

">Paternal morphine exposure enhances morphine self-administration and induces region-specific neural adaptations in reward-related brain regions of male offspring</a></h4>

              
                Background: A growing body of preclinical studies report that preconceptional experiences can have a profound and long-lasting impact on adult offspring behavior and physiology. However, less is known about paternal drug exposure and its effects on reward sensitivity in the next generation. Methods: Adult male rats self-administered morphine for 65 days; controls received saline. Sires were bred to drug-naive dams to produce first-generation (F1) offspring. Morphine, cocaine, and nicotine self-administration were measured in adult F1 progeny. Molecular correlates of addiction-like behaviors were measured in reward-related brain regions of drug naive F1 offspring. Results: Male, but not female offspring produced by morphine-exposed sires exhibited dose-dependent increased morphine self-administration and increased motivation to earn morphine infusions under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. This phenotype was drug-specific as self-administration of cocaine, nicotine, and sucrose were not altered by paternal morphine history. The male offspring of morphine-exposed sires also had increased expression of mu-opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area but not in the nucleus accumbens. Conclusions: Paternal morphine exposure increased morphine addiction-like behavioral vulnerability in male but not female progeny. This phenotype is likely driven by long-lasting neural adaptations within the reward neural brain pathways.

">Modelling the stable subspace of distributed brain responses in stimulus processing</a></h4>

              
                Each brain response to a stimulus is, to a large extent, unique. However this variability, our perceptual experience feels stable. Standard decoding models, which utilise information across several areas to tap into stimuli distributed representations and processing, are fundamentally based on averages and, therefore, can focus precisely on the features that are most stable across stimulus presentations. But what are these stable features that may sustain stable perception across experiences is still poorly understood. This question is indeed difficult to address in the absence of a generative model of the signal. Here, I introduce genephys, a generative model of brain responses to stimulation that, when confronted with a decoding algorithm, can reproduce the structured patterns of decoding accuracy observed in real data. Using this approach, I characterise how these patterns can be brought about by the different aspects of the signal, which in turn may translate into distinct putative neural mechanisms. In particular, the model shows that the features in the data that support successful decoding -and, therefore, likely reflect stable mechanisms of stimulus representation- lie in a high-dimensional, multi-frequency space of phase resets and frequency entrainments, combined with an additive non-oscillatory response. At the individual trial level, still, responses are found to be highly variable, which can be due to various factors including phase noise and probabilistic activations.

">Adolescent stress impairs postpartum social behavior via anterior insula-prelimbic pathway</a></h4>

              
                Adolescent stress can be a risk factor for abnormal social behavior in the postpartum period, which critically affects the safety of mothers and children. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a newly established mouse model with optogenetics and in vivo calcium imaging, we found that adolescent psychosocial stress, combined with pregnancy and delivery, caused hypofunction of the glutamatergic pathway from the anterior insula to prelimbic cortex (AI-PrL pathway), which altered PrL neuronal activity, and in turn led to abnormal social behavior. Specifically, the AI-PrL pathway played a crucial role during recognizing the novelty of other mice by modulating ''stable neurons'' in PrL, which were constantly activated or inhibited by novel mice. We also observed that glucocorticoid receptor signaling in the AI-PrL pathway had a causal role in stress-induced postpartum changes. Our findings provide novel and functional insights into a cortico-cortical pathway underlying adolescent stress-induced postpartum social behavioral deficits.

">Representational geometry explains puzzling error distributions in behavioral tasks</a></h4>

              
                Measuring and interpreting errors in behavioral tasks is critical for understanding cognition. Conventional wisdom assumes that encoding/decoding errors for continuous variables in behavioral tasks should naturally have Gaussian distributions, so that deviations from normality in the empirical data indicate the presence of more complex sources of noise. This line of reasoning has been central for prior research on working memory. Here we re-assess this assumption, and find that even in ideal observer models with Gaussian encoding noise, the error distribution is generally non-Gaussian, contrary to the commonly held belief. Critically, we find that the shape of the error distribution is determined by the geometrical structure of the encoding manifold via a simple rule. In the case of a high-dimensional geometry, the error distributions naturally exhibit flat tails. Using this novel insight, we apply our theory to visual short-term memory tasks, and find that it can account for a large array of experimental data with only two free parameters. Our results call attention to the geometry of the representation as a critically important, yet underappreciated factor in determining the character of errors in human behavior.

">Tool-sensed object information effectively supports vision for multisensory grasping</a></h4>

              
                Tools enable humans to extend their sensing abilities beyond the natural limits of their hands, allowing them to sense objects as if they were using their hands directly. The similarities between tool-mediated and hand-based sensing entail the existence of comparable processes for integrating tool- and hand-sensed information with vision, raising the intriguing question of whether tools can support vision in bimanual object manipulations. Here we investigated this question by measuring participants' performance while reaching for and grasping objects either held with a tool or with their hand. We found that tool-mediated sensing effectively supports vision in multisensory grasping. Even more intriguingly, tool-mediated sensing resembled hand-based sensing. In addition, by manipulating the object features (availability of position and size versus position only), we found that both tool- and hand-mediated action performance was not hindered by the absence of size information. Thus, integrating the tool-sensed position of the object with its vision is sufficient to promote a multisensory advantage in grasping. In sum, our findings indicate that multisensory integration mechanisms significantly improve grasping actions, fine-tuning contralateral hand movements even when object information is only indirectly sensed through the hand operating a tool.

">Drifting representation with transient resets characterizes sensorimotor transformation in the monkey superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                To produce goal-directed eye movements known as saccades, we must channel sensory input from our environment through a process known as sensorimotor transformation. The behavioral output of this phenomenon (an accurate eye movement) is straightforward, but the coordinated activity of neurons underlying it is not well understood. We searched for a neural correlate of sensorimotor transformation in the activity patterns of simultaneously recorded neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) of rhesus monkeys performing a standard delayed saccade task. Neurons in its intermediate layers produce a burst of spikes both following the appearance of a visual (sensory) stimulus and preceding an eye movement command, but many also exhibit a sustained activity level during the intervening time ("delay period"). Each session's population activity was summarized in a low-dimensional framework and assessed on a scale of visual- to motor-like throughout the delay period using a novel measure we call the Visuomotor Proximity Index (VMPI). On average, population activity slowly evolved from a more visual- to a more motor-like pattern throughout the delay period, but microsaccade perturbations transiently deviated it to a visual-like pattern. A correlation was also found between the VMPI and single trial saccadic reaction time, even hundreds of milliseconds before the cue to initiate a movement. Therefore, we conclude that SC population activity contains a neural signature of the sensorimotor transformation process, systematically drifting toward a motor-like representation and intermittently reverting to a visual-like representation following a microsaccade.

	<p>(1) Background: Although cognitive impairments in coma survivors are common, methods of measuring long-term cognitive outcomes in this population are inconsistent, precluding the development of a strong evidence-base to support clinical decision making. In this literature review, we identify and characterize the measures used to track cognitive recovery in coma survivors to data. (2) Methods: We extracted the instrument used for cognitive assessment, the cognitive domains assessed, methods administration and scoring, and timing of assessment from 134 of 996 screened records. (3) Results: A total of 133 unique cognitive tests and cognitive testing batteries were identified, with 97 cognitive instruments used in less than three articles. The instruments assessed 20 different cognitive domains, with 73 articles also using tests that assess general &amp;amp;ldquo;cognitive ability&amp;amp;rdquo;. Cognitive instruments ranged from subjective assessments to comprehensive cognitive batteries. There were inconsistent points of reference for the timing of assessment across studies, with few studies repeating assessments at more than one time point, and arbitrary time intervals between tests. (4) Conclusions: Overall, this review illustrates the enormous disparity between studies that track cognitive outcome in coma survivors, and the need for a systematic, patient-accessible method of assessing cognitive functioning in future studies with this population.</p>

	<p>Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have an elevated risk of suicidality. The same has been found for people within the penitentiary system, suggesting a cumulative effect for offender patients suffering from SSD. While there appear to be overlapping characteristics, there is little research on factors distinguishing between offenders and non-offenders with SSD regarding suicidality. Our study therefore aimed at evaluating distinguishing such factors through the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms on a dataset of 232 offenders and 167 non-offender patients with SSD and history of suicidality. With an AUC of 0.81, Na&amp;amp;iuml;ve Bayes outperformed all other ML algorithms. The following factors emerged as most powerful in their interplay in distinguishing between offender and non-offender patients with a history of suicidality: Prior outpatient psychiatric treatment, regular intake of antipsychotic medication, global cognitive deficit, a prescription of antidepressants during the referenced hospitalisation and higher levels of anxiety and a lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation measured by an adapted positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Interestingly, neither aggression nor overall psychopathology emerged as distinguishers between the two groups. The present findings contribute to a better understanding of suicidality in offender and non-offender patients with SSD and their differing characteristics.</p>

	<p>Background: ACDF has become one of the established procedures for the surgical treatment of symptomatic cervical spondylosis, showing excellent clinical results and effective improvements in neural functions and neck pain relief. The main purpose of ACDF is neural decompression, and it is considered by some authors as an indirect result of the intervertebral distraction and cage insertion and the consequent restoration of the disc space and foramen height. Methods: Radiological data from 28 patients who underwent single-level ACDF were retrospectively collected and evaluated. For neural foramen evaluation, antero-posterior (A-P) and cranio-caudal (C-C) diameters were manually calculated; for intervertebral disc height the anterior, centrum and posterior measurement were calculated. All measurements were performed at surgical and adjacent (above and below) segments. NRS, NDI and also the mJOA and Nurick scale were collected for clinical examination and complete evaluation of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; postoperative outcome. Results: The intervertebral disc height in all its measurements, in addition to the height (C-C diameter) of the foramen (both right and left) increase at the surgical segment when comparing pre and postop results (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, and p = 0.033 and p = 0.001). NRS and NDI radiculopathy scores showed improved results from pre- to post-op evaluation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and a negative statistical correlation with the improved disc height at the surgical level. Conclusions: The restoration of posterior disc height through cage insertion appears to be effective in increasing foraminal height in patients with symptomatic preoperative cervical foraminal stenosis.</p>

	<p>Gestures and speech, as linked communicative expressions, form an integrated system. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have suggested that neural networks for gesture and spoken word production share similar brain regions consisting of fronto-temporo-parietal brain regions. However, information flow within the neural network may dynamically change during the planning of two communicative expressions and also differ between them. To investigate dynamic information flow in the neural network during the planning of gesture and spoken word generation in this study, participants were presented with spatial images and were required to plan the generation of gestures or spoken words to represent the same spatial situations. The evoked potentials in response to spatial images were recorded to analyze the effective connectivity within the neural network. An independent component analysis of the evoked potentials indicated 12 clusters of independent components, the dipoles of which were located in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal brain regions and on the medial wall of the frontal and parietal lobes. Comparison of effective connectivity indicated that information flow from the right middle cingulate gyrus (MCG) to the left supplementary motor area (SMA) and from the left SMA to the left precentral area increased during gesture planning compared with that of word planning. Furthermore, information flow from the right MCG to the left superior frontal gyrus also increased during gesture planning compared with that of word planning. These results suggest that information flow to the brain regions for hand praxis is more strongly activated during gesture planning than during word planning.</p>

	<p>Eating disorders (EDs) are psychiatric disorders with a neurobiological basis. ED-specific neuropsychological and brain characteristics have been identified, but often in individuals in the acute phase or recovered from EDs, precluding an understanding of whether they are correlates and scars of EDs vs. predisposing factors. Although familial high-risk (FHR) studies are available across other disorders, this study design has not been used in EDs. We carried out the first FMH study in EDs, investigating healthy offspring of women with EDs and controls. We preliminarily aimed to investigate ED-related neurocognitive and brain markers that could point to predisposing factors for ED. Sixteen girls at FHR for EDs and twenty control girls (age range: 8&amp;amp;ndash;15), completed neuropsychological tests assessing executive functions. Girls also underwent a resting-state fMRI scan to quantify functional connectivity (FC) within resting-state networks. Girls at FHR for EDs performed worse on a cognitive flexibility task compared with controls (F = 5.53, p = 0.02). Moreover, they showed different FC compared with controls in several resting-state networks (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 FDR-corrected). Differences identified in cognitive flexibility and in FC are in line with those identified in individuals with EDs, strongly pointing to a role as potential endophenotypes of EDs.</p>

	<p>We would like to congratulate Sachdeva and colleagues for establishing an informative review regarding the effects of music/sound exposure on blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier permeability and meningeal lymphatic/glymphatic clearance, and would appreciate the opportunity to make a comment. The review by Sachdeva and colleagues documents the beneficial effects of sound interventions on blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier permeability and the activity of the meningeal lymphatic/glymphatic system. The authors further note that sound interventions may have the potential to reduce the accumulation of amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; within the brain in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease through improved meningeal lymphatic/glymphatic clearance. The authors also nicely discuss evidence that music influences sleep quality, which may facilitate glymphatic solute clearance as a result of an increase in the interstitial space, which results in reduced resistance to fluid transport. We fully agree with this notion, since we recently hypothesized that immersive sound therapy may be an innovative approach to reduce the individual risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, by inducing EEG slow-wave delta oscillations (which characterize deep sleep), thereby promoting glymphatic clearance.</p>

                Background: Occurrence of right atrial masses, especially in patients with history of cardiac surgery, is rare. Differential diagnosis between malignant and non-malignant aetiologies might be cumbersome, and surgery is often required to prevent complications or disease evolution. Case: We report the case of a 16-year-old girl from a rural area of Sudan, who underwent surgery for a modified De Vega’s tricuspid annuloplasty, and mitral and aortic valve replacement with mechanical prostheses. The patient was on regular follow-up but demonstrated a poor compliance to anticoagulation therapy with a time in therapeutic range between 52% and 20%. She remained asymptomatic, but a right atrial mass was diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography during a follow-up visit 41 months after the first operation. Surgical removal of the mass revealed an organized thrombus arising from the point where the Prolene stitches for the tricuspid annuloplasty were previously passed. The patient recovered from surgery, was discharged home on post-operative day 10 and the first follow-up visit at 30 days after discharge confirmed a good clinical status and a normal transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Conclusions: This case report describes the diagnostic and therapeutic work-out of a thrombus formation on the suture lines of a tricuspid annuloplasty. Moreover, it highlights the importance of a strict and long follow-up after valvular surgery and of the adherence to anticoagulation therapy, especially for patients living in rural areas of developing countries.

                Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening disease, and animal models of sepsis are minimal. This study aims to find the optimal dose to make a sepsis mouse model by examining the presence of target organ damage. Methods: This study used 30 mice divided into four groups. The control group injected 0.5 cc NaCl 0.9% intraperitoneally (i.p.). Group A was injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) 0.25 mg/kg B.W. i.p. given on the first and second day, group B was injected with LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. i.p. given on the first and second days, and group C was injected by LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. single dose i.p. Each group was terminated on the third, fourth, and fifth days. Results: NF-κB, C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), NF-κB examinations, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in all treatment groups increased when compared with the control. The highest degree of histopathological features of the kidneys and liver and the results of immunohistochemistry examinations on the liver and kidneys were shown in group C. Conclusions: Inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-α, NF-κB, and expression of NF-κB in liver and kidneys) and characteristics of organ damage (ALT, liver, and kidneys histopathology scores) increase on day 3. The highest increase was in the group administered with LPS 0.3 mg/kg B.W. single dose.

                This dataset presents data collected to assess teaching and learning of quantum physics at the University of Rwanda - College of Education (UR-CE), Rwanda. Data were collected between August and November 2019 as the baseline, and between January and April 2022 under a quasi-experimental design. Three sets of data were collected. The first set was about students' performance and conceptual understanding collected before and after teaching intervention (lecture method or multimedia-aided approach) using mainly Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey (QPCS). The second set documented classroom practices during teaching and learning using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS). The last set is comprised of the data related to lecturers' and students' perceptions before teaching and learning quantum physics and students' attitudes after learning Quantum physics. The Quantum Physics Attitude Test (QPAT) was mainly used to collect these data. The dataset is important to education stakeholders because university managers can visualize the status of teaching and learning outcomes, lecturers can reflect on the study, and researchers can use the data to analyze various independent variables.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-997/v2?src=rss">The patent landscape in the field of stem cell therapy: closing the gap between research and clinic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell technology is a powerful tool ready to respond to the needs of modern medicine that is experiencing rapid technological development. Given its potential in therapeutic applications, intellectual property rights (IPR) as a protection resource of knowledge are a relevant topic. Patent eligibility of stem cells has been controversial as restrictions to access the fundamental technologies open a gap between research and clinic. Therefore, we depicted the current patent landscape in the field to discuss if this approach moves forward in closing this breach by examining patent activity over the last decade from a transdisciplinary perspective. Stem cell therapeutic applications is an area of continuous growth where patent filing through the PCT is the preferred strategy. Patenting activity is concentrated in the USA, European Union, and Australia; this accumulation in a few key players leads to governance, regulation, and inequality concerns. To boost wealthiness and welfare in society - stem cell therapies' ultimate goal - while at post-pandemic recovery, critical elements in the field of IPR rise to overcome current limitations: to promote bridge builders able to connect the research and business worlds, regulatory updates, novel financing models, new vehicles (startups, spinouts, and spin-offs), and alternative figures of intellectual property.

                Background: Increasing dietary supplement (DS) consumption was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including during the post-Delta wave period. This study aimed to measure the practice of DS consumption and respondents’ knowledge of DS. Methods: An internet-based survey was distributed from October-December 2021 and obtained 541 valid and completed responses. Descriptive analysis was performed to present the practice of DS consumption, including frequency, duration, aim, preferable dosage form etc. Level of knowledge on DS principles, side effects and regulation were also measured. Inferential analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of the respondents’ DS practice and level of knowledge. Results: Data from 541 valid responses showed that 77.63% of respondents consumed DS in the last 3 months, with only 59.52% reporting also consuming DS before the COVID-19 pandemic. One half of the respondents had good knowledge about DS; however, some knowledge regarding side effects and possible drug-supplement interaction needed improvement. Their DS consumption practice was affected by their economic status and history of contracting COVID-19. Nevertheless, the level of knowledge was not affected by the sociodemographic factors and DS supplement experience. Conclusions: Taken together, the practice of self-consumption of DS in Indonesia is increasing; hence, knowledge of DS is necessary to avoid detrimental effects that might occur in the future. Increasing access to information on better labelling and educating consumers about DS are important actions to consider.

At a time when effective tools for monitoring malaria control and eradication efforts are crucial, the increasing availability of molecular data motivates their application to epidemiology. The multiplicity of infection (MOI), defined as the number of genetically distinct parasite strains co-infecting a host, is one key epidemiological parameter for evaluating malaria interventions. Estimating MOI remains a challenge for high-transmission settings where individuals typically carry multiple co-occurring infections. Several quantitative approaches have been developed to estimate MOI, including two cost-effective ones relying on molecular data: i) THE REAL McCOIL method is based on putatively neutral single nucleotide polymorphism loci, and ii) the <i>var</i>coding method is a fingerprinting approach that relies on the diversity and limited repertoire overlap of the <i>var</i> multigene family encoding the major <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> blood-stage antigen PfEMP1 and is therefore under selection. In this study, we assess the robustness of the MOI estimates generated with these two approaches by simulating <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> malaria dynamics under three transmission conditions using an extension of a previously developed stochastic agent-based model. We demonstrate that these approaches are complementary and best considered across distinct transmission intensities. While <i>var</i>coding can underestimate MOI, it allows robust estimation, especially under high-transmission where repertoire overlap is extremely limited from frequency-dependent selection. In contrast, THE REAL McCOIL often considerably overestimates MOI, but still provides reasonable estimates for low- and moderate-transmission. Regardless of transmission intensity, results for THE REAL McCOIL indicate that an inaccurate tail at high MOI values is generated, and that at high transmission, an apparently reasonable estimated MOI distribution can arise from some degree of compensation between overestimation and underestimation. As many countries pursue malaria elimination targets, defining the most suitable approach to estimate MOI based on sample size and local transmission intensity is highly recommended for monitoring the impact of intervention programs.

Dynamical models in the form of systems of ordinary differential equations have become a standard tool in systems biology. Many parameters of such models are usually unknown and have to be inferred from experimental data. Gradient-based optimization has proven to be effective for parameter estimation. However, computing gradients becomes increasingly costly for larger models, which are required for capturing the complex interactions of multiple biochemical pathways. Adjoint sensitivity analysis has been pivotal for working with such large models, but methods tailored for steady-state data are currently not available. We propose a new adjoint method for computing gradients, which is applicable if the experimental data include steady-state measurements. The method is based on a reformulation of the backward integration problem to a system of linear algebraic equations. The evaluation of the proposed method using real-world problems shows a speedup of total simulation time by a factor of up to 4.4. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a substantial improvement in computation time, in particular for large-scale models, where computational efficiency is critical.

Background <p>Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) typically results from transmission of a small and genetically uniform viral population. Following transmission, the virus population becomes more diverse because of recombination and acquired mutations through genetic drift and selection. Viral intrahost genetic diversity remains a major obstacle to the cure the HIV; however, the association between intrahost diversity and disease progression markers has not been investigated in large and diverse cohorts for which the majority of the genome has been deep-sequenced. Viral load (VL) is a key progression marker and understanding of its relationship to viral intrahost genetic diversity could help design future strategies for HIV monitoring and treatment.</p> Methods <p>We analysed deep-sequenced viral genomes from 2,650 treatment-naive HIV-infected persons to measure the intrahost genetic diversity of 2,447 genomic codon positions as calculated by Shannon entropy. We tested for associations between VL and amino acid (AA) entropy accounting for sex, age, race, duration of infection, and HIV population structure.</p> Results <p>We confirmed that the intrahost genetic diversity is highest in the <i>env</i> gene. Furthermore, we showed that mean Shannon entropy is significantly associated with VL, especially in infections of >24 months duration. We identified 16 significant associations between VL (p-value<2.0x10<sup>-5</sup>) and Shannon entropy at AA positions which in our association analysis explained 13% of the variance in VL. Finally, equivalent analysis based on variation in HIV consensus sequences explained only 2% of VL variance.</p> Conclusions <p>Our results elucidate that viral intrahost genetic diversity is associated with VL and could be used as a better disease progression marker than HIV consensus sequence variants, especially in infections of longer duration. We emphasize that viral intrahost diversity should be considered when studying viral genomes and infection outcomes.</p> Trial registration <p>Samples included in this study were derived from participants who consented in the clinical trial, START (NCT00867048) (23), run by the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT).

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dynamic interactions between the subregions of the hippocampus are required for the encoding and consolidation of memory. While the interplay and contributions of the CA1 and CA3 regions are well understood, we continue to learn more about how CA2 differentially contributes to the organization of network function. For example, CA2 place cells have been reported to be less spatially tuned during exploration, but uniquely capable of coding place while an animal stops. Here we applied chemogenetics to transiently silence CA2 pyramidal cells and found that CA2 influences hippocampal dynamics in a state-dependent manner. We find that during rest, CA2 inhibition reduces synchronization across regions (CA1, CA2, CA3) and frequency bands (low-gamma- and ripple-band). Moreover, during new learning CA1 place field formation is slower in the absence of CA2 transmission and during pausing, CA1 pyramidal cells are less excitable without CA2 drive. On the network level, a novel convolutional neural network (SpikeDecoder) was employed to show subregion and state-dependent changes in spatial coding that agree with our observations on the single cell level. Together these data suggest additional novel roles for CA2 in governing and differentiating hippocampal dynamics under discrete behavioral states.</p>

                Background: Young people with mental illness should be offered evidence-based treatments. In 2018, we developed a national evidence portal in Norway providing mental health professionals and others with living evidence summaries. This immense work has been an important contribution to mental health care in Norway but is also a rich data source for exploring the characteristics and evidence gaps of the existing research internationally. At the time of this study, eight overviews of systematic reviews (OoOs) had been published. These addressed treatments for attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), self-harm and trauma/ post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study was to do a secondary analysis of this evidence to describe the state-of-the art in this field, and to map: treatments evaluated for each patient group and the longest time of follow-up treatment comparisons evaluated for more than one patient group Methods: We performed a mapping review of the eight OoOs. Data extraction was performed by one author and double-checked by another. All data was entered into Excel. Findings were visualized in descriptive tables and using Sunburst-diagrams. We used statistical thresholds to determine the size of effect and report the associated certainty. Results: We identified 200 treatment comparisons including a wide variety of interventions. Some mental illnesses are treated mostly with pharmacological or combination therapies and others solely with psychological or psychosocial treatments or with more diversity. The evidence supporting most treatments is of low to very low certainty. Ten percent of the comparisons included follow-up assessments beyond 12 months. Cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectic behavioural therapy, physical activity and mindfulness interventions were effective across populations. Conclusions: The evidence supporting treatment of mental illness in young people has important limitations. Future research efforts should address these evidence gaps.

                Background: The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene is a reporter gene that can be used to optimize protein isolation procedures and the functional working of a transduction protein. EGFP, with the addition of eleven arginine residues, has been engineered to functionally improve the protein transduction process, which can later be used for cell reprogramming like induced pluripotent stem cells. The addition of six histidine amino acid residues at its C-terminal is intended for the protein isolation process using the His-tag antibody. Methods: The study aimed to investigate the optimization of the EGFP polyarginine protein expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in sufficient quantities for the protein isolation stage. This study also analyzed EGFP expression without polyarginine to analyze the polyarginine addition effect on expression processes. Protein expression was qualitatively measured by looking at expression fluorescence and protein levels of EGFP and EGFP - PolyR proteins. Results: Bands on Western Blots with 6×His-tag monoclonal antibody (primary antibody) and Goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (secondary antibody) showed the EGFP polyarginine and EGFP proteins were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1 at relatively low levels. The lyticase incubation time modification and administration of 3-5 kDa microfilter to concentrate increased the yield of isolated protein. Conclusions: The sufficient amount of protein isolation in S. cerevisiae can be achieved by using lyticase and sonicators combination for the lysis process.

     alt="Neurodegeneration in a novel invertebrate model system: Failed microtubule-mediated cell adhesion and unraveling of macroglia"/>
<p>Early stages of neurodegeneration in the spider, <i>Cupiennius salei</i>, show unraveling of macroglia around neurons, which is likely due to the catastrophic failure of microtubule-associated desmosomes. This unraveling is followed by the depletion of neuronal cytoplasmic content into the unraveling macroglia, inducing cell death of both neurons and glia cells.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are among the main causes of death in the United States, leading to irreversible disintegration of neurons. Despite intense international research efforts, cellular mechanisms that initiate neurodegeneration remain elusive, thus inhibiting the development of effective preventative and early onset medical treatment. To identify underlying cellular mechanisms that initiate neuron degeneration, it is critical to identify histological and cellular hallmarks that can be linked to underlying biochemical processes. Due to the poor tissue preservation of degenerating mammalian brain tissue, our knowledge regarding histopathological hallmarks of early to late degenerative stages is only fragmentary. Here, we introduce a novel model organism to study histological hallmarks of neurodegeneration, the spider <i>Cupiennius salei</i>. We utilized toluidine blue-stained 0.9-μm serial semithin and 50-nm ultrathin sections of young and old spider nervous tissue. Our findings suggest that the initial stages of neurodegeneration in spiders may be triggered by (1) dissociation of neuron- and glia-derived microtubules, and (2) the weakening of microtubule-associated desmosomal junctions that lead to the unraveling of neuron-insulating macroglia, compromising the structural integrity of affected neurons. The involvement of macroglia in the disposal of neuronal debris described here—although different in the proposed transport mechanisms—shows resemblance to the mammalian glymphatic system. We propose that this model system is highly suitable to investigate invertebrate neurodegenerative processes from early onset to scar formation and that this knowledge may be useful for the study of neurodegeneration in mammalian tissue.</p>

                Cephalopods are set apart from other mollusks by their advanced behavioral abilities and by the complexity of their nervous systems. Because of the great evolutionary distance that separates vertebrates from cephalopods, it is evident that higher cognitive features have evolved separately in these clades despite the similarities that they share. Alongside their complex behavioral abilities, cephalopods have evolved specialized cells and tissues, such as the chromatophores for camouflage or suckers to grasp prey. Despite significant progress in genome and transcriptome sequencing, the molecular identities of cell types in cephalopods remain largely unknown. We here combine single-cell transcriptomics with <i>in situ</i> gene expression analysis to uncover cell type diversity in the European squid <i>Loligo vulgaris</i>. We describe cell types that are conserved with other phyla such as neurons, muscles, or connective tissues but also cephalopod-specific cells, such as chromatophores or sucker cells. Moreover, we investigate major components of the squid nervous system including progenitor and developing cells, differentiated cells of the brain and optic lobes as well as sensory systems of the head. Our study provides a molecular assessment for conserved and novel cell types in cephalopods and a framework for mapping the nervous system of <i>L. vulgaris</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81892">Antisense oligonucleotide therapy rescues disturbed brain rhythms and sleep in juvenile and adult mouse models of Angelman syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <i>UBE3A</i> encodes ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, and in neurons its expression from the paternal allele is repressed by the <i>UBE3A</i> antisense transcript (<i>UBE3A-ATS</i>). This leaves neurons susceptible to loss-of-function of maternal <i>UBE3A</i>. Indeed, Angelman syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by maternal <i>UBE3A</i> deficiency. A promising therapeutic approach to treating Angelman syndrome is to reactivate the intact paternal <i>UBE3A</i> by suppressing <i>UBE3A-ATS</i>. Prior studies show that many neurological phenotypes of maternal <i>Ube3a</i> knockout mice can only be rescued by reinstating <i>Ube3a</i> expression in early development, indicating a restricted therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome. Here we report that reducing <i>Ube3a-ATS</i> by antisense oligonucleotides in juvenile or adult maternal <i>Ube3a</i> knockout mice rescues the abnormal electroencephalogram rhythms and sleep disturbance, two prominent clinical features of Angelman syndrome. Importantly, the degree of phenotypic improvement correlates with the increase of Ube3a protein levels. These results indicate that the therapeutic window of genetic therapies for Angelman syndrome is broader than previously thought, and electroencephalogram power spectrum and sleep architecture should be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81154">The meningeal transcriptional response to traumatic brain injury and aging</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that the meningeal compartment plays instrumental roles in various neurological disorders, however, we still lack fundamental knowledge about meningeal biology. Here, we utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques to investigate the transcriptional response of the meninges to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and aging in the sub-acute and chronic time frames. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we first explored how mild TBI affects the cellular and transcriptional landscape in the meninges in young mice at one-week post-injury. Then, using bulk RNA-seq, we assessed the differential long-term outcomes between young and aged mice following TBI. In our scRNA-seq studies, we highlight injury-related changes in differential gene expression seen in major meningeal cell populations including macrophages, fibroblasts, and adaptive immune cells. We found that TBI leads to an upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) signature genes in macrophages and a controlled upregulation of inflammatory-related genes in the fibroblast and adaptive immune cell populations. For reasons that remain poorly understood, even mild injuries in the elderly can lead to cognitive decline and devastating neuropathology. To better understand the differential outcomes between the young and the elderly following brain injury, we performed bulk RNA-seq on young and aged meninges 1.5 months after TBI. Notably, we found that aging alone induced upregulation of meningeal genes involved in antibody production by B cells and type I IFN signaling. Following injury, the meningeal transcriptome had largely returned to its pre-injury signature in young mice. In stark contrast, aged TBI mice still exhibited upregulation of immune-related genes and downregulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Overall, these findings illustrate the dynamic transcriptional response of the meninges to mild head trauma in youth and aging.

">Stepwise molecular specification of excitatory synapse diversity on a target neuron</a></h4>

              
                Brain function relies on the generation of a large variety of morphologically and functionally diverse, but specific, neuronal synapses. Here, we show that, initially, synapse formation on a common target neuron, the cerebellar Purkinje cells, involves a presynaptic secreted protein common for all types of excitatory inputs. The molecular program then evolves only in one of the inputs with the additional expression of a combination of presynaptic secreted proteins that specify the mature pattern of connectivity on the target. These results show that some inputs actively and gradually specify their synaptic molecular identity while others rely on the "original code". Thus, the molecular specification of excitatory synapses, crucial for proper circuit function, is acquired in a stepwise manner during mouse postnatal development and obeys input-specific rules.

">Hypersensitivity to distractors in Fragile X syndrome from loss of modulation of cortical VIP interneurons.</a></h4>

              
                Attention deficit is one of the most prominent and disabling symptoms in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli contributes to attention difficulties by overwhelming and/or distracting affected individuals, which disrupts activities of daily living at home and learning at school. We find that auditory or visual distractors selectively impair visual discrimination performance in both humans and mice with FXS, but not their typically developing controls. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons were significantly modulated by incorrect responses in the post-stimulus period during early distractor trials in WT mice, consistent with their known role as  error signals. Strikingly, however, VIP cells from Fmr1-/- mice showed little modulation in error trials, and this correlated with their poor performance on the distractor task. Thus, VIP interneurons and their reduced modulatory influence on pyramidal cells, could be a potential therapeutic target for attentional difficulties in FXS.

">Decoding the relative contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms in mediating heterogeneous spiking activities of sensory neurons in vivo using computational modeling</a></h4>

              
                Neurons ubiquitously display heterogeneities in spiking activity even within a given cell type. To date, the relative contributions of extrinsic mechanisms (e.g., synaptic bombardment) and intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., conductances, cell morphology) towards determining spiking activity remain poorly understood. Here we address this important question using a novel approach that combines biophysical techniques, in which extracellular in vivo recordings of electrosensory pyramidal cells within weakly electric fish, are combined with computational modeling. Specifically, by varying parameters, a conductance-based computational model successfully reproduced the highly heterogeneous spiking activities seen experimentally. Model parameters that varied the most were then used to gauge the relative contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic mechanisms. Overall, extrinsic synaptic input was predicted to be the main factor accounting for spiking heterogeneities. We tested this prediction experimentally by performing two different manipulations: i) pharmacologically inactivating feedback; ii) applying the neuromodulator serotonin. Our model predicted that feedback inactivation should reduce while serotonin application should increase spiking heterogeneities. Experiments corroborated these predictions. Importantly, for serotonin application, increased heterogeneity occurred despite a strong reduction in intrinsic membrane conductance, further demonstrating that extrinsic synaptic input is the primary determinant of spiking heterogeneities in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that devising a computational model to capture spiking heterogeneities in vivo and assessing which parameters are responsible can successfully determine the relative contributions of extrinsic vs. intrinsic inputs. We expect this approach to be generalizable to other systems and species.

">An original potentiating mechanism revealed by the cryoEM structures of the human α7 nicotinic receptor in complex with nanobodies</a></h4>

              
                The human 7 nicotinic receptor is a pentameric channel mediating cellular and neuronal communication. It has attracted considerable interest to design ligands for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To develop a novel class of 7 ligands, we recently generated two nanobodies named E3 and C4 acting as positive and silent allosteric modulators respectively. Here, we solved the cryo-EM structures of the nanobody-receptor complexes. E3 and C4 bind to a common epitope involving two subunits at the apex of the receptor. They form by themselves a symmetric pentameric assembly that extends the extracellular domain. Unlike C4, the binding of E3 drives an active or desensitized conformation in the absence of orthosteric agonist, and mutational analysis shows a key contribution of a N-linked sugar moiety in mediating E3 potentiation. The nanobody E3, by remotely controlling the global allosteric conformation of the receptor, implements an original mechanism of regulation which opens new avenues for drug design.

">Mitochondrial genes in the 22q11.2 deleted region regulate neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation</a></h4>

              
                Microdeletion of a 3Mbp region encompassing 45 protein-coding genes at chromosome 22q11.2 (22q11.2DS) predisposes to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and is one of the greatest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Defective mitochondrial function has been hypothesized to contribute to 22q11.2DS pathogenesis; however, which of the six mitochondrial genes contribute to neurodevelopmental phenotypes and their underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. To systematically test 22q11.2DS genes for functional roles in neurodevelopment and behavior, we generated genetic mutants for each of the 37 conserved zebrafish orthologs and performed high throughput behavioral phenotyping using seven behavioral assays. Through this unbiased approach, we identified five single-gene mutants with partially overlapping behavioral phenotypes. Two of these genes, mrpl40 and prodha, encode for mitochondrial proteins and, similar to what we observed in mrpl40 and prodha mutants, pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial function during development results in microcephaly. Finally, we show that both mrpl40 and prodha mutants display neural stem and progenitor cell phenotypes, with each gene regulating different neural stem cell populations. Combined, our results demonstrate a critical role for mitochondrial function in neural stem and progenitor cell populations in the developing vertebrate brain and provide compelling evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment is linked to brain volume and behavioral phenotypes observed in models of 22q11.2DS.

">ErbB inhibition impairs cognition via disrupting myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                White matter abnormalities are an emerging feature of schizophrenia, yet the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Disruption of ErbB signaling that is essential for peripheral myelination has been genetically associated with schizophrenia and white matter lesions in schizophrenic patients. However, the roles of ErbB signaling in oligodendrocytes remain elusive. Here, we used a pan-ErbB inhibition strategy and demonstrated the synergistic functions of endogenous ErbB receptors in oligodendrocytes. Through analyses of the cellular, histological, biochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological differences in mice with manipulation of ErbB activities in oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages, we found that ErbB signaling regulates myelination and aerobic glycolysis in oligodendrocytes, and both functions are required for working memory. ErbB inhibition in oligodendrocytes at early differentiation stages induces hypomyelination by suppressing the differentiation of newly-formed oligodendrocytes. In contrast, ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes alters neither myelination nor oligodendrocyte numbers, but accelerates axonal conduction decline under energy stress. Mechanistically, mature oligodendrocytes with ErbB inhibition reduce the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A, failing to provide lactate to electrically active axons. Supplementation of L-lactate restores axonal conduction and working memory capacity that are suppressed by ErbB inhibition in mature oligodendrocytes. These findings reveal the indispensable roles of ErbB signaling in white matter integrity and function, and provide insights into the multifaceted contributions of white matter abnormalities to cognitive impairment.

">Generation of nanobodies acting as silent and positive allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</a></h4>

              
                The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a potential drug target for treating cognitive disorders, mediates communication between neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Although many competitive antagonists, agonists, and partial-agonists have been found and synthesized, they have not led to effective therapeutic treatments. In this context, small molecules acting as positive allosteric modulators binding outside the orthosteric, acetylcholine, site have attracted considerable interest. Two single-domain antibody fragments, C4 and E3, generated through alpaca immunization with cells expressing the extracellular domain of the human 7-nAChR, are herein described. They bind to the 7-nAChR but not to the other major nAChR subtypes, 4{beta}2 and 3{beta}4. E3 acts as a slowly associating type I positive allosteric modulator, strongly potentiating the acetylcholine-elicited currents, while not significantly altering the desensitization of the receptor. An E3-E3 bivalent construct shows similar potentiating properties but displays very slow dissociation kinetics conferring quasi-irreversible properties. Whereas, C4 does not alter the receptor function, but fully inhibits the E3-evoked potentiation, showing it is a silent allosteric modulator competing with E3 binding. Both nanobodies do not compete with -bungarotoxin, localizing at an allosteric extracellular binding site away from the orthosteric site. The functional differences of each nanobody, as well as the alteration of functional properties through nanobody modifications indicate the importance of this extracellular site. The nanobodies will be useful for pharmacological and structural investigations; moreover, they, along with the extracellular site, have a direct potential for clinical applications.
