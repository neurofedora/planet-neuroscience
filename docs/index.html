              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hemispheric Asymmetries of Individual Differences in Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state fMRI studies have revealed that individuals exhibit stable, functionally meaningful divergences in large-scale network organization. The strongest deviations (called network "variants") have a characteristic spatial distribution, with qualitative evidence from prior reports suggesting that this distribution differs across hemispheres. Hemispheric asymmetries can inform us on the developmental constraints of idiosyncratic regions. Here, we used data from the Human Connectome Project to systematically investigate hemispheric differences in network variants. Variants were significantly larger in the right hemisphere, particularly along the frontal operculum and medial frontal cortex. Variants in the left hemisphere were smaller but slightly more numerous, appearing most commonly around the temporoparietal junction. We investigated how variant asymmetries vary by functional network and how they compare with typical network distributions. For some networks, variants seemingly increase group-average network asymmetries (e.g., the language network is slightly bigger in the left hemisphere and variants appeared more frequently in the ipsilateral hemisphere). For other networks, variants counter the group-average network asymmetries (e.g., the default mode network is slightly bigger in the left hemisphere, but variants were more frequent in the right hemisphere). Intriguingly, left- and right-handers differed in their network variant asymmetries for the cinguloopercular and frontoparietal networks, suggesting that variant asymmetries are relevant to lateralized traits. These findings demonstrate that idiosyncratic aspects of brain organization differ systematically across the hemispheres. We discuss how these asymmetries in brain organization may inform us on developmental constraints of network variants, and how they may relate to functions differentially linked to the two hemispheres.

	<p>An increasing amount of research has examined the effects of bilingualism on performance in theory of mind (ToM) tasks. Bilinguals outperform monolinguals in ToM when comparing groups. However, it is unclear what aspects of the bilingual experience contribute to this effect in a dynamic construct like ToM. To date, bilingualism has been conceptualized as a dichotic skill that is distinct from monolingualism, obscuring nuances in the degree that different bilingual experience affects cognition. The current study used a combination of network science, cognitive, and linguistic behavioral measurements to explore the factors that influence perspective-taking ToM based on participants&amp;amp;rsquo; current and previous experience with language, as well as their family networks&amp;amp;rsquo; experience with language. The results suggest that some aspects of the bilingual experience predict task performance, but not others, and these predictors align with the two-system theory of ToM. Overall, the findings provide evidence for the extent to which individual differences in bilingualism are related to different cognitive outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Blind demixing methods for recovering dense neuronal morphology from barcode imaging data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shuonan Chen, Jackson Loper, Pengcheng Zhou, Liam Paninski</p>

Cellular barcoding methods offer the exciting possibility of ‘infinite-pseudocolor’ anatomical reconstruction—i.e., assigning each neuron its own random unique barcoded ‘pseudocolor,’ and then using these pseudocolors to trace the microanatomy of each neuron. Here we use simulations, based on densely-reconstructed electron microscopy microanatomy, with signal structure matched to real barcoding data, to quantify the feasibility of this procedure. We develop a new blind demixing approach to recover the barcodes that label each neuron, and validate this method on real data with known barcodes. We also develop a neural network which uses the recovered barcodes to reconstruct the neuronal morphology from the observed fluorescence imaging data, ‘connecting the dots’ between discontiguous barcode amplicon signals. We find that accurate recovery should be feasible, provided that the barcode signal density is sufficiently high. This study suggests the possibility of mapping the morphology and projection pattern of many individual neurons simultaneously, at high resolution and at large scale, via conventional light microscopy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using topic modeling to detect cellular crosstalk in scRNA-seq</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexandrina Pancheva, Helen Wheadon, Simon Rogers, Thomas D. Otto</p>

Cell-cell interactions are vital for numerous biological processes including development, differentiation, and response to inflammation. Currently, most methods for studying interactions on scRNA-seq level are based on curated databases of ligands and receptors. While those methods are useful, they are limited to our current biological knowledge. Recent advances in single cell protocols have allowed for physically interacting cells to be captured, and as such we have the potential to study interactions in a complimentary way without relying on prior knowledge. We introduce a new method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for detecting genes that change as a result of interaction. We apply our method to synthetic datasets to demonstrate its ability to detect genes that change in an interacting population compared to a reference population. Next, we apply our approach to two datasets of physically interacting cells to identify the genes that change as a result of interaction, examples include adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules which confirm physical interaction between cells. For each dataset we produce a ranking of genes that are changing in subpopulations of the interacting cells. In addition to the genes discussed in the original publications, we highlight further candidates for interaction in the top 100 and 300 ranked genes. Lastly, we apply our method to a dataset generated by a standard droplet-based protocol not designed to capture interacting cells, and discuss its suitability for analysing interactions. We present a method that streamlines detection of interactions and does not require prior clustering and generation of synthetic reference profiles to detect changes in expression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Deep learning for robust and flexible tracking in behavioral studies for C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kathleen Bates, Kim Le, Hang Lu</p>

Robust and accurate behavioral tracking is essential for ethological studies. Common methods for tracking and extracting behavior rely on user adjusted heuristics that can significantly vary across different individuals, environments, and experimental conditions. As a result, they are difficult to implement in large-scale behavioral studies with complex, heterogenous environmental conditions. Recently developed deep-learning methods for object recognition such as Faster R-CNN have advantages in their speed, accuracy, and robustness. Here, we show that Faster R-CNN can be employed for identification and detection of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> in a variety of life stages in complex environments. We applied the algorithm to track animal speeds during development, fecundity rates and spatial distribution in reproductive adults, and behavioral decline in aging populations. By doing so, we demonstrate the flexibility, speed, and scalability of Faster R-CNN across a variety of experimental conditions, illustrating its generalized use for future large-scale behavioral studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A particle-based computational model to analyse remodelling of the red blood cell cytoskeleton during malaria infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julia Jäger, Pintu Patra, Cecilia P. Sanchez, Michael Lanzer, Ulrich S. Schwarz</p>

Red blood cells can withstand the harsh mechanical conditions in the vasculature only because the bending rigidity of their plasma membrane is complemented by the shear elasticity of the underlying spectrin-actin network. During an infection by the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the parasite mines host actin from the junctional complexes and establishes a system of adhesive knobs, whose main structural component is the knob-associated histidine rich protein (KAHRP) secreted by the parasite. Here we aim at a mechanistic understanding of this dramatic transformation process. We have developed a particle-based computational model for the cytoskeleton of red blood cells and simulated it with Brownian dynamics to predict the mechanical changes resulting from actin mining and KAHRP-clustering. Our simulations include the three-dimensional conformations of the semi-flexible spectrin chains, the capping of the actin protofilaments and several established binding sites for KAHRP. For the healthy red blood cell, we find that incorporation of actin protofilaments leads to two regimes in the shear response. Actin mining decreases the shear modulus, but knob formation increases it. We show that dynamical changes in KAHRP binding affinities can explain the experimentally observed relocalization of KAHRP from ankyrin to actin complexes and demonstrate good qualitative agreement with experiments by measuring pair cross-correlations both in the computer simulations and in super-resolution imaging experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Effective population size for culturally evolving traits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dominik Deffner, Anne Kandler, Laurel Fogarty</p>

Population size has long been considered an important driver of cultural diversity and complexity. Results from population genetics, however, demonstrate that in populations with complex demographic structure or mode of inheritance, it is not the census population size, <i>N</i>, but the effective size of a population, <i>N</i><sub>e</sub>, that determines important evolutionary parameters. Here, we examine the concept of effective population size for traits that evolve culturally, through processes of innovation and social learning. We use mathematical and computational modeling approaches to investigate how cultural <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> and levels of diversity depend on (1) the way traits are learned, (2) population connectedness, and (3) social network structure. We show that one-to-many and frequency-dependent transmission can temporally or permanently lower effective population size compared to census numbers. We caution that migration and cultural exchange can have counter-intuitive effects on <i>N</i><sub>e</sub>. Network density in random networks leaves <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> unchanged, scale-free networks tend to decrease and small-world networks tend to increase <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> compared to census numbers. For one-to-many transmission and different network structures, larger effective sizes are closely associated with higher cultural diversity. For connectedness, however, even small amounts of migration and cultural exchange result in high diversity independently of <i>N</i><sub>e</sub>. Extending previous work, our results highlight the importance of carefully defining effective population size for cultural systems and show that inferring <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> requires detailed knowledge about underlying cultural and demographic processes.

     alt="Abnormal dynamic functional connectivity in first-episode, drug-naïve adolescents with major depressive disorder"/>
<p>This dynamic functional connectivity (FC) study suggests that adolescent depression is characterized by unstable network dynamic pattern, altered state transition metrics, and disrupted FC in a weakly connected state. Furthermore, mean dwell time in this weakly connected state is associated with disease severity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Previous neuroimaging studies have identified disrupted large-scale functional brain networks in major depressive disorder (MDD); however, most of them focused on adult patients and were based on static functional connectivity (FC). Thus, we aimed to investigate the patterns of change in dynamic FC in depressed adolescents. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 60 first-episode, drug-naïve adolescents with MDD and 60 matched healthy controls (HCs). Then, the dynamic FC properties were analyzed using a sliding windows approach, <i>k</i>-means clustering, and graph theory methods. The intrinsic brain FC were clustered into two configuration states—a more frequent and relatively sparsely connected State 1 and a less frequent and more strongly interconnected State 2. Compared with HCs, depressed adolescents had higher reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 1, and lower reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 2, and higher total number of transitions between the two states. Depressed adolescents showed decreased FC within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other networks in State 1. Additionally, the MDD group showed higher variances in the global and local efficiency. Furthermore, the duration of illness was positively correlated with the number of state transitions, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the mean dwell time in State 1. This study demonstrated abnormal dynamic FC in depressed adolescents, which provided new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adolescent-onset depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Prelimbic cortex drives discrimination of non-aversion via amygdala somatostatin interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Overgeneralization of fear to non-aversive stimuli is observed in several psychiatric disorders. Using a mouse model, Stujenske et al. identify the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex acting via somatostatin interneurons in the basolateral amygdala as the mechanism that desynchronizes sensory activation of the amygdala during non-aversive stimuli, thereby suppressing generalized fear responses.

                Zhang et al. report that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has an unusually high number of mutations in its spike (S), which requires a high level of host receptor ACE2 for efficient membrane fusion, thereby compromising its fusogenic capability. Mutations remodel the S antigenic structure, causing remarkable resistance to neutralizing antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Dynamic Ca2+ sensitivity stimulates the evolved SARS-CoV-2 spike strain-mediated membrane fusion for enhanced entry</a></h4>

              
                Singh et al. show that low pH and Ca2+ facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spike-driven membrane fusion. Ca2+ drives a pre- to post-fusion conformational change of the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 spike variants of concern have evolved with enhanced dynamic calcium sensitivity, which increases fusion activity and cell entry.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multi-omic rejuvenation of human cells by maturation phase transient reprogramming</a></h4>

              
                Ageing is the gradual decline in organismal fitness that occurs over time leading to tissue dysfunction and disease. At the cellular level, ageing is associated with reduced function, altered gene expression and a perturbed epigenome. Somatic cell reprogramming, the process of converting somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), can reverse these age-associated changes. However, during iPSC reprogramming, somatic cell identity is lost, and can be difficult to reacquire as re-differentiated iPSCs often resemble foetal rather than mature adult cells. Recent work has demonstrated that the epigenome is already rejuvenated by the maturation phase of reprogramming, which suggests full iPSC reprogramming is not required to reverse ageing of somatic cells. Here we have developed the first 'maturation phase transient reprogramming' (MPTR) method, where reprogramming factors are expressed until this rejuvenation point followed by withdrawal of their induction. Using dermal fibroblasts from middle age donors, we found that cells temporarily lose and then reacquire their fibroblast identity during MPTR, possibly as a result of epigenetic memory at enhancers and/or persistent expression of some fibroblast genes. Excitingly, our method substantially rejuvenated multiple cellular attributes including the transcriptome, which was rejuvenated by around 30 years as measured by a novel transcriptome clock. The epigenome, including H3K9me3 histone methylation levels and the DNA methylation ageing clock, was rejuvenated to a similar extent. The magnitude of rejuvenation instigated by MTPR appears substantially greater than that achieved in previous transient reprogramming protocols. In addition, MPTR fibroblasts produced youthful levels of collagen proteins, and showed partial functional rejuvenation of their migration speed. Finally, our work suggests that more extensive reprogramming does not necessarily result in greater rejuvenation but instead that optimal time windows exist for rejuvenating the transcriptome and the epigenome. Overall, we demonstrate that it is possible to separate rejuvenation from complete pluripotency reprogramming, which should facilitate the discovery of novel anti-ageing genes and therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Schema representations in distinct brain networks support narrative memory during encoding and retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Schematic prior knowledge can scaffold the construction of event memories during perception and also provide structured cues to guide memory search during retrieval. We measured the activation of story-specific and schematic representations using fMRI while participants were presented with 16 stories and then recalled each of the narratives, and related these activations to memory for specific story details. We predicted that schema representations in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) would be correlated with successful recall of story details. In keeping with this prediction, an anterior mPFC region showed a significant correlation between activation of schema representations at encoding and subsequent behavioral recall performance; however, this mPFC region was not implicated in schema representation during retrieval. More generally, our analyses revealed largely distinct brain networks at encoding and retrieval in which schema activation was related to successful recall. These results provide new insight into when and where event knowledge can support narrative memory.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Completion of neural crest cell production and emigration is regulated by retinoic-acid-dependent inhibition of BMP signaling</a></h4>

              
                Production and emigration of neural crest cells is a transient process followed by the emergence of the definitive roof plate. The mechanisms regulating the end of neural crest ontogeny are poorly understood. Whereas early crest development is stimulated by mesoderm-derived retinoic acid, we report that the end of the neural crest period is regulated by retinoic acid synthesized in the dorsal neural tube. Inhibition of retinoic acid signaling in the neural tube prevents the normal upregulation of BMP inhibitors in the nascent roof plate and prolongs the period of BMP responsiveness which otherwise ceases close to roof plate establishment. Consequently, neural crest production and emigration are extended well into the roof plate stage. In turn, extending the activity of neural crest-specific genes inhibits the onset of retinoic acid synthesis in roof plate suggesting a mutual repressive interaction between neural crest and roof plate traits. Although several roof plate-specific genes are normally expressed in the absence of retinoic acid signaling, roof plate and crest markers are co-expressed in single cells and this domain also contains dorsal interneurons. Hence, the cellular and molecular architecture of the roof plate is compromised. Collectively, our results demonstrate that neural tube-derived retinoic acid, via inhibition of BMP signaling, is an essential factor responsible for the end of neural crest generation and the proper segregation of dorsal neural lineages.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endogenous Syngap1 alpha splice forms promote cognitive function and seizure protection</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function variants in <i>SYNGAP1</i> cause a developmental encephalopathy defined by cognitive impairment, autistic features, and epilepsy. <i>SYNGAP1</i> splicing leads to expression of distinct functional protein isoforms. Splicing imparts multiple cellular functions of SynGAP proteins through coding of distinct C-terminal motifs. However, it remains unknown how these different splice sequences function <i>in vivo</i> to regulate neuronal function and behavior. Reduced expression of SynGAP-a1/2 C-terminal splice variants in mice caused severe phenotypes, including reduced survival, impaired learning, and reduced seizure latency. In contrast, upregulation of a1/2 expression improved learning and increased seizure latency. Mice expressing a1-specific mutations, which disrupted SynGAP cellular functions without altering protein expression, promoted seizure, disrupted synapse plasticity, and impaired learning. These findings demonstrate that endogenous SynGAP isoforms with a1/2 spliced sequences promote cognitive function and impart seizure protection. Regulation of SynGAP-a expression or function may be a viable therapeutic strategy to broadly improve cognitive function and mitigate seizure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Efficient differentiation of human primordial germ cells through geometric control reveals a key role for Nodal signaling</a></h4>

              
                Human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) form around the time of implantation and are the precursors of eggs and sperm. Many aspects of hPGC specification remain poorly understood because of the inaccessibility of the early postimplantation human embryo for study. Here we show that micropatterned human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) treated with BMP4 give rise to hPGC-like cells (hPGCLC) and use these as a quantitatively reproducible and simple <i>in vitro</i> model to interrogate this important developmental event. We characterize micropatterned hPSCs up to 96h and show that hPGCLC populations are stable and continue to mature. By perturbing signaling during hPGCLC differentiation, we identify a previously unappreciated role for Nodal signaling and find that the relative timing and duration of BMP and Nodal signaling are critical parameters controlling the number of hPGCLCs. We formulate a mathematical model for a network of cross-repressive fates driven by Nodal and BMP signaling which predicts the measured fate patterns after signaling perturbations. Finally, we show that hPSC colony size dictates the efficiency of hPGCLC specification, which led us to dramatically improve the efficiency of hPGCLC differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Agl24 is an ancient archaeal homolog of the eukaryotic N-glycan chitobiose synthesis enzymes</a></h4>

              
                Protein N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification found in organisms of all domains of life. The crenarchaeal N-glycosylation begins with the synthesis of a lipid-linked chitobiose core structure, identical to that in Eukaryotes, although the enzyme catalyzing this reaction remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of a thermostable archaeal β-1,4-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, named <span class="underline">a</span>rchaeal <span class="underline">gl</span>ycosylation enzyme 24 (Agl24), responsible for the synthesis of the N-glycan chitobiose core. Biochemical characterization confirmed its function as an inverting β-D-GlcNAc-(1→4)-α-D-GlcNAc-diphosphodolichol glycosyltransferase. Substitution of a conserved histidine residue, found also in the eukaryotic and bacterial homologs, demonstrated its functional importance for Agl24. Furthermore, bioinformatics and structural modeling revealed similarities of Agl24 to the eukaryotic Alg14/13 and a distant relation to the bacterial MurG, which are catalyzing the same or a similar reaction, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of Alg14/13 homologs indicates that they are ancient in Eukaryotes, either as a lateral transfer or inherited through eukaryogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Neural Response at the Fundamental Frequency of Speech is Modulated by Word-level Acoustic and Linguistic Information</a></h4>

              
                Spoken language comprehension requires rapid and continuous integration of information, from lower-level acoustic to higher-level linguistic features. Much of this processing occurs in the cerebral cortex. Its neural activity exhibits, for instance, correlates of predictive processing, emerging at delays of a few hundred milliseconds. However, the auditory pathways are also characterized by extensive feedback loops from higher-level cortical areas to lower-level ones as well as to subcortical structures. Early neural activity can therefore be influenced by higher-level cognitive processes, but it remains unclear whether such feedback contributes to linguistic processing. Here, we investigated early speech-evoked neural activity that emerges at the fundamental frequency. We analyzed EEG recordings obtained when subjects listened to a story read by a single speaker. We identified a response tracking the speaker's fundamental frequency that occurred at a delay of 11 ms, while another response elicited by the high-frequency modulation of the envelope of higher harmonics exhibited a larger magnitude and longer latency of about 18 ms. Subsequently, we determined the magnitude of these early neural responses for each individual word in the story. We then quantified the context-independent frequency of each word and used a language model to compute context-dependent word surprisal and precision. The word surprisal represented how predictable a word is, given the previous context, and the word precision reflected the confidence about predicting the next word from the past context. We found that the word-level neural responses at the fundamental frequency were predominantly influenced by the acoustic features: the average fundamental frequency and its variability. Amongst the linguistic features, only context-independent word frequency showed a weak but significant modulation of the neural response to the high-frequency envelope modulation. Our results show that the early neural response at the fundamental frequency is already influenced by acoustic as well as linguistic information, suggesting top-down modulation of this neural response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning and Expression of Dopaminergic Reward Prediction Error via Plastic Representations of Time</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) releasing neurons in the midbrain learn response patterns that represent reward prediction error (RPE). Typically, models proposing a mechanistic explanation for how dopamine neurons learn to exhibit RPE are based on temporal difference (TD) learning, a machine learning algorithm. However, mechanistic models motivated by TD learning face two significant hurdles. First, TD-based models typically require rather unrealistic components, such as long and robust temporal chains of feature-specific neurons that tile, a priori, each interval from a given stimulus to a given reward. Secondly, various predictions of TD clash with experimental observations of how RPE evolves over learning. Here, we present a biophysically plausible plastic network model of spiking neurons, that learns RPEs and can replicate results observed in multiple experiments. This model, coined FLEX (Flexibly Learned Errors in Expected Reward), learns feature-specific representations of time, allowing for neural representations of stimuli to adjust their timing and relation to rewards in an online manner. Following learning, model dopamine neurons in FLEX report a distribution of response types, as observed experimentally and as used in machine learning. Dopamine neuron firing in our model reflects an RPE before and after learning but not necessarily during learning, allowing the model to reconcile seemingly inconsistent experiments and make unique predictions that contrast those of TD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ROStrace detects oxidative stress in vivo and predicts progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology in APP/PS1 mice.</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, tracking oxidative stress in the brain has proven difficult and impeded its use as a biomarker. Herein, we investigate the utility of a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [18F]ROStrace, as a biomarker of oxidative stress throughout the course of AD in the well-established APP/PS1 double mutant mouse model. Methods: PET imaging studies were conducted in wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice at 3 different time points, representing early (5 mo.), middle (10 mo.), and advanced (16 mo.) life (n = 6-12, per sex). Semi-quantitation SUVRs of the plateau phase (40-60nmin post-injection; SUVR40-60) of ten brain subregions were designated by the Mirrione atlas and analyzed by Pmod. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to distinguish brain regions with elevated ROS in APP/PS1 relative to WT in both sexes. The PET studies were validated by ex vivo autoradiography and immunofluorescence with the parent compound, dihydroethidium. Results: [18F]ROStrace retention was increased in the APP/PS1 brain compared to age-matched controls by 10 mo. of age (p < 0.0001), and preceded the accumulation of oxidative damage in APP/PS1 neurons at 16mo. (p < 0.005). [18F]ROStrace retention and oxidative damages were higher and occurred earlier in female APP/PS1 mice as measured by PET (p < 0.001), autoradiography and immunohistochemistry (p < 0.05). [18F]ROStrace differences emerged mid-life, temporally and spatially correlating with increased A{beta} burden (r2 = 0.36; p = 0.0003), which was also greatest in the female brain (p < 0.001). Conclusions: [18F]ROStrace identifies increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 female mice, concurrent with increased amyloid burden mid-life. Differences in oxidative stress during this crucial time may partially explain the sexual dimorphism in AD. [18F]ROStrace may provide a long-awaited tool to stratify at-risk patients who may benefit from antioxidant therapy prior to irreparable neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High frequency spike inference with particle Gibbs sampling</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent calcium indicators are an indispensable tools for monitoring the spiking activity of large neuronal populations in animal models. However, despite the plethora of algorithms developed over the last decades, accurate spike time inference methods for rates greater than 20 Hz are lacking. More importantly, little attention has been devoted to the quantification the statistical uncertainties in spike time estimation, which is essential for assigning a confidence in the inference for a particular recording. To address these challenges, we introduce an auto-regressive generative model that accounts for bursting neuronal activity and baseline fluorescence modulation, and it also applies recent sequential Monte Carlo approaches to obtain joint posterior distributions of static and dynamic model parameters. We show that our inference method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms by analysing the CASCADE benchmark datasets. We also show that spike time intervals as short as five milliseconds can be inferred from fluorescence transients recorded using a state-of-the-art genetically encoded indicator. Overall, our study describes a Bayesian inference method to detect neuronal spiking patterns and their uncertainty. The use of particle Gibbs samplers allows for unbiased estimates of all model parameters and it provides a statistical framework to test more specific models of calcium indicators.

                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized cognitive neuroscience, but methodological barriers limit the generalizability of findings from the lab to the real world. Here, we present Neuroscout, an end-to-end platform for analysis of naturalistic fMRI data designed to facilitate the adoption of robust and generalizable research practices. Neuroscout leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to automatically annotate stimuli from dozens of naturalistic fMRI studies, allowing researchers to easily test neuroscientific hypotheses across multiple ecologically-valid datasets. In addition, Neuroscout builds on a robust ecosystem of open tools and standards to provide an easy-to-use analysis builder and a fully automated execution engine that reduce the burden of reproducible research. Through a series of meta-analytic case studies, we validate the automatic feature extraction approach and demonstrate its potential to support more robust fMRI research. Owing to its ease of use and a high degree of automation, Neuroscout makes it possible to overcome modeling challenges commonly arising in naturalistic analysis and to easily scale analyses within and across datasets, democratizing generalizable fMRI research.

                This paper describes a novel tool for closed-loop system identification of the activation dynamics of the neural target of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The method operates in real time, selects ideal stimulus parameters, detects and processes the response, and estimates the input--output curve and the neural membrane time constant representing a first-order approximation of the activated neural target. First, the neural membrane response and depolarization factor, which leads to motor evoked potentials (MEPs) are analytically computed and discussed. Then, an integrated model is developed which combines the neural membrane time constant and the input--output curve in TMS. Identifiability of the proposed integrated model is discussed. A condition is derived, which assures SPE of the proposed integrated model for the specific case of cTMS pulses. Finally, a real-time and sequential parameter estimation (SPE) formalism is described to identify the neural membrane time constant and IO curve parameters in closed-loop TMS, where TMS pulses are administered sequentially based on the automatic analysis of the electromyography (EMG) data in real time. Optimal sampling based on maximization of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and more conventional and intuitive uniform sampling methods both are addressed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed parameter tuning method is evaluated via simulations. The Matlab code is available online on Github.

                Understanding the topological characteristics of the brain network across a population is central to understanding brain functions. The abstraction of human connectome as a graph has been pivotal in gaining insights on the topological features of the brain network. The development of group-level statistical inference procedures in brain graphs while accounting for the heterogeneity and randomness still remains a difficult task. In this study, we develop a robust statistical framework based on persistent homology using the order statistics for analyzing brain networks. The use of order statistics greatly simplifies the computation of the persistent barcodes. We validate the proposed methods using comprehensive simulation studies and subsequently apply to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance images. We conclude a statistically significant topological difference between the male and female brain networks.

                Speech production is an intricate process involving a large number of muscles and cognitive processes. The neural processes underlying speech production are not completely understood. As speech is a uniquely human ability, it can not be investigated in animal models. High-fidelity human data can only be obtained in clinical settings and is therefore not easily available to all researchers. Here, we provide a dataset of 10 participants reading out individual words while we measured intracranial EEG from a total of 1103 electrodes. The data, with its high temporal resolution and coverage of a large variety of cortical and sub-cortical brain regions, can help in understanding the speech production process better. Simultaneously, the data can be used to test speech decoding and synthesis approaches from neural data to develop speech Brain-Computer Interfaces and speech neuroprostheses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cochlear Neurotrophin-3 overexpression at mid-life prevents age-related cochlear synaptopathy and slows age-related hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most prevalent sensory deficit in the elderly. This progressive pathology often has psychological and medical comorbidities, including social isolation, depression, and cognitive decline. Despite ARHL's enormous impact, no therapies to prevent or slow its progression exist. Loss of synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), a.k.a. cochlear synaptopathy, is an early event in ARHL, preceding neuronal and hair cell loss. To determine if age-related cochlear synaptopathy can be prevented, and if this impacts the time-course of ARHL, we tested the effects of cochlear overexpression of neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3) starting at middle-age. We chose Ntf3 because this neurotrophin regulates the formation of IHC-SGN synapses in the neonatal period. We now show that triggering Ntf3 overexpression by cochlear supporting cells starting in middle age rapidly increases the amplitude of sound-evoked neural potentials, indicating that Ntf3 improves cochlear function when pathology is minimal. Furthermore, near the end of their lifespan, Ntf3-overexpressing mice have milder ARHL, with enhanced cochlear neural function and reduced cochlear synaptopathy. Our results provide evidence that age-related decrease in cochlear Ntf3 expression contributes to ARHL. and Ntf3 supplementation could serve as a therapeutic for this prevalent disorder. Furthermore, these findings suggest that increased expression of factors that regulate synaptogenesis during development might prevent age-related synaptopathy, a process involved in several central nervous system degenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heat and humidity sensors that alert mosquitoes to nearby human hosts</a></h4>

              
                Mosquito-borne diseases sicken >500,000,000 people annually, killing >500,0001. Mosquito host-seeking is guided by multiple host-associated cues, which combine to drive blood feeding in a manner that remains poorly understood2,3. While heat is a powerful mosquito attractant, recent studies indicate that disruption of heat seeking has little impact on host detection by the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae4, suggesting other cues act alongside heat in the complex sensory environment of a human host. Here we show mosquitoes require Ir93a (an Ionotropic Receptor5) to maintain attraction to a human host and feed on warmed blood. Using Ir93a, we uncover the previously uncharacterized mosquito hygrosensory system, and show Ir93a is required for humidity detection by humidity sensors (hygrosensors) as well as temperature detection by thermosensors, and for attraction to each stimulus. These findings indicate that hygrosensation and thermosensation function in parallel, driving host proximity detection in response to the overlapping heat and humidity gradients humans produce6,7. These host cue sensors appear to have arisen by co-opting existing sensors of physical cues rather than de novo, as Ir93a-dependent thermo- and hygro-sensors support physiological homeostasis in non-blood-feeding insects8-11. While Ir93a is conserved among arthropods, reliance on heat and humidity evolved independently in multiple blood-feeding lineages, suggesting multiple, vector-specific implementations of this common host-seeking strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A genetic variant of the Wnt receptor LRP6 accelerates synapse degeneration during ageing and in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Synapse loss strongly correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Studies suggest that deficient Wnt signalling, a pathway required for neuronal connectivity, contributes to synapse dysfunction and loss in AD. Consistent with this idea, a variant of Lrp6, (Lrp6-val), which confers reduced Wnt signalling, has been linked to late onset AD. However, the impact of Lrp6-val on synapses in the healthy and AD brain has not been examined. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated a novel knock-in mouse model carrying this Lrp6 variant to study its role in synaptic integrity. Lrp6-val mice develop normally and do not exhibit morphological brain abnormalities. Hippocampal neurons from Lrp6-val mice do not respond to Wnt7a, a Wnt ligand that promotes synaptic assembly through the Frizzled-5 (Fz5) receptor. Activation of the Wnt pathway by Wnt ligands leads to the formation of a complex between LRP6 and Fz5. In contrast, LRP6-Val impairs the formation of the LRP6-Fz5 complex elicited by Wnt7a, as detected by proximity ligation assay (PLA). We demonstrate that Lrp6-val mice exhibit structural and functional synaptic defects that become more pronounced with age, consistent with decreased canonical Wnt signalling during ageing. To investigate the contribution of this variant to AD, Lrp6-val mice were crossed to hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F (NL-G-F), a knock-in AD mouse model. The presence of the Lrp6-val variant significantly exacerbates synapse loss around amyloid-{beta} plaques in NL-G-F mice. Our findings uncover a novel role for the Lrp6-val variant in synapse vulnerability during ageing and its contribution to synapse degeneration in AD.

                Dysregulated protein synthesis is a core pathogenic mechanism in Fragile X Syndrome (FX). The mGluR Theory of FX predicts that pathological synaptic changes arise from the excessive translation of mRNAs downstream of mGlu1/5 activation. Here, we use a combination of CA1 pyramidal neuron-specific TRAP-seq and proteomics to identify the overtranslating mRNAs supporting exaggerated mGlu1/5 -induced long-term synaptic depression (mGluR-LTD) in the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y). Surprisingly, our results identify a robust translation of ribosomal proteins (RPs) upon mGlu1/5 stimulation that coincides with a reduced translation of long mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins. These changes are mimicked and occluded in Fmr1-/y neurons. Inhibiting RP translation significantly impairs mGluR-LTD and prevents the length-dependent shift in the translating population. Together, these results suggest that pathological changes in FX result from a length-dependent alteration in the translating population that is supported by excessive RP translation.

                During propofol-induced general anesthesia, alpha rhythms undergo a striking shift from posterior to anterior, termed anteriorization. We combined human intracranial recordings with diffusion imaging to show that anteriorization occurs with opposing dynamics in two distinct thalamocortical subnetworks. The cortical and thalamic anatomy involved, as well as their known functional roles, suggest multiple means by which propofol dismantles sensory and cognitive processes to achieve loss of consciousness.

                Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) restore motor function to people with paralysis by translating brain activity into control signals for external devices. In current iBCIs, instabilities at the neural interface result in a degradation of decoding performance, which necessitates frequent supervised recalibration using new labeled data. One potential solution is to use the latent manifold structure that underlies neural population activity to facilitate a stable mapping between brain activity and behavior. Recent efforts using unsupervised approaches have improved iBCI stability using this principle; however, existing methods treat each time step as an independent sample and do not account for latent dynamics. Dynamics have been used to enable high performance prediction of movement intention, and may also help improve stabilization. Here, we present a platform for Nonlinear Manifold Alignment with Dynamics (NoMAD), which stabilizes iBCI decoding using recurrent neural network models of dynamics. NoMAD uses unsupervised distribution alignment to update the mapping of nonstationary neural data to a consistent set of neural dynamics, thereby providing stable input to the iBCI decoder. In applications to data from monkey motor cortex collected during motor tasks, NoMAD enables accurate behavioral decoding with unparalleled stability over weeks- to months-long timescales without any supervised recalibration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A critical developmental interval of coupling axon branching to synaptic degradation during neural circuit formation</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of neuronal wiring specificity requires stabilization of dynamic axonal branches at sites of selective synapse formation. Models that explain how axonal branching is coupled to synaptogenesis postulate molecular regulators acting in a spatiotemporally restricted fashion. We report that Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activity is required in presynaptic axonal branches during two distinct temporal intervals to regulate circuit wiring in the developing Drosophila visual system. EGFR is required early to regulate primary axonal branching and independently again later to prevent autophagic degradation of the synaptic active zone protein Bruchpilot (Brp). The protection of synaptic material during this later interval of wiring ensures the stabilization of terminal branches, circuit connectivity and appropriate visual behavior. Phenotypes of EGFR inactivation were rescued by increasing Brp levels or downregulating autophagic genes. We identify a temporally restricted molecular mechanism required for coupling axonal branching and synaptic stabilization that contributes to the emergence of neuronal wiring specificity.

                The most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD) is heterozygous mutations in the GBA1 gene which encodes for the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GCase impairments are associated with an accumulation of abnormal -synuclein (-syn) called Lewy pathology, which characterizes PD. PD patients heterozygous for the GBA1 L444P mutation (GBA1+/L444P) have a 5.6-fold increased risk of cognitive impairments. In this study, we used GBA1+/L444P mice to determine the effects of this severe GBA1 mutation on lipid metabolism, expression of synaptic proteins, behavior, and -syn inclusion formation. GBA1+/L444P mice showed reduced GCase activity in limbic brain regions and expressed lower levels of hippocampal vGLUT1 compared to wildtype (GBA1+/+) mice. GBA+/L444P mice also demonstrated impaired fear conditioning, but no motor deficits. We show, using mass spectrometry, that mutant GCase and age increased levels of glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), but not glucosylceramide (GlcCer), in the brains and serum of GBA1+/L444P mice. Aged GBA1+/+ mice also showed increased levels of GlcSph, and decreased GlcCer. To model disease pathology, templated -syn pathology was used. -Syn inclusions were increased in the hippocampus of GBA1+/L444P mice compared to GBA1+/+ mice, but not in the cortex, or substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Pathologic -syn did not cause a loss of dopamine neurons in the SNc. Treatment with a GlcCer synthase inhibitor prevented loss of cortical -syn inclusions, but not loss of dopamine neurons. Overall, these data suggest the critical importance to evaluate the contribution of hippocampal pathologic -syn and brain and serum glucosylsphingosine in synucleinopathies.

	<p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in adaptive behavior. A wealth of studies suggests obesity-related alterations in the central dopamine system. The most direct evidence for such differences in humans comes from molecular neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The aim of the current review is to give a comprehensive overview of molecular neuroimaging studies that investigated the relation between BMI or weight status and any dopamine target in the striatal and midbrain regions of the human brain. A structured literature search was performed and a summary of the extracted findings are presented for each of the four available domains: (1) D2/D3 receptors, (2) dopamine release, (3) dopamine synthesis, and (4) dopamine transporters. Recent proposals of a nonlinear relationship between severity of obesity and dopamine imbalances are described while integrating findings within and across domains, after which limitations of the review are discussed. We conclude that despite many observed associations between obesity and substrates of the dopamine system in humans, it is unlikely that obesity can be traced back to a single dopaminergic cause or consequence. For effective personalized prevention and treatment of obesity, it will be crucial to identify possible dopamine (and non-dopamine) profiles and their functional characteristics.</p>

	<p>Recently, a large cluster-randomized controlled trial was designed&amp;amp;mdash;Music Interventions for Dementia and Depression in ELderly care (MIDDEL)&amp;amp;mdash;to assess the effectiveness of music interventions on depression in care home residents with dementia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03496675). To understand the pathophysiological mechanisms, we observed the effect of repeated music interventions on stress in this population since chronic stress was associated with depression and an increased risk for dementia. An exploratory study was designed to assess: (1) changes in hair cortisol concentrations as an indicator of longer-term stress; (2) whether baseline stress is a predictor of therapy outcome; (3) pre- and post-treatment effects on salivary &amp;amp;alpha;-amylase and cortisol response as an indicator of immediate stress in 180&amp;amp;ndash;200 care home residents with dementia and depressive symptoms who partake in the MIDDEL trial. Insights into mediatory effects of stress to explain the effect of music interventions will be gained. Hair cortisol concentrations were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months along with the Perceived Stress Scale. Salivary &amp;amp;alpha;-amylase and cortisol concentrations were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months. Saliva was collected just before a session and 15 and 60 min after a session, along with a stress Visual Analogue Scale.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Tinnitus is the awareness of a sound in the absence of an external source. It affects around 10&amp;amp;ndash;15% of people, a significant proportion of whom also experience symptoms such as depression or anxiety that negatively affect their quality of life. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique involving constant low-intensity direct current delivered via scalp electrodes. It is a potential treatment option for tinnitus, as well as tinnitus-related conditions such as depression and anxiety. This systematic review estimates the effects of tDCS on outcomes relevant to tinnitus. In addition, it sheds light on the relationship between stimulation parameters and the effect of tDCS on these outcomes; (2) Methods: Exhaustive searches of electronic databases were conducted. Randomised controlled trials were included if they reported at least one of the following outcomes: tinnitus symptom severity, anxiety, or depression. Where available, data on quality of life, adverse effects, and neurophysiological changes were also reviewed. GRADE was used to assess the certainty in the estimate; (3) Results: Meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant reduction in tinnitus (moderate certainty) and depression (low certainty)-but not anxiety-following active tDCS compared to sham control. Network meta-analyses revealed potential optimal stimulation parameters; (4) Conclusions: The evidence synthesised in this review suggests tDCS has the potential to reduce symptom severity in tinnitus and depression. It further narrows down the number of potentially optimal stimulation parameters.</p>

	<p>Speech therapy can be part of the care pathway for patients recovering from comas and presenting a disorder of consciousness (DOC). Although there are no official recommendations for speech therapy follow-up, neuroscientific studies suggest that relevant stimuli may have beneficial effects on the behavioral assessment of patients with a DOC. In two case studies, we longitudinally measured (from 4 to 6 weeks) the behavior (observed in a speech therapy session or using items from the Coma Recovery Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Revised) of two patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) when presenting music and/or autobiographical materials. The results highlight the importance of using relevant material during a speech therapy session and suggest that a musical context with a fast tempo could improve behavior evaluation compared to noise. This work supports the importance of adapted speech therapy for MCS patients and encourages larger studies to confirm these initial observations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulated actin reorganization mediated by motor proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maria-Veronica Ciocanel, Aravind Chandrasekaran, Carli Mager, Qin Ni, Garegin A. Papoian, Adriana Dawes</p>

Cortical actin networks are highly dynamic and play critical roles in shaping the mechanical properties of cells. The actin cytoskeleton undergoes significant reorganization in many different contexts, including during directed cell migration and over the course of the cell cycle, when cortical actin can transition between different configurations such as open patched meshworks, homogeneous distributions, and aligned bundles. Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by different kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of actin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin with myosin <i>in vivo</i>, we propose stochastic agent-based models and develop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins mediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual motor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin networks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of myosin motor localization, which have previously been observed experimentally. In simulations where two motor populations with distinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that motors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network organization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant. This modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where spatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for changes in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work suggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional regulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the cytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dynamic coupling of residues within proteins as a mechanistic foundation of many enigmatic pathogenic missense variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicholas J. Ose, Brandon M. Butler, Avishek Kumar, I. Can Kazan, Maxwell Sanderford, Sudhir Kumar, S. Banu Ozkan</p>

Many pathogenic missense mutations are found in protein positions that are neither well-conserved nor fall in any known functional domains. Consequently, we lack any mechanistic underpinning of dysfunction caused by such mutations. We explored the disruption of allosteric dynamic coupling between these positions and the known functional sites as a possible mechanism for pathogenesis. In this study, we present an analysis of 591 pathogenic missense variants in 144 human enzymes that suggests that allosteric dynamic coupling of mutated positions with known active sites is a plausible biophysical mechanism and evidence of their functional importance. We illustrate this mechanism in a case study of <i>β-Glucocerebrosidase</i> (GCase) in which a vast majority of 94 sites harboring Gaucher disease-associated missense variants are located some distance away from the active site. An analysis of the conformational dynamics of GCase suggests that mutations on these distal sites cause changes in the flexibility of active site residues despite their distance, indicating a dynamic communication network throughout the protein. The disruption of the long-distance dynamic coupling caused by missense mutations may provide a plausible general mechanistic explanation for biological dysfunction and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptive and optimized COVID-19 vaccination strategies across geographical regions and age groups</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeta Molla, Alejandro Ponce de León Chávez, Takayuki Hiraoka, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Mikko Kivelä, Lasse Leskelä</p>

We evaluate the efficiency of various heuristic strategies for allocating vaccines against COVID-19 and compare them to strategies found using optimal control theory. Our approach is based on a mathematical model which tracks the spread of disease among different age groups and across different geographical regions, and we introduce a method to combine age-specific contact data to geographical movement data. As a case study, we model the epidemic in the population of mainland Finland utilizing mobility data from a major telecom operator. Our approach allows to determine which geographical regions and age groups should be targeted first in order to minimize the number of deaths. In the scenarios that we test, we find that distributing vaccines demographically and in an age-descending order is not optimal for minimizing deaths and the burden of disease. Instead, more lives could be saved by using strategies which emphasize high-incidence regions and distribute vaccines in parallel to multiple age groups. The level of emphasis that high-incidence regions should be given depends on the overall transmission rate in the population. This observation highlights the importance of updating the vaccination strategy when the effective reproduction number changes due to the general contact patterns changing and new virus variants entering.

                <p>by Malgorzata Sobota, Pilar Natalia Rodilla Ramirez, Alexander Cambré, Andrea Rocker, Julien Mortier, Théo Gervais, Tiphaine Haas, Delphine Cornillet, Dany Chauvin, Isabelle Hug, Thomas Julou, Abram Aertsen, Médéric Diard</p>

Virulence gene expression can represent a substantial fitness cost to pathogenic bacteria. In the model entero-pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium (<i>S</i>.Tm), such cost favors emergence of attenuated variants during infections that harbor mutations in transcriptional activators of virulence genes (e.g., <i>hilD</i> and <i>hilC</i>). Therefore, understanding the cost of virulence and how it relates to virulence regulation could allow the identification and modulation of ecological factors to drive the evolution of <i>S</i>.Tm toward attenuation. In this study, investigations of membrane status and stress resistance demonstrate that the wild-type (WT) expression level of virulence factors embedded in the envelope increases membrane permeability and sensitizes <i>S</i>.Tm to membrane stress. This is independent from a previously described growth defect associated with virulence gene expression in <i>S</i>.Tm. Pretreating the bacteria with sublethal stress inhibited virulence expression and increased stress resistance. This trade-off between virulence and stress resistance could explain the repression of virulence expression in response to harsh environments in <i>S</i>.Tm. Moreover, we show that virulence-associated stress sensitivity is a burden during infection in mice, contributing to the inherent instability of <i>S</i>.Tm virulence. As most bacterial pathogens critically rely on deploying virulence factors in their membrane, our findings could have a broad impact toward the development of antivirulence strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">RNA Pol IV induces antagonistic parent-of-origin effects on Arabidopsis endosperm</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Prasad R. V. Satyaki, Mary Gehring</p>

Gene expression in endosperm—a seed tissue that mediates transfer of maternal resources to offspring—is under complex epigenetic control. We show here that plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) mediates parental control of endosperm gene expression. Pol IV is required for the production of small interfering RNAs that typically direct DNA methylation. We compared small RNAs (sRNAs), DNA methylation, and mRNAs in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> endosperm from heterozygotes produced by reciprocally crossing wild-type (WT) plants to Pol IV mutants. We find that maternally and paternally acting Pol IV induce distinct effects on endosperm. Loss of maternal or paternal Pol IV impacts sRNAs and DNA methylation at different genomic sites. Strikingly, maternally and paternally acting Pol IV have antagonistic impacts on gene expression at some loci, divergently promoting or repressing endosperm gene expression. Antagonistic parent-of-origin effects have only rarely been described and are consistent with a gene regulatory system evolving under parental conflict.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Hasty sensorimotor decisions rely on an overlap of broad and selective changes in motor activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gerard Derosiere, David Thura, Paul Cisek, Julie Duque</p>

Humans and other animals are able to adjust their speed–accuracy trade-off (SAT) at will depending on the urge to act, favoring either cautious or hasty decision policies in different contexts. An emerging view is that SAT regulation relies on influences exerting broad changes on the motor system, tuning its activity up globally when hastiness is at premium. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis. A total of 50 participants performed a task involving choices between left and right index fingers, in which incorrect choices led either to a high or to a low penalty in 2 contexts, inciting them to emphasize either cautious or hasty policies. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on multiple motor representations, eliciting motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in 9 finger and leg muscles. MEP amplitudes allowed us to probe activity changes in the corresponding finger and leg representations, while participants were deliberating about which index to choose. Our data indicate that hastiness entails a broad amplification of motor activity, although this amplification was limited to the chosen side. On top of this effect, we identified a local suppression of motor activity, surrounding the chosen index representation. Hence, a decision policy favoring speed over accuracy appears to rely on overlapping processes producing a broad (but not global) amplification and a surround suppression of motor activity. The latter effect may help to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the chosen representation, as supported by single-trial correlation analyses indicating a stronger differentiation of activity changes in finger representations in the hasty context.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Inequities in therapy for infantile spasms: a call to action</a></h4>

              
                <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>To determine whether selection of treatment for children with infantile spasms (IS) varies by race/ethnicity.</p>
<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>The prospective US National Infantile Spasms Consortium database includes children with IS treated from 2012–2018. We examined the relationship between race/ethnicity and receipt of standard IS therapy (prednisolone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, vigabatrin), adjusting for demographic and clinical variables using logistic regression. Our primary outcome was <i>treatment course</i>, which considered therapy prescribed for the first and, when needed, the second IS treatment together.</p>
<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>Of 555 children, 324 (58%) were Non-Hispanic white, 55 (10%) Non-Hispanic Black, 24 (4%) Non-Hispanic Asian, 80 (14%) Hispanic, and 72 (13%) Other/Unknown. Most (398, 72%) received a standard treatment course. Insurance type, geographic location, history of prematurity, prior seizures, developmental delay or regression, abnormal head circumference, hypsarrhythmia, and IS etiologies were associated with standard therapy. In adjusted models, Non-Hispanic Black children had lower odds of receiving a standard treatment course compared with Non-Hispanic white children (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20–0.89, p = 0.02). Adjusted models also showed that children with public (vs. private) insurance had lower odds of receiving standard therapy for treatment 1 (OR 0.42, CI 0.21–0.84, p = 0.01).</p>
<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>Non-Hispanic Black children were more often treated with non-standard IS therapies than Non-Hispanic white children. Likewise, children with public (vs. private) insurance were less likely to receive standard therapies. Investigating drivers of inequities, and understanding the impact of racism on treatment decisions, are critical next steps to improve care for patients with IS.</p>

                Kwak and Curtis demonstrate that the memory formats measured with fMRI for two different visual features, orientation and motion direction, are shared in an abstract line-like format. These results demonstrate that the goal-relevant details of past percepts are recoded into abstract working memory representations in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Task-related hemodynamic responses in human early visual cortex are modulated by task difficulty and behavioral performance</a></h4>

              
                Early visual cortex exhibits widespread hemodynamic responses in the absence of visual stimulation, which are entrained to the timing of a task and not predicted by local spiking or local field potential (LFP). Such task-related responses ('TRRs') covary with reward magnitude and physiological signatures of arousal. It is unknown, however, if TRRs change on a trial-to-trial basis according to behavioral performance and task difficulty. If so, this would suggest that TRRs reflect arousal on a trial-to-trial timescale and covary with critical task and behavioral variables. We measured fMRI-BOLD responses in the early visual cortex of human observers performing an orientation discrimination task consisting of separate easy and hard runs of trials. Stimuli were presented in a small portion of one hemifield, but the fMRI response was measured in the ipsilateral hemisphere, far from the stimulus representation and focus of spatial attention. TRRs scaled in amplitude with task difficulty, behavioral accuracy, reaction time, and lapses across trials. These modulations were not explained by the influence of respiration, cardiac activity, or head movement on the fMRI signal. Similar modulations with task difficulty and behavior were observed in pupil size. These results suggest that TRRs reflect arousal and behavior on the timescale of individual trials.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic loci and metabolic states associated with murine epigenetic aging</a></h4>

              
                Changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) are linked to aging. Here, we profile highly conserved CpGs in 339 predominantly female mice belonging to the BXD family for which we have deep longevity and genomic data. We use a 'pan-mammalian' microarray that provides a common platform for assaying the methylome across mammalian clades. We computed epigenetic clocks and tested associations with DNAm entropy, diet, weight, metabolic traits, and genetic variation. We describe the multifactorial variance of methylation at these CpGs, and show that high fat diet augments the age-associated changes. Entropy increases with age. The progression to disorder, particularly at CpGs that gain methylation over time, was predictive of genotype-dependent life expectancy. The longer-lived BXD strains had comparatively lower entropy at a given age. We identified two genetic loci that modulate rates of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA): one on chromosome (Chr) 11 that encompasses the <i>Erbb2/Her2 </i>oncogenic region, and a second on Chr19 that contains a cytochrome P450 cluster. Both loci harbor genes associated with EAA in humans including <i>STXBP4</i>, <i>NKX2-</i>3, and <i>CUTC</i>. Transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed associations with oxidation-reduction, metabolic, and immune response pathways. Our results highlight concordant loci for EAA in humans and mice, and demonstrate a tight coupling between the metabolic state and epigenetic aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Generation of a CRF1-Cre transgenic rat and the role of central amygdala CRF1 cells in nociception and anxiety-like behavior</a></h4>

              
                Corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 (CRF<sub>1</sub>) receptors are critical to stress responses because they allow neurons to respond to CRF released in response to stress. Our understanding of the precise role of CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing neuronal populations in CRF-mediated behaviors has been largely limited to mouse experiments due to the lack of genetic tools available to selectively visualize and manipulate CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in rats. Here, we describe the generation and validation of a transgenic CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rat, which expresses a bicistronic <i>iCre-2A-<sup>td</sup>Tomato </i>transgene directed by 200kb of promoter and enhancer sequence surrounding the<i> Crhr1</i> cDNA present within a BAC clone, that has been transgenically inserted into the rat genome. We report that <i>Crhr1 </i>and <i>Cre </i>mRNA expression are highly colocalized in CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats within both the central amygdala (CeA), composed of mostly GABAergic neurons, and in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), composed of mostly glutamatergic neurons. In the CeA, membrane properties, inhibitory synaptic transmission, and responses to CRF bath application in <sup>td</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> neurons are similar to those previously reported in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in CRFR1-GFP mice. We show that stimulatory DREADD receptors can be selectively targeted to CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells via virally delivered Cre-dependent transgenes, that transfected Cre/<sup>td</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells are activated by clozapine-n-oxide <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, and that activation of these cells <i>in vivo</i> increases anxiety-like behavior and nocifensive responses. Outside the amygdala, we show that Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato is expressed in several brain areas across the rostrocaudal axis of the CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rat brain, and that the expression pattern of Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato cells is similar to the known expression pattern of CRF<sub>1 </sub>cells. Given the accuracy of expression in the CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre rat, modern genetic techniques used to investigate the anatomy, physiology, and behavioral function of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons and circuits can now be performed in assays that require the use of rats as the model organism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unexpected inhibition of motor function by dopamine activation of D1/D2 co-expressing striatal neurons.</a></h4>

              
                The central function of the striatum and its dopaminergic (DA) afference in motor control and integration of cognitive and emotional processes is commonly explained by the two striatal efferent pathways characterized by striatal projection neurons (SPNs) expressing DA D1 receptor- and D2 receptor (D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs), respectively, regardless of SPNs co-expressing these two receptors (D1/D2-SPNs). Here, after developing an approach that enables to target these hybrid SPNs, we demonstrated that, although these SPNs are rare, they play a major role in guiding the motor function of the other two main populations and convey a DA-mediated antagonistic motor brake. D1/D2-SPNs project exclusively to the external globus pallidus (GPe) and have specific electrophysiological features with distinctive integration of DA signals. Optogenetic stimulation and loss-of-function experiments indicated that D1/D2-SPNs potentiate the prokinetic and antikinetic functions of D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs, respectively, and restrain the integrated motor response to psychostimulants. Overall, our findings demonstrate the essential role of this third unacknowledged population of D1/D2 co-expressing neurons, which orchestrates the fine-tuning of DA regulation in the thalamo-cortico-striatal loops.

                In many situations of everyday life, it is important to quickly understand a spoken message despite distraction by an already ongoing activity. Previous dual-task studies recording the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP) have shown that auditory language comprehension can be strongly delayed by temporally overlapping additional tasks. In the current study, we investigated whether this interference is aggravated by the need for saccadic eye movements and visuospatial attention shifts in the overlapping task. In two dual-task experiments, a synonymy judgment task for spoken words was combined with a visual discrimination task at different stimulus onset asynchronies. In half of the trials, the primary visual task required a 10 degree exogenous saccade towards a peripheral stimulus. The timing of semantic processing in the secondary task was assessed by recording the N400. We replicated that with increasing temporal overlap between the tasks, the N400 component was strongly delayed. However, additional saccade-related processes in the primary task had no detrimental effects on concurrent spoken language processing on their own. Unexpectedly, we also observed that a preceding saccade consistently facilitated subsequent motoric processing in the visual task (as indexed by manual reaction times and the lateralized readiness potential), suggesting that saccade execution as such can significantly enhance subsequent processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A visual representation of the hand in the resting somatomotor regions of the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Hands are regularly in sight in everyday life. This visibility affects motor control, perception, and attention, as visual information is integrated into an internal model of sensorimotor control. Spontaneous brain activity, i.e., ongoing activity in the absence of an active task (rest), is correlated among somatomotor regions that are jointly activated during motor tasks1. Moreover, recent studies suggest that spontaneous activity patterns do not only replay at rest task activation patterns, but also maintain a model of the statistical regularities (priors) of the body and environment, which may be used to predict upcoming behavior (Raichle et al,2011; Betti et al, 2021; Pezzulo, 2021). Here we test whether spontaneous activity in the human somatomotor cortex is modulated by visual stimuli that display hands vs. non-hand stimuli, and by the use/action they represent. We analyzed activity with fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to examine the similarity between spontaneous (rest) activity patterns and task-evoked patterns to the presentation of natural hands, robot hands, gloves, or control stimuli (food). In the left somatomotor cortex we observed a stronger (multi-voxel) spatial correlation between resting-state activity and natural hand picture patterns, as compared to other stimuli. A trend analysis showed that task-rest pattern similarity was influenced by inferred visual and motor attributes (i.e., correlation for hand>robot>glove>food). We did not observe any task-rest similarity in the visual cortex. We conclude that somatomotor brain regions code at rest for visual representations of hand stimuli and their inferred use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signalling speed along a key white matter tract influences memory recall ability in humans</a></h4>

              
                Conduction velocity is the speed at which electrical signals travel along axons and is a crucial determinant of neural communication. Inferences about conduction velocity can now be made in vivo in humans using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and a measure called the MR g-ratio. Here, in the first application to cognition, we found that increased MR g-ratio, and by inference faster conduction velocity, specifically in the parahippocampal cingulum bundle, which connects the hippocampus with a range of other brain areas, was associated with better memory recall ability in 217 healthy adults. Moreover, two tract features seemed to favour better memory retrieval - large inner axon diameters and coherently organised neurites, both of which facilitate speedy signalling. These results offer a new perspective on drivers of individual differences in memory recall ability. More broadly, they show that MR g-ratio can provide novel insights into how the human brain processes and integrates information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extended functional connectivity of convergent structural alterations among individuals with PTSD: A neuroimaging meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder defined by the onset of intrusive, avoidant, negative cognitive or affective, and/or hyperarousal symptoms after witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event. Previous voxel-based morphometry studies have provided insight into structural brain alterations associated with PTSD with notable heterogeneity across these studies. Furthermore, how structural alterations may be associated with brain function, as measured by task-free and task-based functional connectivity, remains to be elucidated. Methods: Using emergent meta-analytic techniques, we sought to first identify a consensus of structural alterations in PTSD using the anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Next, we generated functional profiles of identified convergent structural regions utilizing resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) methods. Finally, we performed functional decoding to examine mental functions associated with our ALE, rsFC, and MACM brain characterizations. Results: We observed convergent structural alterations in a single region located in the medial prefrontal cortex. The resultant rsFC and MACM maps identified functional connectivity across a widespread, whole-brain network that included frontoparietal and limbic regions. Conclusions: Consensus-based functional connectivity was observed in regions of the default mode, salience, and central executive networks, which play a role in the tripartite model of psychopathology. Functional decoding revealed overlapping associations with attention, memory, and emotion processes. Taken together, these findings have important implications in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with PTSD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative study between radiofrequency- and muscimol-induced inhibition of cultured networks of cortical neuron</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that spontaneously active cultured networks of cortical neuron grown planar microelectrode array are sensitive to radiofrequency (RF) fields and exhibit an inhibitory response more pronounced as the exposure time and power increase. To better understand the mechanism behind the observed effects, we aimed at identifying similarities and dissimilarities between the inhibitory effect of RF fields (continuous wave, 1800 MHz) to the {gamma}-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor agonist muscimol (MU). Inhibition of network bursting activity in response to RF exposure became apparent at an SAR level of 28.6 W/kg and co-occurred with an elevation of the culture medium temperature of [~]1 {degrees}C. Differently to a pharmacological inhibition with MU, exposure to RF fields preferentially inhibits bursting over spiking activity and exerts less constrains on neural network bursting synchrony. Network rebound excitation, a phenomenon relying on intrinsic properties of cortical neurons, was observed consecutively to the removal of tonic hyperpolarization after washout of MU but not in response to cessation of RF exposure which implies that hyperpolarization is not the main driving force mediating the inhibitory effects of RF fields. At the level of single neurons, network inhibition induced by MU and RF fields occurred with reduced action potential (AP) half-width. As change in AP waveform tightly influence efficiency of synaptic transmission, the narrowing effect on AP seen under RF exposure might contribute to reduce network bursting activity. By pointing only to a partial overlap between the inhibitory hallmarks of these two forms of inhibition, our data suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms of action of RF fields differ from the ones mediated by the activation of GABAA receptor. The rapid onset of the inhibitory effect of RF fields and its reversibility strikingly similar to MU are in favour of a mechanism interacting with fast operating targets at the membrane such as ion channels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental switch in prediction and adaptation to pain in human neonates</a></h4>

              
                Habituation to recurrent non-threatening or unavoidable noxious stimuli is an important aspect of adaptation to pain and indicates the ability of the brain to encode expectation of imminent nociception. However, it is not known whether the newborn brain can predict and habituate to recurrent noxious inputs. We used electroencephalography to investigate changes in cortical microstates, which represent the complex sequential processing of noxious inputs, following repeated clinically-required heel lances in term and preterm infants. Noxious stimulus repetition decreased the engagement of early sensory-related microstates and associated behavioural and physiological responses in term infants, while preterm infants did not show signs of adaptation. Nevertheless, both groups displayed a switch between different microstates at longer latencies. These data suggests that the preterm brain is capable of encoding high-level contextual differences in pain, but cannot update its prediction, which allows for adaptation, emphasising the vulnerability of this population to recurrent pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attentional rhythms are generated in binocular cells</a></h4>

              
                Visual attention is intrinsically rhythmic and oscillates based on the discrete sampling of either single or multiple objects. Recently, studies employing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and high-temporal behavioral approaches have found that the early visual cortex (V1/V2) modulates attentional rhythms. However, both monocular cells and binocular cells are in the early visual cortex, and whether the neural site of attentional rhythms is monocular cells or binocular cells remains poorly understood. In Experiment 1, we reset the phase of attentional rhythms in one monocular channel (left eye or right eye) by the dichoptic cue and tracked the temporal response function (TRF) of the monocular channel in the left and right eyes separately using time response tracking technology. We found no significant differences in the two TRFs of each monocular eye, suggesting that attention rarely switched between the two eyes, indicating that binocular cells, not monocular cells, are the neural site of attentional rhythms. These results were verified even when resetting the phases of attentional rhythms by a binocular cue in Experiment 2. These results constitute direct neural evidence supporting rhythmic attention theory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-neuron bursts encode pathological oscillations in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor</a></h4>

              
                Deep brain stimulation procedures offer an invaluable opportunity to study disease through intracranial recordings from awake patients. Herein, we address the relationship between single-neuron and aggregate-level (local field potential; LFP) activities in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of patients with Parkinson's disease (n=19) and essential tremor (n=16), respectively. Both disorders have been characterized by pathologically elevated LFP oscillations, as well as an increased tendency for neuronal bursting. Our findings suggest that periodic single-neuron bursts encode both pathophysiological beta (13-33Hz; STN) and tremor (4-10Hz; Vim) LFP oscillations, evidenced by strong time-frequency and phase-coupling relationships between the bursting and LFP signals. Spiking activity occurring outside of bursts had no relationship to the LFP. In STN, bursting activity most commonly preceded the LFP oscillation, suggesting that neuronal bursting generated within STN may give rise to an aggregate-level LFP oscillation. In Vim, LFP oscillations most commonly preceded bursting activity, suggesting that neuronal firing may be entrained by periodic afferent inputs. In both STN and Vim, the phase-coupling relationship between LFP and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) signals closely resembled the relationships between the LFP and single-neuron bursting. This suggests that periodic single-neuron bursting is likely representative of a higher spatial and temporal resolution readout of periodic increases in the amplitude of HFOs, which themselves may be a higher resolution readout of aggregate-level LFP oscillations. Overall, our results may reconcile 'rate' and 'oscillation' models of Parkinson's disease and shed light onto the single-neuron basis and origin of pathophysiological oscillations in movement disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Blood oxygenation-level dependent cerebrovascular reactivity imaging as strategy to monitor CSF-hemoglobin toxicity</a></h4>

              
                PurposeCell-free hemoglobin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-Hb) may be one of the main drivers of secondary brain injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Haptoglobin scavenging of CSF-Hb has been shown to mitigate cerebrovascular disruption. Using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and blood oxygenation-level dependent cerebrovascular reactivity imaging (BOLD-CVR) the aim was to assess the acute toxic effect of CSF-Hb on cerebral blood flow and autoregulation, as well as to test the protective effects of haptoglobin.

MethodsDSA imaging was performed in eight anesthetized and ventilated sheep (mean weight: 80.4 kg) at baseline, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after infusion of hemoglobin (Hb) or co-infusion with haptoglobin (Hb:Haptoglobin) into the left lateral ventricle. Additionally, 10 ventilated sheep (mean weight: 79.8 kg) underwent BOLD-CVR imaging to assess the cerebrovascular reserve capacity.

ResultsDSA imaging did not show a difference in mean transit time or cerebral blood flow. Wholebrain BOLD-CVR compared to baseline decreased more in the Hb group after 15 minutes (Hb vs Hb:Haptoglobin: -0.03 {+/-}0.01 vs -0.01 {+/-}0.02) and remained diminished compared to Hb:Haptoglobin group after 30 minutes (Hb vs Hb:Haptoglobin: -0.03 {+/-}0.01 vs 0.0 {+/-}0.01), 45 minutes (Hb vs Hb:Haptoglobin: -0.03 {+/-}0.01 vs 0.01 {+/-}0.02) and 60 minutes (Hb vs Hb:Haptoglobin: -0.03 {+/-}0.02 vs 0.01 {+/-}0.01).

ConclusionIt is demonstrated that CSF-Hb toxicity leads to rapid cerebrovascular reactivity impairment, which is blunted by haptoglobin co-infusion. BOLD-CVR may therefore be further evaluated as a monitoring strategy for CSF-Hb toxicity after aSAH.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concentration dependent dual effect of the endozepine ODN on neuronal spiking activity</a></h4>

              
                Endozepines, known as the endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine-binding sites, include the diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and its processing products, the triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN) and the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). Despite indisputable evidences of the binding of ODN on GABAAR-BZ-binding sites, their action on this receptor lacks compelling electrophysiological observations, some studies reporting that ODN acts as a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of GABAAR while others suggest the opposite (positive allosteric modulation, PAM effect). All these studies were carried out in vitro with various neuronal cell types. To further elucidate the role of ODN on neuronal excitability, we tested its effect in vivo in the cortex of the anesthetized mouse. Spontaneous neuronal spikes were recorded by the mean of an extracellular pipette in the vicinity of which ODN was micro-infused, either at high dose (10-5M) or low dose (10-11M). ODN at high dose induced a significant increase of neuronal spiking. This effect could be antagonized by the GABAAR-BZ-binding sites blocker flumazenil. In sharp contrast, at low concentration, ODN reduced neuronal spiking in a magnitude similar to GABA itself. Interestingly, this decrease of neuronal activity by low dose of ODN was not flumazenil dependent suggesting that this effect is mediated by another receptor. Finally, we show that astrocytes in culture, known to be stimulated by picomolar dose of ODN via a GPCR, increased their export of GABA when stimulated by low dose of ODN. Our results confirm the versatility of ODN in the control of GABA transmission, but suggest that its PAM-like effect is, at least in part, mediated via an astrocytic non-GABAAR ODN receptor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of experiencing CS-US pairings on instructed fear reversal</a></h4>

              
                Fear learning allows us to identify and anticipate aversive events, and adapt our behavior accordingly. This is often thought to rely on associative learning mechanisms where an initially neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), eventually leading to the CS also being perceived as aversive and threatening. Importantly, however, humans also show verbal fear learning. Namely, they have the ability to change their responses to stimuli rapidly through verbal instructions about CS-US pairings. Past research on the link between experience-based and verbal fear learning indicated that verbal instructions about a reversal of CS-US pairings can fully override the effects of previously experienced CS-US pairings, as measured through fear ratings, skin conductance, and fear-potentiated startle. However, it remains an open question whether such instructions can also annul memory traces in the brain. Here, we used a fear reversal paradigm in conjunction with representational similarity analysis of fMRI data to test whether verbal instructions fully override the effects of experienced CS-US pairings in fear-related brain regions or not. Previous research suggests that only the right amygdala should show lingering representations of previously experienced threat (a so-called "Pavlovian trace"). Unexpectedly, we found evidence for the residual effect of prior CS-US experience to be much more widespread than anticipated, in the amygdala but also cortical regions like the dorsal anterior cingulate or dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex. This finding shines a new light on the interaction of different fear learning mechanisms, at times with unexpected consequences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">MicroRNA inhibition using antimiRs in acute human brain tissue sections</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: An emerging pre-clinical approach for the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy is targeting the microRNA (miRNA) system. MiRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that suppress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Targeting miRNAs, which is possible using antisense oligonucleotide antimiRs can produce broad effects on gene expression suited to the complex pathophysiology in temporal lobe epilepsy. Potent anti-seizure and disease-modifying effects have been reported for antimiRs targeting microRNA-134 (antimiR-134). To date, however, pre-clinical testing has been performed using in vitro cell cultures and rodent models. It is uncertain how well this approach will translate to the clinic. Here, we develop an antimiR testing platform in human brain tissue sections. Methodology: Human brain specimens were obtained with consent from patients undergoing resective surgery to treat focal drug-resistant epilepsy. Neocortical specimens were submerged in modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), dissected for clinical neuropathological examination, and unused material transferred for sectioning. Individual tissue sections were incubated in oxygenated ACSF, containing either antimiR-134 or a non-targeting control antimiR, for 24 hours at room temperature. RNA integrity was assessed using BioAnalyzer processing, and individual miRNA levels measured using RT-qPCR. Results: ACSF transport had no obvious impact on any clinical neurosurgical or neuropathological procedure and specimens were confirmed to be viable following this process. RNA was well-preserved by transportation of specimens in ACSF, with RNA integrity scores significantly higher than tissue transported without ACSF. AntimiR-134 mediated a specific and dose-dependent knockdown of miR-134 in human neocortical sections, with approximately 75% reduction of miR-134 at 1 M and 90% reduction at 3 M. These doses did not have off-target effects on expression of a selection of three other miRNAs (miR-10, miR-129 or miR-132). Significance: This is the first demonstration of antimiR-134 effects in live human brain tissues. The findings lend further support to the preclinical development of miR-134 and offer a flexible platform for the pre-clinical testing of antimiRs, and other antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, in human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The pitfalls of measuring representational similarityusing representational similarity analysis</a></h4>

              
                A core challenge in neuroscience is to assess whether diverse systems represent the world similarly. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) is an innovative approach to address this problem and has become increasingly popular across disciplines from machine learning to computational neuroscience. Despite these successes, RSA regularly uncovers difficult-to-reconcile and contradictory findings. Here we demonstrate the pitfalls of using RSA to infer representational similarity and explain how contradictory findings arise and support false inferences when left unchecked. By comparing neural representations in primate, human and computational models, we reveal two problematic phenomena that are ubiquitous in current research: a 'mimic' effect, where confounds in stimuli can lead to high RSA scores between provably dissimilar systems, and a 'modulation effect', where RSA-scores become dependent on stimuli used for testing. Since our results bear on existing findings and inferences, we provide recommendations to avoid these pitfalls and sketch a way forward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Analysis of non-human primate models for evaluating prion disease therapeutic efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Prion disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by the conformational corruption of the prion protein (PrP), encoded by the prion protein gene (PRNP). While no disease-modifying therapy is currently available, genetic and pharmacological proofs of concept support development of therapies that lower PrP levels in the brain. In light of proposals for clinical testing of such drugs in presymptomatic individuals at risk for genetic prion disease, extensive nonclinical data are likely to be required, with extra attention paid to choice of animal models. Uniquely, the entire prion disease process can be faithfully modeled through transmission of human prions to non-human primates (NHPs), raising the question of whether NHP models should be used to assess therapeutic efficacy. Here we systematically aggregate data from N=527 prion-inoculated animals spanning six decades of research studies. Using this dataset, we assess prion strain, route of administration, endpoint, and passage number to characterize the relationship of tested models to currently prevalent human subtypes of prion disease. We analyze the incubation times observed across diverse models and perform power calculations to assess the practicability of testing prion disease therapeutic efficacy in NHPs. We find that while some models may theoretically be able to support therapeutic efficacy studies, pilot studies would be required to confirm incubation time and attack rate before pivotal studies could be designed, cumulatively requiring several years. The models with the shortest and most tightly distributed incubation times are those with smaller brains and weaker homology to humans. Our findings indicate that it would be challenging to conduct efficacy studies in NHPs in a paradigm that honors the potential advantages of NHPs over other available models, on a timeframe that would not risk unduly delaying patient access to promising drug candidates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The strength of feedback processing is associated with resistance to visual backward masking during illusory contour processing in adult humans.</a></h4>

              
                Re-entrant feedback processing is a key mechanism of visual object-recognition, especially under compromised viewing conditions where only sparse information is available and object features must be interpolated. Illusory contour stimuli are commonly used in conjunction with visual evoked potentials (VEP) to study these filling-in processes, with characteristic modulation of the VEP in the ~100-150ms timeframe associated with this re-entrant processing. Substantial inter-individual variability in timing and amplitude of feedback-related VEP modulation is observed, raising the question whether this variability might underlie inter-individual differences in the ability to form strong perceptual gestalts. Backward masking paradigms have been used to study inter-individual variance in the ability to form robust object perceptions before processing of the mask interferes with object-recognition. Some individuals recognize objects when the time between target object and mask is extremely short, whereas others struggle to do so even at longer target-to-mask intervals. We asked whether timing and amplitude of feedback-related VEP modulations were associated with individual differences in resistance to backward masking. Participants (N=40) showed substantial performance variability in detecting illusory contours at intermediate target-to-mask intervals (67ms and 117ms), allowing us to use kmeans clustering to divide the population into four performance groups (poor, low-average, high-average, superior). There was a clear relationship between the amplitude (but not the timing) of feedback-related VEP modulation and illusory contour detection during backward masking. We conclude that individual differences in the strength of feedback processing in neurotypical humans lead to differences in the ability to quickly establish perceptual awareness of incomplete visual objects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The theta paradox: 4-8 Hz EEG oscillations reflect both local sleep and cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Human brain activity generates electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations that characterize specific behavioral and vigilance states. The frequency of these oscillations is typically sufficient to distinguish a given state, however theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) have instead been found in near-opposite conditions of drowsiness during sleep deprivation and alert cognitive control. While the latter has been extensively studied and is often referred to as "frontal midline theta", the former has been investigated far less but is considered to be a marker for local sleep during wake. In this study we investigated to what extent theta oscillations differed during cognitive tasks and sleep deprivation. We measured high-density EEG in 18 young healthy adults performing 6 tasks under 3 levels of sleep deprivation. We found both cognitive load and sleep deprivation increased theta power in medial prefrontal cortical areas, however sleep deprivation caused additional increases in theta in many other, predominantly frontal, areas. The sources of sleep deprivation theta were task-dependent, with a visual-spatial task and short-term memory task showing the most widespread effects. Notably, theta was highest in supplementary motor areas during passive music listening, and highest in the inferior temporal cortex during a spatial game. This suggests that theta caused by sleep deprivation may preferentially occur in cortical areas not involved in ongoing behavior. While our results find differences in topography from frontal midline theta, they raise the possibility that a common mechanism may underly both theta oscillations during cognition and during sleep deprivation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivating ordinal position information from auditory sequence memory in human brains</a></h4>

              
                Retaining a sequence of events in their order is a core ability of many cognitive functions, such as speech recognition, movement control, and episodic memory. Although content representations have been widely studied in working memory (WM), little is known about how ordinal position information of an auditory sequence is retained in the human brain as well as its coding characteristics. In fact, there is still a lack of an efficient approach to directly access the stored ordinal position code, since the neural activities enter a relatively 'activity-silent' WM state during WM retention. Here participants performed an auditory sequence WM task with their brain activities recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). We developed new triggering events that could successfully reactivate neural representations of ordinal position from the 'activity-silent' retention stage. Importantly, the rank reactivation is further related to recognition behavior, confirming its indexing of WM storage. Furthermore, the ordinal position code displays an intriguing 'stable-dynamic' format, i.e., undergoing the same dynamic neutral trajectory during both encoding and retention (whenever reactivated). Overall, our results provide an effective approach to accessing the behaviorally-relevant ordinal position information in auditory sequence WM and reveal its new temporal characteristics.

                Efforts to predict trait phenotypes based on functional MRI data from large cohorts have been hampered by low prediction accuracy and/or small effect sizes. Although these findings are highly replicable, the small effect sizes are somewhat surprising given the presumed brain basis of phenotypic traits such as neuroticism and fluid intelligence. We aim to replicate previous work and additionally test multiple data manipulations that may improve prediction accuracy by addressing data pollution challenges. Specifically, we added additional fMRI features, averaged the target phenotype across multiple measurements to obtain more accurate estimates of the underlying trait, balanced the target phenotype's distribution through undersampling of majority scores, and identified data-driven subtypes to investigate the impact of between-participant heterogeneity. Our results replicated prior results from Dadi et a (2021) in a larger sample. Each data manipulation further led to small but consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, which were largely additive when combining multiple data manipulations. Combining data manipulations (i.e., extended fMRI features, averaged target phenotype, balanced target phenotype distribution) led to a three-fold increase in prediction accuracy for fluid intelligence compared to prior work. These findings highlight the benefit of several relatively easy and low-cost data manipulations, which may positively impact future work.

                Prospective outcomes bias behavior in a "Pavlovian" manner: Reward prospect invigorates action, while punishment prospect suppresses it. Theories have posited Pavlovian biases as global action "priors" in unfamiliar or uncontrollable environments. However, this account fails to explain the strength of these biases---causing frequent action slips---even in well-known environments. We propose that Pavlovian control is additionally useful if flexibly recruited by instrumental control. Specifically, instrumental action plans might shape selective attention to reward/ punishment information and thus the input to Pavlovian control. In two eye-tracking samples (N = 35/ 64), we observed that Go/ NoGo action plans influenced when and for how long participants attended to reward/ punishment information, which in turn biased their responses in a Pavlovian manner. Participants with stronger attentional effects showed higher performance. Thus, humans appear to align Pavlovian control with their instrumental action plans, extending its role beyond action defaults to a powerful tool ensuring robust action execution.

                Differential expression of myelin-related genes and changes in myelin thickness have been demonstrated in mice after chronic psychosocial stress, a risk factor for anxiety disorders. To determine whether and how stress affects structural remodeling of nodes of Ranvier, another form of myelin plasticity, we developed a 3D reconstruction analysis of node morphology in C57BL/6NCrl and DBA/2NCrl mice. We identified strain-dependent effects of chronic stress on node morphology, including elongation of paranodes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in DBA/2NCrl mice. Furthermore, chronic chemogenetic activation of the ventral hippocampus-to-mPFC pathway resulted in increased risk assessment behavior and shortened paranodes specifically in stimulated axons, providing a direct link between anxiety-like behavior and remodeling of the nodes. Altogether, our data demonstrate genetic regulation of nodal remodeling in stress and suggest an activity-dependent regulation of paranodes in anxiety-related circuits. Nodal remodeling may thus contribute to the aberrant circuit function associated with anxiety disorders.

                Currently, calcium imaging allows for the long-term recording of large-scale neuronal activity in diverse states. However, it remains difficult to extract neuronal dynamics from recorded imaging data. In this study, we propose an improved CNMF-based algorithm and an effective method for extracting cell shapes with fewer false positives and false negatives caused by image processing. We also showed that the values obtained during image processing can be combined and used for false positive determination of cells. For the CNMF algorithm, we combined cell-by-cell regularization and baseline shrinkage estimation, which greatly improved its stability and robustness. We applied these methods to artificial and real data and confirmed their effectiveness. Our method is simpler and faster, detects more cells with lower firing rates and signal-to-noise ratios, and enhance the quality of the extracted cell signals. These advances can improve the standard of downstream analysis and contribute to progress in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probing different paradigms of morphine withdrawal on sleep behavior in male and female C57BL/6J mice</a></h4>

              
                The opioid epidemic has increased dramatically over the last few decades resulting in many suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD). The prevalence of opioids and opioid overdose has been driven by the development of new synthetic opioids, increased availability of prescription opioids, and more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. As we see increased in exposure to opioids, the United States has also seen increases in the frequency of instances of Narcan (naloxone) administration as a life saving measure for respiratory depression, and, thus, consequently, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Sleep dysregulation is one of the main symptoms of OUD and opioid withdrawal syndrome, and therefore should be a key facet of animal models of OUD. Here we examine the effect of precipitated and spontaneous morphine withdrawal on sleep behaviors in C57BL/6J. We find that morphine administration and withdrawal dysregulates sleep, however not equally across morphine exposure paradigms and not qualitatively the same across sexes. Furthermore, many environmental triggers promote relapse to drug seeking/taking behavior, and the stress of disrupted sleep may fall into that category. We find that sleep deprivation dysregulates sleep in mice that had previous opioid withdrawal experience. These data suggest that the 3-day precipitated withdrawal paradigm has the most profound effects on opioid induced sleep dysregulation, and that further validate the construct of the 3-day precipitated withdrawal model as a model for opioid dependence and OUD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mouse mutants in schizophrenia risk genes GRIN2A and AKAP11 show EEG abnormalities in common with schizophrenia patients</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis, whose etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Exome sequencing studies have uncovered rare, loss-of-function variants that greatly increase risk of schizophrenia, including loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A (aka GluN2A or NR2A, encoding the NMDA receptor subunit 2A) and AKAP11 (A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 11). AKAP11 and GRIN2A mutations are also associated with bipolar disorder, and epilepsy and developmental delay/intellectual disorder, respectively. Accessible in both humans and rodents, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings offer a window into brain activity and display abnormal features in schizophrenia patients. Does loss of Grin2a or Akap11 in mice also result in EEG abnormalities? METHODS: We monitored EEG in heterozygous and homozygous knockout Grin2a and Akap11 mutant mice compared with their wild-type littermates, at 3- and 6-months of age, across the sleep/wake cycle and during auditory stimulation protocols. RESULTS: Grin2a and Akap11 mutants exhibited increased resting gamma power, attenuated 40-50 Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR), and reduced responses to unexpected auditory stimuli during mismatch negativity (MMN) tests. Sleep spindle density was reduced in a gene dose-dependent manner in Akap11 mutants, whereas Grin2a mutants showed increased sleep spindle density. CONCLUSIONS: The EEG phenotypes of Grin2a and Akap11 mutant mice show a variety of abnormal features that overlap considerably with human schizophrenia patients, reflecting systems-level changes caused by Grin2a and Akap11 deficiency. These neurophysiologic findings further substantiate Grin2a and Akap11 mutants as genetic models of schizophrenia and identify potential biomarkers for stratification of schizophrenia patients.

	<p>This study investigated the characteristics of cognitive impairment in patients with white matter lesions (WMLs) caused by cerebral small vessel disease and the corresponding changes in WM microstructures. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 50 patients with WMLs and 37 healthy controls were collected. Patients were divided into vascular cognitive impairment non-dementia and vascular dementia groups. Tract-based spatial statistics showed that patients with WMLs had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) values throughout the WM areas but predominately in the forceps minor, forceps major (FMA), bilateral corticospinal tract, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and anterior thalamic radiation, compared to the control group. These fiber bundles were selected as regions of interest. There were significant differences in the FA, MD, AD, and RD values (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) between groups. The DTI metrics of all fiber bundles significantly correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), with the exception of the AD values of the FMA and ILF. Patients with WMLs showed changes in diffusion parameters in the main WM fiber bundles. Quantifiable changes in WM microstructure are the main pathological basis of cognitive impairment, and may serve as a biomarker of WMLs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid and Lasting Effects of Activating BDNF-Expressing PVH Neurons on Energy Balance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), are implicit in causing obesity. Mutations that reduce BDNF and TrkB expression are associated with obesity in humans and mice. Recently, it was reported that <I>Bdnf</I> gene deletion in the neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) caused positive energy balance and severe obesity in the form of hyperphagia, impaired adaptive thermogenesis, and decreased energy expenditure. Thus, we hypothesize that activation of these neurons will have the opposite effect and provide an opportunity for long-lasting obesity treatment. To specifically activate BDNF-expressing PVH (PVH<sup>BDNF</sup>) neurons, we injected Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the excitatory DREADD hM3Dq bilaterally into the PVH of <I>Bdnf<sup>2A-Cre/+</sup></I> knock-in mice and then administered clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Using this technique, we demonstrated that acute activation of these neurons rapidly decreased normal nocturnal feeding and fasting-induced feeding in male and female mice. At thermoneutral temperatures, acute activation also rapidly increased adaptive thermogenesis, increased core body temperature, increased locomotion, increased energy expenditure, and decreased respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in male and female mice. These observations indicate that acute stimulation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons promotes negative energy balance and weight loss. However, the rapid decrease in RER after activation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons was followed by a delayed and prolonged increase in RER that remained elevated for 3 d in female mice. Thus, although acute activation of PVH<sup>BDNF</sup> neurons promotes negative energy balance in the short term, long-term effects of activation include sexually dimorphic overcompensatory mechanisms that may promote positive energy balance in female mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Egr1 Is Necessary for Forebrain Dopaminergic Signaling during Social Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Finding the link between behaviors and their regulatory molecular pathways is a major obstacle in treating neuropsychiatric disorders. The immediate early gene (IEG) <I>EGR1</I> is implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and is linked to gene pathways associated with social behavior. Despite extensive knowledge of <I>EGR1</I> gene regulation at the molecular level, it remains unclear how EGR1 deficits might affect the social component of these disorders. Here, we examined the social behavior of zebrafish with a mutation in the homologous gene <I>egr1</I>. Mutant fish exhibited reduced social approach and orienting, whereas other sensorimotor behaviors were unaffected. On a molecular level, expression of the dopaminergic biosynthetic enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), was strongly decreased in TH-positive neurons of the anterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus. These neurons are connected with basal forebrain (BF) neurons associated with social behavior. Chemogenetic ablation of around 30% of TH-positive neurons in this preoptic region reduced social attraction to a similar extent as the <I>egr1</I> mutation. These results demonstrate the requirement of Egr1 and dopamine signaling during social interactions, and identify novel circuitry underlying this behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">P3b Does Not Reflect Perceived Contrasts</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>It has been shown that P3b is not a signature of perceptual awareness per se but is instead more closely associated with postperceptual processing (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">Cohen et al., 2020</cross-ref>). Here, we seek to investigate whether human participants&rsquo; attentional states are different in the report and the no-report conditions. This difference in attentional states, if exists, may lead to degraded consciousness of the stimuli in the no-report condition, and it therefore remains unknown whether the disappearance of P3b is because of a lack of reportability or degraded consciousness. Results of our experiment 1 showed that participants did experience degraded contents of consciousness in the no-report condition. However, results of experiment 2 showed that the degraded contents of consciousness did <I>not</I> influence the amplitude of P3b. These findings strengthen the claim that P3b is <I>not</I> a signature of perceptual awareness but is associated with postperceptual processing.</p>
