              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Term Effects of Repeated Social Defeat Stress on Brain Activity during Social Interaction in BALB/c Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Understanding the long-term effects of stress on brain function is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of depression. The BALB/c mouse strain has high susceptibility to stress and is thus an effective model for depression. The long-term effects of repeated social defeat stress (SDS) on BALB/c mice, however, are not clear. Here, we investigated the effects of repeated SDS in male BALB/c mice over the subsequent two weeks. Some defeated mice immediately exhibited social avoidance, whereas anxiety-like behavior was only evident at later periods. Furthermore, defeated mice segregated into two groups based on the level of social avoidance, namely, avoidant and nonavoidant mice. The characteristic of avoidance or nonavoidance in each individual was not fixed over the two weeks. In addition, we developed a semi-automated method for analyzing c-Fos expression in the mouse brain to investigate the effect of repeated SDS on brain activity more than two weeks after the end of the stress exposure. Following social interaction, c-Fos expression was reduced in several brain regions in the defeated mice compared with control mice. The correlation of c-Fos expression among these brain areas, with exception of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and central amygdala (CeA), was increased in defeated mice, suggesting increased synchrony. Notably, c-Fos expression in the lateral habenula (LHb) was different between mice that exhibited social avoidance from immediately after the repeated SDS and those that exhibited social avoidance only at later periods. These observations provide insight into the long-term effects of social stress on behavior and brain activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">SMART: An Open-Source Extension of WholeBrain for Intact Mouse Brain Registration and Segmentation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mapping immediate early gene (IEG) expression across intact mouse brains allows for unbiased identification of brain-wide activity patterns underlying complex behaviors. Accurate registration of sample brains to a common anatomic reference is critical for precise assignment of IEG-positive ("active") neurons to known brain regions of interest (ROIs). While existing automated voxel-based registration methods provide a high-throughput solution, they require substantial computing power, can be difficult to implement and fail when brains are damaged or only partially imaged. Additionally, it is challenging to cross-validate these approaches or compare them to any preexisting literature based on serial coronal sectioning. Here, we present the open-source R package SMART (Semi-Manual Alignment to Reference Templates) that extends the WholeBrain R package framework to automated segmentation and semi-automated registration of intact mouse brain light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) datasets. The SMART package was created for novice programmers and introduces a streamlined pipeline for aligning, registering, and segmenting LSFM volumetric datasets across the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, using a simple "choice game" and interactive menus. SMART provides the flexibility to register whole brains, partial brains or discrete user-chosen images, and is fully compatible with traditional sectioned coronal slice-based analyses. We demonstrate SMART&rsquo;s core functions using example datasets and provide step-by-step video tutorials for installation and implementation of the package. We also present a modified iDISCO+ tissue clearing procedure for uniform immunohistochemical labeling of the activity marker Fos across intact mouse brains. The SMART pipeline, in conjunction with the modified iDISCO+ Fos procedure, is ideally suited for examination and orthogonal cross-validation of brain-wide neuronal activation datasets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Shifting the water paradigm from social good to economic good and the state’s role in fulfilling the right to water [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The problem currently faced is the availability of water to meet human needs, which is decreasing in number. On the one hand, there is a view that water is a commodity (economic good) while on the other hand says that water is a social good. These different approaches influence state policies in water management on how the state regulates and manages water in fulfilling the right to water for their citizens. The right to water implies that everyone should have access to water without discrimination. Methods: This study uses a normative approach, which reviewing water as social economic issues and adjusting by the legal rules relating to water and human rights. Results: Changing the paradigm of water from social goods to economic goods, this change is also based on water scarcity faced not only by one country but has become a global issue. Economic issues are the main topic in the global conversation, by reducing water in a social perspective, which should be the responsibility of the state as Article 33 paragraph (3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia 1945. This legal basis has logical consequences for the state to keep water as a social commodity oriented to the public interest. Conclusions: The pattern of economic approaches through privatization in the management of water resources has resulted in co-opting water as a collective source of life. Water is forced in commercial motivation rather than as a constitutive element that regulates water for the "sustainability of collective life" and "to the maximum extent possible for the prosperity of society." The fulfillment of the right to water by the state certainly cannot be directly fulfilled, the important thing is that there are progressive efforts to fulfill it, with community involvement in the management of water resources, especially local communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Establishment of diagnostic reference level and radiation dose variation in head & neck and pelvis treatment planning in radiation therapy computed tomography [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This observational study aims to establish a discrepancy in the radiation dose distributed for head & neck and pelvis localization in Computed Tomography (CT) imaging in radiation therapy. The objective and need of the current study are to establish Diagnostic Reference Level (DRL) for head & neck and pelvic CT protocols in Radiation Therapy planning and compare them with other regional, national and international DRL. The established DRL will be used to find further optimized DRL for Radiation Therapy Computed Tomography (RTCT). Methods: A total of 120 patients with Head & Neck cancers and 90 patients with pelvic cancers to be treated with radiotherapy prescribed for the RTCT with ages above 18 years old and above were included in the current study. The advanced Philips 16 slice big bore CT acquired all the CT simulation images. Results: Third quartile standards of Dose Length Product and effective dose for Head & Neck, and pelvis were 790.65mGy.cm, 2.45179 mSv, and 999.7 mGy.cm, 15.48mSv respectively. The third quartile CTDIvol value for the same order of procedure is 17.6 mGy. Tube voltage of 120kVp and 300mAs and used for radiotherapy planning. Conclusion: The first regional Radiation therapy Computed tomography simulation Diagnostic reference levels have been projected and deliver a platform for dose evaluation and optimization due to the limited number of papers on radiation therapy, computed tomography, and diagnostic reference levels. Comparison with previously available RT CT diagnostic reference levels indicated some radiation dose variation, so exposure parameters should be revised and improved.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">‘Comparison and correlation of the maxillary sinus dimensions in various craniofacial patterns: A CBCT Study’ [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND  To compare and correlate the maxillary sinus dimensions and basal bone height among various facial patterns using CBCT for advanced diagnosis and treatment planning in Orthodontics. METHODS 66 CBCT images within age group of 18-30 years were divided into horizontal (Group 1), average (Group 2) and vertical (Group 3) facial growth patterns. Maxillary sinus dimensions were compared and correlated in all three groups. The sinus height and basal bone height were recorded at 3 locations-between 1st premolar and 2nd premolar (PM1-PM2), between 2nd premolar and 1st Molar (PM2-M1) and between 1st and 2nd molar (M1-M2). RESULTS Overall reduction in sinus height and significantly reduced sinus volume was seen in Group-1. Longest maxillary sinus height in M1-M2 region and shortest in PM1-PM2 region was seen in Group-3. The basal bone height in PM1-PM2 region was significantly longer in Group-3 than in Group-1(p<.05).Shortest basal bone height in M1-M2 region was seen in Group-3. A significant negative correlation was seen between the maxillary sinus height and the basal bone height in Group-1 and Group-3(p<.05). CONCLUSION There is a correlation between the maxillary sinus height and basal bone height with that of facial pattern which needs to be considered during orthodontic treatment planning and while carrying out facial growth modification procedures in younger patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Translation, validity and reliability of the Danish version of the Adolescent Insomnia Questionnaire [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Adolescent Insomnia Questionnaire (AIQ), English version, is the only validated screening measure developed specifically to identify insomnia symptoms in adolescents. To date, no specific screening tool for adolescent insomnia is present in Danish language. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the AIQ in a sample of Danish adolescents. Methods: The AIQ underwent a process of forward-backward translation and pilot testing. Subsequently, data were collected at baseline and two-week follow-up from adolescents aged 11-19, who completed both the AIQ and an available adult measure of insomnia (the Athens Insomnia Scale, AIS). The internal consistency, test-retest reliability and convergent validity were assessed. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify the latent factors underlying the questionnaire. Results: At baseline 185 adolescents (18% males and 82% females, mean age 16.0 years) and 102 (55.1%) at two-week follow-up completed the questionnaires. The AIQ showed excellent internal consistency for the total score (Cronbach's a: 0.88) and good convergent validity with the AIS total score (Pearson’s correlation value= 0.86, P<0.001). The test-retest reliability at two weeks was very satisfactory (ICC coefficient = 0.89; 95% CI 0.84, 0.92). Results from the exploratory factor analysis identified a three-model solution corresponding to the same three-model solution identified within the original development sample. Conclusions: The Danish version of the AIQ demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency, test-retest reliability and validity, which supports its use as a screening tool for the identification of insomnia symptoms in adolescents, including Danish-speaking adolescents.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Buprenorphine-precipitated fentanyl withdrawal treated with high-dose buprenorphine [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the mu-opioid receptor, is an increasingly prescribed medication for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder. When this medication is taken in the context of active opioid use, precipitated withdrawal can occur, leading to acute onset of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Fentanyl complicates use of buprenorphine, as it slowly releases from body stores and can lead to higher risk of precipitated withdrawal. Objectives: Describe the successful management of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal from fentanyl with high doses of buprenorphine. We seek to highlight how no adverse effects occurred in this patient and illustrate his stable transition to outpatient treatment. Case report: We present the case of a patient with severe opioid use disorder who presented in moderately severe opioid withdrawal after taking non-prescribed buprenorphine-naloxone which precipitated opioid withdrawal from daily fentanyl use. He was treated with high doses of buprenorphine, 148 mg over the first 48 hours, averaging 63 mg per day over four days. The patient reported rapid improvement in withdrawal symptoms without noted side effects and was able to successfully taper to 16 mg twice daily by discharge. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine at high doses for treatment of precipitated withdrawal. While other options include symptomatic withdrawal management, initiating methadone or less researched options like ketamine, utilizing buprenorphine can preserve or re-establish confidence in this life-saving medication. This case also increases the previously documented upper boundary on buprenorphine dosing for withdrawal and should provide additional confidence in its use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Module intervention to improve involvement and practices of fathers towards infant and young child feeding (IYCF) in Coastal South India - a randomized controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Overall child health depends on nutrition and its related practices. At the family level, responsibility of child feeding lies with both parents. There is no uniform and systematic way to determine and assess the practices of fathers in infant and young child feeding (IYCF). Also, there is a paucity of evidence related to interventions for fathers in improving their practices and involvement in the feeding of their infant or young child (aged less than two years). Methods: This was a community-based randomized control trial, conducted among 120 fathers with infants and/or young children in Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka. Fathers with poor level of involvement and practices towards IYCF, during the initial assessment, were included as the study participants. For the intervention, a module in the flipchart format was developed. Simple randomization technique was used to allot the participants into two groups - intervention and control. Participants in the intervention group received module intervention, in addition to the care which they received routinely, and the control group received only routine care. The participants in the intervention group were paid a monthly visit to implement the module, for six months. The post-intervention assessment was done at the end of 6 months. Results: A total of 117 participants provided post-intervention data. The mean age was 34.7 (+/- 5.48) years in the intervention group and 34.36 years (+/- 5.26) in the control group. The intervention group had a significant improvement in knowledge, attitude, and practice components at 6 months. We noted higher change scores for the intervention group (p<0.05). Conclusions: The extent of increase in practice and involvement in child feeding was clearly higher among the intervention group. The module developed was successful in improving the practices of fathers in feeding their infants and young children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">How did the US and UK markets react to the COVID-19 vaccines’ announcements? A preliminary assessment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major public health and economic disruption. At the same time, a pandemic allows researchers to assess market efficiency; namely, whether, to what extent, and how swiftly stock markets incorporated information related to COVID-19. Soon after the outbreak of the pandemic, research on this front was conducted, with a particular focus on the United States of America (US) market. However, new major events linked to the pandemic have unfolded: a number of vaccines were announced and authorized. The research available in relation to market efficiency relative to vaccine availability is scant. The aim of this study was to assess market efficiency hypotheses with regards to the US and United Kingdom (UK) markets, investigating the impact of the promising news of the vaccines’ successful trials and, subsequently, their authorization. Methods: This work considered data from the S&P500 for the US market and the FTSE100 for the UK market. The time interval considered ranged from the date positive results of vaccines’ trials were first announced, 18 November 2020, until up to two months after the vaccines’ authorization that happened later in December 2020. For both markets, we analyzed the daily returns, cumulative returns, standard deviation and average returns. Results: In both the US and the UK, there was a positive effect of the vaccines’ announcements in terms of increase in the daily returns. However, the standard deviation was not found to increase substantially, notwithstanding the increase in the COVID-19 cases worldwide and the potential lockdown in several countries, as well as the fear from new coronavirus strains that the new vaccines might not be protect against. Conclusions: Whilst both markets displayed an increase in the average return following the vaccines’ announcements, the UK market seemed to reflect vaccines’ announcements faster than the US market.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Potential impact of great lockdown on students’ knowledge, attitude and practices towards the COVID-19 outbreak [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite variation in the types of COVID-19 vaccines and genetic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, using preventive measures remains the first choice to reduce risks associated with COVID-19 infection. Methods: This cross-sectional study highlights students’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward SARS-CoV-2 infection during the lockdown. The study was conducted at the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Data was collected from 43 male preparatory students via an online self-structured questionnaire. Knowledge level was determined using mean scores, while chi-square and t-tests were performed to detect significant differences between groups. Results: Males aged 17–20 displayed better knowledge regarding COVID-19 than other groups (t = 2.03, p = 0.049). Most participants recognized the typical symptoms and transmission routes; 93% indicated they viewed social distancing as a crucial preventive measure. Following lockdown, a 1.7-fold increase in the number of participants who believed that mask-wearing was an effective preventive measure was observed; however, 37.2% did not trust this practice. There was a 2.2-fold increase in the number of participants who took part in awareness programs during lockdown. Students’ knowledge increased from 73.2% to 81.5% following the lockdown. Specifically, mean knowledge regarding the role of contaminated tools in disease transmission increased from 33.7% to 75.5%. After lockdown, 58.1% of participants were anxious and afraid of having contact with their colleagues, while 39.5% missed their classes due to anxiety. Two sources of information impacted students’ knowledge following the lockdown: university studies (t = 2.149, p = 0.038) and friends (t = 2.6, p = 0.013). Conclusions: The findings suggest that IAU preparatory-year students have acceptable knowledge, awareness, and attitudes towards COVID-19 infection. This reflects the impact of media on the improvement in preventive measure uptake. Knowledge of the pandemic may increase if health education programs are designed to target students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of beliefs, knowledge, and attitude on herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicines are gaining a greater degree of popularity as complementary and alternative medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, there is a lack of data concerning the rationale for and factors influencing their use. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based online study involving 1,621 participants was conducted to explore the effects of magical health beliefs, holistic health beliefs, knowledge, and pro- complementary alternative medicine (CAM) attitudes on herbal medicine use in the Indonesian population. Results: Logistic regression findings showed that knowledge about herbal medicines was independently and positively associated with herbal medicine use to a greater extent than herbal medicine non-use (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval; CI = 1.16 to 1.24). The participants who used herbal medicines had a greater magical health belief score than herbal medicine non-users, with AOR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.06. Moreover, holistic health beliefs and pro-CAM attitudes were also found to be independently associated with herbal medicine use. Conclusion: These findings alert nurses to assess the roles of magical health beliefs, holistic health belief, knowledge, and attitudes toward herbal medicine use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Research in child and adolescent anxiety and depression: treatment uncertainties prioritised by youth and professionals [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A starting point for evaluating the effectiveness of treatments should be to identify evidence gaps. Furthermore, such evaluations should consider the perspectives of patients, clinicians and carers to ensure relevance and potentially influence future research initiatives. Methods: Our approach, inspired by the James Lind Alliance methods, involved three steps. First, we performed a document analysis by identifying interventions and outcomes in two recently published overviews of systematic reviews, which summarised the effects of interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. Second, we surveyed children and adolescents with personal experiences of depression or anxiety as well as clinicians, and asked them to suggest treatments and outcomes associated with uncertainty. Finally, we facilitated a consensus process where clinicians and youth mental health patient representatives were invited to prioritise research uncertainties in separate consensus processes. Results: The survey included 674 respondents who reported a total of 1267 uncertainties. Independent coding by four investigators revealed 134 suggestions for treatments of anxiety, 90 suggestions for treatments of depression, 84 for outcomes of interventions for anxiety and 71 suggestions for outcomes of interventions for depression. Two separate priority setting workshops with eight clinicians and ten youth resulted in four independent top ten priority lists. Conclusion: Top ten lists of treatments and outcome domains of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents was identified by youth and clinicians. The results may influence the research agenda, and ultimately benefit patients.

                Background: Both smoked and smokeless tobacco use have deleterious effects on most major organ systems including the reproductive system. We conducted a systematic review on smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and reproductive outcomes among women. Methods: We searched Pubmed, ProQuest, Cochrane, Wiley and Emerald databases for studies involving smokeless tobacco use in women with any or a combination of three conditions: infertility, menstrual disorders and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Eligibility criteria included English language publications from 1st January 1990 - 31st October 2020. CADIMA software used for filtering the studies and modified SIGN checklist for the quality assessment. The findings are reported as per the PRISMA guidelines. The AXIS and ROBIN E tool were used for assessment of risk of bias. Results: In total, three studies addressed our research question. Two studies addressed infertility (prospective cohort: n=501, cross sectional: n=192) of which, the cross-sectional study compared the mean cotinine levels between those with infertility, menstrual disorders and PID. This study also explored the association between SLT and PID. PID was the most common gynecological complaint. Women with PID had significantly higher urinary cotinine levels = 24.95±12.259) ng/ ml (p=0.0144). Mean urinary cotinine in women with menstrual complaints was 19.32±10.29 ng/ml.  The other study used population-based sampling of 501 couples who attempted pregnancy (enrolled in the LIFE Study).  Results showed that 9% and 2% (n=28) of men used snuff and chewed tobacco respectively. and  few of the women used smokeless tobacco.  Time to pregnancy was shorter among smokeless tobacco users relative to smokers. Conclusions: Available studies exploring associations between SLT and reproductive outcomes are inconclusive due to limitations in the study methodologies. More studies with robust study designs are required from low- and middle-income countries with high prevalence of SLT use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A pilot study assessing the similarity between core outcome sets and outcomes included in health technology assessments [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Core outcome sets (COS) are an agreed standardised collection of outcomes created with representation from all key stakeholders (such as patients, clinicians, researchers), which should be reported as a minimum for all trials in that corresponding clinical area. There has been little research investigating the use of core outcomes in Health technology assessments (HTAs) and none in non-oncology HTAs. This study aimed to assess the similarity between COS and HTA outcomes. Methods: Ten COS published between 2015 and 2019 were selected, with patient participation taken as a proxy measure for a high quality COS. The INAHTA database was used as a source to identify relevant HTAs, which were accessed through the hyperlinks provided. Outcomes selected for these assessments were categorised as either a specific, partial or no match compared to the COS. An additional cohort of non-oncology HTAs published between 2019 and 2021 were identified from the NICE website and compared against a relevant COS. Results: Six hundred and fifty-one HTAs were matched to the ten COS areas, of which 119 were reviewed. Of a possible 1318 core outcome matches, there were 562 (43%) matches, 413 (31%) specific and 149 (11%) partial. NICE HTA matches against corresponding COS ranged from 44% to 100%, with a total of 78% (73/94) matches, 57 (61%) specific and 16 (17%) partial. Conclusion: Further work is required to promote the awareness and implementation of COS within HTAs. The degree of matching between COS and NICE HTA outcomes is encouraging, demonstrating acceptance of COS by HTA producers.

                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and has been a global public health concern. We report coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and 2009 H1N1 Influenza strain in a French patient with pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome.  The patient also had a medical history of pulmonary sarcoidosis with a restrictive ventilatory syndrome and obesity, which would be a supplementary risk to develop a poor outcomes. This case highlights the possible coinfection of two severe SARS-CoV-2 and influenza H1N1 viruses in comorbid patient, which presents a higher risk to extend the care duration. The overlapping clinical features of the two respiratory syndromes is a challenge, and awareness is required to recommend an early differential diagnosis and it’s necessary to adopt the vigilant preventive measures and therapeutic strategies to prevent a deleterious impacts in patients with comorbid factors.

                How LPS attains cytosolic access in vivo is unclear. Vasudevan et al. define a TLR4-independent role for CD14 in the cytosolic localization of LPS, triggering noncanonical inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in vivo. This finding positions CD14 as an integral component of both extracellular and intracellular LPS surveillance pathways.

                Cheratta et al. show that AMPK-α1 (but not α2) is cleaved by caspase-3 at Asp529 (TSLD↓S) during the initiation of apoptosis, precisely removing the nuclear export sequence from the C-terminal end. The resulting cleaved AMPK-α1 accumulates in the nucleus and protects cells against cytotoxicity induced by anticancer agents.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">An eIF3d-dependent switch regulates HCMV replication by remodeling the infected cell translation landscape to mimic chronic ER stress</a></h4>

              
                Instead of eIF4E-regulated ribosome loading, Thompson et al. show capped mRNA translation in HCMV-infected cells becomes reliant upon eIF3d. Depleting eIF3d inhibits HCMV replication, reduces polyribosomes, and restricts virus late gene and host chronic ER stress-induced gene expression. Thus, switching to eIF3d-responsive translation tunes gene expression to support virus replication.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Germinal center expansion but not plasmablast differentiation is proportional to peptide-MHCII density via CD40-CD40L signaling strength</a></h4>

              
                Jing et al. show that GC selection and plasmablast differentiation are permissive to lower-affinity clones even in competitive GCs, while maintaining proportional responses based on peptide-MHC density, via CD40L-CD40 strength. This egalitarian mechanism allows lower-affinity clones to participate in the humoral response but in a proportional manner.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The C5a-C5aR1 complement axis is essential for neutrophil recruitment to draining lymph nodes via high endothelial venules in cutaneous leishmaniasis</a></h4>

              
                Prat-Luri et al. characterize the mechanisms involved in neutrophil recruitment to the draining lymph node following dermal infection with Leishmania mexicana parasites. Neutrophil recruitment occurred predominantly via high endothelial venules, a process mediated by the C5a-C5aR1 axis. C5/C5a are locally produced by lymphatic endothelial cells in the draining lymph node.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Basal cell carcinomas acquire secondary mutations to overcome dormancy and progress from microscopic to macroscopic disease</a></h4>

              
                Trieu et al. generate BCC mouse models in which rare macroscopic tumors form alongside numerous failed microscopic lesions. Successful macroscopic tumors acquire secondary changes that elevate Gli1, Gli2, and/or Mycn levels, causing hyperactivation of downstream Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Loss of p53 and Notch1 also contributes to tumor progression.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Evidence for reduced BRCA2 functional activity in Homo sapiens after divergence from the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor</a></h4>

              
                Huang et al. find a single base substitution in BRCA2 arose in the course of human evolution. This substitution (BRCA2M2662T) is fixed in the present-day human population. The substitution reduces BRCA2 activity and leads to reduced DNA repair by homologous recombination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Jurassic rise of squamates as supported by lepidosaur disparity and evolutionary rates</a></h4>

              
                The squamates (lizards, snakes, and relatives) today comprise more than 10,000 species, and yet their sister group, the Rhynchocephalia, is represented by a single species today, the tuatara. The explosion in squamate diversity has been tracked back to the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, 100 million years ago (Ma), the time when flowering plants began their takeover of terrestrial ecosystems, associated with diversification of coevolving insects and insect-eating predators such as lizards, birds, and mammals. Squamates arose much earlier, but their long pre-Cretaceous history of some 150 million years (Myr) is documented by sparse fossils. Here, we provide evidence for an initial radiation of squamate morphology in the Middle and Late Jurassic (174–145 Ma), and show that they established their key ecological roles much earlier than had been assumed, and they have not changed them much since.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proteolysis of fibrillin-2 microfibrils is essential for normal skeletal development</a></h4>

              
                The embryonic extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes transition to mature ECM as development progresses, yet few mechanisms ensuring ECM proteostasis during this period are known. Fibrillin microfibrils are macromolecular ECM complexes serving structural and regulatory roles. In mice, <i>Fbn1</i> and <i>Fbn2,</i> encoding the major microfibrillar components, are strongly expressed during embryogenesis, but fibrillin-1 is the major component observed in adult tissue microfibrils. Here, analysis of <i>Adamts6</i> and <i>Adamts10</i> mutant mouse embryos, lacking these homologous secreted metalloproteases individually and in combination, along with in vitro analysis of microfibrils, measurement of ADAMTS6-fibrillin affinities and N-terminomics discovery of ADAMTS6-cleaved sites, identifies a proteostatic mechanism contributing to postnatal fibrillin-2 reduction and fibrillin-1 dominance. The lack of ADAMTS6, alone and in combination with ADAMTS10 led to excess fibrillin-2 in perichondrium, with impaired skeletal development defined by a drastic reduction of aggrecan and cartilage link protein, impaired BMP signaling in cartilage, and increased GDF5 sequestration in fibrillin-2-rich tissue. Although ADAMTS6 cleaves fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 as well as fibronectin, which provides the initial scaffold for microfibril assembly, primacy of the protease-substrate relationship between ADAMTS6 and fibrillin-2 was unequivocally established by reversal of the defects in <i>Adamts6</i><sup>-/-</sup> embryos by genetic reduction of <i>Fbn2</i>, but not <i>Fbn1</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Auditory mismatch responses are differentially sensitive to changes in muscarinic acetylcholine versus dopamine receptor function</a></h4>

              
                The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) has been proposed as a biomarker of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction in schizophrenia. Such dysfunction may be caused by aberrant interactions of different neuromodulators with NMDARs, which could explain clinical heterogeneity among patients. In two studies (<i>N</i>=81 each), we used a double-blind placebo-controlled between-subject design to systematically test whether auditory mismatch responses under varying levels of environmental stability are sensitive to diminishing and enhancing cholinergic vs. dopaminergic function. We found a significant drug x mismatch interaction: while the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist biperiden delayed and topographically shifted mismatch responses, particularly during high stability, this effect could not be detected for amisulpride, a dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist. Neither galantamine nor levodopa, which elevate acetylcholine and dopamine levels, respectively, exerted significant effects on MMN. This differential MMN sensitivity to muscarinic versus dopaminergic receptor function may prove useful for developing tests that predict individual treatment responses in schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metabolic basis for the evolution of a common pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa variant</a></h4>

              
                Microbes frequently evolve in reproducible ways. Here, we show that differences in specific metabolic regulation rather than inter-strain interactions explain the frequent presence of <i>lasR</i> loss-of-function mutations in the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. While LasR contributes to virulence through its role in quorum sensing, <i>lasR</i> mutants have been associated with more severe disease.  A model based on the intrinsic growth kinetics for a wild type strain and its LasR<sup>-</sup> derivative, in combination with an experimental evolution based genetic screen and further genetics analyses, indicated that differences in metabolism were sufficient to explain the rise of these common mutant types. The evolution of LasR<sup>-</sup> lineages in laboratory and clinical isolates depended on activity of the two-component system CbrAB, which modulates substrate prioritization through the catabolite repression control pathway. LasR<sup>-</sup> lineages frequently arise in cystic fibrosis lung infections and their detection correlates with disease severity. Our analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid metabolomes identified compounds that negatively correlate with lung function, and we show that these compounds support enhanced growth of LasR<sup>-</sup> cells in a CbrB-controlled manner. We propose that <i>in vivo</i> metabolomes contribute to pathogen evolution, which may influence the progression of disease and its treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">METTL3 promotes homologous recombination repair and modulates chemotherapeutic response in breast cancer by regulating the EGF/Rad51 axis</a></h4>

              
                METTL3 and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) are involved in many types of biological and pathological processes, including DNA repair. However, the function and mechanism of METTL3 in DNA repair and chemotherapeutic response remain largely unknown. In present study, we identified that METTL3 participates in the regulation of homologous recombination repair (HR), which further influences chemotherapeutic response in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer (BC) cells. Knockdown of METTL3 sensitized these BC cells to Adriamycin (ADR; also named as doxorubicin) treatment and increased accumulation of DNA damage. Mechanically, we demonstrated that inhibition of METTL3 impaired HR efficiency and increased ADR-induced DNA damage by regulating m6A modification of EGF/RAD51 axis. METTL3 promoted EGF expression through m6A modification, which further upregulated RAD51 expression, resulting in enhanced HR activity. We further demonstrated that the m6A 'reader', YTHDC1, bound to the m6A modified EGF transcript and promoted EGF synthesis, which enhanced HR and cell survival during ADR treatment in breast cancer cells. Our findings reveal a pivotal mechanism of METTL3-mediated HR and chemotherapeutic drug response, which may contribute to cancer therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Discovery and functional assessment of a novel adipocyte population driven by intracellular Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammals</a></h4>

              
                Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been well established as a potent inhibitor of adipogenesis. Here, we identified a population of adipocytes that exhibit persistent activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as revealed by the Tcf/Lef-GFP reporter allele, in embryonic and adult mouse fat depots, named as Wnt<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. We showed that this β-catenin-mediated signaling activation in these cells is Wnt ligand- and receptor-independent but relies on AKT/mTOR pathway and is essential for cell survival. Such adipocytes are distinct from classical ones in transcriptomic and genomic signatures and can be induced from various sources of mesenchymal stromal cells including human cells. Genetic lineage-tracing and targeted cell ablation studies revealed that these adipocytes convert into beige adipocytes directly and are also required for beige fat recruitment under thermal challenge, demonstrating both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous roles in adaptive thermogenesis. Furthermore, mice bearing targeted ablation of these adipocytes exhibited glucose intolerance, while mice receiving exogenously supplied such cells manifested enhanced glucose utilization. Our studies uncover a unique adipocyte population in regulating beiging in adipose tissues and systemic glucose homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The oncoprotein BCL6 enables solid tumor cells to evade genotoxic stress</a></h4>

              
                Genotoxic agents remain the mainstay of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the clinical benefits are often countered by a rapid tumor adaptive response. Here, we report that the oncoprotein B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a core component that confers solid tumor adaptive resistance to genotoxic stress. Multiple genotoxic agents promoted <i>BCL6</i> transactivation, which was positively correlated with a weakened therapeutic efficacy and a worse clinical outcome. Mechanistically, we discovered that treatment with the genotoxic agent etoposide led to the transcriptional reprogramming of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, among which the interferon-α and interferon-γ responses were substantially enriched in resistant cells. Our results further revealed that the activation of interferon/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 axis directly upregulated BCL6 expression. The increased expression of BCL6 further repressed the tumor suppressor PTEN and consequently enabled resistant cancer cell survival. Accordingly, targeted inhibition of BCL6 remarkably enhanced etoposide-triggered DNA damage and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of BCL6 signaling in conquering solid tumor tolerance to genotoxic stress, further establishing a rationale for a combined approach with genotoxic agents and BCL6-targeted therapy.

                Goal-oriented navigation is widely understood to depend upon internal maps. Although this may be the case in many settings, humans tend to rely on vision in complex, unfamiliar environments. To study the nature of gaze during visually-guided navigation, we tasked humans to navigate to transiently visible goals in virtual mazes of varying levels of difficulty, observing that they took near-optimal trajectories in all arenas. By analyzing participants’ eye movements, we gained insights into how they performed visually-informed planning. The spatial distribution of gaze revealed that environmental complexity mediated a striking tradeoff in the extent to which attention was directed towards two complimentary aspects of the world model: the reward location and task-relevant transitions. The temporal evolution of gaze revealed rapid, sequential prospection of the future path, evocative of neural replay. These findings suggest that the spatiotemporal characteristics of gaze during navigation are significantly shaped by the unique cognitive computations underlying real-world, sequential decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Post-translational modification patterns on β-myosin heavy chain are altered in ischemic and non-ischemic human hearts</a></h4>

              
                Phosphorylation and acetylation of sarcomeric proteins are important for fine-tuning myocardial contractility. Here, we used bottom-up proteomics and label-free quantification to identify novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) on beta-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC) in normal and failing human heart tissues. We report six acetylated lysines and two phosphorylated residues: K34-Ac, K58-Ac, S210-P, K213-Ac, T215-P, K429-Ac, K951-Ac, and K1195-Ac. K951-Ac was significantly reduced in both ischemic and non-ischemic failing hearts compared to non-diseased hearts. Molecular dynamics simulations show that K951-Ac may impact stability of thick filament tail interactions and ultimately myosin head positioning. K58-Ac altered the solvent exposed SH3 domain surface - known for protein-protein interactions - but did not appreciably change motor domain conformation or dynamics under conditions studied. Together, K213-Ac/T215-P altered loop 1's structure and dynamics - known to regulate ADP-release, ATPase activity, and sliding velocity. Our study suggests that β-MHC acetylation levels may be influenced more by the PTM location than the type of heart disease since less protected acetylation sites are reduced in both heart failure groups. Additionally, these PTMs have potential to modulate interactions between β-MHC and other regulatory sarcomeric proteins, ADP-release rate of myosin, flexibility of the S2 region, and cardiac myofilament contractility in normal and heart failure hearts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nuclear receptor ligand screening in an iPSC-derived in vitro blood-brain barrier model identifies new contributors to leptin transport</a></h4>

              
                Background: The peptide hormone leptin exerts its function in the brain to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure to prevent obesity. However, most obese subjects reflect the resistance to leptin even with elevated serum leptin. Considering that leptin must cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in several regions to enter the brain parenchyma, altered leptin transport through the BBB might play an important role in leptin resistance and other biological conditions. Here, we report the use of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BBB model to explore mechanisms that influence leptin transport. Methods: iPSCs were differentiated into brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC)-like cells using standard methods. BMEC-like cells were cultured in Transwell filters, treated with ligands from a nuclear receptor agonist library, and assayed for leptin transport using an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. RNA sequencing was further used to identify differentially regulated genes and pathways. The role of a select hit in leptin transport was tested with the competitive substrate assay and after gene knockdown using CRISPR techniques. Results: Following a screen of 73 compounds, 17{beta}-estradiol was identified as a compound that could significantly increase leptin transport. RNA sequencing revealed many differentially expressed transmembrane transporters after 17{beta}-estradiol treatment. Of these, cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1, encoded by SLC7A1) was selected for follow-up analyses due to its high and selective expression in BMECs in vivo. Treatment of BMEC-like cells with CAT-1 substrates, as well as knockdown of CAT-1 expression via CRISPR-mediated epigenome editing, yielded significant increases in leptin transport. Conclusions: A major female sex hormone, as well as an amino acid transporter, were revealed as regulators of leptin BBB transport in the iPSC-derived BBB model. Outcomes from this work provide insights into regulation of peptide hormone transport across the BBB.

                The accessory olfactory system (AOS) is critical for the development and expression of social behavior. The first dedicated circuit in the AOS, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), exhibits cellular and network plasticity in male and female mice after social experience. In the AOB, interneurons called internal granule cells (IGCs) express the plasticity-associated immediate-early gene Arc following intermale aggression or mating. Here, we sought to better understand how Arc-expressing IGCs shape AOB information processing and social behavior in the context of territorial aggression. We used "ArcTRAP" (Arc-CreERT2) transgenic mice to selectively and permanently label Arc-expressing IGCs following male-male resident-intruder interactions. Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we found that Arc-expressing IGCs display increased intrinsic excitability for several days after a single resident-intruder interaction. Further, we found that Arc-expressing IGCs maintain this increased excitability across repeated resident-intruder interactions, during which resident mice increase or "ramp" their aggression. We tested the hypothesis that Arc-expressing IGCs participate in ramping aggression. Using a combination of ArcTRAP mice and chemogenetics (Cre-dependent hM4D(Gi)-mCherry AAV injections), we found that disruption of Arc-expressing IGC activity during repeated resident-intruder interactions abolishes the ramping aggression exhibited by resident male mice. This work shows that Arc-expressing AOB IGC ensembles are activated by specific chemosensory environments, and play an integral role in the establishment and expression of sex-typical social behavior. These studies identify a population of plastic interneurons in an early chemosensory circuit that display physiological features consistent with simple memory formation, increasing our understanding of central chemosensory processing and mammalian social behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization and mu opioid receptor sensitivity of neuropeptide Y interneurons in the nucleus accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Inhibitory interneurons represent less than 5% of neurons within the nucleus accumbens, but are critical for proper microcircuit function within this brain region. In the dorsal striatum, neuropeptide Y is expressed by two interneuron subtypes (low-threshold spiking interneurons and neurogliaform interneurons) that exhibit mu opioid receptor sensitivity in other brain regions. However, few studies have assessed the molecular and physiological properties of neuropeptide Y interneurons within the nucleus accumbens. We used a transgenic reporter mouse to identify and characterize neuropeptide Y interneurons in acute nucleus accumbens brain slices. Nearly all cells exhibited electrophysiological properties of low-threshold spiking interneurons, with almost no neurogliaform interneurons observed among neuropeptide Y interneurons. We corroborated this pattern using fluorescent in situ hybridization, and also identified a high level of mu opioid receptor expression by low-threshold spiking interneurons, which led us to examine the functional consequences of mu opioid receptor activation in these cells using electrophysiology. Mu opioid receptor activation caused a reduction in the rate of spontaneous action potentials in low-threshold spiking interneurons, as well as a decrease in optogenetically-evoked GABA release onto medium spiny neurons. The latter effect was more robust in female versus male mice, and when the postsynaptic medium spiny neuron expressed the Drd1 dopamine receptor. This work is the first to examine the physiological properties of neuropeptide Y interneurons in the nucleus accumbens, and show they may be an important target for mu opioid receptor modulation by endogenous and exogenous opioids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pallidin function in drosophila surface glia regulates sleep and is dependent on amino acid availability</a></h4>

              
                The Pallidin protein is a component of a multimeric complex named the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex-1 (BLOC1) that regulates specific endosomal function and transmembrane protein trafficking in many different cell types. In the brain, defective BLOC1 function has been linked to schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric disorder with highly prevalent sleep disruptions, and to impaired cognitive abilities in healthy subjects. In animal models, defective BLOC-1 function also impairs behavior, memory, neurotransmission systems and metabolism. This growing body of experimental evidence suggest an involvement of BLOC1 in sleep/wake regulation. Here, we used Drosophila molecular genetics and conditional, cell-type specific knockdown strategy to address this question. We show that down-regulation of a central subunit of BLOC1, Pallidin, in the surface glia, the Drosophila equivalent of the blood brain barrier, is sufficient to reduce, fragment and delay nighttime sleep at the adult stage and in a circadian clock dependent manner. Other members of the BLOC1 complex appear to be involved in this surface glia-dependent sleep regulation. In agreement with a BLOC1 involvement in amino acid transport, down-regulation of the Large neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (LAT1)-like transporters JhI-21 and minidiscs, phenocopy the down-regulation of pallidin. Similar results were obtained by inhibiting the TOR amino acid signaling pathway. Supplementing food with essential amino acids normalizes the sleep/wake phenotypes of pallidin and JhI-21 down-regulation. Furthermore, we identify a role for pallidin in the subcellular trafficking of JhI-21 in surface glial cells. Finally, we provide evidence that Pallidin function in surface glia is required for GABAergic neurons activation involved in promoting sleep. Taken together, these data identify a novel role for BLOC1 that, through LAT1-like transporters subcellular trafficking modulates essential amino acid availability and GABAergic sleep/wake regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CaV1 and CaV2 calcium channels mediate the release of distinct pools of synaptic vesicles</a></h4>

              
                Activation of voltage-gated calcium channels at synapses leads to local increases in calcium and the fusion of synaptic vesicles. However, presynaptic output will be determined by the density of calcium channels, the dynamic properties of the channel, the distance to docked vesicles, and the release probability at the docking site. We demonstrate that at C. elegans neuromuscular junctions, CaV2, and CaV1 mediate the release of two distinct pools of synaptic vesicles. Superresolution microscopy demonstrates that CaV2 channels are concentrated in densely packed clusters ~300 nm in diameter with active zone proteins Neurexin, -Liprin, SYDE, ELKS, RIMB,  Catulin, and MAGI. The CaV2 channels mediate the fusion of vesicles docked within 100 nm of the dense projection and is colocalized with to the synaptic vesicle priming protein UNC 13L. By contrast, CaV1 channels are dispersed in the synaptic varicosity and are coupled to internal calcium stores via the ryanodine receptor. The CaV1 and ryanodine receptor mediate the fusion of vesicles docked broadly in the synaptic varicosity and are colocalized with the vesicle priming protein UNC-13S. These distinct synaptic vesicle pools, released by different calcium channels, could be used to tune the speed, voltage-dependence, and quantal content of neurotransmitter release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Puberty contributes to adolescent development of fronto-striatal functional connectivity supporting inhibitory control</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is defined by puberty and represents a neurobiological period characterized by enhanced neuroplasticity facilitating cognitive improvements. Fronto-striatal systems undergo important specialization throughout adolescence, supporting developmental changes in cognition and motivated behaviors. Though studies have characterized age-related changes, the extent to which puberty influences maturation of fronto-striatal networks is less known, limiting our understanding of unique adolescent processes. Here, we combine two longitudinal datasets to characterize the role of puberty in the development of fronto-striatal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and its relationship to inhibitory control in 110 10-18-year-olds. Not surprisingly, age-effects evident with older age ranges were not present in this sample. After controlling for age effects still possibly present, puberty was associated uniquely with late increases rsFC of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in both males and females and early puberty increases with ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC) in females. Additionally, greater dlPFC - NAcc rsFC was associated with worse inhibitory control performance in early puberty while vlPFC - NAcc was associated with response latency. Taken together, our findings suggest that mid-late puberty is a crucial period for lateral PFC - NAcc circuitry maturation, which may contribute to critical aspects of developmental improvements in inhibitory control function into adulthood.

	<p>Bodily experiences such as the feeling of touch, pain or inner signals of the body are deeply emotional and activate brain networks that mediate their perception and higher-order processing. While the ad hoc perception of bodily signals and their influence on behavior is empirically well studied, there is a knowledge gap on how we store and retrieve bodily experiences that we perceived in the past, and how this influences our everyday life. Here, we explore the hypothesis that negative body memories, that is, negative bodily experiences of the past that are stored in memory and influence behavior, contribute to the development of somatic manifestations of mental health problems including somatic symptoms, traumatic re-experiences or dissociative symptoms. By combining knowledge from the areas of cognitive neuroscience and clinical neuroscience with insights from psychotherapy, we identify Clinical Body Memory (CBM) mechanisms that specify how mental health problems could be driven by corporeal experiences stored in memory. The major argument is that the investigation of the neuronal mechanisms that underlie the storage and retrieval of body memories provides us with empirical access to reduce the negative impact of body memories on mental health.</p>

	<p>In pandemic times, taking advantage of COVID-19-elicited emotions in commercials has been a popular tactic employed by corporations to build successful consumer engagement and, hopefully, increase sales. The present study investigates whether COVID-19-related emotional communication affects the consumer&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotional response and the approach/avoidance motivation toward the brand&amp;amp;mdash;measured as a function of brain hemodynamic changes&amp;amp;mdash;as well as the purchase intentions. The functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to record neural correlates from the prefrontal cortex while the experimental and control groups were observing respectively COVID-19-related and unrelated advertisements (ads). The hemodynamic patterns suggest that COVID-19-related ads may promote deeper emotional elaboration, shifting consumers&amp;amp;rsquo; attention from the semantic meaning to the affective features and perhaps supporting a more favorable brand evaluation. Conversely, purchase intentions were only related to the pre-existing level of brand engagement. The findings suggest that leveraging the negative emotional potential of COVID-19 may not shift the explicit purchase intentions but could nonetheless boost emotional engagement, benefitting the final evaluation of the brand at an implicit level.</p>

	<p>Multisensory integration is a capacity allowing us to merge information from different sensory modalities in order to improve the salience of the signal. Audiovisual integration is one of the most used kinds of multisensory integration, as vision and hearing are two senses used very frequently in humans. However, the literature regarding age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) on audiovisual integration abilities is almost nonexistent, despite the growing prevalence of presbycusis in the population. In that context, the study aims to assess the relationship between presbycusis and audiovisual integration using tests of saccade and vergence eye movements to visual vs. audiovisual targets, with a pure tone as an auditory signal. Tests were run with the REMOBI and AIDEAL technologies coupled with the pupil core eye tracker. Hearing abilities, eye movement characteristics (latency, peak velocity, average velocity, amplitude) for saccade and vergence eye movements, and the Stroop Victoria test were measured in 69 elderly and 30 young participants. The results indicated (i) a dual pattern of aging effect on audiovisual integration for convergence (a decrease in the aged group relative to the young one, but an increase with age within the elderly group) and (ii) an improvement of audiovisual integration for saccades for people with presbycusis associated with lower scores of selective attention in the Stroop test, regardless of age. These results bring new insight on an unknown topic, that of audio visuomotor integration in normal aging and in presbycusis. They highlight the potential interest of using eye movement targets in the 3D space and pure tone sound to objectively evaluate audio visuomotor integration capacities.</p>

	<p>In our previous investigations using systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS) neuroimaging, we found larger variability between subjects in changes of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation induced by an intricate experimental paradigm involving colored light exposure and a cognitive task. We aimed to investigate the role the activity of the systemic physiology has on individual variations in the fNIRS data. Thirty-two healthy subjects (17 female, 15 male and age: 25.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.3 years) were exposed to blue and red light for 9 min (colored light exposure, CLE) while performing a verbal fluency task (VFT). We found that (i), at the group level, the visual cortex showed a stronger deoxyhemoglobin concentration response during blue light exposure than during red light exposure, and (ii) this relationship was influenced by individually different baseline blood pressure values. Furthermore, we found other correlations between changes in fNIRS signals and changes in systemic physiology. Our study demonstrates the usefulness and necessity of the SPA-fNIRS approach to gain insights into the individual variability of hemodynamic responses measured with fNIRS, especially in the case of an intricate experimental paradigm (i.e., CLE-VFT) as used in our study.</p>

	<p>The amount of integrated information, &amp;amp;Phi;, proposed in an integrated information theory (IIT) is useful to describe the degree of brain adaptation to the environment. However, its computation cannot be precisely performed for a reasonable time for time-series spike data collected from a large count of neurons.. Therefore, &amp;amp;Phi; was only used to describe averaged activity of a big group of neurons, and the behavior of small non-brain systems. In this study, we reported on ways for fast and precise &amp;amp;Phi; calculation using different approximation methods for &amp;amp;Phi; calculation in neural spike data, and checked the capability of &amp;amp;Phi; to describe a degree of adaptation in brain neural networks. We show that during instrumental learning sessions, all applied approximation methods reflect temporal trends of &amp;amp;Phi; in the rat hippocampus. The value of &amp;amp;Phi; is positively correlated with the number of successful acts performed by a rat. We also show that only one subgroup of neurons modulates their &amp;amp;Phi; during learning. The obtained results pave the way for application of &amp;amp;Phi; to investigate plasticity in the brain during the acquisition of new tasks.</p>

	<p>Salivary A&amp;amp;beta;40, A&amp;amp;beta;42, t-tau, and p-tau 181 are commonly employed in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) investigations. However, the collection method of these biomarkers can affect their levels. To assess the impact of saliva collection methods on biomarkers in this study, 15 healthy people were employed in the morning with six saliva collection methods. The chosen methods were then applied in 30 AD patients and 30 non-AD controls. The levels of salivary biomarkers were calculated by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The receiver operating characteristic was utilized to assess salivary biomarkers in AD patients. The results demonstrated that the highest levels of salivary A&amp;amp;beta;40, A&amp;amp;beta;42, t-tau, and p-tau were in different saliva collection methods. The correlations between different saliva biomarkers in the same collection method were different. Salivary A&amp;amp;beta;40, A&amp;amp;beta;42, t-tau, and p-tau had no significant association. Salivary A&amp;amp;beta;42 was higher in AD than in non-AD controls. However, p-tau/t-tau and A&amp;amp;beta;42/A&amp;amp;beta;40 had some relevance. The area under the curve for four biomarkers combined in AD diagnosis was 92.11%. An alternate saliva collection method (e.g., USS in A&amp;amp;beta;40, UPS in A&amp;amp;beta;42, t-tau, SSS in p-tau 181) was demonstrated in this study. Moreover, combining numerous biomarkers improves AD diagnosis.</p>

While hierarchical experimental designs are near-ubiquitous in neuroscience and biomedical research, researchers often do not take the structure of their datasets into account while performing statistical hypothesis tests. Resampling-based methods are a flexible strategy for performing these analyses but are difficult due to the lack of open-source software to automate test construction and execution. To address this, we present <i>Hierarch</i>, a Python package to perform hypothesis tests and compute confidence intervals on hierarchical experimental designs. Using a combination of permutation resampling and bootstrap aggregation, <i>Hierarch</i> can be used to perform hypothesis tests that maintain nominal Type I error rates and generate confidence intervals that maintain the nominal coverage probability without making distributional assumptions about the dataset of interest. <i>Hierarch</i> makes use of the Numba JIT compiler to reduce <i>p-</i>value computation times to under one second for typical datasets in biomedical research. <i>Hierarch</i> also enables researchers to construct user-defined resampling plans that take advantage of <i>Hierarch’s</i> Numba-accelerated functions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Protein degradation sets the fraction of active ribosomes at vanishing growth</a></h4>

Growing cells adopt common basic strategies to achieve optimal resource allocation under limited resource availability. Our current understanding of such “growth laws” neglects degradation, assuming that it occurs slowly compared to the cell cycle duration. Here we argue that this assumption cannot hold at slow growth, leading to important consequences. We propose a simple framework showing that at slow growth protein degradation is balanced by a fraction of “maintenance” ribosomes. Consequently, active ribosomes do not drop to zero at vanishing growth, but as growth rate diminishes, an increasing fraction of active ribosomes performs maintenance. Through a detailed analysis of compiled data, we show that the predictions of this model agree with data from <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Intriguingly, we also find that protein degradation increases at slow growth, which we interpret as a consequence of active waste management and/or recycling. Our results highlight protein turnover as an underrated factor for our understanding of growth laws across kingdoms.

Identifying structural differences among proteins can be a non-trivial task. When contrasting ensembles of protein structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, biologically-relevant features can be easily overshadowed by spurious fluctuations. Here, we present SINATRA Pro, a computational pipeline designed to robustly identify topological differences between two sets of protein structures. Algorithmically, SINATRA Pro works by first taking in the 3D atomic coordinates for each protein snapshot and summarizing them according to their underlying topology. Statistically significant topological features are then projected back onto a user-selected representative protein structure, thus facilitating the visual identification of biophysical signatures of different protein ensembles. We assess the ability of SINATRA Pro to detect minute conformational changes in five independent protein systems of varying complexities. In all test cases, SINATRA Pro identifies known structural features that have been validated by previous experimental and computational studies, as well as novel features that are also likely to be biologically-relevant according to the literature. These results highlight SINATRA Pro as a promising method for facilitating the non-trivial task of pattern recognition in trajectories resulting from molecular dynamics simulations, with substantially increased resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Observing others give & take: A computational account of bystanders’ feelings and actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bastien Blain, Joseph Marks, Philipp Czech, Tali Sharot</p>

Social interactions influence people’s feelings and behavior. Here, we propose that a person’s well-being is influenced not only by interactions they experience themselves, but also by those they observe. In particular, we test and quantify the influence of observed selfishness and observed inequality on a bystanders’ feelings and non-costly punishment decisions. We developed computational models that relate others’ (un)selfish acts to observers’ emotional reactions and punishment decisions. These characterize the rules by which others’ interactions are transformed into bystanders’ reactions, and successfully predict those reactions in out-of-sample participants. The models highlight the impact of two social values—‘selfishness aversion’ and ‘inequality aversion’. As for the latter we find that even small violations from perfect equality have a disproportionately large impact on feelings and punishment. In this age of internet and social media we constantly observe others’ online interactions, in addition to in-person interactions. Quantifying the consequences of such observations is important for predicting their impact on society.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Unsupervised learning for robust working memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jintao Gu, Sukbin Lim</p>

Working memory is a core component of critical cognitive functions such as planning and decision-making. Persistent activity that lasts long after the stimulus offset has been considered a neural substrate for working memory. Attractor dynamics based on network interactions can successfully reproduce such persistent activity. However, it requires a fine-tuning of network connectivity, in particular, to form continuous attractors which were suggested for encoding continuous signals in working memory. Here, we investigate whether a specific form of synaptic plasticity rules can mitigate such tuning problems in two representative working memory models, namely, rate-coded and location-coded persistent activity. We consider two prominent types of plasticity rules, differential plasticity correcting the rapid activity changes and homeostatic plasticity regularizing the long-term average of activity, both of which have been proposed to fine-tune the weights in an unsupervised manner. Consistent with the findings of previous works, differential plasticity alone was enough to recover a graded-level persistent activity after perturbations in the connectivity. For the location-coded memory, differential plasticity could also recover persistent activity. However, its pattern can be irregular for different stimulus locations under slow learning speed or large perturbation in the connectivity. On the other hand, homeostatic plasticity shows a robust recovery of smooth spatial patterns under particular types of synaptic perturbations, such as perturbations in incoming synapses onto the entire or local populations. However, homeostatic plasticity was not effective against perturbations in outgoing synapses from local populations. Instead, combining it with differential plasticity recovers location-coded persistent activity for a broader range of perturbations, suggesting compensation between two plasticity rules.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A multistudy analysis reveals that evoked pain intensity representation is distributed across brain systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bogdan Petre, Philip Kragel, Lauren Y. Atlas, Stephan Geuter, Marieke Jepma, Leonie Koban, Anjali Krishnan, Marina Lopez-Sola, Elizabeth A. Reynolds Losin, Mathieu Roy, Choong-Wan Woo, Tor D. Wager</p>

Information is coded in the brain at multiple anatomical scales: locally, distributed across regions and networks, and globally. For pain, the scale of representation has not been formally tested, and quantitative comparisons of pain representations across regions and networks are lacking. In this multistudy analysis of 376 participants across 11 studies, we compared multivariate predictive models to investigate the spatial scale and location of evoked heat pain intensity representation. We compared models based on (a) a single most pain-predictive region or resting-state network; (b) pain-associated cortical–subcortical systems developed from prior literature (“multisystem models”); and (c) a model spanning the full brain. We estimated model accuracy using leave-one-study-out cross-validation (CV; 7 studies) and subsequently validated in 4 independent holdout studies. All spatial scales conveyed information about pain intensity, but distributed, multisystem models predicted pain 20% more accurately than any individual region or network and were more generalizable to multimodal pain (thermal, visceral, and mechanical) and specific to pain. Full brain models showed no predictive advantage over multisystem models. These findings show that multiple cortical and subcortical systems are needed to decode pain intensity, especially heat pain, and that representation of pain experience may not be circumscribed by any elementary region or canonical network. Finally, the learner generalization methods we employ provide a blueprint for evaluating the spatial scale of information in other domains.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The motor severity in Parkinson disease (PD) is believed to parallel dopaminergic terminal degeneration in the striatum, although the terminal was reported to be virtually absent by 4 years postdiagnosis. Meanwhile, neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra (SN) elucidated a variability at early stages and gradual loss with less variability 10 years postdiagnosis. Here, we aimed to clarify the correlation between motor impairments and striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration and nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron loss at early to advanced stages of PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety-three PD patients were divided into early and advanced subgroups based on motor symptom duration and whether motor fluctuation was present. Striatal dopaminergic terminal degeneration was evaluated using a presynaptic dopamine transporter tracer, <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Nigral neuromelanin-laden dopamine neuron density was assessed by neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In patients with early stage PD (motor symptoms for ≤8 or 10 years), motor dysfunction during the drug-off state was paralleled by a decline in <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum despite the absence of a correlation with reductions in NM-MRI signals in SN. Meanwhile, in patients with advanced stage PD (motor symptoms for &gt;8 or 10 years and with fluctuation), the degree of motor deficits during the drug-off state was not correlated with <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane uptake in the striatum, despite its significant negative correlation with NM-MRI signals in SN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose striatal dopaminergic terminal loss measured using <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT and nigral dopamine neuron loss assessed with NM-MRI as early stage and advanced stage motor impairment biomarkers, respectively. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 02 May 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01053-1">doi:10.1038/s41593-022-01053-1</a></p>Activity-regulated myelination adaptively tunes neural circuit function in health. In rodent models of generalized epilepsy, recurrent seizures aberrantly increase myelination specifically within the seizure circuit. Blocking this seizure-induced myelination abrogates the progressive increase in seizure burden and ictal hypersynchrony that occurs in mice with intact activity-regulated myelination, indicating that maladaptive myelination can contribute to disease progression in epilepsy.

                The EGR2 promoter antisense RNA (AS-RNA) recruits chromatin remodeling complexes to inhibit EGR2 transcription following peripheral nerve injury. Here we show that the EGR2-AS-RNA modulates chromatin accessibility and serves as scaffold for two distinct histone modification complexes. It binds to EZH2 and WDR5 and enables coordinate targeting of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 to promoters of EGR2and C-JUN. Expression of the AS-RNA results in reorganization of the global chromatin landscape and quantitative changes in loop formation and in contact frequency at domain boundaries exhibiting enrichment for AP-1 genes. In addition, the EGR2-AS-RNA induces changes in hierarchical TADs and increases transcriptional activity on an inter-TAD loop between a super-enhancer regulatory hub and the promoter of mTOR. Our results show that the EGR2-AS-RNA may serve as regulator of coordinate chromatin remodeling and spatial genome organization to regulate cellular plasticity-associated transcription in Schwann cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inner hair cell synapse density influences auditory processing</a></h4>

              
                It has been proposed that inner hair cell (IHC) synaptopathy, i.e., loss of synapses between spiral ganglion neurons and IHCs, leads to hidden hearing loss (HHL), i.e. poor performance on challenging hearing tasks despite a normal audiogram. However, this has only been tested in animals after exposure to noise or ototoxic drugs, which can cause deficits beyond synaptopathy. Furthermore, the impact of supernumerary synapses on auditory processing has not been evaluated. Here, we studied mice in which IHC synapse counts have been increased or decreased by altering neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) expression in IHC supporting cells. As we previously showed, postnatal Ntf3 knockdown or overexpression reduces or enhances suprathreshold ABR amplitude and IHC synapse density, respectively, without changing cochlear thresholds. Here, we show that IHC synapse density does not influence the acoustic startle reflex or prepulse inhibition, measures of reflexive responses to sound and sensory-motor gating. In contrast, gap-prepulse inhibition, a behavioral test for auditory temporal processing, was increased or reduced according to Ntf3 expression levels. These results indicate that cochlear synaptopathy causes temporal processing deficits, which may be a key contributor to the hearing impairments that define HHL. Furthermore, the improvement in temporal acuity achieved by increasing Ntf3 expression and synapse density suggests a therapeutic strategy for improving hearing in noise for individuals with synaptopathy of various etiologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A resource for generating and manipulating human microglial states in vitro</a></h4>

              
                Microglia have emerged as key players in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In response to CNS stimuli, these cells adopt distinct transcriptional and functional subtypes known as states. However, an understanding of the function of these states has been elusive, especially in human microglia, due to lack of tools to model and manipulate this cell-type. Here, we provide a platform for modeling human microglia transcriptional states in vitro. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that exposure of human stem-cell differentiated microglia (iMGLs) to brain-related challenges generated extensive transcriptional diversity which mapped to gene signatures identified in human brain microglia. We identified two in vitro transcriptional clusters that were analogous to human and mouse disease-associated microglia (DAMs), a state enriched in neurodegenerative disease contexts. To facilitate scalable functional analyses, we established a lentiviral approach enabling broad and highly efficient genetic transduction of microglia in vitro. Using this new technology, we demonstrated that MITF (Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor), an AD-enriched transcription factor in microglia, drives both a disease-associated transcriptional signature and a highly phagocytic state. Finally, we confirmed these results across iMGLs differentiated from multiple iPSC lines demonstrating the broad utility of this platform. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive resource that enables the manipulation and functional interrogation of human microglial states in both homeostatic and disease-relevant contexts.

                Background: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) presents a major obstacle in developing specific diagnostic imaging agents for many neurological disorders. In this study we aimed to generate single domain anti-mouse transferrin receptor antibodies (anti-mTfR VHHs) to mediate BBB transcytosis as components of novel MRI molecular contrast imaging agents. Methods: Anti-mTfR VHHs were produced by immunizing a llama with mTfR, generation of a VHH phage display library, immunopanning, and in vitro characterization of candidates. Site directed mutagenesis was used to generate additional variants. VHH fusions with neurotensin (NT) allowed rapid, hypothermia-based screening for VHH-mediated BBB transcytosis in wild-type mice. One anti-mTfR VHH variant was fused with an anti-amyloid-beta (A{beta}) VHH dimer and labeled with fluorescent dye for direct assessment of in vivo target engagement in a mouse model of AD-related A{beta} plaque pathology. Results: An anti-mTfR VHH called M1 and variants had binding affinities to mTfR of <1nM to 1.52nM. The affinity of the VHH binding to mTfR correlated with the efficiency of the VHH-NT induced hypothermia effects after intravenous injection of 600 nmol/kg body weight, ranging from undetectable for nonbinding mutants to -6{degrees}C for the best mutants. The anti-mTfR VHH variant M1P96H with the strongest hypothermia effect was fused to the anti-A{beta} VHH dimer and labeled with Alexa647; the dye-labeled VHH fusion construct still bound both mTfR and A{beta} plaques. However, after intravenous injection at 600 nmol/kg body weight into APP/PS1 transgenic mice, there was no detectible labeling of plaques above control levels. Thus, NT-induced hypothermia did not correlate with direct target engagement in cortex. Conclusions: There was a surprising dissociation between NT-induced hypothermia, presumably mediated by hypothalamus, and direct engagement with A{beta}-plaques in cortex. Alternative methods to assess anti-mTfR VHH BBB transcytosis will need to be developed for anti-mTfR VHH screening and the development of novel MRI molecular contrast agents.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic and pharmacological reduction of CDK14 mitigates synucleinopathy</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DaNs) and the abnormal accumulation of alpha-Synuclein (a-Syn) protein. Currently, no treatment can slow nor halt neurodegeneration. Multiplications and mutations of the a-Syn gene (SNCA) cause PD-associated syndromes and animal models that overexpress a-Syn replicate several features of PD. Decreasing total a-Syn levels, therefore, is an attractive approach to slow down neurodegeneration in patients with a 'synucleinopathy'. We previously performed a genetic screen for modifiers of a-Syn levels, and found CDK14, a kinase of largely unknown function as a regulator of a-Syn. To test the potential therapeutic effects of CDK14 reduction in PD, we decreased Cdk14 in two mouse models of synucleinopathy. We found that reduction of Cdk14 mitigated neuropathological and neurobehavioral sequelae associated with a-Syn overexpression. We further validated these findings in PD patient neurons. Finally, we leveraged the recent discovery of a covalent inhibitor of CDK14 to determine whether this target is pharmacologically tractable ex vivo. We found that in both mouse and human neurons, CDK14 inhibition decreases total and pathologically aggregated a-Syn. In summary, we suggest that CDK14 represents a novel therapeutic target for PD-associated synucleinopathy.

                ALS is a rapidly progressive, fatal disorder caused by motor neuron degeneration, for which there is a great unmet therapeutic need. AMX0035, a combination of sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) and taurursodiol (TUDCA, Turso), has shown promising results in early ALS clinical trials, but its mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated. To obtain an unbiased landscape of AMX0035 effects we investigated the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of primary skin fibroblasts from sporadic ALS patients and healthy controls treated with PB, TUDCA, or PB-TUDCA combination (Combo). Combo changed many more genes and metabolites than either PB or TUDCA individually. Most changes were unique to Combo and affected the expression of genes involved in ALS-relevant pathways, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport, unfolded protein response, mitochondrial function, RNA metabolism, and innate immunity. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis showed that significant correlations between ALS gene expression modules and clinical parameters were abolished by Combo. This study is the first to explore the molecular effects of Combo in ALS patient-derived cells. It shows that Combo has a greater and distinct impact compared to the individual compounds and provides clues to drug targets and mechanisms of actions, which may underlie the benefits of this investigational drug combination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Syntaxin Habc is required to open Unc18 to template SNARE assembly</a></h4>

              
                SNARE and Unc18 proteins form the core of the membrane fusion complex at synapses. The fusion machinery is evolutionarily ancient and mediates constitutive fusion in yeast. We demonstrate that the SNARE and Unc18 machinery in the nematode C. elegans can be replaced by yeast proteins and still carry out synaptic transmission. However, substitutions of individual components from yeast disrupts fusion. To understand the functional interactions within the core machinery we adopted an interspecies complementation approach using yeast. Synaptic transmission could be restored in chimeras when two key interfaces were present: a novel Habc-Unc18 contact site and an Unc18-SNARE motif contact site. An open form of Unc18 could bypass the requirement for the Habc-Unc18 interface. Together, these data suggest that the Habc domain of syntaxin is required for Unc18 to adopt an open conformation; open Unc18 then templates SNARE complex formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantitative analysis of neuroligin-3 expression in the enteric nervous system of the Neuroligin-3R451C mouse model of autism</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the Neuroligin-3 (Nlgn3) gene are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction but its cellular expression in the GI tract remains to be characterised. Localisation of NLGN3 protein is challenging in intestinal tissue due to the lack of target-specific antibodies. Here, we combined RNAScope in situ hybridization for Nlgn3 mRNA and immunofluorescence for markers of all mouse enteric neurons, cholinergic submucosal neurons, non-cholinergic submucosal neurons, nitregic and calretinin-containing myenteric neurons as well as glial cells. We also developed a quantitative 3-dimensional image analysis method to measure Nlgn3 mRNA cellular expression levels in enteric neurons and glia. We show that Nlgn3 mRNA is expressed in most submucosal and myenteric neurons as well as in enteric glia. The R451C mutation reduces Nlgn3 mRNA expression levels in cholinergic, nitrergic and calretinin enteric neuronal subpopulations but does not affect Nlgn3 mRNA expression in VIPergic submucosal neurons. In summary, we show that the autism-associated R451C mutation in Nlgn3 reduces Nlgn3 mRNA expression in the mouse enteric nervous system (ENS). These findings could shed light on the pathophysiology of GI dysfunction in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CSF circulation and dispersion yield rapid clearancefrom intracranial compartments</a></h4>

              
                In this paper we used a computational model to estimate the clearance of tracer driven by circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced in the choroid plexus (CP) located within the lateral ventricles. CSF was assumed to exit the subarachnoid space (SAS) via different outflow routes such as the parasagittal dura, cribriform plate and/or meningeal lymphatics. We also modelled a reverse case where fluid was produced within the spinal canal and absorbed in the CP in line with observation on certain iNPH patients. No directional interstitial fluid flow was assumed within the brain parenchyma. Tracers were injected into the foramen magnum. The models demonstrate that convection in the SAS yield rapid clearance from both the SAS and the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) and can speed up intracranial clearance from years, as would be the case for purely diffusive flow, to days.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Choosing memory retrieval strategies: a critical role for inhibition in the dentate gyrus</a></h4>

              
                Remembering the location of food is essential for survival. Rodents and humans employ mainly hippocampus-dependent spatial strategies, but when being stressed they shift to striatum-mediated stimulus-based strategies. To investigate underlying brain circuits, we tested mice with a heightened stress susceptibility due to a lack of the GABA-synthetizing enzyme GAD65 (GAD65-/- mice) in a dual solution task. Here, GAD65-/- mice preferred to locate a food reward in an open field via a proximal cue, while their wildtype littermates preferred a spatial strategy. The analysis of cFos co-activation across brain regions and of stress-induced mRNA expression changes of GAD65 pointed towards the hippocampal dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) as a central structure for mediating stress effects on strategy choices via GAD65. Reducing the GAD65 expression locally in the dDG by a shRNA mediated knock down was sufficient to replicate the phenotype of the global GAD65 knock out and to increase dDG excitability. Using DREADD vectors to specifically interfere with dDG circuit activity during dual solution retrieval but not learning confirmed that the dDG modulates strategy choices and that a balanced excitability of this structure is necessary to establish spatial strategy preference.

These data highlight the dDG as a critical hub for choosing between spatial and non-spatial foraging strategies. The inhibitory/excitatory balance in the DG appears as a crucial factor for determining strategy selection in stress-susceptible mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibition of c-Jun in AgRP neurons mediates chronic stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors and colitis susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, are frequently associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), however, the neural mechanisms are unknown. Here, we showed that hypothalamic agouti-related protein (AgRP) neuronal activity was suppressed under chronic restraint stress (CRS), a condition known to induce anxiety-like behaviors and increase colitis susceptibility. Consistently, chemogenic activation (inhibition) of AgRP neurons reversed (mimicked) CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviors and colitis susceptibility. Furthermore, CRS inhibited AgRP neuronal activity by suppressing the expression of c-Jun. As expected, overexpression of c-Jun in these neurons protected against the CRS-induced these effects and knockdown of c-Jun in AgRP neurons (c-Jun{Delta}AgRP) promoted anxiety-like behaviors and colitis. Moreover, relieving the anxiety with cyamemazine (an anxiolytic drug) alleviated colitis susceptibility in c-Jun{Delta}AgRP mice. Finally, according to a proteomic analysis, the levels of the secreted protein thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) were negatively associated with the increased anxiety-like behaviors and colitis susceptibility, supplementing recombinant THBS1 rescued colitis in c-Jun{Delta}AgRP mice. Taken together, these results reveal a critical role of hypothalamic AgRP neuron-derived c-Jun in orchestrating chronic stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors and colitis susceptibility. These results provide a new perspective for understanding the neuronal mechanisms and potential therapeutic target for the comorbidity of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, and IBD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Widespread employment of conserved C. elegans homeobox genes in neuronal identity specification</a></h4>

              
                Homeobox genes are prominent regulators of neuronal identity, but the extent to which their function has been probed in animal nervous systems remains limited. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, each individual neuron class is defined by the expression of unique combinations of homeobox genes, prompting the question of whether each neuron class indeed requires a homeobox gene for its proper identity specification. We present here progress in addressing this question by extending previous mutant analysis of homeobox gene family members and describing multiple examples of homeobox gene function in different parts of the C. elegans nervous system. To probe homeobox function, we make use of a number of reporter gene tools, including a novel multicolor reporter transgene, NeuroPAL, which permits simultaneous monitoring of the execution of multiple differentiation programs throughout the entire nervous system. Using these tools, we add to the previous characterization of homeobox gene function by identifying neuronal differentiation defects for 12 homeobox genes in 19 distinct neuron classes that are mostly unrelated by location, function and lineage history. 10 of these 19 neuron classes had no homeobox gene function ascribed to them before, while in the other 9 neuron classes, we extend the combinatorial code of transcription factors required for specifying terminal differentiation programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in a particular lineage, homeotic identity transformations occur upon loss of a homeobox gene and we show that these transformations are the result of changes in homeobox codes. Combining the present with past analysis, 112 of the 118 neuron classes of C. elegans are now known to require a homeobox gene for proper execution of terminal differentiation programs. Such broad deployment indicates that homeobox function in neuronal identity specification may be an ancient feature of animal nervous systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurocomputational evidence that conflicting prosocial motives guide distributive justice</a></h4>

              
                In the history of humanity, most conflicts within and between societies have originated from perceived inequality in resource distribution. How humans achieve and maintain distributive justice has therefore been an intensely studied issue. However, most research on the corresponding psychological processes has focused on inequality aversion and has been largely agnostic of other motives that may either align or oppose this behavioral tendency. Here we provide behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging evidence that distribution decisions are guided by three distinct motives - inequality aversion, harm aversion, and rank reversal aversion - that interact and in fact can also deter individuals from pursuing equality. At the neural level, we show that these three motives are encoded by separate neural systems, compete for representation in various brain areas processing equality and harm signals, and are integrated in the striatum, which functions as a crucial hub for translating the motives to behavior. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the cognitive and biological processes by which multiple prosocial motives are coordinated in the brain to guide redistribution behaviors. This framework enhances our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying equality-related behavior, suggests possible neural origins of individual differences in social preferences, and provides a new pathway to understand the cognitive and neural basis of clinical disorders with impaired social functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Minute-scale oscillatory sequences in medial entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) hosts many of the brain's circuit elements for spatial navigation and episodic memory, operations that require neural activity to be organized across long durations of experience[1]. While location is known to be encoded by a plethora of spatially tuned cell types in this brain region[2-6], little is known about how the activity of entorhinal cells is tied together over time. Among the brain's most powerful mechanisms for neural coordination are network oscillations, which dynamically synchronize neural activity across circuit elements[7-10]. In MEC, theta and gamma oscillations provide temporal structure to the neural population activity at subsecond time scales[1,11-13]. It remains an open question, however, whether similarly powerful coordination occurs in MEC at behavioural time scales, in the second-to-minute regime. Here we show that MEC activity can be organized into a minute-scale oscillation that entrains nearly the entire cell population, with periods ranging from 10 to 100 seconds. Throughout this ultraslow oscillation, neural activity progresses in periodic and stereotyped sequences. This activity was elicited while mice ran at free pace on a rotating wheel in darkness, with no change in its location or running direction and no scheduled rewards. The oscillation sometimes advanced uninterruptedly for tens of minutes, transcending epochs of locomotion and immobility. Similar oscillatory sequences were not observed in neighboring parasubiculum or in visual cortex. The ultraslow oscillation of activity sequences in MEC may have the potential to couple its neurons and circuits across extended time scales and to serve as a scaffold for processes that unfold at behavioural time scales, such as navigation and episodic memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal changes in the microglial proteome of male and female mice after a diffuse brain injury using label-free quantitative proteomics</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers neuroinflammatory cascades mediated by microglia, which promotes tissue repair in the short-term. These cascades may exacerbate TBI-induced tissue damage and symptoms in the months to years post-injury. However, the progression of the microglial function across time post-injury and whether this differs between biological sexes is not well understood. In this study, we examined the microglial proteome in the days (3- and 7-days) to 1 month (28 days) after a midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI) in male and female mice using label-free quantitative proteomics. We identified a reduction in microglial proteins involved with clearance of neuronal debris via phagocytosis at 3- and 7-days post-injury. At 28 days post-injury pro-inflammatory proteins were decreased and anti-inflammatory proteins were increased in microglia. These results indicate a reduction in microglial clearance of neuronal debris in the days post-injury with a shift to anti-inflammatory function by 1 month. The changes in the microglial proteome that occurred across time post-injury did not differ between biological sexes. However, we did identify an increase in microglial proteins related to pro-inflammation as well as insulin and estrogen signalling in males compared with female mice that occurred with or without a brain injury. Although microglial response was similar between males and females up to 1 month following TBI, biological sex differences in the basal microglial proteome has implications for the efficacy of treatment strategies targeting the microglial response post-injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal Control Costs of Brain State Transitions in Linear Stochastic Systems</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a system that performs numerous functions by controlling its states. Quantifying the cost of this control is essential as it reveals how the brain can be controlled based on the minimization of the control cost, and which brain regions are most important to the optimal control of transitions. Despite its great potential, the current control paradigm in neuroscience uses a deterministic framework and is therefore unable to consider stochasticity, severely limiting its application to neural data. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a novel framework for the evaluation of control costs based on a linear stochastic model. Following our previous work, we quantified the optimal control cost as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence between the uncontrolled and controlled processes. In the linear model, we established an analytical expression for minimal cost and showed that we can decompose it into the cost for controlling the mean and covariance of brain activity. To evaluate the utility of our novel framework, we examined the significant brain regions in the optimal control of transitions from the resting state to seven cognitive task states in whole-brain imaging data. We found that, in realizing the different transitions, the lower visual areas played a commonly significant role in controlling the means, while the posterior cingulate cortex played a commonly significant role in controlling the covariances.

                There has been growing interest in using pharmacological fMRI to identify novel treatments for fear, yet these models are limited with respect to determining process-specific effects on the actual subjective experience of fear which represents the key symptom why patients seek treatment. Combining a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR1) antagonist with a fear vigilance fMRI paradigm and neurofunctional decoding in n = 87 individuals we demonstrate that AT1R blockade selectively reduces the neurofunctional reactivity to fear-inducing visual oddballs in terms of attenuating dorsolateral prefrontal activity and amygdala-ventral anterior cingulate (vACC) communication, and further show that the observed effect is due to reduced subjective fear, but not threat or non-specific negative affect, using a decoding analysis. Our findings demonstrate a highly specific role of AT1R in subjective fear experience and demonstrate the feasibility of a precision approach to the affective characterization of novel receptor targets for fear in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding of Speech Information using EEG in Children with Dyslexia: Less Accurate Low-Frequency Representations of Speech, Not "Noisy" Representations</a></h4>

              
                The amplitude envelope of speech carries crucial low-frequency acoustic information that assists linguistic decoding. The sensory-neural Temporal Sampling (TS) theory of developmental dyslexia proposes atypical encoding of speech envelope information <10 Hz, leading to atypical phonological representations. Here a backward linear TRF model and story listening were employed to estimate the speech information encoded in the electroencephalogram in the canonical delta, theta and alpha bands by 9-year-old children with and without dyslexia. TRF decoding accuracy provided an estimate of how faithfully the children's brains encoded low-frequency envelope information. Between-group analyses showed that the children with dyslexia exhibited impaired reconstruction of speech information in the delta band. However, when the quality of speech encoding for each child was estimated using child-by-child decoding models, then the dyslexic children did not differ from controls. This suggests that children with dyslexia encode neither "noisy" nor "normal" representations of the speech signal, but different representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal 7T MRI reveals volumetric changes in subregions of human medial temporal lobe to sex hormone fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) are critical for memory processes, with local atrophy linked to memory deficits. Animal work shows that MTL subregions densely express sex hormone receptors and exhibit rapid structural changes synchronized with hormone fluctuations. Such transient effects in humans have thus far not been shown. By combining a dense-sampling protocol, ultra-high field neuroimaging and individually-derived segmentation analysis, we demonstrate how estradiol and progesterone fluctuations affect MTL subregion volumes across the human menstrual cycle. Twenty-seven healthy women (19-34 years) underwent 7T MRI at six timepoints to acquire T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Linear mixed-effects modeling showed positive associations between estradiol and parahippocampal cortex volume, progesterone and subiculum and perirhinal Area 35 volumes, and an estradiol*progesterone interaction with CA1 volume. We confirmed volumetric changes were not driven by hormone-related water (cerebral spinal fluid) or blood-flow (pulsed arterial spin labeling) changes. These findings suggest that sex hormones alter structural brain plasticity in subregions that are differentially sensitive to hormones. Mapping how endogenous endocrine factors shape adult brain structure has critical implications for women's health during the reproductive years as well as later in life, such as increased dementia risk following perimenopause, a period of pronounced sex hormone fluctuations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncovering molecular iron compounds in the living human brain.</a></h4>

              
                Strict iron regulation is essential for normal brain function. The main iron compounds responsible for iron homeostasis, transferrin and ferritin, are distributed heterogeneously across the brain and are implicated in aging, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, non-invasive discrimination between iron compounds, such as transferrin and ferritin, remains a challenge. We present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology for mapping of iron compounds in the living brain (the r1-r2* relaxivity). The specificity of the r1-r2* relaxivity to the presence of ferritin and transferrin is validated by both bottom-up and top-down approaches, incorporating in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo analyses. In vitro, our MRI approach reveals the distinct paramagnetic properties of ferritin and transferrin. In the in vivo human brain, we validate our approach against ex vivo iron compounds quantification and gene expression. Our approach predicts the transferrin-ferritin fraction across brain regions and in aging. It reveals brain tumors' iron homeostasis, and enhances the distinction between tumor tissue and non-pathological tissue without contrast agents. Therefore, our approach may allow for non-invasive research and diagnosis of iron homeostasis in living human brains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding violated sensory expectations from the auditory cortex of anaesthetized mice: Hierarchical recurrent neural network depicts separate 'danger' and 'safety' units</a></h4>

              
                The ability to respond appropriately to sensory information received from the external environment is among the most fundamental capabilities of central nervous systems. In the auditory domain, processes underlying this behaviour are studied by measuring auditory-evoked electrophysiology during sequences of sounds with predetermined regularities. Identifying neural correlates of ensuing auditory novelty responses is supported by research in experimental animals. In the present study, we reanalysed epidural field potential recordings from the auditory cortex of anaesthetised mice during frequency and intensity oddball stimulation. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) modelling were adopted to explore these data with greater resolution than previously considered using conventional methods. Time-wise and generalised temporal decoding MVPA approaches revealed previously underestimated asymmetry between responses to sound-level transitions in the intensity oddball paradigm, in contrast with tone frequency changes. After training, the cross-validated RNN model architecture with four hidden layers produced output waveforms in response to simulated auditory inputs that were strongly correlated with grand-average auditory-evoked potential waveforms (r2 > 0.9). Units in hidden layers were classified based on their temporal response properties and characterised using principal component analysis and sample entropy. These demonstrated spontaneous alpha rhythms, sound onset and offset responses, and putative  safety and  danger units activated by relatively inconspicuous and salient changes in auditory inputs, respectively. The hypothesised existence of corresponding biological neural sources is naturally derived from this model. If proven, this would have significant implications for prevailing theories of auditory processing.

	<p>The vestibular system exerts control over various functions through neural pathways that are not yet fully mapped. Functional dysregulations or tissue lesions at different levels of the peripheral and the central vestibular networks can alter these different functions, causing a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from posturo-locomotor alterations to psychiatric syndromes such as PPPD, including the deregulation of the main biological functions. These different symptoms differ by their expression kinetics (they each appear and regress with their own kinetics) by the targets affected (muscles, organs, and brain areas) and by the sensitivity specific to each individual. Vestibular pathologies thus cover a mosaic of distinct effects, and they involve various effectors&amp;amp;mdash;which constitute the many markers of their different types and stages. It is therefore crucial, to predict the onset of a vertigo syndrome, to follow its temporal course, or to monitor the impact of therapeutic approaches, and to have specific and reliable biomarkers. Hormonal variations are among the possible sources of biomarkers for neurotology. We know that specific hormonal profiles can promote the appearance of vestibular disorders. We also know that the expression of vertigo syndrome is accompanied by measurable hormonal variations. The link between endocrine deregulation and vestibular alterations therefore no longer needs to be proven. However, there are still few data on their precise correlations with the vertigo syndrome. This study was undertaken with the aim to deliver an extensive review of the hormonal alterations linked to vestibular disorders. A review of the literature covering the last two decades was carried out using the MEDLINE and COCHRANE databases in order to identify studies associating the terms vestibular system or vestibular pathologies and hormones. Bibliographic data provides several outcomes in terms of therapeutic innovation in the diagnosis and therapeutic follow-up of vestibular pathologies.</p>

	<p>Sex differences are poorly studied within the field of mental health, even though there is evidence of disparities (with respect to brain anatomy, activation patterns, and neurochemistry, etc.) that can significantly influence the etiology and course of mental disorders. The objective of this work was to review sex differences in adolescents (aged 13&amp;amp;ndash;18 years) diagnosed with ADHD (according to the DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria) in terms of substance use disorder (SUD), prevalence, pharmacological therapy and mental health. We searched three academic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) and performed a narrative review of a total of 21 articles. The main conclusions of this research were (1) girls with ADHD are more at risk of substance use than boys, although there was no consensus on the prevalence of dual disorders; (2) girls are less frequently treated because of underdiagnosis and because they are more often inattentive and thereby show less disruptive behavior; (3) together with increased impairment in cognitive and executive functioning in girls, the aforementioned could be related to greater substance use and poorer functioning, especially in terms of more self-injurious behavior; and (4) early diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, especially in adolescent girls, is essential to prevent early substance use, the development of SUD, and suicidal behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asynchronous excitatory neuron development in an isogenic cortical spheroid model of Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                The intellectual disability (ID) in Down syndrome (DS) is thought to result from a variety of developmental deficits such as alterations in neural progenitor division, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, cortical architecture, and reduced cortical volume. However, the molecular processes underlying these neurodevelopmental changes are still elusive, preventing an understanding of the mechanistic basis of ID in DS. In this study, we used a pair of isogenic (trisomic and euploid) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to generate cortical spheroids (CS) that model the impact of trisomy 21 on brain development. CS contain neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and they are widely used to approximate early neurodevelopment. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we uncovered cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in the trisomic CS. In particular, we found that excitatory neuron populations were most affected and that a specific population of cells with a transcriptomic profile resembling layer IV cortical neurons displayed the most profound divergence in developmental trajectory between trisomic and euploid genotypes. We also identified candidate genes potentially driving the developmental asynchrony between trisomic and euploid excitatory neurons. Direct comparison between the current isogenic CS scRNA-seq data and previously published datasets revealed several recurring differentially expressed genes between DS and control samples. Altogether, our study highlights the power and importance of cell type-specific analyses within a defined genetic background, coupled with broader examination of mixed samples, to comprehensively evaluate cellular phenotypes in the context of DS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordinated control of neuronal differentiation and wiring by a sustained code of transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                The enormous diversity of cell types in nervous systems presents a challenge in identifying the genetic mechanisms that encode it. Here, we report that nearly 200 distinct neurons in the Drosophila visual system can each be defined by unique combinations of [~]10 transcription factors that are continuously expressed by them. We show that targeted modifications of this  selector code induce predictable conversions of cell fates between neurons in vivo. These conversions appear morphologically and transcriptionally complete, arguing for a conserved gene regulatory program that jointly instructs both the type-specific development and the terminal features of neurons. Cis-regulatory sequence analysis of open chromatin links one of these selectors to an upstream patterning gene in stem cells that specifies neuronal fates. Experimentally validated network models show that selectors interact with ecdysone signaling to regulate downstream effectors controlling brain wiring. Our results provide a generalizable framework of how specific fates are initiated and maintained in postmitotic neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A role for the anterior hippocampus in autobiographical memory construction regardless of temporal distance</a></h4>

              
                Mounting evidence suggests distinct functional contributions of the anterior and posterior hippocampus to autobiographical memory retrieval, but how these subregions function under different retrieval demands as memories age is not yet understood. Specifically, autobiographical memory retrieval is not a homogenous process, rather, it is thought to consist of multiple stages: an early stage of memory construction and a later stage of detailed elaboration, which may differently engage the hippocampus over time. In the present study, we analyzed data from 40 participants who constructed and overtly elaborated upon recent and remote memories in response to picture cues in the fMRI scanner. We previously reported a temporal gradient in the posterior hippocampus during the elaboration period of autobiographical retrieval, with posterior hippocampal activation observed for recent but not remote timepoints. Here, we consider the previously unanalyzed construction stage of retrieval, where participants searched for and selected a memory. We found no evidence of a temporal gradient during memory construction, instead observing strong anterior hippocampus activity regardless of memory remoteness. Our findings suggest a unique contribution of the anterior hippocampus to the construction process of autobiographical retrieval over time. These findings highlight that retrieval processes, which have yet to be considered in current models of systems consolidation, offer novel insights to hippocampal subregion function over time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Goal-driven optimization of single-neuron properties in artificial networks reveals regularization role of neural diversity and adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Individual neurons, and the circuits they collectively form in the brain, have been subject to joint evolutionary pressure to produce system-level functions. Considerable effort has been invested in understanding the impact of single-neuron input-output mechanisms, such as diversity in f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation, on network computations. Yet, how goal-driven requirements at the network level influence single-neuron coding properties remains largely unexplored. Toward addressing this, we systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion in artificial recurrent neural networks. This is achieved by interconnected Adaptive Recurrent Units (ARU), which perform online control of a novel two-parameter family of activation functions mimicking the diversity of f-I curves found in common neural types in the brain. Our network of ARUs shows much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Importantly, we find that ARUs recover precise biological coding strategies such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we elucidate the role of these emergent single neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaption likely play an active regularization role that enables neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time. In doing so, we discuss how goal-driven optimization approaches, while not biologically plausible themselves, reveal neural mechanisms that are consistent with evolutionary pressures on the brain.

                Fear extinction allows for adaptive control of learned fear responses but often fails, resulting in a renewal or spontaneous recovery of the extinguished fear, i.e., forgetting of the extinction memory readily occurs. Using an activity-dependent neuronal labeling strategy, we demonstrate that engram neurons for fear extinction memory are dynamically positioned in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (vHPC), which constitute an engram construct in the term of directional engram synaptic connectivity from the BLA or vHPC to mPFC, but not that in the opposite direction, for retrieval of extinction memory. Fear renewal or spontaneous recovery switches the extinction engram construct from an accessible to inaccessible state, whereas additional extinction learning or optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation restores the directional engram connectivity and prevents the return of fear. Thus, the plasticity of engram construct underlies forgetting of extinction memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling mouse auditory response dynamics along a continuum of consciousness using a deep recurrent neural network</a></h4>

              
                ObjectiveUnderstanding neurophysiological changes that accompany transitions between anaesthetized and conscious states is a key objective of anesthesiology and consciousness science. This study aimed to characterize the dynamics of auditory-evoked potential morphology in mice along a continuum of consciousness.

ApproachEpidural field potentials were recorded from above the primary auditory cortices of two groups of laboratory mice: urethane-anaesthetized (A, n = 14) and conscious (C, n = 17). Both groups received auditory stimulation in the form of a repeated pure-tone stimulus, before and after receiving 10 mg/kg i.p. ketamine (AK and CK). Evoked responses were then ordered by ascending sample entropy into AK, A, CK, and C, considered to reflect physiological correlates of awareness. These data were used to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an input parameter encoding state. Model outputs were compared with grand-average event-related potential (ERP) waveforms. Subsequently, the state parameter was varied to simulate changes in the ERP that occur during transitions between states, and relationships with dominant peak amplitudes were quantified.

Main resultsThe RNN synthesized output waveforms that were in close agreement with grand-average ERPs for each group (r2 > 0.9, p < 0.0001). Varying the input state parameter generated model outputs reflecting changes in ERP morphology predicted to occur between states. Positive peak amplitudes within 25 to 50 ms, and negative peak amplitudes within 50 to 75 ms post-stimulus-onset, were found to display a sigmoidal characteristic during the transition from anaesthetized to conscious states. In contrast, negative peak amplitudes within 0 to 25 ms displayed greater linearity.

SignificanceThis study demonstrates a method for modelling changes in ERP morphology that accompany transitions between states of consciousness using a RNN. In future studies, this approach may be applied to human data to support the clinical use of ERPs to predict transition to consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Recurrent neural network model of human event-related potentials in response to intensity oddball stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the human event-related potential (ERP) is frequently interpreted as a sensory prediction-error signal. However, there is ambiguity concerning the neurophysiology underlying hypothetical prediction and prediction-error signalling components, and whether these can be dissociated from overlapping obligatory components of the ERP that are sensitive to physical properties of sounds. In the present study, a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) was fitted to ERP data from 38 subjects. After training the model to reproduce ERP waveforms evoked by 80 dB standard and 70 dB deviant stimuli, it was used to simulate a response to 90 dB deviant stimuli. Internal states of the RNN effectively combine to generate synthetic ERPs, where individual hidden units are loosely analogous to population-level sources. Model behaviour was characterised using principal component analysis of stimulus condition, layer, and individual unit responses. Hidden units were categorised according to their temporal response fields, and statistically significant differences among stimulus conditions were observed for amplitudes of units peaking in the 0 to 75 ms (P50), 75 to 125 ms (N1), and 250 to 400 ms (N3) latency ranges, surprisingly not including the measurement window of MMN. The model demonstrated opposite polarity changes in MMN amplitude produced by falling (70 dB) and rising (90 dB) intensity deviant stimuli, consistent with loudness dependence of sensory ERP components. Although perhaps less parsimoniously, these observations could be interpreted within the context of predictive coding theory, as examples of negative and positive prediction errors, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NMDA-receptor-Fc-fusion constructs neutralize anti- NMDA receptor antibodies</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is the most common subtype of autoimmune encephalitis characterized by a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome ranging from memory impairment and psychosis to coma. Patients develop an intrathecal immune response against NMDARs with antibodies that presumably bind to the amino-terminal domain (ATD) of the GluN1 subunit. The therapeutic response to immunotherapy is often delayed and does not directly interfere with intrathecal synthesis of pathogenic antibodies. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches for fast neutralization of NMDAR antibodies are needed. Here, we developed fusion constructs consisting of the Fc part of immunoglobulin G and the ATDs of either GluN1 or GluN2B or both, GluN1 and GluN2B, subunits. Surprisingly, both subunits were required to generate high-affinity epitopes. The construct with both subunits efficiently prevented NMDAR binding of patient-derived monoclonal antibodies and of patient cerebrospinal fluid containing high-titer NMDAR antibodies. Furthermore, it inhibited the internalization of NMDARs in rodent dissociated neurons and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons. Finally, the construct stabilized NMDAR currents recorded in rodent neurons. Our results demonstrate that both GluN1 and GluN2B subunits contribute to the main immunogenic region of the NMDAR and provide a promising strategy for fast and specific treatment of NMDAR encephalitis, which can complement immunotherapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning to suppress likely distractor locations in visual search is driven by the local distractor frequency</a></h4>

              
                Salient but task-irrelevant distractors interfere less with visual search when they appear in a display region where distractors have appeared more frequently in the past ('distractor-location probability cueing'). This effect could reflect the (re-)distribution of a global, limited attentional 'inhibition resource'. Accordingly, changing the frequency of distractor appearance in one display region should also affect the magnitude of interference generated by distractors in a different region. Alternatively, distractor-location learning may reflect a local response (e.g., 'habituation') to distractors occurring at a particular location. In this case, the local distractor frequency in one display region should not affect distractor interference in a different region. To decide between these alternatives, we conducted three experiments in which participants searched for an orientation-defined target while ignoring a more salient orientation distractor that occurred more often in one vs. another display region. Experiment 1 varied the ratio of distractors appearing in the frequent vs. rare regions (60/40-90/10), with a fixed global distractor frequency. The results revealed the cueing effect to increase with increasing probability ratio. In Experiments 2 and 3, one ('test') region was assigned the same local distractor frequency as in one of the conditions of Experiment 1, but a different frequency in the other region - dissociating local from global distractor frequency. Together, the three experiments showed that distractor interference in the test region was not significantly influenced by the frequency in the other region, consistent with purely local learning. We discuss the implications for theories of statistical distractor-location learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal cAMP-dependent synaptic potentiation, ERK-dependent immediate-early gene activation, and context-dependent fear conditioning in mice are linked through dependence on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RapGEF2</a></h4>

              
                The MAP kinase ERK is important for neuronal plasticity underlying associative learning, yet specific molecular pathways for ERK activation in hippocampus are still largely undetermined. RapGEF2 has emerged as a neuron-specific cAMP sensor that mediates ERK activation. We investigated whether RapGEF2 might also be required for cAMP-dependent ERK activation leading to synaptic potentiation, and how this involvement might be penetrant to hippocampus-dependent learned behavior. We demonstrate that conditional knockout of Rapgef2 in forebrain neurons, specifically in dentate gyrus and CA1 of the hippocampus, leads to an attenuation of context-dependent fear conditioning, but not of cue-dependent fear conditioning, in mice. RapGEF2 knockout is associated with a reduction in cAMP-dependent synaptic potentiation at two central hippocampal synapses-the entorhinal cortex-granule cell synapse and the CA3-CA1 synapse. Furthermore, cAMP-induced postsynaptic potentiation requires both RapGEF2 and activation of ERK. Induction of Egr-1/Zif268 (and pERK), but not of c-Fos, immediately following fear conditioning, was abolished in CA1 and detate gyrus, in the absence of RapGEF2 expression in these hippocampal regions, thus revealing a link between learning (conditioning) and molecular pathways activated during conditioned fear memory formation. Hence, we suggest that contextual fear conditioning is mediated via RapGEF2-dependent ERK activation and downstream induction of Egr-1, via an underlying mechanism of cAMP-dependent long-term potentiation at hippocampal synapses. Cyclic AMP-dependent GEFs have been genetically associated as risk factors for schizophrenia, a disorder associated with cognitive deficits. This study provides a functional link between one of these cAMP-dependent GEFs, RapGEF2, and cognitive processes involved in associative learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explaining and Predicting the Effects of Neurostimulation via Neuronal Excitation/Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has highlighted the role of the excitation/inhibition ratio (E/I) for typical and atypical development, mental health, cognition, and learning. Parallel research has highlighted the benefits of high-frequency random noise stimulation (tRNS), an excitatory form of neurostimulation, on learning. We examined the E/I as a potential mechanism and whether tRNS effect on learning depends on E/I as measured by the aperiodic exponent. In addition to manipulating E/I using tRNS, we also manipulated the level of learning (learning/overlearning) that has been shown to influence E/I. One hundred and two participants received either sham stimulation or 20 min DLPFC tRNS during a mathematical learning task. We showed a lower aperiodic exponent, which reflects higher E/I, after tRNS, and that higher baseline aperiodic exponent, which reflects lower E/I, predicted greater benefit from tRNS specifically for the learning task. In contrast to previous MRS-based E/I studies, we found no effect of the learning manipulation on E/I. Our results highlight the role of E/I as a marker for neurostimulation efficacy and learning. This mechanistic understanding could provide stronger potential to augment learning. At the same time, we offer new insights on the quantification of E/I using EEG vs MRS to foster better theoretical understanding and its utilisation in future research.

                Healthy ageing is commonly accompanied by cognitive decline affecting several domains such as executive control, whereas certain verbal skills remain relatively preserved. Interestingly, recent scientific research has shown that some intellectual activities may be linked to beneficial effects, delaying or even alleviating cognitive decline in the elderly. Thirty young (age: M = 23) and thirty old (age: M = 66) adults were assessed in executive control (switching) and literacy experience (print exposure). First, we tried to confirm whether healthy ageing was generally associated with deficits in switching by looking at mixing cost effects, to then investigate if individual differences in print exposure explained variation in that age-related mixing costs. Both accuracy and reaction times mixing cost indexes demonstrated larger cost in old (but not in young) adults when switching from local to global information. More importantly, this cost effect disappeared in old adults with higher print exposure (reaction times). Our findings suggest literacy experience accumulated across the life-span may act as a cognitive reserve proxy to prevent executive control decline.

                The axon initial segment (AIS) is a critical locus of control of action potential (AP) generation and neuronal information synthesis. Concussive traumatic brain injury gives rise to diffuse axotomy, and the majority of neocortical axonal injury arises at the AIS. Consequently, concussive traumatic brain injury might profoundly disrupt the functional specialization of this region. To investigate this hypothesis, one and two days after mild central fluid percussion injury in Thy1-YFP-H mice, we recorded high-resolution APs from axotomized and adjacent intact layer 5 pyramidal neurons and applied a second derivative (2o) analysis to measure the AIS- and soma-regional contributions to the AP upstroke. All layer 5 pyramidal neurons recorded from sham animals manifested two stark 2o peaks separated by a negative intervening slope. In contrast, within injured mice, we discovered a subset of axotomized layer 5 pyramidal neurons in which the AIS-regional 2o peak was abolished, a functional perturbation associated with diminished excitability, axonal sprouting and distention of the AIS as assessed by staining for ankyrin-G. Our analysis revealed an additional subpopulation of both axotomized and intact layer 5 pyramidal neurons that manifested a melding together of the AIS- and soma-regional 2o peaks, suggesting a more subtle aberration of sodium channel function and/or translocation of the AIS initiation zone closer to the soma. When these experiments were repeated in animals in which cyclophilin-D was knocked out, these effects were ameliorated, suggesting that trauma-induced AIS functional perturbation is associated with mitochondrial calcium dysregulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The contribution of Neanderthal introgression and natural selection to neurodegenerative diseases</a></h4>

              
                Background: Humans are thought to be more susceptible to neurodegeneration than equivalently-aged primates. It is not known whether this vulnerability is specific to anatomically-modern humans or shared with other hominids. The contribution of introgressed Neanderthal DNA to neurodegenerative disorders remains uncertain. It is also unclear how common variants associated with neurodegenerative disease risk are maintained by natural selection in the population despite their deleterious effects. In this study, we aimed to quantify the genome-wide contribution of Neanderthal introgression and positive selection to the heritability of complex neurodegenerative disorders to address these questions. Methods: We used stratified-linkage disequilibrium score regression to investigate the relationship between five SNP-based signatures of natural selection, reflecting different timepoints of evolution, and genome-wide associated variants of the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results: We found a significant depletion of positively-selected SNPs in the heritability of Parkinson's disease, raising the possibility that these variants may modulate disease risk, in addition to conferring an evolutionary advantage. For Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, common deleterious disease variants are unlikely to be maintained by positive selection. There was no enrichment of Neanderthal introgression in the SNP-heritability of these disorders, suggesting that Neanderthal admixture is unlikely to have contributed to disease risk. Conclusions: These findings provide insight into the origins of neurodegenerative disorders within the evolution of Homo sapiens and addresses a long-standing debate, showing that Neanderthal admixture is unlikely to have contributed to common genetic risk of neurodegeneration in anatomically-modern humans.

                The dual specificity lipid/protein phosphatase SHIP1 (encoded by the INPP5D gene) is enriched in myeloid cells. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in INPP5D coding and non-coding regions impact risk for developing late onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We present pathological analyses with spatial transcriptomics of mice with tamoxifen-sensitive microglial knockdown of Inpp5d and show exacerbated plaque pathology, plaque-associated microglial density, and altered gene expression around plaques, suggesting novel markers for plaque-associated reactive microglia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EndophilinA-dependent coupling between activity-dependent calcium influx and synaptic autophagy is disrupted by a Parkinson-risk mutation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity and neurotransmitter release cause use-dependent decline in protein function. However, it is unclear how this is coupled to local protein turnover and quality control mechanisms. Here we show that the endocytic protein Endophilin-A (EndoA/ENDOA1) couples activity-induced calcium influx to synaptic autophagy and neuronal survival. We identify single mutations in the EndoA flexible region that either increases EndoA diffusion and promotes autophagosome formation in the absence of calcium, or immobilizes EndoA and blocks autophagy, even in the presence of calcium. Hence, the EndoA flexible region is a switch that responds to calcium, regulating EndoA nanoscale synaptic organization and association with autophagosomes driving their formation. Interestingly, a pathogenic variant in the human ENDOA1 variable region that confers risk to Parkinson s disease (PD), also confines ENDOA1 to the synaptic plasma membrane and equally blocks autophagy in flies in vivo and in induced human neurons. Thus, our work reveals a mechanism neurons use to connect neuronal activity to local protein turnover by autophagy, which is critical for neuronal survival.

                Different sleep states have been shown to be vital for a variety of brain function, including learning, memory, and skill consolidation. However, our understanding of neural dynamics during sleep and the role of prominent LFP frequency bands remain incomplete. To discern changes between different behavioral states we collected multichannel LFP and spike data in primary motor cortex of unconstrained macaques for up to 24 hours using the Neurochip3. Each 8 second bin of time was classified into awake and moving (Move), awake and at rest (Rest), REM sleep (REM), or non-REM sleep (NREM) by using dimensionality reduction and clustering on the average spectral density and the acceleration of the head. LFP power showed high delta during NREM, high theta during REM, and high beta when the animal was awake. Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling typically showed higher coupling for deeper sleep between all pairs of frequency bands except for high delta-high gamma and theta-high gamma coupling during Move, and high theta-beta coupling during REM. Sorted single units showed decreased firing rate with deeper sleep, though with higher, bursty patterns during NREM compared to other states. Spike-LFP synchrony showed high delta synchrony during Move, and higher coupling with all other frequency bands during NREM. These results altogether are consistent with previous findings showing reactivation of cortical circuitry activated during the day, which may be driven by the delta band LFP.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BMAL1 loss in oligodendroglial lineage cells dysregulates myelination and sleep</a></h4>

              
                Myelination depends on maintenance of oligodendrocytes that arise from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). We show that the dynamic nature of oligodendroglia and myelination are regulated by the circadian transcription factor BMAL1. Bmal1 knockdown in OPCs during development, but not adulthood, decreases OPC proliferation, whereas BMAL1 regulates OPC morphology throughout life. OPC-specific Bmal1 deficiency impairs remyelination in an age-dependent manner, suggesting that age-associated decrements in circadian regulation of oligodendroglia may contribute to the deficient remyelination potential in demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). This oligodendroglial dysregulation and dysmyelination increase sleep fragmentation in OPC-specific Bmal1 knockout mice, and sleep fragmentation is causally associated with MS. These findings have broad mechanistic and therapeutic implications for numerous brain disorders that include both myelin and sleep phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The activation of mGluR4 rescues parallel fiber LTP, motor learning and social behavior in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X patients and mice lacking the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) suffer from multiple behavioral alterations, including deficits in motor learning. We found that enhanced synaptic vesicle (SV) docking in cerebellar parallel fiber to Purkinje cell Fmr1KO synapses was associated with enhanced asynchronous release, which not only occludes further potentiation, but it also compromises presynaptic parallel fiber long-term potentiation (PF-LTP). A reduction in extracellular Ca2+ restored the readily releasable pool (RRP) size, rescuing {beta} adrenergic receptor-mediated potentiation and parallel fiber LTP. Interestingly, VU 0155041, a selective positive allosteric modulator of mGluR4, also restored both the RRP size and parallel fiber LTP. Moreover, when injected into Fmr1KO mice, VU 0155041 improved motor learning in skilled reaching, classical eyeblink conditioning and vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) tests, as well as improving the social behavior of these mice. Thus, pharmacological activation of mGluRs may offer therapeutic relief for motor learning and social deficits in Fragile X Syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Features Underlying the Memorability of Objects</a></h4>

              
                Despite decades of study of memory, it remains unclear what makes an image memorable. There is considerable debate surrounding the underlying determinants of memory, including the roles of semantic (e.g., animacy, utility) and visual features (e.g., brightness) as well as whether the most prototypical or most atypical items are best remembered. Prior studies have relied on constrained stimulus sets, limiting any generalized view of the features that may contribute to memory. Here, we collected over one million memory ratings (N=13,946) for THINGS (Hebart et al., 2019), a naturalistic dataset of 26,107 object images designed to comprehensively sample concrete objects. First, we establish a model of object features that is predictive of image memorability, capturing over half of the explainable variance. For this model, we find that semantic features have a stronger influence than visual features on what people will remember. Second, we examined whether memorability could be accounted for by the typicality of the objects, by comparing human behavioral data, object feature dimensions, and deep neural network features. While prototypical objects tend to be the most memorable, the relationship between memorability and typicality is more complex than a simple positive or negative association and typicality alone cannot account for memorability.

To this end, volumetric brain atlases enable histological datasets to be spatially registered and analysed, yet accurate registration remains expertise-dependent and slow.

	<p>Anxiety disorder impacts the quality of life of the patients. The 95% ethanol extract of rhizomes and roots of Valeriana jatamansi Jones (Zhi zhu xiang, ZZX) has previously been shown to be effective for the treatment of anxiety disorder. In this study, the dose ratio of each component of the anxiolytic compounds group (ACG) in a 95% ethanol extract of ZZX was optimized by a uniform design experiment and mathematical modeling. The anxiolytic effect of ACG was verified by behavioral experiments and biochemical index measurement. Network pharmacology was used to determine potential action targets, as well as predict biological processes and signaling pathways, which were then verified by molecular docking analysis. Metabolomics was then used to screen and analyze metabolites in the rat hippocampus before and after the administration of ZZX-ACG. Finally, the results of metabolomics and network pharmacology were integrated to clarify the anti-anxiety mechanism of the ACG. The optimal dose ratio of ACG in 95% ethanol extract of ZZX was obtained, and our results suggest that ACG may regulate ALB, AKT1, PTGS2, CYP3A4, ESR1, CASP3, CYP2B6, EGFR, SRC, MMP9, IGF1, and MAPK8, as well as the prolactin signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and arachidonic acid metabolism pathway, thus affecting the brain neurotransmitters and HPA axis hormone levels to play an anxiolytic role, directly or indirectly.</p>

	<p>Preclinical evidence suggests a main role of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling in drug addiction. Recently, we reported alterations in the plasma concentrations of LPA species in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). As there are sex differences in drug addiction, the main aim of the present study was to investigate whether relevant LPA species (16:0-LPA, 18:0-LPA, 18:1-LPA, 18:2-LPA and 20:4-LPA) were associated with sex and/or substance use disorder (SUD). This exploratory study was conducted in 214 abstinent patients with lifetime SUD, and 91 healthy control subjects. The SUD group was divided according to the diagnosis of AUD and/or cocaine use disorder (CUD). Participants were clinically assessed, and plasma samples were collected to determine LPA species and total LPA. We found that LPA concentrations were significantly affected by sex, and women showed higher concentrations than men. In addition, there were significantly lower 16:0-LPA, 18:2-LPA and total LPA concentrations in patients with SUD than in controls. Namely, patients with CUD and AUD + CUD showed lower LPA concentrations than controls or patients with AUD. In conclusion, our data suggest that LPA species could be potential biomarkers for SUD in women and men, which could contribute to a better stratification of these patients in treatment programs.</p>

	<p>Many people are affected by tinnitus, a sensation of ringing in the ear despite the absence of external sound. Goshajinkigan (GJG) is one of the formulations of Japanese traditional herbal medicine and is prescribed for the palliative treatment of patients with tinnitus. Although GJG is clinically effective in these patients, its behavioral effects and the underlying neuroanatomical substrate have not been modeled in animals. We modeled tinnitus using salicylate-treated rats, demonstrated the effectiveness of GJG on tinnitus, and examined the underlying neuronal substrate with c-Fos expression. Intraperitoneal injection of sodium salicylate (400 mg/kg) into rats for three consecutive days significantly increased false positive scores, which were used to assess tinnitus behavior. When GJG was orally administered one hour after each salicylate injection, the increase in tinnitus behavior was suppressed. The analysis of c-Fos expression in auditory-related brain areas revealed that GJG significantly reduced the salicylate-induced increase in the number of c-Fos-expressing cells in the auditory cortices, inferior colliculus, and dorsal cochlear nucleus. These results suggest a suppressive effect of GJG on salicylate-induced tinnitus in animal models.</p>

	<p>A growing body of research documents the persistence of physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms following the resolution of acute COVID-19 infection. To the best of our knowledge, no published study has examined the interaction between insomnia and mental health. Accordingly, we proposed to examine new diagnoses of insomnia, and referrals to pulmonary and sleep medicine clinics for treatment of sleep disorders, in patients presenting to one post-acute COVID-19 recovery clinic. Additionally, we aimed to examine the relationship between poor sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Patients presented to the clinic on average 2 months following COVID-19 infection; 51.9% (n = 41) were hospitalized, 11.4% (n = 9) were in the intensive care unit, 2.5% (n = 2) were on a mechanical ventilator, and 38.0% (n = 30) were discharged on oxygen. The most commonly reported symptom was fatigue (88%, n = 70), with worse sleep following a COVID-19 infection reported in 50.6% (n = 40). The mean PSQI score was 9.7 (82.3%, n = 65 with poor sleep quality). The mean GAD-7 score was 8.3 (22.8%, n = 14 with severe depression). The mean PHQ-9 was 10.1 (17.8%, n = 18 with severe anxiety). The mean IES-6 was 2.1 (54.4%, n = 43 with post-traumatic stress). Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with increased severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Future work should follow patients longitudinally to examine if sleep, fatigue, and mental health symptoms improve over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In vitro and in vivo study: Ethanolic extract leaves of Azadirachta indica Juss. variant of Indonesia and Philippines suppresses tumor growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 signaling [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Azadirachta indica Juss. has been shown to suppress cancer progression through a variety of mechanisms. In order to treat cancer progression, cancer immunotherapy is used to stimulate the immune system where immunosuppression is present in tumor microenvironments. Many cancer cells produce a lot of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and signal transducer activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3 plays a key role in suppressing the expression of critical immune activation regulators. IL‐6‐mediated STAT3 activation is common in the tumor microenvironment. Inhibiting the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway has become a therapeutic option for cancer progression. As vimentin is also expressed in hepatic stellate cells boosting cancer survival. We focused on the precise effect of extract from leaves of Azadirachta indica Juss, on inhibiting the IL-6/STAT3 signaling cascade on hepatocellular carcinoma by in vitro and in vivo study. Methods: In the in vitro study, the effect of Azadirachta indica Juss. variant Indonesia and Philippines against the expression of IL-6 and STAT3 was examined in liver cancer cell line. In the in vivo study, 24 male rats (Rattus norvegicus) strain Wistar were induced by diethylnitrosamine and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Based on the therapy given, the groups were divided into negative control, positive control, Indonesia extract, and Philippine extract. Expression of IL-6, STAT3, and vimentin were tested using immunohistochemistry staining. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance, which was then followed by the Tukey test. Results: Statistically significant difference in IL-6 and STAT3 was observed between the treatment groups and positive control group by in vitro study and in vivo study. Generally, there is no significant difference between treatment using Indonesian and Philippine leaves. Conclusion: Both therapy doses of Azadirachta indica variant in Indonesia and Philippines were able to reduce IL-6, STAT3 and vimentin expression of hepatocellular carcinoma cell by in vitro and in vivo experiment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Attitudes toward and knowledge of collaboration of dental and medical practice among medical students in Southern India: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:    Enhancing oral health care services provided through inter-professional collaboration between medical and dental practitioner is important, and even essential. The purpose of this study is to assess the attitude toward and knowledge of medical-dental collaborative practice among medical students attending colleges in Southern India. Methods:       A cross sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among medical students and interns of medical colleges in coastal South India with prior information and permission. The questionnaire consisted of 11 questions to assess attitude toward and knowledge of medical-dental collaborative practice. The demographic backgrounds of participants were also recorded. Chi square test was employed for data analysis. The responses obtained were correlated with age, gender and year of study of participants using Pearson’s correlation test Results:        A total 250 questionnaires were distributed and 234 responses were appropriately completed. Most of the students agreed that oral health was an integral part of systemic health, however participants disagreed on attending compulsory rotation in dentistry at a statistically significant level (p<0.05), moreover participants did not agree with physicians having an active role in motivating their patients for regular dental check-up. 82% of the medical students believe that dental check-up should be included in health packages under health insurance. A statistically significant (p<0.05) difference was observed among 3rd year & 4th year students and interns and also it was found that female students provided more positive responses towards medical-dental collaboration. Conclusions:        Even though medical students showed fairly positive attitudes and knowledge towards dentistry, the analysis within the study groups showed that knowledge and attitudes regarding the collaborative practice worsened over the academic years among the medical students. In order to destigmatize and foster interdisciplinary collaboration which would contribute to higher resource efficiency and the standard of care, continuing education in both the disciplines would be highly beneficial.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of sulfated polysaccharide activity against virulent Plasmodium falciparum PHISTb/RLP1 protein [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence of artemisinin resistance in South East Asia calls for urgent discovery of new drug compounds that have antiplasmodial activity. Unlike the classical compound screening drug discovery methods, the rational approach involving targeted drug discovery is less cumbersome and therefore key for innovation of new antiplasmodial compounds.  Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) utilizes the process of host erythrocyte remodeling using Plasmodium-helical interspersed sub-telomeric domain (PHIST) containing proteins, which are amenable drug targets. The aim of this study is to identify inhibitors of PHIST from sulfated polysaccharides as new antimalarials. Methods: 251 samples from an ongoing study of epidemiology of malaria and drug resistance sensitivity patterns in Kenya were sequenced for PHISTb/RLP1 gene using Sanger sequencing. The sequenced reads were mapped to the reference Pf3D7 protein sequence of PHISTb/RLP1 using CLC Main Workbench. Homology modeling of both reference and mutant protein structures was achieved using the LOMETs tool. The models were refined using ModRefiner for energy minimization. Ramachandran plot was generated by ProCheck to assess the conformation of amino acids in the protein model. Protein binding sites predictions were assessed using FT SITE software. We searched for prospective antimalarials from PubChem. Docking experiments were achieved using AutoDock Vina and analysis results visualized in PyMOL. Results: Sanger sequencing generated 86 complete sequences. Upon mapping of the sequences to the reference, 12 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were considered for mutant protein structure analysis. Eleven drug compounds with antiplasmodial activity were identified. Both modeled PHISTb/RLP1 reference and mutant structures had a Ramachandran score of >90% of the amino acids in the favored region. Ten of the drug compounds interacted with amino acid residues in PHISTb and RESA domains, showing potential activity against these proteins. Conclusion: This research identifies inhibitors of exported proteins that can be used in in vitro tests against the Plasmodium parasite.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Andrographolide, isolated from Andrographis paniculata, induces apoptosis in monocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma cells via augmentation of reactive oxygen species production [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Andrographolide (Andro) is a diterpenoid component of the plant Andrographis paniculata that is known for its anti-tumor activity against a variety of cancer cells.   Methods: We studied the effects of Andro on the viability of the human leukemia monocytic cell line THP-1 and the human multiple myeloma cell line H929. Andro was compared with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and vincristine (VCR), which are well-established therapeutics against hematopoietic tumors. The importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production for the toxicity of each agent was investigated by using an inhibitor of ROS production, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC).    Results:  Andro reduced the viability of THP-1 and H929 in a concentration-dependent manner. H929 viability was highly susceptible to Andro, although only slightly susceptible to Ara-C. The agents Andro, Ara-C, and VCR each induced apoptosis, as shown by cellular shrinkage, DNA fragmentation, and increases in annexin V-binding, caspase-3/7 activity, ROS production, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Whereas Ara-C and VCR increased the percentages of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases, respectively, Andro showed little or no detectable effect on cell cycle progression. The apoptotic activities of Andro were largely suppressed by NAC, an inhibitor of ROS production, whereas NAC hardly affected the apoptotic activities of Ara-C and VCR.  Conclusions: Andro induces ROS-dependent apoptosis in monocytic leukemia THP-1 and multiple myeloma H929 cells, underlining its potential as a therapeutic agent for treating hematopoietic tumors. The high toxicity for H929 cells, by a mechanism that is different from that of Ara-C and VCR, is encouraging for further studies on the use of Andro against multiple myeloma.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">phastSim: Efficient simulation of sequence evolution for pandemic-scale datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicola De Maio, William Boulton, Lukas Weilguny, Conor R. Walker, Yatish Turakhia, Russell Corbett-Detig, Nick Goldman</p>

Sequence simulators are fundamental tools in bioinformatics, as they allow us to test data processing and inference tools, and are an essential component of some inference methods. The ongoing surge in available sequence data is however testing the limits of our bioinformatics software. One example is the large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available, which are beyond the processing power of many methods, and simulating such large datasets is also proving difficult. Here, we present a new algorithm and software for efficiently simulating sequence evolution along extremely large trees (e.g. > 100, 000 tips) when the branches of the tree are short, as is typical in genomic epidemiology. Our algorithm is based on the Gillespie approach, and it implements an efficient multi-layered search tree structure that provides high computational efficiency by taking advantage of the fact that only a small proportion of the genome is likely to mutate at each branch of the considered phylogeny. Our open source software allows easy integration with other Python packages as well as a variety of evolutionary models, including indel models and new hypermutability models that we developed to more realistically represent SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Population heterogeneity in clinical cohorts affects the predictive accuracy of brain imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oualid Benkarim, Casey Paquola, Bo-yong Park, Valeria Kebets, Seok-Jun Hong, Reinder Vos de Wael, Shaoshi Zhang, B. T. Thomas Yeo, Michael Eickenberg, Tian Ge, Jean-Baptiste Poline, Boris C. Bernhardt, Danilo Bzdok</p>

Brain imaging research enjoys increasing adoption of supervised machine learning for single-participant disease classification. Yet, the success of these algorithms likely depends on population diversity, including demographic differences and other factors that may be outside of primary scientific interest. Here, we capitalize on propensity scores as a composite confound index to quantify diversity due to major sources of population variation. We delineate the impact of population heterogeneity on the predictive accuracy and pattern stability in 2 separate clinical cohorts: the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE, <i>n</i> = 297) and the Healthy Brain Network (HBN, <i>n</i> = 551). Across various analysis scenarios, our results uncover the extent to which cross-validated prediction performances are interlocked with diversity. The instability of extracted brain patterns attributable to diversity is located preferentially in regions part of the default mode network. Collectively, our findings highlight the limitations of prevailing deconfounding practices in mitigating the full consequences of population diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Context coding in the mouse nucleus accumbens modulates motivationally relevant information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jimmie M. Gmaz, Matthijs A. A. van der Meer</p>

Neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to track fundamentally value-centric quantities linked to reward and effort. However, the NAc also contributes to flexible behavior in ways that are difficult to explain based on value signals alone, raising the question of if and how nonvalue signals are encoded in NAc. We recorded NAc neural ensembles while head-fixed mice performed an odor-based biconditional discrimination task where an initial discrete cue modulated the behavioral significance of a subsequently presented reward-predictive cue. We extracted single-unit and population-level correlates related to the cues and found value-independent coding for the initial, context-setting cue. This context signal occupied a population-level coding space orthogonal to outcome-related representations and was predictive of subsequent behaviorally relevant responses to the reward-predictive cues. Together, these findings support a gating model for how the NAc contributes to behavioral flexibility and provide a novel population-level perspective from which to view NAc computations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Adamant: a JSON schema-based metadata editor for research data management workflows [version 1; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The web tool Adamant has been developed to systematically collect research metadata as early as the conception of the experiment. Adamant enables a continuous, consistent, and transparent research data management (RDM) process, which is a key element of good scientific practice ensuring the path to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) research data. It simplifies the creation of on-demand metadata schemas and the collection of metadata according to established or new standards. The approach is based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) schema, where any valid schema can be presented as an interactive web-form. Furthermore, Adamant eases the integration of numerous available RDM methods and software tools into the everyday research activities of especially small independent laboratories. A programming interface allows programmatic integration with other software tools such as electronic lab books or repositories. The user interface (UI) of Adamant is designed to be as user friendly as possible. Each UI element is self-explanatory and intuitive to use, which makes it accessible for users that have little to no experience with JSON format and programming in general. Several examples of research data management workflows that can be implemented using Adamant are introduced. Adamant (client-only version) is available from: https://plasma-mds.github.io/adamant.

                Background: Down Syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder that causes structural, functional anomalies, and intellectual disability. The common oral hygiene problems found in DS children are gingivitis, periodontal problems, pain, infection, and problems with the masticatory system. This study explored the relationship between parents' oral hygiene knowledge and oral hygiene of children with DS.   Method: This was an observational analytical study. To assess parents' oral hygiene knowledge, a questionnaire consisting of 25 questions was distributed to 100 parents whose DS children in POTADS (Down Syndrome Parents Association) Surabaya. To assess the DS children's oral hygiene, dental exams were performed to calculate the individual Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified (OHI-S) scores by dividing the sum of the individual debris and calculus scores by six (the number of teeth examined). The data were analysed using regression analysis. Results: There was a significant and strong inverse relationship between parents’ oral hygiene knowledge and DS children’s oral hygiene. Parents’ oral hygiene knowledge affected DS children’s oral hygiene. The results of the regression analysis indicated that a 1% increase in parents' knowledge caused a reduction in the OHI-S score to 7.377. Conclusion: A significant inverse relationship between parents’ oral hygiene knowledge and DS children’s oral hygiene was observed in this study. Further studies could be conducted to determine other variables that my influence both parents’ oral hygiene knowledge and DS children’s oral hygiene.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Critical delay factors for construction projects in Central Aceh District, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Construction development in Indonesia is growing rapidly, especially in Central Aceh District. Construction projects have distinctive characteristics and are very complex, so that risk events can have a serious impact on the viability of the project. A lack of attention to the risks faced will affect project implementation by creating delays, resulting in losses. The purpose of this study was to (1) identify the risk factors that cause delays in construction projects and (2) determine those particular risk factors that have a greater influence on construction projects. The location of this research was Central Aceh District, Indonesia. Methods: The data in this study were primary data in the form of a questionnaire and secondary data obtained from the literature related to this particular type of research. Questionnaires were distributed to respondents, namely contractor companies located in the Central Aceh District. The questionnaires were distributed to determine respondents' opinions about the level of influence of risk factors causing project delays. We used a validity test, reliability test, and descriptive analysis for data processing. Results: Based on the results of the study from 47 respondents, the “very high influence” category (Mode=5) for the tool malfunction factor was chosen by 21 respondents (44.68%), cost estimation inaccuracy by 20 respondents (42.55%), increased work costs by 22 respondents (46.81%), implementation of new technologies by 25 respondents (53.19%), details, accuracy and conformity to specifications that are not appropriate by 20 respondents (42.55%), worker quarrels by 20 respondents (42.55%), poor project planning and management by 22 respondents (46.81%), poor condition at locations and accessibility difficulty by 20 respondents (42.55%). Conclusions: Of the 80 risk factors that caused project delays, eight risk factors were found to have a very high influence on the implementation of construction projects in Central Aceh District.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in hypofunctional teeth during orthodontic tooth movement in rats [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: When moved orthodontically, hypofunctional teeth will have a decreased tooth movement rate compared to normal teeth. This study aimed to determine the number of osteoblasts in the tension side and the number of osteoclasts in the pressure side of the hypofunctional teeth during orthodontic tooth movement. Method: 18 male Wistar rats were given a palatal coil spring application on the maxillary incisors. Rats were divided into two groups, the orthodontic group with normal occlusion (NO) and hypofunctional occlusion (HO). The number of osteoblasts on the tension side and osteoclasts on the pressure side on days zero (D0), five (D5), and 10 (D10) were tested with two-way ANOVA. Observations were made by hematoxylin eosin staining. Result: The results showed that the number of osteoblasts on the tension side of the HO group was the same at the NO group (p> 0.05). The number of osteoblasts on the tension side in the NO and HO groups at D5 was the same at D10 (p = 0.99), but significantly higher (p = 0.002), than D0. The number of osteoclasts on the pressure side in the HO group was significantly lower than the NO group (p <0.05). The number of osteoclasts in the NO D5 group was significantly higher than the other groups (p <0.05). Conclusions: The number of osteoblasts on the tension side was not affected by the hypofunctional state but decreased the number of osteoclasts on the pressure side during orthodontic tooth movement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Associations among smoking, IDH mutations, MGMT promoter methylation, and grading in glioma: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background  Several molecular markers have important roles in glioma management. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene are associated with the grading and prognosis of glioma. Methylation in the promoter region of the O (6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is an important determinant of glioma sensitivity to alkylating agents. Studies in various cancers indicated that IDH1 mutations and MGMT promoter methylations were associated with smoking habits. However, these associations in gliomas are still unclear. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the association among smoking, IDH1 mutations, MGMT promoter methylation, and grading in glioma patients.  Methods  Patients were recruited from Dr. Sardjito General Hospital (a referral hospital in Yogyakarta and Central Java region) and its network hospitals. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples or fresh glioma tissues. Identification of IDH1 mutation was performed using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) or DNA sequencing. Methylation-specific real-time PCR was performed to identify MGMT promoter methylation status. Smoking status was obtained by history taken from the patient or family members.  Results  In total, 122 patients were included in this study. As many as 35 patients (28.7%) had a smoking history. Most smokers (57.1%) smoke less than ten cigarettes per day. However, most of them (68.8%) have been smoking for more than 20 years. Smoking patients have a significantly higher proportion of high-grade glioma than non-smokers (80% vs. 55.2%, p=0.01). Among 122 patients, 24 (19.7%) of them carried IDH1 mutation. Smoking patients have a significantly higher proportion of IDH1 mutation compared with non-smokers (31.4% vs. 14.9%, p<0.001). No significant association was found between intensity and duration of smoking with IDH1 mutations and glioma grading. No significant association was found between smoking and MGMT promoter methylation.   Conclusions  In glioma patients, smoking is associated with IDH1 mutations and grading but not with MGMT promoter methylation.
