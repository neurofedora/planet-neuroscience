              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Manipulation of G-Protein {gamma}7 Subunit in Mice Provides New Insights into Striatal Control of Motor Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stimulatory coupling of dopamine D<SUB>1</SUB> (D<SUB>1</SUB>R) and adenosine A<SUB>2A</SUB> receptors (A<SUB>2A</SUB>R) to adenylyl cyclase within the striatum is mediated through a specific G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer to ultimately modulate motor behaviors. To dissect the individual roles of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer in different populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), we produced and characterized conditional mouse models, in which the <I>Gng7</I> gene was deleted in either the D<SUB>1</SUB>R- or A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-expressing MSNs. We show that conditional loss of <SUB>7</SUB> disrupts the cell type-specific assembly of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer, thereby identifying its circumscribed roles acting downstream of either the D<SUB>1</SUB>Rs or A<SUB>2A</SUB>Rs in coordinating motor behaviors, including <I>in vivo</I> responses to psychostimulants. We reveal that G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>/cAMP signal in D<SUB>1</SUB>R-MSNs does not impact spontaneous and amphetamine-induced locomotor behaviors in male and female mice, while its loss in A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-MSNs results in a hyperlocomotor phenotype and enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine. Additionally, G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>/cAMP signal in either D<SUB>1</SUB>R- or A<SUB>2A</SUB>R/D<SUB>2</SUB>R-expressing MSNs is not required for the activation of PKA signaling by amphetamine. Finally, we show that G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> signaling acting downstream of D<SUB>1</SUB>Rs is selectively implicated in the acute locomotor-enhancing effects of morphine. Collectively, these results support the general notion that receptors use specific G&alpha;&beta; proteins to direct the fidelity of downstream signaling pathways and to elicit a diverse repertoire of cellular functions. Specifically, these findings highlight the critical role for the <SUB>7</SUB> protein in determining the cellular level, and hence, the function of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer in several disease states associated with dysfunctional striatal signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysfunction or imbalance of cAMP signaling in the striatum has been linked to several neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dystonia, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. By genetically targeting the <SUB>7</SUB> subunit in distinct striatal neuronal subpopulations in mice, we demonstrate that the formation and function of the G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB> heterotrimer, which represents the rate-limiting step for cAMP production in the striatum, is selectively disrupted. Furthermore, we reveal cell type-specific roles for G&alpha;<SUB>olf</SUB>&beta;<SUB>2</SUB><SUB>7</SUB>-mediated cAMP production in the control of spontaneous locomotion as well as behavioral and molecular responses to psychostimulants. Our findings identify the <SUB>7</SUB> protein as a novel therapeutic target for disease states associated with dysfunctional striatal cAMP signaling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Metaplastic Reinforcement of Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal Area CA2 by Cholinergic Receptor Activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal CA2, an inconspicuously positioned area between the well-studied CA1 and CA3 subfields, has captured research interest in recent years because of its role in social memory formation. However, the role of cholinergic inputs to the CA2 area for the regulation of synaptic plasticity remains to be fully understood. We show that cholinergic receptor activation with the nonselective cholinergic agonist, carbachol (CCh), triggers a protein synthesis-dependent and NMDAR-independent long-term synaptic depression (CCh-LTD) at entorhinal cortical (EC)-CA2 and Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA2 synapses in the hippocampus of adult male Wistar rats. The activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) is critical for the induction of CCh-LTD with the results suggesting an involvement of M3 and M1 mAChRs in the early facilitation of CCh-LTD, while nicotinic AChR activation plays a role in the late maintenance of CCh-LTD at CA2 synapses. Remarkably, we find that CCh priming lowers the threshold for the subsequent induction of persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission at EC-CA2 and the plasticity-resistant SC-CA2 pathways. The effects of such a cholinergic-dependent synaptic depression on subsequent LTP at EC-CA2 and SC-CA2 synapses have not been previously explored. Collectively, the results demonstrate that CA2 synaptic learning rules are regulated in a metaplastic manner, whereby modifications triggered by prior cholinergic stimulation can dictate the outcome of future plasticity events. Moreover, the reinforcement of LTP at EC inputs to CA2 following the priming stimulus coexists with concurrent sustained CCh-LTD at the SC-CA2 pathway and is dynamically scaled by modulation of SC-CA2 synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The release of the neuromodulator acetylcholine is critically involved in processes of hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Cholinergic afferents originating in the medial septum and diagonal bands of Broca terminating in the hippocampal area CA2 might play an important role in the modulation of area-specific synaptic plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that cholinergic receptor activation induces an LTD of synaptic transmission at entorhinal cortical- and Schaffer collateral-CA2 synapses. This cholinergic activation-mediated LTD displays a bidirectional metaplastic switch to LTP on a future timescale. This suggests that such bidirectional synaptic modifications triggered by the dynamic modulation of tonic cholinergic receptor activation may support the formation of CA2-dependent memories given the increased hippocampal cholinergic tone during active wakefulness observed in exploratory behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CNS Hypomyelination Disrupts Axonal Conduction and Behavior in Larval Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Myelination is essential for central nervous system (CNS) formation, health and function. As a model organism, larval zebrafish have been extensively employed to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of CNS myelination, because of their genetic tractability and suitability for non-invasive live cell imaging. However, it has not been assessed to what extent CNS myelination affects neural circuit function in zebrafish larvae, prohibiting the integration of molecular and cellular analyses of myelination with concomitant network maturation. To test whether larval zebrafish might serve as a suitable platform with which to study the effects of CNS myelination and its dysregulation on circuit function, we generated zebrafish myelin regulatory factor (<I>myrf</I>) mutants with CNS-specific hypomyelination and investigated how this affected their axonal conduction properties and behavior. We found that <I>myrf</I> mutant larvae exhibited increased latency to perform startle responses following defined acoustic stimuli. Furthermore, we found that hypomyelinated animals often selected an impaired response to acoustic stimuli, exhibiting a bias toward reorientation behavior instead of the stimulus-appropriate startle response. To begin to study how myelination affected the underlying circuitry, we established electrophysiological protocols to assess various conduction properties along single axons. We found that the hypomyelinated <I>myrf</I> mutants exhibited reduced action potential conduction velocity and an impaired ability to sustain high-frequency action potential firing. This study indicates that larval zebrafish can be used to bridge molecular and cellular investigation of CNS myelination with multiscale assessment of neural circuit function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelination of CNS axons is essential for their health and function, and it is now clear that myelination is a dynamic life-long process subject to modulation by neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear precisely how changes to myelination affects animal behavior and underlying action potential conduction along axons in intact neural circuits. In recent years, zebrafish have been employed to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of myelination, because of their relatively simple, optically transparent, experimentally tractable vertebrate nervous system. Here we find that changes to myelination alter the behavior of young zebrafish and action potential conduction along individual axons, providing a platform to integrate molecular, cellular, and circuit level analyses of myelination using this model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid and Bihemispheric Reorganization of Neuronal Activity in Premotor Cortex after Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain injuries cause hemodynamic changes in several distant, spared areas from the lesion. Our objective was to better understand the neuronal correlates of this reorganization in awake, behaving female monkeys. We used reversible inactivation techniques to "injure" the primary motor cortex, while continuously recording neuronal activity of the ventral premotor cortex in the two hemispheres, before and after the onset of behavioral impairments. Inactivation rapidly induced profound alterations of neuronal discharges that were heterogeneous within each and across the two hemispheres, occurred during movements of either the affected or nonaffected arm, and varied during different phases of grasping. Our results support that extensive, and much more complex than expected, neuronal reorganization takes place in spared areas of the bihemispheric cortical network involved in the control of hand movements. This broad pattern of reorganization offers potential targets that should be considered for the development of neuromodulation protocols applied early after brain injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that brain injuries cause changes in several distant, spared areas of the network, often in the premotor cortex. This reorganization is greater early after the injury and the magnitude of early changes correlates with impairments. However, studies to date have used noninvasive brain imaging approaches or have been conducted in sedated animals. Therefore, we do not know how brain injuries specifically affect the activity of neurons during the generation of movements. Our study clearly shows how a lesion rapidly impacts neurons in the premotor cortex of both hemispheres. A better understanding of these complex changes can help formulate hypotheses for the development of new treatments that specifically target neuronal reorganization induced by lesions in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Inputs in the Prelimbic Cortex Curb Fear after Extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>In contrast to easily formed fear memories, fear extinction requires prolonged training. The prelimbic cortex (PL), which integrates signals from brain structures involved in fear conditioning and extinction such as the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) and the basolateral amygdala (BL), is necessary for fear memory retrieval. Little is known, however, about how the vHIP and BL inputs to the PL regulate the display of fear after fear extinction. Using functional anatomy tracing in male rats, we found two distinct subpopulations of neurons in the PL activated by either the successful extinction or the relapse of fear. During the retrieval of fear extinction memory, the dominant input to active neurons in the PL was from the vHIP, whereas the retrieval of fear memory, regardless of the age of a memory and testing context, was associated with greater BL input. Optogenetic stimulation of the vHIP&ndash;PL pathway after one session of fear extinction increased conditioned fear, whereas stimulation of the vHIP inputs after several sessions of extinction decreased the conditioned fear response. This latter effect was, however, transient, as stimulation of this pathway 28 d after extinction increased conditioned fear response again. The results show that repeated fear extinction training gradually changes vHIP&ndash;PL connectivity, making fear suppression possible, whereas in the absence of fear suppression from the vHIP, signals from the BL can play a dominant role, resulting in high levels of fear.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Behavioral therapies of fear are based on extinction learning. As extinction memories fade over time, such therapies produce only a temporary suppression of fear, which constitutes a clinical and societal challenge. In our study, we provide a framework for understating the underlying mechanism by which extinction of fear memories fade by demonstrating the existence of two subpopulations of neurons in the prelimbic cortex associated with low and high levels of fear. Insufficient extinction and exposure to the context in which fear memory was formed promoted high fear neuronal activity in the prelimbic cortex, leading to fear retrieval. Extensive extinction training, on the other hand, boosted low fear neuronal activity and, as a result, extinction memory retrieval. This effect was, however, transient and disappeared with time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Studying Independent Kcna6 Knock-out Mice Reveals Toxicity of Exogenous LacZ to Central Nociceptor Terminals and Differential Effects of Kv1.6 on Acute and Neuropathic Pain Sensation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The potassium channel Kv1.6 has recently been implicated as a major modulatory channel subunit expressed in primary nociceptors. Furthermore, its expression at juxtaparanodes of myelinated primary afferents is induced following traumatic nerve injury as part of an endogenous mechanism to reduce hyperexcitability and pain-related hypersensitivity. In this study, we compared two mouse models of constitutive Kv1.6 knock-out (KO) achieved by different methods: traditional gene trap via homologous recombination and CRISPR-mediated excision. Both Kv1.6 KO mouse lines exhibited an unexpected reduction in sensitivity to noxious heat stimuli, to differing extents: the Kv1.6 mice produced via gene trap had a far more significant hyposensitivity. These mice (<I>Kcna6<sup>lacZ</sup></I>) expressed the bacterial reporter enzyme LacZ in place of Kv1.6 as a result of the gene trap mechanism, and we found that their central primary afferent presynaptic terminals developed a striking neurodegenerative phenotype involving accumulation of lipid species, development of "meganeurites," and impaired transmission to dorsal horn wide dynamic range neurons. The anatomic defects were absent in CRISPR-mediated Kv1.6 KO mice (<I>Kcna6</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) but were present in a third mouse model expressing exogenous LacZ in nociceptors under the control of a Nav1.8-promoted Cre recombinase. LacZ reporter enzymes are thus intrinsically neurotoxic to sensory neurons and may induce pathologic defects in transgenic mice, which has confounding implications for the interpretation of gene KOs using <I>lacZ</I>. Nonetheless, in <I>Kcna6</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice not affected by LacZ, we demonstrated a significant role for Kv1.6 regulating acute noxious thermal sensitivity, and both mechanical and thermal pain-related hypersensitivity after nerve injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In recent decades, the expansion of technologies to experimentally manipulate the rodent genome has contributed significantly to the field of neuroscience. While introduction of enzymatic or fluorescent reporter proteins to label neuronal populations is now commonplace, often potential toxicity effects are not fully considered. We show a role of Kv1.6 in acute and neuropathic pain states through analysis of two mouse models lacking Kv1.6 potassium channels: one with additional expression of LacZ and one without. We show that LacZ reporter enzymes induce unintended defects in sensory neurons, with an impact on behavioral data outcomes. To summarize we highlight the importance of Kv1.6 in recovery of normal sensory function following nerve injury, and careful interpretation of data from LacZ reporter models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Stable Population Code for Attention in Prefrontal Cortex Leads a Dynamic Attention Code in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Attention often requires maintaining a stable mental state over time while simultaneously improving perceptual sensitivity. These requirements place conflicting demands on neural populations, as sensitivity implies a robust response to perturbation by incoming stimuli, which is antithetical to stability. Functional specialization of cortical areas provides one potential mechanism to resolve this conflict. We reasoned that attention signals in executive control areas might be highly stable over time, reflecting maintenance of the cognitive state, thereby freeing up sensory areas to be more sensitive to sensory input (i.e., unstable), which would be reflected by more dynamic attention signals in those areas. To test these predictions, we simultaneously recorded neural populations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortical area V4 in rhesus macaque monkeys performing an endogenous spatial selective attention task. Using a decoding approach, we found that the neural code for attention states in PFC was substantially more stable over time compared with the attention code in V4 on a moment-by-moment basis, in line with our guiding thesis. Moreover, attention signals in PFC predicted the future attention state of V4 better than vice versa, consistent with a top-down role for PFC in attention. These results suggest a functional specialization of attention mechanisms across cortical areas with a division of labor. PFC signals the cognitive state and maintains this state stably over time, whereas V4 responds to sensory input in a manner dynamically modulated by that cognitive state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention requires maintaining a stable mental state while simultaneously improving perceptual sensitivity. We hypothesized that these two demands (stability and sensitivity) are distributed between prefrontal and visual cortical areas, respectively. Specifically, we predicted attention signals in visual cortex would be less stable than in prefrontal cortex, and furthermore prefrontal cortical signals would predict attention signals in visual cortex in line with the hypothesized role of prefrontal cortex in top-down executive control. Our results are consistent with suggestions deriving from previous work using separate recordings in the two brain areas in different animals performing different tasks and represent the first direct evidence in support of this hypothesis with simultaneous multiarea recordings within individual animals.</p>

                <p>Sex steroid hormones act on hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons to regulate reproductive neural circuits in the brain. Kisspeptin neurons start to express estrogen receptors <I>in utero</I>, suggesting steroid hormone action on these cells early during development. Whether neurosteroids are locally produced in the embryonic brain and impinge onto kisspeptin/reproductive neural circuitry is not known. To address this question, we analyzed aromatase expression, a key enzyme in estrogen synthesis, in male and female mouse embryos. We identified an aromatase neuronal network comprising ~6000 neurons in the hypothalamus and amygdala. By birth, this network has become sexually dimorphic in a cluster of aromatase neurons in the arcuate nucleus adjacent to kisspeptin neurons. We demonstrate that male arcuate aromatase neurons convert testosterone to estrogen to regulate kisspeptin neuron activity. We provide spatiotemporal information on aromatase neuronal network development and highlight a novel mechanism whereby aromatase neurons regulate the activity of distinct neuronal populations expressing estrogen receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sex steroid hormones, such as estradiol, are important regulators of neural circuits controlling reproductive physiology in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Memory Specific to Temporal Features of Sound Is Formed by Cue-Selective Enhancements in Temporal Coding Enabled by Inhibition of an Epigenetic Regulator</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent investigation of memory-related functions in the auditory system have capitalized on the use of memory-modulating molecules to probe the relationship between memory and substrates of memory in auditory system coding. For example, epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate gene expression necessary for memory consolidation, are powerful modulators of learning-induced neuroplasticity and long-term memory (LTM) formation. Inhibition of the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) promotes LTM, which is highly specific for spectral features of sound. The present work demonstrates for the first time that HDAC3 inhibition also enables memory for temporal features of sound. Adult male rats trained in an amplitude modulation (AM) rate discrimination task and treated with a selective inhibitor of HDAC3 formed memory that was highly specific to the AM rate paired with reward. Sound-specific memory revealed behaviorally was associated with a signal-specific enhancement in temporal coding in the auditory system; stronger phase locking that was specific to the rewarded AM rate was revealed in both the surface-recorded frequency following response and auditory cortical multiunit activity in rats treated with the HDAC3 inhibitor. Furthermore, HDAC3 inhibition increased trial-to-trial cortical response consistency (relative to naive and trained vehicle-treated rats), which generalized across different AM rates. Stronger signal-specific phase locking correlated with individual behavioral differences in memory specificity for the AM signal. These findings support that epigenetic mechanisms regulate activity-dependent processes that enhance discriminability of sensory cues encoded into LTM in both spectral and temporal domains, which may be important for remembering spectrotemporal features of sounds, for example, as in human voices and speech.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epigenetic mechanisms have recently been implicated in memory and information processing. Here, we use a pharmacological inhibitor of HDAC3 in a sensory model of learning to reveal the ability of HDAC3 to enable precise memory for amplitude-modulated sound cues. In so doing, we uncover neural substrates for memory's specificity for temporal sound cues. Memory specificity was supported by auditory cortical changes in temporal coding, including greater response consistency and stronger phase locking. HDAC3 appears to regulate effects across domains that determine specific cue saliency for behavior. Thus, epigenetic players may gate how sensory information is stored in long-term memory and can be leveraged to reveal the neural substrates of sensory details stored in memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multivariate Analysis of Electrophysiological Signals Reveals the Time Course of Precision Grasps Programs: Evidence for Nonhierarchical Evolution of Grasp Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current understanding of the neural processes underlying human grasping suggests that grasp computations involve gradients of higher to lower level representations and, relatedly, visual to motor processes. However, it is unclear whether these processes evolve in a strictly canonical manner from higher to intermediate and to lower levels given that this knowledge importantly relies on functional imaging, which lacks temporal resolution. To examine grasping in fine temporal detail here we used multivariate EEG analysis. We asked participants to grasp objects while controlling the time at which crucial elements of grasp programs were specified. We first specified the orientation with which participants should grasp objects, and only after a delay we instructed participants about which effector to use to grasp, either the right or the left hand. We also asked participants to grasp with both hands because bimanual and left-hand grasping share intermediate-level grasp representations. We observed that grasp programs evolved in a canonical manner from visual representations, which were independent of effectors to motor representations that distinguished between effectors. However, we found that intermediate representations of effectors that partially distinguished between effectors arose after representations that distinguished among all effector types. Our results show that grasp computations do not proceed in a strictly hierarchically canonical fashion, highlighting the importance of the fine temporal resolution of EEG for a comprehensive understanding of human grasp control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A long-standing assumption of the grasp computations is that grasp representations progress from higher to lower level control in a regular, or canonical, fashion. Here, we combined EEG and multivariate pattern analysis to characterize the temporal dynamics of grasp representations while participants viewed objects and were subsequently cued to execute an unimanual or bimanual grasp. Interrogation of the temporal dynamics revealed that lower level effector representations emerged before intermediate levels of grasp representations, thereby suggesting a partially noncanonical progression from higher to lower and then to intermediate level grasp control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Roles of Basolateral Amygdala Parvalbumin Neurons in Fear Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is obligatory for fear learning. This learning is linked to BLA excitatory projection neurons whose activity is regulated by complex networks of inhibitory interneurons, dominated by parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic neurons. The roles of these GABAergic interneurons in learning to fear and learning not to fear, activity profiles of these interneurons across the course of fear learning, and whether or how these change across the course of learning all remain poorly understood. Here, we used PV cell-type-specific recording and manipulation approaches in male transgenic PV-Cre rats during pavlovian fear conditioning to address these issues. We show that activity of BLA PV neurons during the moments of aversive reinforcement controls fear learning about aversive events, but activity during moments of nonreinforcement does not control fear extinction learning. Furthermore, we show expectation-modulation of BLA PV neurons during fear learning, with greater activity to an unexpected than expected aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). This expectation-modulation was specifically because of BLA PV neuron sensitivity to aversive prediction error. Finally, we show that BLA PV neuron function in fear learning is conserved across these variations in prediction error. We suggest that aversive prediction-error modulation of PV neurons could enable BLA fear-learning circuits to retain selectivity for specific sensory features of aversive USs despite variations in the strength of US inputs, thereby permitting the rapid updating of fear associations when these sensory features change.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The capacity to learn about sources of danger in the environment is essential for survival. This learning depends on complex microcircuitries of inhibitory interneurons in the basolateral amygdala. Here, we show that parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons in the rat basolateral amygdala are important for fear learning during moments of danger, but not for extinction learning during moments of safety, and that the activity of these neurons is modulated by expectation of danger. This may enable fear-learning circuits to retain selectivity for specific aversive events across variations in expectation, permitting the rapid updating of learning when aversive events change.</p>

                <p>Loss-of-function mutations in endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 6 (NHE6) cause the X-linked neurologic disorder Christianson syndrome. Patients exhibit symptoms associated with both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative abnormalities. While loss of NHE6 has been shown to overacidify the endosome lumen, and is associated with endolysosome neuropathology, NHE6-mediated mechanisms in endosome trafficking and lysosome function have been understudied. Here, we show that NHE6-null mouse neurons demonstrate worsening lysosome function with time in culture, likely as a result of defective endosome trafficking. NHE6-null neurons exhibit overall reduced lysosomal proteolysis despite overacidification of the endosome and lysosome lumen. Akin to Nhx1 mutants in <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>, we observe decreased endosome-lysosome fusion in NHE6-null neurons. Also, we find premature activation of pH-dependent cathepsin D (CatD) in endosomes. While active CatD is increased in endosomes, CatD activation and CatD protein levels are reduced in the lysosome. Protein levels of another mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR)-dependent enzyme, &beta;-N-acetylglucosaminidase, were also decreased in lysosomes of NHE6-null neurons. M6PRs accumulate in late endosomes, suggesting defective M6PR recycling and retromer function in NHE6-null neurons. Finally, coincident with decreased endosome-lysosome fusion, using total internal reflection fluorescence, we also find a prominent increase in fusion between endosomal multivesicular bodies and the plasma membrane, indicating enhanced exosome secretion from NHE6-null neurons. In summary, in addition to overacidification of endosomes and lysosomes, loss of NHE6 leads to defects in endosome maturation and trafficking, including enhanced exosome release, contributing to lysosome deficiency and potentially leading to neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss-of-function mutations in the endosomal Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 6 (NHE6) cause Christianson syndrome, an X-linked neurologic disorder. Loss of NHE6 has been shown to overacidify endosomes; however, endosome trafficking mechanisms have been understudied, and the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration are largely unknown. In NHE6-null mouse neurons <I>in vitro</I>, we find worsening lysosome function with days in culture. Notably, pH-dependent lysosome enzymes, such as cathepsin D, have reduced activity in lysosomes yet increased, precocious activity in endosomes in NHE6-null neurons. Further, endosomes show reduced fusion to lysosomes, and increased fusion to the plasma membrane with increased exosome release. This study identifies new mechanisms involving defective endosome maturation and trafficking that impair lysosome function in Christianson syndrome, likely contributing to neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatostatin-Positive Interneurons Contribute to Seizures in SCN8A Epileptic Encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy is a devastating epilepsy syndrome caused by mutant <I>SCN8A</I>, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6. To date, it is unclear if and how inhibitory interneurons, which express Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6, influence disease pathology. Using both sexes of a transgenic mouse model of <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy, we found that selective expression of the R1872W <I>SCN8A</I> mutation in somatostatin (SST) interneurons was sufficient to convey susceptibility to audiogenic seizures. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments revealed that SST interneurons from mutant mice were hyperexcitable but hypersensitive to action potential failure via depolarization block under normal and seizure-like conditions. Remarkably, GqDREADD-mediated activation of WT SST interneurons resulted in prolonged electrographic seizures and was accompanied by SST hyperexcitability and depolarization block. Aberrantly large persistent sodium currents, a hallmark of <I>SCN8A</I> mutations, were observed and were found to contribute directly to aberrant SST physiology in computational modeling and pharmacological experiments. These novel findings demonstrate a critical and previously unidentified contribution of SST interneurons to seizure generation not only in <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy, but epilepsy in general.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy is a devastating neurological disorder that results from <I>de novo</I> mutations in the sodium channel isoform Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.6. Inhibitory neurons express Na<SUB>V</SUB>1.6, yet their contribution to seizure generation in <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy has not been determined. We show that mice expressing a human-derived <I>SCN8A</I> variant (R1872W) selectively in somatostatin (SST) interneurons have audiogenic seizures. Physiological recordings from SST interneurons show that <I>SCN8A</I> mutations lead to an elevated persistent sodium current which drives initial hyperexcitability, followed by premature action potential failure because of depolarization block. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of WT SST interneurons leads to audiogenic seizure activity. These findings provide new insight into the importance of SST inhibitory interneurons in seizure initiation, not only in <I>SCN8A</I> epileptic encephalopathy, but for epilepsy broadly.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Composition within and between Languages in the Bilingual Mind: MEG Evidence from Korean/English Bilinguals</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability of the human brain to build complex expressions from simpler parts is fascinating, but the ability of the bilingual brain to do so is perhaps even more remarkable. When highly proficient bilinguals converse, they can fluidly switch from one language to another even inside sentences. Thus, they build expressions using words from more than one language. How are bilinguals able to compose words across different languages in real time? While robust evidence has implicated the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) for the composition of words within one language, we do not know how the LATL, or other regions implicated for composition, operates when the language switches. We also do not know whether prefrontal regions associated with language control are recruited for language switching during composition. We addressed these questions with magnetoencephalography measurements in bilinguals who are fluent in two typologically distant languages, English and Korean. We observed early composition effects in the LATL at ~200 ms that were unaffected by either language or orthography switching, which was also varied (Hangul vs Roman alphabet). Thus, the combinatory mechanism at 200 ms housed in the anterior temporal cortex appears blind to the language in which its input concepts are expressed. However, in later time windows, language and orthography switching interacted both in regions implicated for composition [LATL, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG)] as well as in regions associated with language control (ACC, LIFG). This establishes a starting point for understanding how bilingual brains code switch: words are initially combined without consideration of which language they come from, but language switching affects later processing.</p>

                E. coli strains 4s, F5 and F17, whose O antigens are structurally characterized and shown to effectively shield the cell surface from bacteriophage attack, were used as the hosts to isolate novel RB49-like bacteriophages. Three  novel phage isolates were obtained, and their genomes were sequenced and annotated. Despite high overall identity levels of these genomic sequences, the variants of large distal tail fiber subunit, orthologous to the bacteriophage T2 long tail receptor recognition protein gp38, were unique for each phage, suggesting their role in host range determination. The annotated genomes are available via NCBI Genbank, acc. numbers MZ504876-MZ504878.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Asymptomatic COVID-19 patient with a subtle hypercoagulable state and fluctuating D-dimer level [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: COVID-19 can infect an asymptomatic person silently without any overt symptoms despite diffuse blood clots throughout the body. Clot formation is induced by COVID-19 associated coagulopathy that can cause a high mortality rate. D-dimer, a fairly decisive marker for the coagulopathy event, is physiologically a marker of the fibrinolysis process. The increase of D-dimers in COVID-19 cases must be followed up because it relates to the initiation of a cytokine storm. Case presentation: We report an asymptomatic patient with sudden D-dimer elevation who received anticoagulant therapy. After three days of heparin administration, D-dimer results became normal and anticoagulant therapy was stopped. However, on the 12th day, the D-dimer level rebounded back and was followed by an increase of hs-C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, although SARS-CoV-2 PCR result became negative. A hyperglycaemic reaction and a sudden increase of HbA1C was observed in the patient. After three weeks D-dimer had returned to normal levels, and so did the other markers. The patient recovered fully and still no symptoms were obvious. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients without symptoms may be at risk of an asymptomatic coagulopathy process. The decreasing level of D-dimer erroneously cannot ensure that the coagulopathy process stops.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Leveraging biochemical reactions to unravel functional impacts of cancer somatic variants affecting protein interaction interfaces [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Considering protein mutations in their biological context is essential for understanding their functional impact, interpretation of high-dimensional datasets and development of effective targeted therapies in personalized medicine. Methods: We combined the curated knowledge of biochemical reactions from Reactome with the analysis of interaction-mediating 3D interfaces from Mechismo. In addition, we provided a software tool for users to explore and browse the analysis results in a multi-scale perspective starting from pathways and reactions to protein-protein interactions and protein 3D structures. Results: We analyzed somatic mutations from TCGA, revealing several significantly impacted reactions and pathways in specific cancer types. We found examples of genes not yet listed as oncodrivers, whose rare mutations were predicted to affect cancer processes similarly to known oncodrivers. Some identified processes lack any known oncodrivers, which suggests potentially new cancer-related processes (e.g. complement cascade reactions). Furthermore, we found that mutations perturbing certain processes are significantly associated with distinct phenotypes (i.e. survival time) in specific cancer types (e.g. PIK3CA centered pathways in LGG and UCEC cancer types), suggesting the translational potential of our approach for patient stratification. Our analysis also uncovered several druggable processes (e.g. GPCR signalling pathways) containing enriched reactions, providing support for new off-label therapeutic options. Conclusions: In summary, we have established a multi-scale approach to study genetic variants based on protein-protein interaction 3D structures. Our approach is different from previously published studies in its focus on biochemical reactions and can be applied to other data types (e.g. post-translational modifications) collected for many types of disease.

                Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) recurrency rate is still high despite patients receiving complete treatment. The response to treatment may vary depending on the type of histopathology and Epstein-Barr virus, however the mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies have found that there is a relationship between response to treatment and the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). CD44+ cancer stem cells may cause cancer cells to be resistant to treatment. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aims to determine the correlation between CD44 + cancer stem cell expression and the histopathological types of NPC. Method: Samples were obtained from NPC biopsies of type I, II, III patients (based on WHO histopathology criteria), who had not received prior treatment. CD44+ expression was examined using immunohistochemistry methods by staining CD44+ monoclonal antibodies. The degree of CD44+ cell membrane expression was based on the immunoreactive score scale or the Remmele index scale. Results: Most histopathological types were WHO type III (21 patients, 50%), followed by type II (18 patients, 42.86%), and type I (3 patients, 7.14%). CD44 + expression on type I showed one patient had moderate positive and two patients had a high-positive expression. In type II, 10 were moderate positive and eight were high-positive. In type III, one patient was low-positive, 11 were moderate positive and nine patients were high-positive. Statistical analysis showed that the CD44+ expression difference between the three histopathology types were not statistically significant. Conclusion: There were no correlations between CD44 + expression and histopathological type of NPC.

     alt="Basal forebrain magnocellular cholinergic systems are damaged in mice following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia"/>
<p>Mouse cholinergic systems: Poor executive function and decreases in memory and learning are seen after neonatal HIE. We examined the cholinergic systems to determine if there is pathology there that could contribute to these functional outcomes. In contrast to normal, after neonatal HI on P10, loss of permanent attrition of ChAT neurons in the MSN, nbM, and striatum is found. ChAT+ neurons are crenated with shorter dystrophic dendrites. Increased and larger lysosomes are also present in the nbM. Within the injured ipsilateral cortex, AChE activity is abnormally increased. We hypothesize that permanent injury to the cholinergic systems after neonatal HI is responsible for these poor neurologic outcomes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes lifelong neurologic disability. Despite the use of therapeutic hypothermia, memory deficits and executive functions remain severely affected. Cholinergic neurotransmission from the basal forebrain to neocortex and hippocampus is central to higher cortical functions. We examined the basal forebrain by light microscopy and reported loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT)+ neurons, at postnatal day (P) 40, in the ipsilateral medial septal nucleus (MSN) after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in mice. There was no loss of ChAT+ neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and striatum. Ipsilateral striatal and nbM ChAT+ neurons were abnormal with altered immunoreactivity for ChAT, shrunken and crenated somas, and dysmorphic appearing dendrites. Using confocal images with 3D reconstruction, nbM ChAT+ dendrites in HI mice were shorter than sham (<i>p</i> = .0001). Loss of ChAT+ neurons in the MSN directly correlated with loss of ipsilateral hippocampal area. In the nbM and striatum, percentage of abnormal ChAT+ neurons correlated with loss of ipsilateral cerebral cortical and striatal area, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increased in adjacent ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the increase was linearly related to loss of cortical and hippocampal area. Numbers and size of cathepsin D+ lysosomes increased in large neurons in the ipsilateral nbM. After neonatal HI, abnormalities were found throughout the major cholinergic systems in relationship to amount of forebrain area loss. There was also an upregulation of cathepsin D+ particles within the nbM. Cholinergic neuropathology may underlie the permanent dysfunction in learning, memory, and executive function after neonatal brain injury.</p>

                A substantial amount of data about the COVID-19 pandemic is generated every day. Yet, data streaming, while considerably visualized, is not accompanied with modelling techniques to provide real-time insights. This study introduces a unified platform, COVIDSpread, which integrates visualization capabilities with advanced statistical methods for predicting the virus spread in the short run, using real-time data. The platform uses time series models to capture any possible non-linearity in the data. COVIDSpread enables lay users, and experts, to examine the data and develop several customized models with different restrictions such as models developed for a specific time window of the data.

<p>We examined sites of isotocin (IT) action throughout an evolutionarily conserved vocal motor network that is shared by nearly all vocal vertebrates. Using the highly vocal plainfin midshipman (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>) fish, we find that IT receptor (R) mRNA and IT-like fibers are widespread throughout the vocal motor network. Next, using a neural activity marker, we show that ITR dense nuclei within forebrain and midbrain nodes are differentially activated during vocal courtship. Midshipman photo credit: Margaret Marchaterre

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptides, including oxytocin-like peptides, are a conserved group of hormones that regulate a wide range of social behaviors, including vocal communication. In the current study, we evaluate whether putative brain sites for the actions of isotocin (IT), the oxytocin (OT) homolog of teleost fishes are associated with vocal courtship and circuitry in the plainfin midshipman fish (<i>Porichthys notatus</i>). During the breeding season, nesting males produce advertisement calls known as “hums” to acoustically court females at night and attract them to nests. We first identify IT receptor (ITR) mRNA in evolutionarily conserved regions of the forebrain preoptic area (POA), anterior hypothalamus (AH), and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and in two topographically separate populations within the hindbrain vocal pattern generator– duration-coding vocal prepacemaker (VPP) and amplitude-coding vocal motor nuclei (VMN) that also innervate vocal muscles. We also verify that ITR expression overlaps known distribution sites of OT-like immunoreactive fibers. Next, using phosphorylated ribosomal subunit 6 (pS6) as a marker for activated neurons, we demonstrate that ITR-containing neurons in the anterior parvocellular POA, AH, PAG, VPP, and VMN are activated in humming males. Posterior parvocellular and magno/gigantocellular divisions of the POA remain constitutively active in nonhumming males that are also in a reproductive state. Together with prior studies of midshipman fish and other vertebrates, our findings suggest that IT-signaling influences male courtship behavior, in part, by acting on brain regions that broadly influence behavioral state (POA) as well as the initiation (POA and PAG) and temporal structure (VPP and VMN) of advertisement hums.</p>

                Background COVID-19 has drastically dampened human activities since early 2020. Studies have shown that this has resulted in changes in air temperature and humidity. Since lightning activities are dependent on air temperature and humidity, this study is conducted to evaluate the correlation between the intensity of lightning activities with the atmospheric changes, and investigates the changes, in lightning activities due to atmospheric changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The hypothesis was tested through a t-test and Pearson’s correlation study. The variation trend of lightning strikes count (LSC) in Europe and Oceania during the five months COVID-19 lockdown period (March – July) compared to the same period in the previous five years from 2015 to 2019 is investigated. Results Statistical analysis shows the LSC in Europe and Oceania during the lockdown period dropped significantly by more than 50% and 44% respectively compared to the same period in previous five years. Furthermore, LSC was found to be positively correlated with air temperature and relative humidity in Europe. However, in Oceania, LSC seems to be only positively correlated with air temperature but negatively correlated with relative humidity. Conclusions This study seems to suggest that lightning activities have significantly changed during this pandemic due to reduction in human activities.

                Background: Given the persistent challenges to the higher education business model, private higher education institutions (PHEIs) are exploring myriad ways to increase enrolment and income, while aggressively managing spending. Many PHEIs are facing financial distress and struggling because of decreasing budgets and declining revenue. Thus, carving unique strategies that direct the institution to focus on its core competencies, making additional budget cuts without compromising quality, developing new revenue streams, embracing new technology, and offering affordable programs, will ultimately lead to financial success. Frugal innovation (FI) can shed light on these challenges. Methods: This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate and analyse prior research that focused on FI within the sphere of intellectual capital (IC) and information technology capabilities (ITC) research, and their relationships in PHEIs. Transfield’s five phases were employed to extract journal articles published over a thirty-year period (1990 to 2020) from major online databases using keyword searches. Although an initial search generated 76,025 papers, the search for IC and FI yielded 41 papers, and finally only two papers were selected as they clearly related IC with FI. Results: There was a research gap in the literature published from 1990 to 2020 regarding IC applications to achieve FI. This work revealed that IC and ITC research for FI in PHEI remain insufficiently explored.   Conclusions: Further research is required on the evaluation model of IC, ITC and FI, methodologies, empirical analysis, and the development of measurement metrics. A limitation to this study is the number of keywords selected.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Morphological analysis of the cerebellum and its efferent system in a basal actinopterygian fish, Polypterus senegalus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although all vertebrate cerebella contain granule cells, Purkinje cells, and efferent neurons, the cellular arrangement and neural circuitry are highly diverse. In amniotes, cerebellar efferent neurons form clusters, deep cerebellar nuclei, lie deep in the cerebellum, and receive synaptic inputs from Purkinje cells but not granule cells. However, in the cerebellum of teleosts, the efferent neurons, called eurydendroid cells, lie near the cell bodies of Purkinje cells, and receive inputs both from axons of Purkinje cells and granule cell parallel fibers. It is largely unknown how the cerebellar structure evolved in ray-finned fish (actinopterygians). To address this issue, we analyzed the cerebellum of a bichir <i>Polypterus senegalus</i>, one of the most basal actinopterygians. We found that the cell bodies of Purkinje cells are not aligned in a layer; incoming climbing fibers terminate mainly on the basal portion of Purkinje cells, revealing that the <i>Polypterus</i> cerebellum has unique features among vertebrate cerebella. Retrograde labeling and marker analyses of the efferent neurons revealed that their cell bodies lie in restricted granular areas but not as deep cerebellar nuclei in the cerebellar white matter. The efferent neurons have long dendrites like eurydendroid cells, although they do not reach the molecular layer. Our findings suggest that the efferent system of the bichir cerebellum has intermediate features between teleosts and amniote vertebrates, and provides a model to understand the basis generating diversity in actinopterygian cerebella.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Nuclear Factor I in neurons, glia and during the formation of Müller glia‐derived progenitor cells in avian, porcine and primate retinas</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The regenerative potential of Müller glia (MG) is extraordinary in fish, poor in chick and terrible in mammals. In the chick model, MG readily reprogram into proliferating Müller glia-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), but neuronal differentiation is very limited. The factors that suppress the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick are slowly being revealed. Isoforms of Nuclear Factor I (NFI) are cell-intrinsic factors that limit neurogenic potential; these factors are required for the formation of MG in the developing mouse retina (Clark et al., 2019) and deletion of these factors reprograms MG into neuron-like cells in mature mouse retina (Hoang et al., 2020). Accordingly, we sought to characterize the patterns of expression NFIs in the developing, mature and damaged chick retina. In addition, we characterized patterns of expression of NFIs in the retinas of large mammals, pigs and monkeys. Using a combination of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunolabeling we probed for patterns of expression. In embryonic chick, levels of NFIs are very low in early E5 (embryonic day 5) retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), up-regulated in E8 RPCs, further up-regulated in differentiating MG at E12 and E15. NFIs are maintained in mature resting MG, microglia and neurons. Levels of NFIs are reduced in activated MG in retinas treated with NMDA and/or insulin+FGF2, and further down-regulated in proliferating MGPCs. However, levels of NFIs in MGPCs were significantly higher than those seen in RPCs. Immunolabeling for NFIA and NFIB closely matched patterns of expression revealed in different types of retinal neurons and glia, consistent with findings from scRNA-seq. In addition, we find expression of NFIA and NFIB through progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone at the far periphery of the retina. We find similar patterns of expression for NFIs in scRNA-seq databases for pig and monkey retinas. Patterns of expression of NFIA and NFIB were validated with immunofluorescence in pig and monkey retinas wherein these factors were predominantly detected in MG and a few types of inner retinal neurons. In summary, NFIA and NFIB are prominently expressed in developing chick retina and by mature neurons and glia in the retinas of chicks, pigs and monkeys. Although levels of NFIs are decreased in chick, in MGPCs these levels remain higher than those seen in neurogenic RPCs. We propose that the neurogenic potential of MGPCs in the chick retina is suppressed by NFIs.</p>

                Mort Mishkin’s career started in Donald Hebb’s office in 1947. Hebb was a newly appointed assistant professor at McGill University, having just arrived from the Yerkes primate research institute in Orange Park, Florida, where he had worked with Karl Lashley. Mort, along with another graduate student, Brenda Milner, attended Hebb’s lectures. In Hebb’s class, they studied his book, The Organization of Behavior, chapter by chapter. At that time, there was only a single tattered manuscript copy of the book that was passed around the class.

                In this issue of Neuron, Stern et al. (2021) demonstrate that cell-type-specific ablation of RhoA differentially affects axon regeneration outcomes in spinal cord injury models. Their findings highlight the importance of considering cell-type-specific strategies to promote axon regeneration.

                Axon integrity depends on support by glia facilitating axonal maintenance and energy homeostasis, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this issue of Neuron, Chamberlain et al. (2021) provide evidence that oligodendrocyte-to-axon transfer of SIRT2 via extracellular vesicles (exosomes) enables deacetylation of mitochondrial proteins, enhancing axonal energy production.

                Cross-orientation interactions result in diverse effects in mouse V1. Barbera et al. use a combination of calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and modeling to reveal that this heterogeneity can be explained by a single feedforward mechanism: plaids can drive facilitation or suppression depending on alignment with the neurons’ receptive fields.

                <p>Nature, Published online: 03 November 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04050-9">doi:10.1038/s41586-021-04050-9</a></p>Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) has provided significant understanding of time-resolved processes of various systems in biology, for example, rhodopsin, which underlies our vision. The approach involves femtosecond-length X-ray pulses directed at protein crystals and has been used to study various photoactive proteins. However, the function of proteins such as rhodopsin requires trans–cis isomerization of a chromophore, which involves crossing of a conical intersection—a funnel separating potential energy surfaces—at timescales faster than what can be achieved experimentally. Here, Ourmazd and colleagues report a machine learning analysis of SFX data of photoactive yellow protein, which resolves the protein passing through a conical intersection, providing information about the potential energy surfaces involved and achieving time resolution of less than 10 fs. This approach offers an opportunity to understand some of the fastest processes in biology by extracting even more information from SFX datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rotational dynamics in motor cortex are consistent with a feedback controller</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have identified rotational dynamics in motor cortex (MC) which many assume arise from intrinsic connections in MC. However, behavioural and neurophysiological studies suggest that MC behaves like a feedback controller where continuous sensory feedback and interactions with other brain areas contribute substantially to MC processing. We investigated these apparently conflicting theories by building recurrent neural networks that controlled a model arm and received sensory feedback from the limb. Networks were trained to counteract perturbations to the limb and to reach towards spatial targets. Network activities and sensory feedback signals to the network exhibited rotational structure even when the recurrent connections were removed. Furthermore, neural recordings in monkeys performing similar tasks also exhibited rotational structure not only in MC but also in somatosensory cortex. Our results argue that rotational structure may also reflect dynamics throughout the voluntary motor system involved in online control of motor actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Population receptive fields in non-human primates from whole-brain fMRI and large-scale neurophysiology in visual cortex in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Population receptive field (pRF) modeling is a popular fMRI method to map the retinotopic organization of the human brain. While fMRI-based pRF-maps are qualitatively similar to invasively recorded single-cell receptive fields in animals, it remains unclear what neuronal signal they represent. We addressed this question in awake non-human primates comparing whole-brain fMRI and large-scale neurophysiological recordings in areas V1 and V4 of the visual cortex. We examined the fits of several pRF-models based on the fMRI BOLD-signal, multi-unit spiking activity (MUA) and local field potential (LFP) power in different frequency bands. We found that pRFs derived from BOLD-fMRI were most similar to MUA-pRFs in V1 and V4, while pRFs based on LFP gamma power also gave a good approximation. FMRI-based pRFs thus reliably reflect neuronal receptive field properties in the primate brain. In addition to our results in V1 and V4, the whole-brain fMRI measurements revealed retinotopic tuning in many other cortical and subcortical areas with a consistent increase in pRF-size with increasing eccentricity, as well as a retinotopically specific deactivation of default-mode network nodes similar to previous observations in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proximity labeling identifies LOTUS domain proteins that promote the formation of perinuclear germ granules in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                The germ line produces gametes that transmit genetic and epigenetic information to the next generation. Maintenance of germ cells and development of gametes require germ granules-well-conserved membraneless and RNA-rich organelles. The composition of germ granules is elusive owing to their dynamic nature and their exclusive expression in the germ line. Using <i>C. elegans</i> germ granule, called P granule, as a model system, we employed a proximity-based labeling method in combination with mass spectrometry to comprehensively define its protein components. This set of experiments identified over 200 proteins, many of which contain intrinsically disordered regions. An RNAi-based screen identified factors that are essential for P granule assembly, notably EGGD-1 and EGGD-2, two putative LOTUS-domain proteins. Loss of <i>eggd-1</i> and <i>eggd-2</i> results in separation of P granules from the nuclear envelope, germline atrophy and reduced fertility. We show that intrinsically disordered regions of EGGD-1 are required to anchor EGGD-1 to the nuclear periphery while its LOTUS domains are required to promote perinuclear localization of P granules. Together, our work expands the repertoire of P granule constituents and provides new insights into the role of LOTUS-domain proteins in germ granule organization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Extreme suction attachment performance from specialised insects living in mountain streams (Diptera: Blephariceridae)</a></h4>

              
                Suction is widely used by animals for strong controllable underwater adhesion but is less well understood than adhesion of terrestrial climbing animals. Here we investigate the attachment of aquatic insect larvae (Blephariceridae), which cling to rocks in torrential streams using the only known muscle-actuated suction organs in insects. We measured their attachment forces on well-defined rough substrates and found that their adhesion was less reduced by micro-roughness than that of terrestrial climbing insects. In vivo visualisation of the suction organs in contact with microstructured substrates revealed that they can mould around large asperities to form a seal. We have shown that the ventral surface of the suction disc is covered by dense arrays of microtrichia, which are stiff spine-like cuticular structures that only make tip contact. Our results demonstrate the impressive performance and versatility of blepharicerid suction organs and highlight their potential as a study system to explore biological suction mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformational dynamics of auto-inhibition in the ER calcium sensor STIM1</a></h4>

              
                The dimeric ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM1 controls store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) through the regulated binding of its CRAC activation domain (CAD) to Orai channels in the plasma membrane. In resting cells, the STIM1 CC1 domain interacts with CAD to suppress SOCE, but the structural basis of this interaction is unclear. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and protein crosslinking approaches, we show that CC1 interacts dynamically with CAD in a domain-swapped configuration with an orientation predicted to sequester its Orai-binding region adjacent to the ER membrane. Following ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and release from CAD, cysteine crosslinking indicates that the two CC1 domains become closely paired along their entire length in the active Orai-bound state. These findings provide a structural basis for the dual roles of CC1: sequestering CAD to suppress SOCE in resting cells and propelling it towards the plasma membrane to activate Orai and SOCE after store depletion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Developmental emergence of two-stage nonlinear synaptic integration in cerebellar interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic transmission, connectivity, and dendritic morphology mature in parallel during brain development and are often disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet how these changes influence the neuronal computations necessary for normal brain function are not well understood. To identify cellular mechanisms underlying the maturation of synaptic integration in interneurons, we combined patch-clamp recordings of excitatory inputs in mouse cerebellar stellate cells (SCs), three-dimensional reconstruction of SC morphology with excitatory synapse location, and biophysical modeling. We found that postnatal maturation of postsynaptic strength was homogeneously reduced along the somatodendritic axis, but dendritic integration was always sublinear. However, dendritic branching increased without changes in synapse density, leading to a substantial gain in distal inputs. Thus, changes in synapse distribution, rather than dendrite cable properties, are the dominant mechanism underlying the maturation of neuronal computation. These mechanisms favor the emergence of a spatially compartmentalized two-stage integration model promoting location-dependent integration within dendritic subunits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling hepatitis C virus kinetics during liver transplantation reveals the role of the liver in virus clearance</a></h4>

              
                While the liver, specifically hepatocytes, are widely accepted as the main source of hepatitis C virus (HCV) production, the role of the liver/hepatocytes in clearance of circulating HCV remains unknown. Frequent HCV kinetic data were recorded and mathematically modeled from 5 liver-transplant patients throughout the anhepatic (absence of liver) phase and for 4 hours post-reperfusion. During the anhepatic phase, HCV remained at pre-anhepatic levels (n=3) or declined (n=2) with t<sub>1/2</sub>~1h. Immediately post-reperfusion, virus declined in a biphasic manner in 4 patients consisting of a rapid decline (t<sub>1/2</sub>=5min) followed by a slower decline (t<sub>1/2</sub>=67min). Consistent with the majority of patients in the anhepatic phase, when we monitored HCV clearance at 37°C from culture medium in the absence/presence of chronically infected hepatoma cells that were inhibited from secreting HCV, the HCV t<sub>1/2</sub> in cell culture was longer in the absence of chronically HCV-infected cells. The results suggest that the liver plays a major role in the clearance of circulating HCV and that hepatocytes may be involved.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">STING mediates immune responses in the closest living relatives of animals</a></h4>

              
                Animals have evolved unique repertoires of innate immune genes and pathways that provide their first line of defense against pathogens. To reconstruct the ancestry of animal innate immunity, we have developed the choanoflagellate <i>Monosiga brevicollis</i>, one of the closest living relatives of animals, as a model for studying mechanisms underlying pathogen recognition and immune response. We found that <i>M. brevicollis</i> is killed by exposure to <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> bacteria. Moreover, <i>M. brevicollis </i>expresses STING, which, in animals, activates innate immune pathways in response to cyclic dinucleotides during pathogen sensing. <i>M. brevicollis </i>STING increases the susceptibility of <i>M. brevicollis </i>to <i>P. aeruginosa</i>-induced cell death and is required for responding to the cyclic dinucleotide 2'3' cGAMP. Furthermore, similar to animals, autophagic signaling in <i>M. brevicollis</i> is induced by 2'3' cGAMP in a STING-dependent manner. This study provides evidence for a pre-animal role for STING in antibacterial immunity and establishes <i>M. brevicollis </i>as a model system for the study of immune responses.

                The medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala are involved in the regulation of social behavior and associated with psychiatric diseases but their detailed neurophysiological mechanisms at a network level remain unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the dorsal medial PFC (dmPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) while mice engaged on social behavior. We found that in wild-type mice, both the dmPFC and BLA increased 4-7 Hz oscillation power and decreased 30-60 Hz power when they needed to attend to another target mouse. In mouse models with reduced social interactions, dmPFC 4-7 Hz power further increased especially when they exhibited social avoidance behavior. In contrast, dmPFC and BLA decreased 4-7 Hz power when wild-type mice socially approached a target mouse. Frequency-specific optogenetic manipulations of replicating social approach-related LFP patterns restored social interaction behavior in socially deficient mice. These results demonstrate a neurophysiological substrate of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala related to social behavior and provide a unified pathophysiological understanding of neuronal population dynamics underlying social behavioral deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diversified expression of gamma-protocadherins regulates synaptic specificity in the mouse neocortex</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic specificity is the basis of forming neural microcircuits. However, how a neuron chooses which neurons out of many potentials to form synapses remains largely unknown. Here we identified that the diversified expression of clustered protocadherin {gamma}s (cPCDH{gamma}s) plays an essential role in regulating such specificity. Our 5-prime end single-cell sequencing data revealed the diversified expression pattern of cPCDH{gamma}s in neocortical neurons. Whole-cell recording of neuron pairs in developing mouse brain slices showed that knocking out PCDH{gamma}s significantly increased the local connection rate of nearby pyramidal neurons. By contrast, neurons overexpressing the same group of clustered PCDH{gamma} isoforms through in utero electroporation dramatically decreased their synaptic connectivity. Finally and more importantly, decreasing the similarity level of PCDH{gamma} isoforms over-expressed in neuron pairs through sequential in utero electroporation led to a progressive elevation of synaptic connectivity. Our observations provide strong evidence to support that the existence of diversely expressed cPCDH{gamma}s allows a neuron to choose which neurons not to form a synapse, rather than choosing which neurons to make synapses.

                Despite well-documented maladaptive neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the principal signal that drives memory and cognitive impairment remains elusive. Here, we reveal robust, age-dependent cellular reactions to type I interferon (IFN), an innate immune cytokine aberrantly elicited by beta-amyloid plaques, and examine their role in cognition and neuropathology relevant to AD in a murine amyloidosis model. Long-term blockade of IFN receptor rescued both memory and synaptic deficits and resulted in reduced microgliosis, inflammation, and neuritic pathology. Interestingly, microglia-specific IFN receptor ablation attenuated the loss of post-synaptic terminals, whereas IFN signaling in neural cells contributed to pre-synaptic alteration and plaque accumulation. Intriguingly, IFN pathway activation displayed a strong inverse correlation with cognitive performance, promoting selective synapse engulfment by microglia rather than amyloid plaques. Overall, IFN signaling represents a critical module within the neuroinflammatory network of AD and prompts a concerted cellular state that is detrimental to memory and cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SorCS2 dynamically interacts with TrkB and GluN2B to control neurotransmission and Huntington's disease progression</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor dysfunction and loss of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in dorsal striatum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) sustains functionality and integrity of MSNs, and thus reduced BDNF signaling is integral to the disease. Here we show that SorCS2 is expressed in MSNs with reduced expression in R6/1 HD model, and that SorCS2 deficiency exacerbates the disease progression in R6/1 mice. Furthermore, we find that SorCS2 binds TrkB and the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B, which is required to control neurotransmission in corticostriatal synapses. While BDNF stimulates SorCS2-TrkB complex formation to enable TrkB signaling, it disengages SorCS2 from GluN2B, leading to enrichment of the subunit at postsynaptic densities. Consequently, long-term potentiation (LTP) is abolished in SorCS2 deficient mice, despite increased striatal TrkB and unaltered BDNF expression. In contrast, the addition of exogenous BDNF rescues the phenotype. Finally, GluN2B, but not GluN2A, currents are also severely impaired in the SorCS2 KO mice. To conclude, we uncovered that SorCS2 dynamically targets TrkB and GluN2B to orchestrate BDNF-dependent plasticity in MSNs of dorsal striatum. We propose that SorCS2 deficiency impairs MSN function thereby increasing neuronal vulnerability and accelerating the motor deficits in Huntington's disease.

                The magnitude of repetition suppression (RS), measured by fMRI, is modulated by the probability of repetitions (P(rep)) for various sensory stimulus categories. It has been suggested that for visually presented simple letters this P(rep) effect depends on the prior practices of the participants with the stimuli. Here we tested further if previous experiences affect the neural mechanisms of RS, leading to the modulatory effects of stimulus P(rep), for more complex lexical stimuli as well. We measured the BOLD signal in the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) of native Chinese and German participants and estimated the P(rep) effects for Chinese characters and German words. The results showed a significant P(rep) effect for stimuli of the mother tongue in both participant groups. Interestingly, Chinese participants, learning German as a second language, also showed a significant P(rep) modulation of RS for German words while the German participants who had no prior experiences with the Chinese characters showed no such effects. Our findings suggest that P(rep) effects on RS are manifest for visual word processing as well, but only for words of a language with which the participants have prior experiences. These results support further the idea that predictive processes, estimated by P(rep) modulations of RS, require prior experiences.

                Kv3 potassium currents mediate rapid repolarization of action potentials (AP), supporting fast spikes and high repetition rates. Of the four Kv3 gene family members, Kv3.1 and Kv3.3 are highly expressed in the auditory brainstem and we exploited this to test for subunit-specific roles at the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal. Deletion of Kv3.3 (but not Kv3.1) increased presynaptic AP duration and facilitated transmitter release, which in turn enhanced short-term depression during high frequency transmission. The response to sound was delayed in the Kv3.3KO, with higher spontaneous and lower evoked firing, thereby reducing signal-to-noise ratio. Computational modelling showed that the enhanced EPSC and short-term depression in the Kv3.3KO reflected increased vesicle release probability and accelerated activity-dependent vesicle replenishment. We conclude that Kv3.3 is the presynaptic delayed rectifier, enabling short duration, precisely timed APs to maintain transmission at high frequencies and during sustained synaptic activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dysconnectivity between auditory-cognitive network associated with auditory GABA and glutamate levels in presbycusis patients</a></h4>

              
                Accumulating studies suggest an interaction between presbycusis (PC) and cognitive impairment, which may be explained by the cognitive-ear link to a large extent. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this link are largely unknown. Here, 51 PC patients and 51 well-matched healthy controls were recruited. We combined resting-state functional MRI and edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate changes of intra- and inter-network functional connectivity and their relationships with auditory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) levels and cognitive impairment in PC. Our study confirmed the plastic model of cognitive-ear link at the level of the large-scale brain network, including the dysconnectivity within high-order cognitive networks and between the auditory-cognitive network and overactivation between cognitive networks dependent on hearing loss, which was closely related to the cognitive impairment of PC patients. Moreover, GABA and Glu levels in the central auditory processing were abnormal in patients with PC. Importantly, reduction of GABA-mediated inhibition plays a crucial role in a dysconnectivity between the auditory-cognitive network, which may be neurochemical underpinnings of functional remodeling of cognitive-ear link in PC. Modulation of GABA neurotransmission may enable the development of new therapeutic strategies for the cognitive impairment of PC patients. Keywords: presbycusis, cognitive impairment, cognitive-ear link, GABA, resting-state networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Manipulating neural dynamics to tune motion detection</a></h4>

              
                Neurons integrate excitatory and inhibitory signals to produce their outputs, but the role of input timing in this integration remains poorly understood. Motion detection is a paradigmatic example of this integration, since theories of motion detection rely on different delays in visual signals. These delays allow circuits to compare scenes at different times to calculate the direction and speed of motion. It remains untested how response dynamics of individual cell types drive motion detection and velocity sensitivity. Here, we sped up or slowed down specific neuron types in Drosophila's motion detection circuit by manipulating ion channel expression. Altering the dynamics of individual neurons upstream of motion detectors changed their integrating properties and increased their sensitivity to fast or slow visual motion, exposing distinct roles for dynamics in tuning directional signals. A circuit model constrained by data and anatomy reproduced the observed tuning changes. Together, these results reveal how excitatory and inhibitory dynamics jointly tune a canonical circuit computation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A gradient of electrophysiological novelty responses along the human hippocampal long axis.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is implicated in novelty detection, thought to be important for regulating entry of information into long-term memory. Whether electrophysiological responses to novelty differ along the human hippocampal long axis is currently unknown. By recording from electrodes implanted longitudinally in the hippocampus of epilepsy patients, here we show a gradual increase of theta frequency oscillatory power from anterior to posterior in response to unexpected stimuli, superimposed on novelty responses common to all long axis portions. Intracranial event-related potentials (iERPs) were larger for unexpected vs. expected stimuli and demonstrated a polarity inversion between the hippocampal head (HH) and body (HB). We observed stronger theta coherence between HH and hippocampal tail (HT) than between HB and HT, similarly for expected and unexpected stimuli. This was accompanied by theta and alpha traveling waves with surprisingly variable direction of travel characterized by a ~180 degree phase lag between hippocampal poles. Interestingly, this phase lag showed a pronounced phase offset between anterior and middle (HH-HB) hippocampal portions coinciding anatomically with a drop in theta coherence and the novelty iERP polarity inversion. Our findings indicate common response properties along the hippocampal long axis to unexpected stimuli, as well as a multifaceted, non-uniform engagement along the long axis for novelty processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dorsal striatum coding for the timely execution of action sequences</a></h4>

              
                The automatic initiation of actions can be highly functional. But occasionally these actions cannot be withheld and are released at inappropriate times, impulsively. Striatal activity has been shown to participate in the timing of action sequence initiation and it has been linked to impulsivity. Using a self-initiated task, we trained adult rats to withhold a rewarded action sequence until a waiting time interval has elapsed. By analyzing neuronal activity we show that the striatal response preceding the initiation of the learned sequence is strongly modulated by the time subjects wait before eliciting the sequence. Interestingly, the modulation is steeper in adolescent rats, which show a strong prevalence of impulsive responses compared to adults. We hypothesize this anticipatory striatal activity reflects the animals' subjective reward expectation, based on the elapsed waiting time, while its steeper waiting modulation in adolescence reflects age-related differences in temporal discounting, internal urgency states or explore-exploit balance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Overlapping Representation of Basic Tastes in the Human Gustatory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The topological representation is a fundamental property of human primary sensory cortices. The human gustatory cortex (GC) responds to the five basic tastes: bitter, salty, sweet, umami, and sour. However, the topological representation of the human gustatory cortex remains controversial. Through functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) measurements of human responses to the five basic tastes, the current study aimed to delineate the taste representations within the GC. During the scanning, the volunteers tasted solutions of the five basic tastes, then washed their mouths with the tasteless solution. The solutions were then sucked from the volunteers' mouths, eliminating the action of swallowing. The results showed that the bilateral mid-insula activated most during the taste task, and the active areas were mainly in the precentral and central insular sulcus. However, the regions responding to the five basic tastes are substantially overlapped, and the analysis of contrasts between each taste response and the averaged response to the remaining tastes does not report any significant results. Furthermore, in the gustatory insular cortex, the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was unable to distinguish the activation patterns of the basic tastes, suggesting the possibility of weakly clustered distribution of the taste-preference neural activities in the human insular cortex. In conclusion, the presented results suggest overlapping representations of the basic tastes in the human gustatory insular cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tonic engagement of nicotinic receptors bidirectionally controls striatal spiny projection neuron spike timing</a></h4>

              
                Striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) transform convergent excitatory corticostriatal inputs into an inhibitory signal that shapes basal ganglia output. This process is fine-tuned by striatal GABAergic interneurons (GINs), which receive overlapping cortical inputs and mediate rapid corticostriatal feedforward inhibition of SPNs. Adding another level of control, cholinergic interneurons (CINs), which are also vigorously activated by corticostriatal excitation, can 1) disynaptically inhibit SPNs by activating 4{beta}2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on various GINs and 2) directly modulate corticostriatal synaptic strength via pre-synaptic 7 nAChR receptors. Measurements of the disynaptic inhibitory pathway, however, indicate that it is too slow to compete with direct GIN-mediated feed-forward inhibition. Moreover, functional nAChRs are also present on populations of GINs that do not respond to phasic activation of CINs, such as parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (PV-FSIs), making the overall role of nAChRs in shaping striatal synaptic integration unclear. Using acute striatal slices we show that upon synchronous optogenetic activation of corticostriatal projections, blockade of 7 nAChRs delayed SPN spikes, whereas blockade of 4{beta}2 nAChRs advanced SPN spikes and increased postsynaptic depolarizations. The nAChR-dependent inhibition was mediated by downstream GABA release, and data suggest that the GABA source was not limited to GINs that respond to phasic CIN activation. In particular, the observed spike-advancement caused by nAChR blockade was associated with a diminished frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in SPNs, and a parallel hyperpolarization of PV-FSIs. Taken together, we describe opposing roles for tonic (as opposed to phasic) engagement of nAChRs in striatal function. We conclude that tonic activation of nAChRs by CINs both sharpens the temporal fidelity of corticostriatal signaling via pre-synaptic 7 nAChRs and maintains a GABAergic brake on cortically-driven striatal output, processes that may shape SPN spike timing, striatal processing and synaptic plasticity.

                The striatum is critical for making decisions based on predictions of future reward. These predictions can be updated by brief pulses of dopamine, encoding reward prediction errors. However, it is unclear how this mechanism handles the need to generate predictions over multiple time horizons: from seconds or less (if singing a song) to potentially hours or more (if hunting for food). Here we monitor and model dopamine pulses across distinct striatal subregions, and find that these reflect predictions over distinct temporal scales. Dopamine dynamics systematically accelerated from ventral to dorsal-medial to dorsal-lateral striatum, in the tempo of their spontaneous fluctuations, their integration of prior rewards, and their discounting of future rewards. In this way parallel striatal circuits can achieve a more comprehensive set of value computations, to guide a broad range of reward-related behaviors.

                The discovery of ways to enhance skin wound healing is of great importance due to the frequency of these lesions. We discovered that 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel blocker, greatly enhances skin wound healing. Benefits include faster wound closure, restoration of normal-appearing skin architecture and epidermal thickness, increased vascularization and increases in K14+ keratinocytes. Hair follicle number was increased, both histologically and by analysis of K15 and K17 expression. Levels of vimentin (which marks fibroblasts) and -smooth muscle actin -SMA, which marks collagen-producing myofibroblasts) increased, as did -SMA+ cell numbers. 4-AP also increased numbers of axons and S-100+ Schwann cells, and increased expression of p75-NTR and SOX10. Treatment also increased levels of nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor-{beta}, Substance P and PGP9.5, important modulators of wound healing. As 4-AP is already used for treatment of multiple sclerosis and other chronic neurological syndromes, it has strong potential for rapid translational development.

                Intelligent behavior depends on the brain's ability to anticipate future events. However, the learning rules that enable neurons to predict and fire ahead of sensory inputs remain largely unknown. We propose a plasticity rule based on predictive processing, where the neuron learns a low-rank model of the synaptic input dynamics in its membrane potential. Neurons thereby amplifies those synapses that maximally predict other synaptic inputs based on their temporal relations, which provides a solution to an optimization problem that can be implemented at the single-neuron level using only local information. Consequently, neurons learn sequences over long timescales and shift their spikes towards the first inputs in a sequence. We show that this mechanism can explain the development of anticipatory motion signaling and recall in the visual system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learning rule gives rise to several experimentally observed STDP (spike-timing-dependent plasticity) mechanisms. These findings suggest prediction as a guiding principle to orchestrate learning and synaptic plasticity in single neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">More than a feeling: scalp EEG and eye correlates of conscious tactile perception</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural basis of consciousness is a fundamental goal of neuroscience. Many of the studies tackling this question have focused on conscious perception, but these studies have been largely vision-centric, with very few involving tactile perception. Therefore, we developed a novel tactile threshold perception task, which we used in conjunction with high-density scalp electroencephalography and eye-metric recordings. Participants were delivered threshold-level vibrations to one of the four non-thumb fingers, and were asked to report their perception using a response box. With false discovery rate (FDR) mass univariate analysis procedures, we found significant event-related potentials (ERP) including bilateral N140 and P300 for perceived vibrations; significant bilateral P100 and P300 were found following vibrations that were not perceived. Significant differences between perceived and not perceived trials were found bilaterally in the N140 and P300. Additionally, we found that pupil diameter and blink rate increased and that microsaccade rate decreased following vibrations that were perceived relative to those that were not perceived. While many of the signals are consistent with similar ERP-findings across sensory modalities, our results indicating a significant P300 in not perceived trials raise more questions regarding P300's perceptual meaning. Additionally, our findings support the use of eye metrics as a measure of physiological arousal as pertains to conscious perception, and may represent a novel path toward the creation of tactile no-report tasks in the future.

                Background: Cochlear implantation is an effective auditory rehabilitation strategy for those with profound hearing loss, including those with residual low frequency hearing through use of hybrid cochlear implantation techniques. Post-mortem studies demonstrate the nearly ubiquitous presence of intracochlear fibrosis and neo-ossification following cochlear implantation. Current evidence suggests post-implantation intracochlear fibrosis is associated with delayed loss of residual acoustic hearing in hybrid cochlear implant (CI) recipients and may also negatively influence outcomes in traditional CI recipients. This study examined the contributions of surgical trauma, foreign body response and electric stimulation to intracochlear fibrosis and the innate immune response to cochlear implantation and the hierarchy of these contributions. Methods: Normal hearing CX3CR1+/GFP mice underwent either round window opening (sham), acute CI insertion or chronic CI insertion with no, low- or high-level electric stimulation. Electric stimulation levels were based on neural response telemetry (NRT), beginning post-operative day 7 for 4 hours per day. Subjects (n=3 per timepoint) were sacrificed at 4 hours, 1,4,7,8,11,14 and 21 days. An unimplanted group (n=3) served as controls. Cochleae were harvested at each time-point and prepared for immunohistochemistry with confocal imaging. The images were analyzed to obtain CX3CR1+ macrophage cell number and density in the lateral wall (LW), scala tympani (ST) and Rosenthal's canal (RC). Results: A ST peri-implant cellular infiltrate and fibrosis occurred exclusively in the chronically implanted groups starting on day 7 with a concurrent infiltration of CX3CR1+ macrophages not seen in the other groups. CX3CR1+ macrophage infiltration was seen in the LW and RC in all experimental groups within the first week, being most prominent in the 3 chronically implanted groups during the second and third week. There were no significant differences in macrophage infiltration related to levels of electric stimulation. Conclusions: The cochlear immune response was most prominent in the presence of chronic cochlear implantation, regardless of electric stimulation level. Further, the development of intracochlear ST fibrosis was dependent on the presence of the indwelling CI foreign body. An innate immune response was evoked by surgical trauma alone (sham and acute CI groups) to a lesser degree. These data suggest that cochlear inflammation and intrascalar fibrosis after cochlear implantation are largely dependent on the presence of a chronic indwelling foreign body and are not critically dependent on electrical stimulation. Also, these data support a role for surgical trauma in inciting the initial innate immune response.

                The search for an 'ideal' approach to investigate the functional connections in the human brain is an ongoing challenge for the neuroscience community. While resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to study individual functional connectivity patterns, recent work has highlighted the benefits of collecting functional connectivity data while participants are exposed to naturalistic stimuli, such as watching a movie or listening to a story. For example, functional connectivity data collected during movie-watching were shown to predict cognitive and emotional scores more accurately than resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We have previously reported a tight link between resting-state functional connectivity and task-derived neural activity, such that the former successfully predicts the latter. In the current work we use data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that naturalistic-stimulus-derived functional connectivity predicts task-induced brain activation maps more accurately than resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We then show that activation maps predicted using naturalistic stimuli are better predictors of individual intelligence scores than activation maps predicted using resting-state. We additionally examine the influence of naturalistic-stimulus type on prediction accuracy. Our findings emphasize the potential of naturalistic stimuli as a promising alternative to resting-state fMRI for connectome-based predictive modelling of individual brain activity and cognitive traits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A retinal circuit that vetoes optokinetic responses to fast visual motion</a></h4>

              
                Optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is a visuomotor reflex that works in tandem with the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) to stabilize the retinal image during self-motion. OKN requires information about both the direction and speed of retinal image motion. Both components are computed within the retina because they are already encoded in the spike trains of the specific class of retinal output neurons that drives OKN [boxh] the ON direction-selective ganglion cells (ON DSGCs). The synaptic circuits that shape the directional tuning of ON DSGCs, anchored by starburst amacrine cells, are largely established. By contrast, little is known about the cells and circuits that account for the slow speed preference of ON DSGCs and, thus, of OKN that they drive. A recent study in rabbit retina implicates feedforward glycinergic inhibition as the key suppressor of ON DSGC responses to fast motion. Here, we used serial-section electron microscopy, patch recording, pharmacology, and optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations to probe this circuit in mouse retina. We confirm a central role for feedforward glycinergic inhibition onto ON DSGCs and identify a surprising primary source for this inhibition [boxh] the VGluT3 amacrine cell (VG3 cell). VG3 cells are retinal interneurons that release both glycine and glutamate, exciting some neurons and inhibiting others. Their role in suppressing the response of ON DSGCs to rapid global motion is surprising. VG3 cells had been thought to provide glutamatergic excitation to ON-DSGCs, not glycinergic inhibition, and because they have strong receptive fields surrounds which might have been expected to render them unresponsive to global motion. In fact, VG3 cells are robustly activated by the sorts of fast global motion that suppress ON DSGCs and weaken optokinetic responses as revealed by dendritic Ca+2 imaging, since surround suppression is less prominent when probed with moving gratings than with spots. VG3 cells excite many ganglion cell types through their release of glutatmate. We confirmed that for one such type, the ON-OFF DSGCs, VG3 cells enhance the response to fast motion in these cells, just as they suppress it in ON DSGCs. Together, our results assign a novel function to VGluT3 cells in shaping the velocity range over which retinal slip drives compensatory image stabilizing eye movements. In addition, fast speed motion signal from VGluT3 cells is used by ON-OFF DSGCs to extend the speed range over which they respond, and might be used to shape the speed tuning or temporal bandwidth of the responses of other RGCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-mitotic accumulation of histone variant H3.3 in new cortical neurons establishes neuronal transcriptome, identity, and connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Histone variants, which can be expressed outside of S-phase and deposited DNA synthesis-independently, provide replacement histones in terminally post-mitotic cells, including neurons. Histone variants can also serve active roles in gene regulation by modulating chromatin states or enabling nucleosome turnover at regulatory regions. Here, we find that newborn cortical excitatory neurons substantially accumulate the histone H3 variant H3.3 immediately post-mitosis. Co-deletion of H3.3-encoding genes H3f3a and H3f3b from new neurons abrogates this accumulation, and causes widespread disruptions in the developmental establishment of the neuronal transcriptome. These broad transcriptomic changes coincide with neuronal maturation phenotypes in acquisition of distinct neuronal identities and formation of axon tracts. Stage-dependent deletion of H3f3a and H3f3b from (1) cycling neural progenitor cells, (2) neurons immediately after terminal mitosis, or (3) several days later, reveals the first post-mitotic days as a critical window for de novo H3.3. After H3.3 accumulation within this developmental window, co-deletion of H3f3a and H3f3b from neurons causes progressive H3.3 depletion over several months without widespread transcriptional disruptions. Our study thus uncovers a key role for H3.3 in establishing neuronal transcriptome, identity, and connectivity immediately post-mitosis that is distinct from its role in maintaining total histone H3 levels over the neuronal lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Penalized generalized estimating equations for relative risk regression with applications to brain lesion data</a></h4>

              
                Motivated by a brain lesion application, we introduce penalized generalized estimating equations for relative risk regression for modelling correlated binary data. Brain lesions can have varying incidence across the brain and result in both rare and high incidence outcomes. As a result, odds ratios estimated from generalized estimating equations with logistic regression structures are not necessarily directly interpretable as relative risks. On the other hand, use of log-link regression structures with the binomial variance function may lead to estimation instabilities when event probabilities are close to 1. To circumvent such issues, we use generalized estimating equations with log-link regression structures with identity variance function and unknown dispersion parameter. Even in this setting, parameter estimates can be infinite, which we address by penalizing the generalized estimating functions with the gradient of the Jeffreys prior. Our findings from extensive simulation studies show significant improvement over the standard log-link generalized estimating equations by providing finite estimates and achieving convergence when boundary estimates occur. The real data application on UK Biobank brain lesion maps further reveals the instabilities of the standard log-link generalized estimating equations for a large-scale data set and demonstrates the clear interpretation of relative risk in clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task-independent acute effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on human brain function and its relationship with cannabinoid receptor gene expression: a neuroimaging meta-regression analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) remain unclear. Here, we examined the spatial acute effect of THC on human on regional brain activation or blood flow (hereafter called 'activation signal') in a 'core' network of brain regions that subserve a multitude of processes. We also investigated whether the neuromodulatory effects of THC are related to the local expression of its key molecular target, cannabinoid-type-1 (CB1R) but not type-2 (CB2R) receptor. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of acute THC-challenge studies using fMRI, PET, and arterial spin labelling in accordance with established guidelines. Using pooled summary data from 372 participants, tested using a within-subject repeated measures design under experimental conditions, we investigated the effects of a single dose (6-42mg) of THC, compared to placebo, on brain signal. Findings: As predicted, THC augmented the activation signal, relative to placebo, in the anterior cingulate, superior frontal cortices, middle temporal and middle and inferior occipital gyri, striatum, amygdala, thalamus, and cerebellum crus II and attenuated it in the middle temporal gyrus (spatially distinct from the cluster with THC-induced increase in activation signal), superior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, and the cerebellum lobule IV/V. Using post-mortem gene expression data from an independent cohort from the Allen Human Brain atlas, we found a direct relationship between the magnitude of THC-induced brain signal change, indexed using pooled effect-size estimates, and CB1R gene expression, a proxy measure of CB1R protein distribution, but not CB2R expression. A dose-response relationship was observed with THC dose in certain brain regions. Interpretation: These meta-analytic findings shed new light on the localisation of the effects of THC in the human brain, suggesting that THC has neuromodulatory effects in regions central to many cognitive tasks and processes, with greater effects in regions with higher levels of CB1R expression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral context affects social signal representations within single primate prefrontal cortex neurons</a></h4>

              
                We tested whether social signal processing in more traditional, head-restrained contexts is representative of the putative natural analog (social communication) by comparing responses to vocalizations within individual neurons in marmoset prefrontal cortex (PFC) across a series of behavioral contexts ranging from traditional to naturalistic. Although vocalization responsive neurons were evident in all contexts, cross-context consistency was notably limited. A response to these social signals when subjects were head-restrained was not predictive of a comparable neural response to the identical vocalizations during natural communication, even within the same neuron. Neural activity at the population level followed a similar pattern, as PFC activity could be reliably decoded for the context in which vocalizations were heard. This suggests that neural representations of social signals in primate PFC are not static, but highly flexible and likely reflect how nuances of the dynamic behavioral contexts affect the perception of these signals and what they communicate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal Pattern of Synaptic Activation Determines the Longevity of Structural Plasticity at Single Dendritic Spines</a></h4>

              
                Individual synapses are the points at which information is passed into neurons, yet it is unknown how the diverse patterns of activity that are observed in vivo effect plasticity at the level of single inputs. Here, we wanted to determine what are the structural plasticity consequences of naturalistic patterns of activity at single spines, as these reflect changes in synaptic efficacy. Utilizing two-photon fluorescence imaging and glutamate uncaging, we studied structural plasticity of individual CA1 hippocampal dendritic spines using activation patterns sampled from a Poisson distribution, which resemble endogenous firing patterns from their CA3 inputs. We found that while the majority of inputs initially undergo structural changes, the robustness of this plasticity is determined by the timing structure of the Poisson sampled naturalistic stimulation patterns. Further, we found that structural plasticity elicited by these naturalistic patterns is both NMDAR and protein synthesis dependent, consistent with requirements for other forms of plasticity. Lastly, we found that during the delivery of naturalistic activity patterns, spines underwent rapid and dynamic structural growth that predicted the longevity of plasticity, which was not the case during tonic stimulation protocols. These data suggest that dendritic spines are able to integrate incoming temporal information and accordingly modulate the longevity of plasticity that is induced.

                While the cerebellum makes known contributions to non-motor task performance, the role of the structure remains unknown. One possibility is that the cerebellum allows for the offloading of cortical processing, providing support during task performance, using internal models. The current work used transcranial direct current stimulation to modulate cerebellar function and investigate the impact on cortical activation patterns. Participants received stimulation over the right cerebellum before a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan where participants completed a sequence learning and a working memory task. We predicted that cathodal stimulation would improve, and anodal stimulation would hinder task performance and cortical activation. We found that anodal cerebellar stimulation resulted in increased bilateral cortical activation, particularly in parietal and frontal regions known to be involved in cognitive processing. This suggests that if the cerebellum is not functioning optimally, there is a greater need for cortical resources.

	<p>The feasibility of working on cognitive functions with children and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) inside Multisensory Interactive Rooms (MIRs) has been poorly investigated, even if sensory atypicalities are common in ASD and usual intervention rooms could represent a challenging sensory setting for patients with ASD. We hypothesized that the possibility to calibrate the sensory stimulation offered by this type of environment, able to promote a positive emotional state in patients with ASD, can consequently favor the interaction with the therapist and the motivation towards activities targeting cognitive functions. High- and low-functioning children and low-functioning adolescents/adults underwent five sessions in a fully digitalized MIR, working on sustained attention, selective attention, association, single inhibition, receptive communication, verbalization, and turn. We developed specific protocols calibrated for sensory stimulation and difficulty level based on the characteristics of the participants. We found statistically significant improvements in all functions, except association, in the children’s group. Therefore, a fully digitalized MIR seems suitable for intervention on cognitive functions in ASDs, but further investigations are needed to better address possible differences related to age and functioning level.</p>

	<p>Walking rehabilitation is challenging in stroke patients with sensory impairments. In this study, we examined the two-week effect of an auditory biofeedback prosthesis, Auditory Foot (AF), on the change in the frontal whole body angular momentum (WBAM) range, before and after a two-week walking rehabilitation. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). We employed statistical Bayesian modeling to understand the mechanism of the rehabilitation effect and predict the expected effect in new patients. The best-performing model indicated that the frontal WBAM range was reduced in the AF group by 12.9–28.7%. This suggests that the use of kinesthetic biofeedback in gait rehabilitation contributes to the suppression of frontal WBAM, resulting in an improved walking balance function in stroke patients.</p>

	<p>Parkinson´s disease multimodal complex treatment (PD-MCT) is a multidisciplinary inpatient treatment option increasingly applied in Germany. However, data on its effectiveness are rare. Data were collected at the Department of Neurology of the University Hospital Jena, Germany. In 2019, 159 patients were admitted to our neurology ward for PD-MCT. Patients were followed for up to 12 months, and their data were retrospectively analyzed to assess the short- and long-term treatment effects. The treatment led to an improvement in motor function assessed by Movement Disorder Society sponsored revision of the unified Parkinson´s disease rating scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III) and motor performance (Tinetti test). Improvement of MDS-UPDRS III was associated with lower age, higher MDS-UPDRS III at admission, and less depression (assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Beck-Depression Inventory II). One month after the hospital stay, 36.8% of the patients reported feeling better, while 32.6% reported feeling worse. If the patients were not depressed, they were more likely to have reported feeling better. PD-MCT is an effective inpatient treatment option. However, to improve patients’ satisfaction, screening and treatment for depression is essential. The effectiveness of different treatment durations has to be elucidated in further studies.</p>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common chronic diseases in the western world. In Australia, around 1.7 million Australians aged 18 years and over (about one in ten) have indicators of CKD, and 1.8 million hospitalisations were associated with CKD in 2017–18. There is currently very little understanding of the impact of CKD on health service utilisation and costs. Understanding the disease pathways of CKD and its effects on service utilisation and patient outcomes is essential to predicting the course of the disease in the future, its effects on health services utilisation and capacity to better manage the burden of premature deaths or the need for dialysis that results from CKD. We describe the establishment of a data linkage framework to study hospital admissions of CKD patients in the public renal services in the Australian state of Queensland, and its potential to advance understanding of their course and outcomes. Seven years of retrospective data (2011–2018) on hospital-based health services utilisation were provided by Queensland Health for all 7,341 patients who enrolled in the CKD.QLD Registry up to Jan 2019. The data were supplied from three datasets: the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection, the Queensland Registrar General deaths, and the Activity Based Funding Model Output data. In addition, data were supplied from two cohorts of de-identified patients admitted to hospital in the same interval (22,023 patients each), who were not in the CKD.QLD Registry, the first with CKD and the second without CKD as indicated by International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification. The comprehensive and multifaceted data via the data linkage will enable us to identify opportunities for efficiencies in management of patients with CKD and for interventions that improve their outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Post-pandemic e-learning: a pre-protocol to assess the integration of mobile VR and its effect on VARK learning styles [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an abrupt but accelerated shift to e-learning worldwide. Education in a post-pandemic world has to amalgamate the advantages of e-learning with important pedagogical goals associated with in-person teaching. Although various advanced technologies are present at our fingertips today, we are still unable to use their full potential in teaching and learning. In this regard, mobile VR technology is both cost-efficient, versatile and engaging for students. Developing countries have more smartphone users than developed countries, implying that developing countries, like Malaysia, should utilize mobile or cellphones more significantly. With that in mind, we propose here a pre-protocol to investigate learner motivation and levels of engagement for e-learning with smartphone-integrated VR, based on their VARK (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning styles. Proposed methodology: This study intends to use a minimum sample of 30 students from the same age group under the K-12 (particularly grade 9-12) belonging to STEM curriculum. The Google Cardboard VR set will be used as the prime technology for its affordability, easy build feature and variety of available vendors. A mixed-method (survey and activity log/tracking) for data collection is suggested to find the degree of engagement and motivation of the learners’ learning in the mobile VR-assisted e-learning context. The students will be taught a topic using the mobile VR and then be assessed through simple classroom quizzes to assess how well they grasped the concept. The data collected through activity logs (while teaching the topic in mobile VR) and questionnaires will be mapped to each individual learner and organized in a data repository. Further visualization, analysis and investigation will be performed using Smart PLS, Python or R language. Conclusions: The study aims to provide context for smartphone and software companies to develop technologies that could facilitate learner engagement during the post-pandemic state.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PEGS: An efficient tool for gene set enrichment within defined sets of genomic intervals [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Many biological studies of transcriptional control mechanisms produce lists of genes and non-coding genomic intervals from corresponding gene expression and epigenomic assays. In higher organisms, such as eukaryotes, genes may be regulated by distal elements, with these elements lying 10s–100s of kilobases away from a gene transcription start site. To gain insight into these distal regulatory mechanisms, it is important to determine comparative enrichment of genes of interest in relation to genomic regions of interest, and to be able to do so at a range of distances. Existing bioinformatics tools can annotate genomic regions to nearest known genes, or look for transcription factor binding sites in relation to gene transcription start sites. Here, we present PEGS (Peak set Enrichment in Gene Sets). This tool efficiently provides an exploratory analysis by calculating enrichment of multiple gene sets, associated with multiple non-coding elements (peak sets), at multiple genomic distances, and within topologically associated domains. We apply PEGS to gene sets derived from gene expression studies, and genomic intervals from corresponding ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq experiments to derive biologically meaningful results. We also demonstrate an extended application to tissue-specific gene sets and publicly available GWAS data, to find enrichment of sleep trait associated SNPs in relation to tissue-specific gene expression profiles.

                Background: Several studies have resulted in controversial data about the recurrence or new incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C who were treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).   Aim: This observational study aimed to assess the occurrence rate of HCC in patients who developed a sustained virological response (SVR).. METHOD:  A six-month prospective study was done at the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute [NHTMRI] in Cairo, Egypt on 150 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin. Patients were assigned into two groups according to their laboratory values to either receive sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (S/D/R) or receive only sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (S/D). The main outcome measure was the occurrence of HCC. Results: SVR-12 was 100%. 8.5% of patients developed HCC in the S/D/R group, while 0% in the S/D group. Conclusion:  New incidence or recurrence of HCC may occur in CHC genotype 4 cirrhotic patients receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (difficult to treat) although achieving SVR. The cause of HCC development in this study is cirrhosis, not the administered DAAs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 and the role of orofecal transmission: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are of key public health importance. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of some COVID-19 patients, suggesting the possibility that the virus could, in addition to droplet and fomite transmission, be transmitted via the orofecal route. Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO COVID-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings. Where necessary, authors are contacted for further details on the content of their articles. Results: We include searches up until 20 December 2020. We included 110 relevant studies: 76 primary observational studies or reports, and 35 reviews (one cohort study also included a review) examining the potential role of orofecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Of the observational studies, 37 were done in China. A total of 48 studies (n=9,081 patients) reported single cases, case series or cohort data on individuals with COVID-19 diagnosis or their contacts and 46 (96%) detected binary RT-PCR with 535 out of 1358 samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 (average 39.4%). The results suggest a long duration of fecal shedding, often recorded after respiratory samples tested negative, and symptoms of gastrointestinal disease were reported in several studies. Twenty-nine studies reported finding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, river water or toilet areas. Six studies attempted viral culture from COVID-19 patients’ fecal samples: culture was successful in 3 of 6 studies, and one study demonstrated invasion of the virus into intestinal epithelial cells. Conclusions: Varied observational and mechanistic evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can infect and be shed from the gastrointestinal tract, including some data demonstrating viral culture in fecal samples. To fully assess these risks, quantitative data on infectious virus in these settings and infectious dose are needed.

                Bezoars are an undigested mass causing an intraluminal obstruction in children.  Pharmacobezoars are formed from medicines or their vehicle, considered as a less frequent type observed in children. Our objective is to report a relatively rare entity as a potential cause of intestinal obstruction in children.  Here we report a case of 13-year-old girl with a history of herbal medicine intake who presented with persistent vomiting and abdominal distension. She was diagnosed with acute intestinal obstruction and managed conservatively without any complications. The patient became stable within two days so was discharged home. We found that ineffective history could lead to a delay in diagnosis and management. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for pica and psychiatric disorders, especially in adolescent children.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Burst control: Synaptic conditions for burst generation in cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eilam Goldenberg Leleo, Idan Segev</p>

The output of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) is expressed by a train of single spikes with intermittent bursts of multiple spikes at high frequencies. The bursts are the result of nonlinear dendritic properties, including Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and NMDA spikes, that interact with the ~10,000 synapses impinging on the neuron’s dendrites. Output spike bursts are thought to implement key dendritic computations, such as coincidence detection of bottom-up inputs (arriving mostly at the basal tree) and top-down inputs (arriving mostly at the apical tree). In this study we used a detailed nonlinear model of L5PC receiving excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to explore the conditions for generating bursts and for modulating their properties. We established the excitatory input conditions on the basal versus the apical tree that favor burst and show that there are two distinct types of bursts. Bursts consisting of 3 or more spikes firing at < 200 Hz, which are generated by stronger excitatory input to the basal versus the apical tree, and bursts of ~2-spikes at ~250 Hz, generated by prominent apical tuft excitation. Localized and well-timed dendritic inhibition on the apical tree differentially modulates Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and NMDA spikes and, consequently, finely controls the burst output. Finally, we explored the implications of different burst classes and respective dendritic inhibition for regulating synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Spatial subsidies drive sweet spots of tropical marine biomass production</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Renato A. Morais, Alexandre C. Siqueira, Patrick F. Smallhorn-West, David R. Bellwood</p>

Spatial subsidies increase local productivity and boost consumer abundance beyond the limits imposed by local resources. In marine ecosystems, deeper water and open ocean subsidies promote animal aggregations and enhance biomass that is critical for human harvesting. However, the scale of this phenomenon in tropical marine systems remains unknown. Here, we integrate a detailed assessment of biomass production in 3 key locations, spanning a major biodiversity and abundance gradient, with an ocean-scale dataset of fish counts to predict the extent and magnitude of plankton subsidies to fishes on coral reefs. We show that planktivorous fish-mediated spatial subsidies are widespread across the Indian and Pacific oceans and drive local spikes in biomass production that can lead to extreme productivity, up to 30 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. Plankton subsidies form the basis of productivity “sweet spots” where planktivores provide more than 50% of the total fish production, more than all other trophic groups combined. These sweet spots operate at regional, site, and smaller local scales. By harvesting oceanic productivity, planktivores bypass spatial constraints imposed by local primary productivity, creating “oases” of tropical fish biomass that are accessible to humans.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Gene replacement strategies validate the use of functional tags on centromeric chromatin and invalidate an essential role for CENP-AK124ub</a></h4>

              
                Using three gene replacement strategies, Salinas-Luypaert et al. demonstrate that CENP-AK124ub is not essential for CENP-A function at centromeres. Thus, functional tags do not mask the role of K124 when it is mutated. These strategies can be employed to interrogate posttranslational modifications at the centromere and other cellular locations.

                Heterochromatin establishment requires distinct nucleation and spreading steps. Murawska et al. show that the conserved and essential histone chaperone FACT facilitates the heterochromatin spreading process by maintaining low heterochromatic histone turnover, which enables a productive H3K9 trimethylation step by the methyltransferase Clr4 in fission yeast.

Few genes are directly affected, but widespread indirect effects accumulate slowly to phenocopy premalignancy.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Encoding of acquired sound-sequence salience by auditory cortical offset responses</a></h4>

              
                To study how the brain represents sound sequences and their meaning, Lee and Rothschild record the activity of groups of neurons in the auditory cortex of mice that learn to associate sound sequences with a reward. They find that responses to termination of sound sequences represent the sounds’ identity and their learning-acquired salience.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Molecular and structural basis of olfactory sensory neuron axon coalescence by Kirrel receptors</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal surface receptors Kirrels are important for vomeronasal sensory neuron axon identity and coalescence in the brain. Wang et al. report structural and evolutionary origins of exclusive homodimerization of Kirrels. Mice expressing monomeric Kirrel3 show axon coalescence phenotypes, supporting the hypothesis that Kirrel homodimerization underlies axonal coalescence in these neurons.

                Zhang et al. show that a chronic trigeminal neuralgia leads to depression, which is caused by increased activity of dopamine neurons in the midbrain. The neuronal circuits linking the spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis, the lateral parabrachial nucleus, and the ventral tegmental area underlie this increased activity of dopamine neurons.

                Suzuki et al. examine the role of eEF2K and retinoic acid signaling pathways in synaptic plasticity and rapid antidepressant effects. Their study establishes a causal link between synaptic scaling and rapid antidepressant effects and proposes that this form of synaptic plasticity is a key synaptic substrate for rapid antidepressant action.

                Zan et al. find that morphine abstinence activates κ-opioid receptors (KORs) by increasing endogenous KOR ligand dynorphin expression in the amygdala, which in turn facilitates GLT1 expression by activation of p38 MAPK. Upregulation of GLT1 expression contributes to opiate-abstinence-elicited depressive-like behaviors through modulating amygdalar glutamatergic inputs to the NAc.
