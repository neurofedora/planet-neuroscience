              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01964">Gain modulation of actions selection without synaptic relearning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptation of behavior requires the brain to change goals in a changing environment. Synaptic learning has demonstrated its effectiveness in changing the probability of selecting actions based on their outcome. In the extreme case, it is vital not to repeat an action to a given goal that led to harmful punishment. The present model proposes a simple neural mechanism of gain modulation that makes possible immediate changes in the probability of selecting a goal after punishment of variable intensity. Results show how gain modulation determine the type of elementary navigation process within the state space of a network of neuronal populations of excitatory neurons regulated by inhibition. Immediately after punishment, the system can avoid the punished populations by going back or by jumping to unpunished populations. This does not require particular credit assignment at the `choice' population but only gain modulation of neurons active at the time of punishment. Gain modulation does not require statistical relearning that may lead to further errors, but can encode memories of past experiences without modification of synaptic efficacies. Therefore, gain modulation can complements synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01966">The impact of motor and non-motor symptoms fluctuations on health-related quality of life in people with functional motor disorder</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To assess the effect of overall, between- and within-day subjectively rated fluctuations in motor and non-motor symptoms in people with functional motor disorder (FMD) on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
  Background: FMD is a complex condition characterized by fluctuating motor and non-motor symptoms that may negatively impact HRQoL.
  Methods: Seventy-seven patients (54 females, mean age 45.4 (SD 10.4) years) with a clinically established diagnosis of FMD, including weakness, completed symptom diaries, rating the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms (i.e., pain, fatigue, mood, cognitive difficulties) on a 10-point numerical scale three times daily for seven consecutive days. HRQoL was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. For the analysis, fluctuation magnitude was defined in terms of the variability in self-reported symptom scores.
  Results: The mental component of SF-36 was jointly predicted by the overall severity scores (P<0.001) and overall general fluctuations (P=0.004). The physical SF-36 was found to be related only to the overall symptom severity scores (P<0.001), but not to the overall fluctuations. The assessment of the impact of different components showed that the mental component of SF-36 was significantly influenced by the combined effect of average fatigue (P<0.001), between-day cognitive symptoms fluctuations (P=0.002), and within-day mood fluctuations (P=0.015).
  Conclusions: This study demonstrated the impact of self-reported symptom fluctuations across multiple motor and non-motor domains on mental but not physical HRQoL in FMD and highlighted the importance of assessing and managing fluctuations in clinical practice.

                arXiv:2501.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the causal interactions in simple brain tasks, such as face detection, remains a challenging and ambiguous process for researchers. In this study, we address this issue by employing a novel causal discovery method -- Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity (DAGMA) -- to investigate the causal structure of the brain's face-selective network and gain deeper insights into its mechanism. Using natural movie stimuli, we extract causal network of face-selective regions and analyze how frames containing faces influence this network. Our findings reveal that the presence of faces in the stimuli have causal effect both on the number and strength of causal connections within the network. Additionally, our results highlight the crucial role of subcortical regions in satisfying causal sufficiency, emphasizing its importance in causal studies of brain. This study provides a new perspective on understanding the causal architecture of the face-selective network of the brain, motivating further research on neural causality.

                arXiv:2501.02402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral inhibition models coupled with Hebbian plasticity have been shown to learn factorised causal representations of input stimuli, for instance, oriented edges are learned from natural images. Currently, these models require the recurrent dynamics to settle into a stable state before weight changes can be applied, which is not only biologically implausible, but also impractical for real-time learning systems. Here, we propose a new Hebbian learning rule which is implemented using plausible biological mechanisms that have been observed experimentally. We find that this rule allows for efficient, time-continuous learning of factorised representations, very similar to the classic noncontinuous Hebbian/anti-Hebbian learning. Furthermore, we show that this rule naturally prevents catastrophic forgetting when stimuli from different distributions are shown sequentially.

                arXiv:2501.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical models of memory in psychology and neuroscience rely on similarity-based retrieval of stored patterns, where similarity is a function of retrieval cues and the stored patterns. While parsimonious, these models do not allow distinct representations for storage and retrieval, despite their distinct computational demands. Key-value memory systems, in contrast, distinguish representations used for storage (values) and those used for retrieval (keys). This allows key-value memory systems to optimize simultaneously for fidelity in storage and discriminability in retrieval. We review the computational foundations of key-value memory, its role in modern machine learning systems, related ideas from psychology and neuroscience, applications to a number of empirical puzzles, and possible biological implementations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03051">Inverse receptive field attention for naturalistic image reconstruction from the brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual perception in the brain largely depends on the organization of neuronal receptive fields. Although extensive research has delineated the coding principles of receptive fields, most studies have been constrained by their foundational assumptions. Moreover, while machine learning has successfully been used to reconstruct images from brain data, this approach faces significant challenges, including inherent feature biases in the model and the complexities of brain structure and function. In this study, we introduce an inverse receptive field attention (IRFA) model, designed to reconstruct naturalistic images from neurophysiological data in an end-to-end fashion. This approach aims to elucidate the tuning properties and representational transformations within the visual cortex. The IRFA model incorporates an attention mechanism that determines the inverse receptive field for each pixel, weighting neuronal responses across the visual field and feature spaces. This method allows for an examination of the dynamics of neuronal representations across stimuli in both spatial and feature dimensions. Our results show highly accurate reconstructions of naturalistic data, independent of pre-trained models. Notably, IRF models trained on macaque V1, V4, and IT regions yield remarkably consistent spatial receptive fields across different stimuli, while the features to which neuronal representations are selective exhibit significant variation. Additionally, we propose a data-driven method to explore representational clustering within various visual areas, further providing testable hypotheses.

                arXiv:2501.03062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the former work Conscious Turing Machine, in this paper, we attempt to talk about the consciousness of CTM, dig deeper into the self-consciousness in CTM, offer a clear definition of it, and design a possible model of the Model-of-the-World processor. To prove the consciousness of CTM does exist, we chose two definitions of human consciousness and extracted four key points to see if the CTM framework meets with them. If it does, we affirm that it's more likely to be able to generate consciousness. About self-consciousness, our definition of it refers to both the definition of conscious awareness in CTM and former studies about the duality of self. After that, we give a brief introduction to a possible model of MoTW processors including five important parts: Modeling function, Gist function, Value function, Cache, and Long term memory. Finally, we use some illusions and disorders to explain our MotW processor model, trying to understand how these illusions work on a CTM.

                arXiv:2501.02146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modality translation between MRI and PET imaging is challenging due to the distinct mechanisms underlying these modalities. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs) are revolutionizing Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection by identifying patients and quantifying brain amyloid levels. However, the potential of BBBMs to enhance PET image synthesis remains unexplored. In this paper, we performed a thorough study on the effect of incorporating BBBM into deep generative models. By evaluating three widely used cross-modality translation models, we found that BBBMs integration consistently enhances the generative quality across all models. By visual inspection of the generated results, we observed that PET images generated by CycleGAN exhibit the best visual fidelity. Based on these findings, we propose Plasma-CycleGAN, a novel generative model based on CycleGAN, to synthesize PET images from MRI using BBBMs as conditions. This is the first approach to integrate BBBMs in conditional cross-modality translation between MRI and PET.

                arXiv:2501.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \emph{Abrupt learning} is commonly observed in neural networks, where long plateaus in network performance are followed by rapid convergence to a desirable solution. Yet, despite its common occurrence, the complex interplay of task, network architecture, and learning rule has made it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms. Here, we introduce a minimal dynamical system trained on a delayed-activation task and demonstrate analytically how even a one-dimensional system can exhibit abrupt learning through ghost points rather than bifurcations. Through our toy model, we show that the emergence of a ghost point destabilizes learning dynamics. We identify a critical learning rate that prevents learning through two distinct loss landscape features: a no-learning zone and an oscillatory minimum. Testing these predictions in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we confirm that ghost points precede abrupt learning and accompany the destabilization of learning. We demonstrate two complementary remedies: lowering the model output confidence prevents the network from getting stuck in no-learning zones, while increasing trainable ranks beyond task requirements (\textit{i.e.}, adding sloppy parameters) provides more stable learning trajectories. Our model reveals a bifurcation-free mechanism for abrupt learning and illustrates the importance of both deliberate uncertainty and redundancy in stabilizing learning dynamics.

Inspired by studies on the latent geometry of the brain, in this perspective paper we posit that an increase in the research and application of hyperbolic geometry in ANNs and machine learning will lead to increased accuracy, improved feature space representations and more efficient models across a range of tasks. We examine the structure and functions of the human brain, emphasising the correspondence between its scale-free hierarchical organization and hyperbolic geometry, and reflecting on the central role hyperbolic geometry plays in facilitating human intelligence. Empirical evidence indicates that hyperbolic neural networks outperform Euclidean models for tasks including natural language processing, computer vision and complex network analysis, requiring fewer parameters and exhibiting better generalisation. Despite its nascent adoption, hyperbolic geometry holds promise for improving machine learning models through brain-inspired geometric representations.

                arXiv:2412.02529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain. In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: There is growing symbiosis between artificial and biological intelligence sciences: neural principles inspire new intelligent machines, which are in turn used to advance our theoretical understanding of the brain. To promote further collaboration between biological and artificial intelligence researchers, we introduce the 2025 edition of the Algonauts Project challenge: How the Human Brain Makes Sense of Multimodal Movies (https://algonautsproject.com/). In collaboration with the Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling (CNeuroMod), this edition aims to bring forth a new generation of brain encoding models that are multimodal and that generalize well beyond their training distribution, by training them on the largest dataset of fMRI responses to movie watching available to date. Open to all, the 2025 challenge provides transparent, directly comparable results through a public leaderboard that is updated automatically after each submission to facilitate rapid model assessment and guide development. The challenge will end with a session at the 2025 Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN) conference that will feature winning models. We welcome researchers interested in collaborating with the Algonauts Project by contributing ideas and datasets for future challenges.

                arXiv:2408.01322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objects we perceive guide our eye movements when observing real-world dynamic scenes. Yet, gaze shifts and selective attention are critical for perceiving details and refining object boundaries. Object segmentation and gaze behavior are, however, typically treated as two independent processes. Here, we present a computational model that simulates these processes in an interconnected manner and allows for hypothesis-driven investigations of distinct attentional mechanisms. Drawing on an information processing pattern from robotics, we use a Bayesian filter to recursively segment the scene, which also provides an uncertainty estimate for the object boundaries that we use to guide active scene exploration. We demonstrate that this model closely resembles observers' free viewing behavior on a dataset of dynamic real-world scenes, measured by scanpath statistics, including foveation duration and saccade amplitude distributions used for parameter fitting and higher-level statistics not used for fitting. These include how object detections, inspections, and returns are balanced and a delay of returning saccades without an explicit implementation of such temporal inhibition of return. Extensive simulations and ablation studies show that uncertainty promotes balanced exploration and that semantic object cues are crucial to forming the perceptual units used in object-based attention. Moreover, we show how our model's modular design allows for extensions, such as incorporating saccadic momentum or pre-saccadic attention, to further align its output with human scanpaths.

                arXiv:2501.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to human vision, insect visual systems excel at rapid and precise collision detection, despite relying on only tens of thousands of neurons organized through a few neuropils. This efficiency makes them an attractive model system for developing artificial collision-detecting systems. Specifically, researchers have identified collision-selective neurons in the locust's optic lobe, called lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs), which respond specifically to approaching objects. Research upon LGMD neurons began in the early 1970s. Initially, due to their large size, these neurons were identified as motion detectors, but their role as looming detectors was recognized over time. Since then, progress in neuroscience, computational modeling of LGMD's visual neural circuits, and LGMD-based robotics has advanced in tandem, each field supporting and driving the others. Today, with a deeper understanding of LGMD neurons, LGMD-based models have significantly improved collision-free navigation in mobile robots including ground and aerial robots. This review highlights recent developments in LGMD research from the perspectives of neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. It emphasizes a biologically plausible research paradigm, where insights from neuroscience inform real-world applications, which would in turn validate and advance neuroscience. With strong support from extensive research and growing application demand, this paradigm has reached a mature stage and demonstrates versatility across different areas of neuroscience research, thereby enhancing our understanding of the interconnections between neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. Furthermore, other motion-sensitive neurons have also shown promising potential for adopting this research paradigm.

                arXiv:2501.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are powerful tools for tackling complex computational problems, yet effectively managing the exploitation and exploration dynamics -- crucial for robust search navigation -- remains a persistent challenge for EA designers, and leads to the so-called exploration-exploitation dilemma. In this paper, a new human-centered framework is proposed to resolve this dilemma. Unlike the traditional approach, the search process will not be compromised of a single-phase nor the decision-maker tuning efforts will be distributed among the algorithm's traditional parameters such as defining new evolutionary operators internal to the algorithm to influence its search navigation. Instead, a human-centered two-phase search process, compromised of a global search phase followed by a local phase will be utilized. In this framework, the designer plays the central role in directing the algorithm's search navigation through the focused tuning efforts of a new Search Space Size Control parameter external to the algorithm which proves itself to be the dominant parameter in-effect to the algorithm's effective search navigation.
  The framework is applicable to any search algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness on 14 well-known benchmark problems in unconstrained optimization.

                arXiv:2501.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) maintain populations through evolutionary operators to discover diverse solutions for complex tasks while gathering valuable knowledge, such as historical population data and fitness evaluations. However, traditional EAs face challenges in dynamically adapting to expanding knowledge bases, hindering the efficient exploitation of accumulated information and limiting adaptability to new situations. To address these issues, we introduce an Optimization Knowledge Adaptation Evolutionary Model (OKAEM), which features dynamic parameter adjustment using accumulated knowledge to enhance its optimization capabilities. OKAEM employs attention mechanisms to model the interactions among individuals, fitness landscapes, and genetic components separately, thereby parameterizing the evolutionary operators of selection, crossover, and mutation. These powerful learnable operators enable OKAEM to benefit from pre-learned extensive prior knowledge and self-tune with real-time evolutionary insights. Experimental results demonstrate that OKAEM: 1) exploits prior knowledge for significant performance gains across various knowledge transfer settings; 2) achieves competitive performance through self-tuning alone, even without prior knowledge; 3) outperforms state-of-the-art black-box baselines in a vision-language model tuning case; 4) can improve its optimization capabilities with growing knowledge; 5) is capable of emulating principles of natural selection and genetic recombination.

                arXiv:2501.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding human activity from EEG signals has long been a popular research topic. While recent studies have increasingly shifted focus from single-subject to cross-subject analysis, few have explored the model's ability to perform zero-shot predictions on EEG signals from previously unseen subjects. This research aims to investigate whether deep learning methods can capture subject-independent semantic information inherent in human EEG signals. Such insights are crucial for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) because, on one hand, they demonstrate the model's robustness against subject-specific temporal biases, and on the other, they significantly enhance the generalizability of downstream tasks. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as denoising agents to extract subject-independent semantic features from noisy EEG signals. Experimental results, including ablation studies, highlight the pivotal role of LLMs in decoding subject-independent semantic information from noisy EEG data. We hope our findings will contribute to advancing BCI research and assist both academia and industry in applying EEG signals to a broader range of applications.

                arXiv:2501.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of multi-objective optimization, evolutionary algorithms are distinguished by their capability to generate a diverse population of solutions that navigate the trade-offs inherent among competing objectives. This has catalyzed the ascension of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) as a prevalent approach. Despite the effectiveness of the EMO paradigm, the analysis of resultant solution sets presents considerable challenges. This is primarily attributed to the high-dimensional nature of the data and the constraints imposed by static visualization methods, which frequently culminate in visual clutter and impede interactive exploratory analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ParetoLens, a visual analytics framework specifically tailored to enhance the inspection and exploration of solution sets derived from the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Utilizing a modularized, algorithm-agnostic design, ParetoLens enables a detailed inspection of solution distributions in both decision and objective spaces through a suite of interactive visual representations. This approach not only mitigates the issues associated with static visualizations but also supports a more nuanced and flexible analysis process. The usability of the framework is evaluated through case studies and expert interviews, demonstrating its potential to uncover complex patterns and facilitate a deeper understanding of multi-objective optimization solution sets. A demo website of ParetoLens is available at https://dva-lab.org/paretolens/.

                arXiv:2501.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization is the core objective when training optimizers from data. However, limited training instances often constrain the generalization capability of the trained optimizers. Co-evolutionary approaches address this challenge by simultaneously evolving a parallel algorithm portfolio (PAP) and an instance population to eventually obtain PAPs with good generalization. Yet, when applied to a specific problem class, these approaches have a major limitation. They require practitioners to provide instance generators specially tailored to the problem class, which is often non-trivial to design. This work proposes a general-purpose, off-the-shelf PAP construction approach, named domain-agnostic co-evolution of parameterized search (DACE), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. The key innovation of DACE lies in its neural network-based domain-agnostic instance representation and generation mechanism that delimitates the need for domain-specific instance generators. The strong generality of DACE is validated across three real-world binary optimization problems: the complementary influence maximization problem (CIMP), the compiler arguments optimization problem (CAOP), and the contamination control problem (CCP). Given only a small set of training instances from these classes, DACE, without requiring any domain knowledge, constructs PAPs with better generalization performance than existing approaches on all three classes, despite their use of domain-specific instance generators.

Abstract: Data encoding is a fundamental step in emerging computing paradigms, particularly in stochastic computing (SC) and hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where it plays a crucial role in determining the overall system performance and hardware cost efficiency. This study presents an advanced encoding strategy that leverages a hardware-friendly class of low-discrepancy (LD) sequences, specifically powers-of-2 bases of Van der Corput (VDC) sequences (VDC-2^n), as sources for random number generation. Our approach significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of SC and HDC systems by addressing challenges associated with randomness. By employing LD sequences, we improve correlation properties and reduce hardware complexity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and energy savings for SC and HDC systems. Our solution provides a robust framework for integrating SC and HDC in resource-constrained environments, paving the way for efficient and scalable AI implementations.

                arXiv:2501.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from storing millions and billions of weights in memory post-training, making challenging memory-intensive models to deploy on embedded devices. The weight-sharing technique is one of the popular compression approaches that use fewer weight values and share across specific connections in the network. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based compression framework independent of neural network architecture, dimension, task, and dataset. We use uniformly sized bins to quantize network weights into a single codebook (lookup table) for efficient weight representation. Using MOEA, we search for Pareto optimal $k$ bins by optimizing two objectives. Then, we apply the iterative merge technique to non-dominated Pareto frontier solutions by combining neighboring bins without degrading performance to decrease the number of bins and increase the compression ratio. Our approach is model- and layer-independent, meaning the weights are mixed in the clusters from any layer, and the uniform quantization method used in this work has $O(N)$ complexity instead of non-uniform quantization methods such as k-means with $O(Nkt)$ complexity. In addition, we use the center of clusters as the shared weight values instead of retraining shared weights, which is computationally expensive. The advantage of using evolutionary multi-objective optimization is that it can obtain non-dominated Pareto frontier solutions with respect to performance and shared weights. The experimental results show that we can reduce the neural network memory by $13.72 \sim14.98 \times$ on CIFAR-10, $11.61 \sim 12.99\times$ on CIFAR-100, and $7.44 \sim 8.58\times$ on ImageNet showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed deep neural network compression framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03113">Balancing Efficiency and Expressiveness: Subgraph GNNs with Walk-Based Centrality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.03113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an expressive and efficient approach that combines the strengths of two prominent extensions of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Subgraph GNNs and Structural Encodings (SEs). Our approach leverages walk-based centrality measures, both as a powerful form of SE and also as a subgraph selection strategy for Subgraph GNNs. By drawing a connection to perturbation analysis, we highlight the effectiveness of centrality-based sampling, and show it significantly reduces the computational burden associated with Subgraph GNNs. Further, we combine our efficient Subgraph GNN with SEs derived from the calculated centrality and demonstrate this hybrid approach, dubbed HyMN, gains in discriminative power. HyMN effectively addresses the expressiveness limitations of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) while mitigating the computational costs of Subgraph GNNs. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks, we show it outperforms other subgraph sampling approaches while being competitive with full-bag Subgraph GNNs and other state-of-the-art approaches with a notably reduced runtime.

                arXiv:2501.03176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm that eliminates the need for backpropagation by training each layer separately. Unlike backpropagation, FF avoids backward gradients and can be more modular and memory efficient, making it appealing for large networks. We extend FF to modern convolutional architectures, such as MobileNetV3 and ResNet18, by introducing a new way to compute losses for convolutional layers. Experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to standard backpropagation. Furthermore, when we divide the network into blocks, such as the residual blocks in ResNet, and apply backpropagation only within each block, but not across blocks, our hybrid design tends to outperform backpropagation baselines while maintaining a similar training speed. Finally, we present experiments on small datasets and transfer learning that confirm the adaptability of our method.

                arXiv:2105.11233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain, has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the neural network model, in combination with its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in digital computers is intrinsically energy hungry, with energy consumption becoming prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing system. The learning process in these material systems, realized, e.g., by artificial evolution, equilibrium propagation or surrogate modelling, is a complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet efficient and accurate gradient extraction method, based on the principle of homodyne detection, for performing gradient descent on a loss function directly in a physical system without the need of an analytical description. By perturbing the parameters that need to be optimized using sinusoidal waveforms with distinct frequencies, we effectively obtain the gradient information in a highly robust and scalable manner. We illustrate the method in dopant network processing units, but argue that it is applicable in a wide range of physical systems. Homodyne gradient extraction can in principle be fully implemented in materia, facilitating the development of autonomously learning material systems.

                arXiv:2312.07419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have proven the effectiveness of k-nearest-neighbor machine translation(a.k.a kNN-MT) approaches to produce remarkable improvement in cross-domain translations. However, these models suffer from heavy retrieve overhead on the entire datastore when decoding each token. We observe that during the decoding phase, about 67% to 84% of tokens are unvaried after searching over the corpus datastore, which means most of the tokens cause futile retrievals and introduce unnecessary computational costs by initiating k-nearest-neighbor searches. We consider this phenomenon is explainable in linguistics and propose a simple yet effective multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to predict whether a token should be translated jointly by the neural machine translation model and probabilities produced by the kNN or just by the neural model. The results show that our method succeeds in reducing redundant retrieval operations and significantly reduces the overhead of kNN retrievals by up to 53% at the expense of a slight decline in translation quality. Moreover, our method could work together with all existing kNN-MT systems.

                arXiv:2403.08352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is arguably the most important regularization technique commonly used to improve generalization performance of machine learning models. It primarily involves the application of appropriate data transformation operations to create new data samples with desired properties. Despite its effectiveness, the process is often challenging because of the time-consuming trial and error procedures for creating and testing different candidate augmentations and their hyperparameters manually. Automated data augmentation methods aim to automate the process. State-of-the-art approaches typically rely on automated machine learning (AutoML) principles. This work presents a comprehensive survey of AutoML-based data augmentation techniques. We discuss various approaches for accomplishing data augmentation with AutoML, including data manipulation, data integration and data synthesis techniques. We present extensive discussion of techniques for realizing each of the major subtasks of the data augmentation process: search space design, hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation. Finally, we carried out an extensive comparison and analysis of the performance of automated data augmentation techniques and state-of-the-art methods based on classical augmentation approaches. The results show that AutoML methods for data augmentation currently outperform state-of-the-art techniques based on conventional approaches.

                arXiv:2403.17328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98992">The phytoplasma SAP54 effector acts as a molecular matchmaker for leafhopper vectors by targeting plant MADS-box factor SVP</a></h4>

              
                Obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes - where genetic information of one organism is manifested as traits in another - remain largely unclear. This study explores the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves and the leaf-like flowers were not required. Here, we made the surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, this phytoplasma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to the males. Critically, the host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase (SVP) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed <i>svp null</i> mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction - integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Based on previous data reporting the status of health professionals&amp;amp;rsquo; training about sleep clinical psychophysiology, insomnia, and its treatment in the US and Canada, this paper aims at providing a snapshot of the Italian situation, considering health professionals qualified to offer cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Adding information on different countries is important, as national health systems differ significantly, and distinct evidence-based pathways for change may be proposed. Methods: Two hundred and thirteen CBT professionals (180 females; 33 males) answered a 5 min survey about their training and experience in recognizing and treating behavioral sleep disorders in their practice. The questionnaire was diffused through the mailing list of the Italian Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy Society (Societ&amp;amp;agrave; Italiana di Terapia Comportamentale e Cognitiva, SITCC) throughout December 2023 and January 2024. Results: A total of 213 participants completed the survey. Only a minor proportion of respondents (37.1%) reported having received training for diagnosis and treatment of insomnia or other behavioral sleep disorders. Familiarity with psychological therapeutics for sleep was mainly associated with knowledge of sleep hygiene rules, relaxation, and mindfulness techniques, but not with core CBT strategies for insomnia (i.e., sleep restriction and stimulus control) and sleep regulation. The less familiar therapeutics were those for pediatric insomnia. Conclusions: The results of this study highlight scarce knowledge and consideration of sleep problems in CBT practice in Italy. As insomnia is prevalent, an independent mental disorder, and a predictor for mental and somatic comorbid conditions, these findings underscore an urgency to enlarge and strengthen CBT professionals&amp;amp;rsquo; training on sleep psychophysiology, sleep clinical psychology, insomnia, behavioral sleep problems, and their treatment.</p>

                <p>Cuprizone (CPZ) is a widely used toxin that induces demyelinating diseases in animal models, producing multiple sclerosis (MS)-like pathology in rodents. CPZ is one of the few toxins that triggers demyelination and subsequent remyelination following the cessation of its application. This study examines the functional consequences of CPZ-induced demyelination and the subsequent recovery of neural communication within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), with a particular focus on interhemispheric connectivity via the corpus callosum (CC). By employing wide-field, high-speed, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we were able to provide real-time mapping of neural activity in the ACC of CPZ-fed mice. Although we could not record physiological signals from the CC, the results demonstrated a notable impairment in interhemispheric connections within the ACC via the CC, with the most pronounced loss observed in a specific coronal slice among a series of slices examined. Notably, the latency of neural signal propagation remained largely unaltered despite connectivity loss, indicating that demyelination affects the extent, rather than the temporal dynamics, of neural communication. It is noteworthy that while functional connectivity appeared to recover fully after the cessation of CPZ, histological analysis revealed only partial recovery of myelination, indicating a discrepancy between functional and structural recovery. These findings enhance our understanding of how demyelination affects the ACC's role in orchestrating neural activity, particularly in light of the slice-specific nature of interhemispheric communication impairments. These findings offer new insights into MS pathology, particularly regarding the role of the CC in interhemispheric communication and potential therapeutic strategies.</p>

                Background This study sought to quantify the levels of saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins, as well as the IC50 values of avocado seed and aloe vera extracts. Methods The materials included in the investigation consisted of 70% ethanol extracts derived from avocado seeds and Aloe vera. Both samples underwent quantitative phytochemical analyses to ascertain total component content and an antioxidant activity assessment utilizing the 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) technique to evaluate % inhibition and IC50 values. The absorbance of the samples was quantified using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer, which facilitated the calculation of total chemical content and antioxidant activity. Results The avocado seed extract comprised saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins at concentrations of 0.21%, 0.0232%, 19.94%, and 10.66%, respectively, with an IC50 value of 135 μg/mL. The aloe vera extract comprises saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins at concentrations of 0.74%, 0.0313%, 0.99%, and 4.68%, respectively, with an IC50 value of 4614 μg/mL. Conclusion Avocado seeds exhibited elevated levels of flavonoids and tannins, while aloe vera demonstrated increased concentrations of alkaloids and saponins. In the antioxidant activity assessment, avocado seeds demonstrated superior antioxidant efficacy.

                Objective To analyze the effectiveness of various techniques available for printing, finishing and polishing of 3D printed prosthesis. Methods The articles were selected from electronic databases including PubMed and Scopus. Recently, lot of advancements have been observed in the field of 3D printing in dentistry. Results Numerous studies were found explaining the factors affecting the surface roughness such as printing speed, direction, layer thickness, post curing, etc., and the significance in achieving a smooth surface finish of a 3D printed prosthesis. The methods employed to achieve this range, similar to conventional and chairside polishing, are to use advanced coating materials such as light cured glazes to nanoparticles. Conclusion 3D printing is being used in day-to-day practice and the prosthesis must be aesthetic looking to satisfy the patients’ expectations. There is a lack of data supporting any one polishing method for the prosthesis. There is a need for further research on the existing techniques and newer advancements yielding aesthetic prostheses with an optimal surface finish.

                Background In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, intradialytic hypertension and intradialytic hypotension are the common complications. The study aimed to collect and assess intradialytic Blood Pressure (BP) complications and their association with BP medications. Methods This was a prospective observational study, conducted at the hemodialysis center in a teaching hospital in the UAE, that provide a specialist’s care for the patients receiving ongoing hemodialysis. Patient demographics, medications used, lab data and the peridialytic BP (pre-, intra-, and post-) dialytic BP were collected for a period of 6 months. SPSS Version 29, Armonk, NY was used for statistical analysis. Pearson Chi-square test and Fischer’s Exact test were used to compare the association between categorical variables to intradialytic hypertension and hypotension. Binary logistic regression was used to find the effect of predictive variables to the presence or absence of intradialytic complications. Results Blood pressure data was collected from 47 hemodialysis patients for a total of 2616 hemodialysis sessions during the 6 months study period. Non-dialysable antihypertensives were predominantly used. Beta-blockers (68%) and calcium channel blockers (66%) were the commonly used drug classes. Intradialytic hypertension events were diagnosed in 49 (1.9%) hemodialysis sessions and intradialytic hypotension was diagnosed in 23 (0.9%) hemodialysis sessions. Chi-square test showed association of antihypertensive medication use to the occurrence of intradialytic hypertension; especially ARBs, and alpha-1 blockers. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers use were associated with decreased number of intradialytic hypertension events (p-value <0.05). Regression showed broad confidence intervals. On the other hand, antihypertensive medication use showed no association with intradialytic hypotension. Conclusions Even though antihypertensive medications showed varying occurance of intradialytic hypertension, the results are inconclusive due to large confidence intervals that could be due to the presence of colliniarity between the variables. Future studies are required in larger populations.

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment is a strategy commonly employed by indoor/vertical farms to improve crop yields. Artificially elevating the CO2 concentration within an enclosed growth space results in improved photosynthetic efficiency, and therefore improved crop growth rates and flavor profiles. Alcohol fermentation provides a steady stream of CO2 that is typically emitted to the atmosphere as a by-product. To evaluate the feasibility of using fermentation off-gas as a source for indoor CO2 enrichment, spinach plants were randomly assigned to 2 growth chambers. The control chamber was maintained under ambient CO2 concentrations, while the treatment chamber was piped onto a flow control system capable of delivering CO2 from a beer fermentation vessel to the growth chamber to maintain CO2 levels at a setpoint of 1200 parts-per-million (ppm). CO2 flow was diverted to the growth chamber when levels were below 1200 ppm, and to an external exhaust when chamber levels were above 1200 ppm, with the flow control device measuring internal CO2 concentrations and responding accordingly every 6 seconds. Standardized batches of beer were used to replenish the fermentation source to maintain continuous fermentation and CO2 off-gas production. The CO2 flow control device successfully maintained a strong oscillation of CO2 around the 1200 ppm setpoint within the treatment growth chamber for the duration of the 50-day growth period. Spinach plants grown in the treatment chamber produced significantly more fresh biomass (5.456 g vs. 2.888 g), dry biomass (0.5711 g vs. 0.271 g), and significantly longer leaf lengths (231.0 mm vs. 159.9 mm) than their control chamber counterparts, respectively. This represents an 89% increase in fresh spinach crop yield within a controlled indoor growth environment.

                Background The successful execution of Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) policies is crucial for developing a strong Regional Innovation System (RIS) in Ethiopia, which is essential for promoting economic growth and enhancing competitiveness. Methods This study utilized a document review approach to critically analyze Ethiopia’s current STI policies and legal frameworks within the context of the Regional Innovation System (RIS). Results The findings indicate potential solutions to strengthen Ethiopia’s regional innovation system, including increasing funding for research and development (R&D), fostering better collaboration between universities and industries, and cultivating an entrepreneurial culture. The analysis reveals that Ethiopia possesses significant opportunities to enhance its STI capabilities due to its strategic location, abundant natural resources, and growing governmental and non-governmental support. However, it also highlights critical implementation gaps in STI policies, such as inadequate infrastructure, poor coordination among stakeholders, weak university-industry partnerships, and limited R&D investment. Conclusion Ethiopia’s STI policies and legal frameworks are essential for driving economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness by fostering an environment that encourages collaboration and technology transfer. Nevertheless, the country faces challenges in effectively implementing these comprehensive policies due to existing barriers like policy gaps and insufficient institutional support. To strengthen its National Innovation System and promote sustainable economic development, Ethiopia must assess current opportunities, address these obstacles, and explore alternative policies that can enhance its STI capabilities.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of specific covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a tertiary care hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

                Invasive sino-orbital fungal infection is an uncommon, yet severe condition that is rare among immunocompetent individuals, with most cases typically occurring in those with compromised immune systems. In this study, we report the case of a 5-month-old immunocompetent infant who exhibited persistent dacryocystitis despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, the patient developed ethmoiditis, orbital subperiosteal abscess, and ulceration of the hard palate. Mycological and histological samples were collected from the affected area. The combination of microscopy and PCR amplification allowed for the identification of the fungal agent Candida tropicalis. The patient underwent sinus surgery and surgical debridement, along with antifungal therapy. The treatment was successful, and the follow-up was uneventful for up to 6 months. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of invasive sino-orbital candidiasis in an immunocompetent infant with dacryocystitis as the entry point. This study explores the clinical features, management approaches, and outcomes of this potentially fatal disease.

                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media and web-based platforms were widely used to promote medicinal substances. To assess community perspectives on drug promotions on social media, we conducted qualitative research using three workshops. The workshops aimed to highlight the public understanding of drug advertising focusing on community perceptions of social media drug promotions, their risks and benefits. Discussions were conducted on the importance of adhering to national drug regulation policies and the World Health Organisation ethical criteria for promotion, advertisement, and publicity of medicines. Methods Participants for the workshops were purposively sampled from local community youth groups and healthcare facilities. Two workshops included ten young adults aged 18-35, while the third workshop involved three healthcare professionals and one traditional healer. Results The study participants’ highlighted the value of honesty and trust in the drug promotions. Gaps in the ethical conduct of advertising were observed and concerns were raised about the reliability of social media information and the omission of valuable details on the drug advertisements. Conclusion Individuals have a right to informed choices that ensure their health safety. This study has highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in pharmaceutical and complementary medicine marketing on social media. Collaboration is needed between regulatory bodies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers and community members, to make sure that drug advertising upholds ethical standards and public health.

                Background This article introduces the concept of fuzzy pseudo-TM subalgebra (FPTMSA) of pseudo-TM algebra (PTMA). This study explores the relationship between FPTMSAs and their level sets within the context of PTMA. It further investigates the homomorphic behavior of FPTMSAs under various algebraic operations, thereby providing a foundation for further exploration of the algebraic structure of fuzzy pseudo-ideals within PTMAs. Methods The concept of level sets for FPTMSAs is defined and examined, highlighting their role in characterizing these subalgebras within a PTMA. This study explores the behavior of FPTMSAs under homomorphisms, considering both homomorphic images (HI) and inverse images (II) of FPTMSAs in PTMAs. In addition, the composition of epimorphic images and inverse images of FPTMSAs is discussed. The study also considers the properties of FPTMSAs under Cartesian products (CPs), demonstrating that the Cartesian product of two FPTMSAs remains an FPTMSA. Results This study establishes several key properties of FPTMSAs in PTMAs, particularly focusing on their behavior under homomorphisms, epimorphisms, and Cartesian products. Specifically, this study demonstrates that the Cartesian product of two FPTMSAs results in another FPTMSA. Additionally, this study examines the relationships between the homomorphic image and inverse image of FPTMSAs and presents further algebraic results related to these concepts. Conclusions The article concludes by highlighting the significant role of FPTMSAs in the structure of PTMAs, particularly in their interaction with homomorphisms, epimorphisms, and Cartesian products. The results suggest that the FPTMSAs are robust under various algebraic operations. Future work will extend these concepts to intuitionistic fuzzy pseudo-TM subalgebra within PTMAs with the goal of uncovering new algebraic insights and results.

                Background The regulation of receptor expression is crucial for fine-tuned signal transduction. Notch signaling is a key signaling pathway involved in retinal development. Although the involvement of this signaling pathway in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells has been documented, less is known about its involvement in earlier stages of retinal progenitor cell differentiation. We aimed to clarify the timing of Notch receptor expression in undifferentiated retinal progenitor cells and elucidate the possible involvement of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of Notch receptor expressions. Methods We re-analyzed publicly available human fetal retina single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (GSE183684) using Seurat/Signac pipelines. Results On days 59, 74, and 78, we observed NOTCH1 mRNA expression in early retinal progenitor cells, which diminished at later stages of differentiation. Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin remodeling in part of the NOTCH1 locus was accompanied by transitions in its mRNA expression. Importantly, chromatin accessibility in the region upstream of NOTCH1 depended on the differentiated cell types. Conclusions These results suggest that chromatin remodeling may be involved in the differential expression of NOTCH1, although another type of Notch mRNA expression regulation may exist.

                Abstract* Isthmocele, or uterine niche, is a defect in the anterior wall of the uterine isthmus, often following a cesarean section. It can lead to complications such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, and pregnancy risks. This case report describes a successful live pregnancy after isthmocele repair and embryo transfer. A 28-year-old woman (para 1, living 1) presented with prolonged periods, dysmenorrhea, and secondary infertility. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a large isthmocele and intra-cavitary uterine fluid. The patient underwent ovarian stimulation using an antagonist protocol twice, retrieving oocytes and freezing nine embryos. She later had laparoscopic isthmocele repair at another facility. Upon returning for frozen embryo transfer, irregular bleeding and dysmenorrhea persisted. Repeat ultrasound showed a small cesarean defect (4x3 mm), fluid in the endometrial cavity, and hyperechoic endometrium. Fluid aspiration was performed, followed by the transfer of a grade AA embryo. Although conception occurred, it was a biochemical pregnancy with a βhCG level of 12.43 mIU/ml. Due to a persistent scar defect and endometrial cavity fluid, the patient underwent hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy, and minimal resection of the defect. Three months later, a frozen embryo transfer of a grade AB embryo was performed. This resulted in a viable pregnancy, confirmed by a βhCG level of 364 mIU/ml. The pregnancy progressed without complications, and at 36+3 weeks, the patient delivered a healthy baby via planned cesarean section. This case underscores the importance of diagnosing and managing isthmocele in infertility patients. Surgical repair can restore normal uterine anatomy and enhance the success of assisted reproductive techniques like embryo transfer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-29/v1?src=rss">An Assessment of Professional Burnout within Hospital Pharmacists: A Case Study of Abu Dhabi [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Burnout is a syndrome resulting from unsuccessful stress management in the workplace, and is characterized by three dimensions: energy depletion, reduced professional efficacy, and feelings of negativism. Background Studies have confirmed that burnout causes deterioration in teamwork and job satisfaction and negatively impacts and compromises services. Many studies have examined the impact of burnout on health. Aim This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the rate of burnout among hospital pharmacists working in Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. Method The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey for Medical Professionals was used to assess burnout. The survey measured three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal achievement. In addition, pharmacists were asked questions regarding their demographic years of practice and qualifications. The surveys were distributed to inpatients, discharge/emergency, outpatients, and clinical pharmacies. The data were collected over two weeks and analyzed. Results Sixty-eight of the 90 pharmacists participated in this study. The response rate was 75.5%. Seventeen pharmacists were considered to have high burnout as they had both high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization scores. Two pharmacists were considered to have moderate burnout, as they had moderate emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal achievement. Only 17 pharmacists reported a low level of burnout. Conclusion The study revealed that 25% of the pharmacists had high burnout rates. Although statistically insignificant (P > 0.05), all pharmacists with high burnout were female and working in different pharmacy settings. Moreover, an additional 25% experienced low burnout, and 3% had moderate burnout levels. The remaining items were difficult to classify because they did not fit the Maslach definition of high, moderate, or low burnout. Further investigation is needed to identify the levels and causes of burnout among Sheikh Khalifa Medical City pharmacists.

                Background Telekyanmar (Telehealth), one of the telemedicine services in Myanmar, was initiated a few months after the military coup and amidst the onset of the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The program aims to address the urgent requirement for accessible medical services for Myanmar’s vulnerable population. Given the critical importance of both clients’ and providers’ satisfaction in the success of telemedicine services, this study aims to evaluate clients’ and providers’ satisfaction regarding the telehealth services offered by the Telekyanmar project in Myanmar. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2023 to September 2023 by utilizing a quantitative research method. Data were collected online through a structured questionnaire. The clients who have received health care services and clinicians who are working at Telekyanmar clinics during the study period were included in the study. Data management and analysis were done by using R software (https://www.r-project.org/). Results A total of 306 clients and 79 clinicians were included in the assessment. The mean age of the clients and clinicians were 33.2±13.6 years and 35.6±6.8 years, respectively. Over 85% of the clients and 58.2% of clinicians were residing inside the country. Clients’ satisfaction on various aspects of Telekyanmar services were assessed, with the question regarding “health staff respect for privacy” receiving the highest proportion of “good” and “excellent” responses at 96.1%. Regarding overall treatment experience, 96.7% of clients reported being “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the Telekyanmar services. Overall satisfaction was reported by 88.6% of clinicians. Specifically, over 87% of clinicians reported their satisfaction on “communication with patients”, 79.7% satisfied with “quality of clinical consultation”, and 78.5% satisfied with “treatment prescription”. Conclusions The findings indicated that majority of the clients and clinicians expressed their satisfaction with the Telekyanmar services, which was established to address the healthcare needs of people in Myanmar after the military coup.

                <p>by Chuanmei Bi, Yong Shi, Junfeng Xia, Zhen Liang, Zhiqiang Wu, Kai Xu, Na Cheng</p>

Synonymous mutations, once considered neutral, are now understood to have significant implications for a variety of diseases, particularly cancer. It is indispensable to identify these driver synonymous mutations in human cancers, yet current methods are constrained by data limitations. In this study, we initially investigate the impact of sequence-based features, including DNA shape, physicochemical properties and one-hot encoding of nucleotides, and deep learning-derived features from pre-trained chemical molecule language models based on BERT. Subsequently, we propose EPEL, an effect predictor for synonymous mutations employing ensemble learning. EPEL combines five tree-based models and optimizes feature selection to enhance predictive accuracy. Notably, the incorporation of DNA shape features and deep learning-derived features from chemical molecule represents a pioneering effect in assessing the impact of synonymous mutations in cancer. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, EPEL demonstrates superior performance on independent test datasets. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a significant correlation between effect scores and patient outcomes across various cancer types. Interestingly, while deep learning methods have shown promise in other fields, their DNA sequence representations do not significantly enhance the identification of driver synonymous mutations in this study. Overall, we anticipate that EPEL will facilitate researchers to more precisely target driver synonymous mutations. EPEL is designed with flexibility, allowing users to retrain the prediction model and generate effect scores for synonymous mutations in human cancers. A user-friendly web server for EPEL is available at http://ahmu.EPEL.bio/.

T cells recognize a wide range of pathogens using surface receptors that interact directly with peptides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) encoded by the HLA loci in humans. Understanding the association between T cell receptors (TCR) and HLA alleles is an important step towards predicting TCR-antigen specificity from sequences. Here we analyze the TCR alpha and beta repertoires of large cohorts of HLA-typed donors to systematically infer such associations, by looking for overrepresentation of TCRs in individuals with a common allele.TCRs, associated with a specific HLA allele, exhibit sequence similarities that suggest prior antigen exposure. Immune repertoire sequencing has produced large numbers of datasets, however the HLA type of the corresponding donors is rarely available. Using our TCR-HLA associations, we trained a computational model to predict the HLA type of individuals from their TCR repertoire alone. We propose an iterative procedure to refine this model by using data from large cohorts of untyped individuals, by recursively typing them using the model itself. The resulting model shows good predictive performance, even for relatively rare HLA alleles.

                <p>by Francisco Páscoa dos Santos, Paul F. M. J. Verschure</p>

Although the primary function of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) homeostasis is the maintenance of mean firing rates, the conjugation of multiple homeostatic mechanisms is thought to be pivotal to ensuring edge-of-bifurcation dynamics in cortical circuits. However, computational studies on E-I homeostasis have focused solely on the plasticity of inhibition, neglecting the impact of different modes of E-I homeostasis on cortical dynamics. Therefore, we investigate how the diverse mechanisms of E-I homeostasis employed by cortical networks shape oscillations and edge-of-bifurcation dynamics. Using the Wilson-Cowan model, we explore how distinct modes of E-I homeostasis maintain stable firing rates in models with varying levels of input and how it affects circuit dynamics. Our results confirm that E-I homeostasis can be leveraged to control edge-of-bifurcation dynamics and that some modes of homeostasis maintain mean firing rates under higher levels of input by modulating the distance to the bifurcation. Additionally, relying on multiple modes of homeostasis ensures stable activity while keeping oscillation frequencies within a physiological range. Our findings tie relevant features of cortical networks, such as E-I balance, the generation of gamma oscillations, and edge-of-bifurcation dynamics, under the framework of firing-rate homeostasis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity in the distance to the bifurcation found across cortical areas. In addition, we reveal the functional benefits of relying upon different homeostatic mechanisms, providing a robust method to regulate network dynamics with minimal perturbation to the generation of gamma rhythms and explaining the correlation between inhibition and gamma frequencies found in cortical networks.

                <p>by Alice Bruel, Lina Bacha, Emma Boehly, Constance De Trogoff, Luca Represa, Gregoire Courtine, Auke Ijspeert</p>

Humans can perform movements in various physical environments and positions (corresponding to different experienced gravity), requiring the interaction of the musculoskeletal system, the neural system and the external environment. The neural system is itself comprised of several interactive components, from the brain mainly conducting motor planning, to the spinal cord (SC) implementing its own motor control centres through sensory reflexes. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether similar movements in various environmental dynamics necessitate adapting modulation at the brain level, correcting modulation at the spinal level, or both. Here, we addressed this question by focusing on upper limb motor control in various gravity conditions (magnitudes and directions) and using neuromusculoskeletal simulation tools. We integrated supraspinal sinusoidal commands with a modular SC model controlling a musculoskeletal model to reproduce various recorded arm trajectories (kinematics and EMGs) in different contexts. We first studied the role of various spinal pathways (such as stretch reflexes) in movement smoothness and robustness against perturbation. Then, we optimised the supraspinal sinusoidal commands without and with a fixed SC model including stretch reflexes to reproduce a target trajectory in various gravity conditions. Inversely, we fixed the supraspinal commands and optimised the spinal synaptic strengths in the different environments. In the first optimisation context, the presence of SC resulted in easier optimisation of the supraspinal commands (faster convergence, better performance). The main supraspinal commands modulation was found in the flexor sinusoid’s amplitude, resp. frequency, to adapt to different gravity magnitudes, resp. directions. In the second optimisation context, the modulation of the spinal synaptic strengths also remarkably reproduced the target trajectory for the mild gravity changes. We highlighted that both strategies of modulation of the supraspinal commands or spinal stretch pathways can be used to control movements in different gravity environments. Our results thus support that the SC can assist gravity compensation.

Sumoylation is a posttranslational modification essential for multiple cellular functions in eukaryotes. ULP-2 is a conserved SUMO protease required for embryonic development in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Here, we revealed that ULP-2 controls germline development by regulating the PHD-SET domain protein, SET-26. Specifically, loss of ULP-2 results in sterility and a progressive elevation of global protein sumoylation. In the germline of <i>ulp-2</i> null mutant, meiosis is arrested at the diplotene stage and the cells in the proximal germline acquire a somatic fate. Germline RNAseq analysis revealed the down-regulation of numerous germline genes in <i>ulp-2</i> mutants, whereas somatic gene expression is up-regulated. To determine the key factors that are regulated by ULP-2, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified the histone methylation reader, SET-26 as a ULP-2 interacting protein. Loss of SET-26 enhanced the sterility of <i>ulp-2</i> mutant animals. Consistently, SET-26 is sumoylated and its sumoylation levels are regulated by ULP-2. Moreover, we detected a reduction in H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) histone levels bound to SET-26 in the <i>ulp-2</i> mutant background suggesting a dependence of this histone reader on balanced sumoylation. Finally, a comparative proteomics screen between WT and <i>ulp-2</i> loss of activity identified the predicted methyltransferase SET-27 as a ULP-2-dependent SET-26-associated protein. SET-27 knockout genetically interacts with ULP-2 in the germline, but not with SET-26. Taken together, we revealed a SUMO protease/H3K4me3 histone reader axis which is required for the maintenance and regulation of germline development.

Throughout the animal kingdom, several members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family act as proneural genes during early steps of nervous system development. Roles of bHLH genes in specifying terminal differentiation of postmitotic neurons have been less extensively studied. We analyze here the function of 5 <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> bHLH genes, falling into 3 phylogenetically conserved subfamilies, which are continuously expressed in a very small number of postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. We show (a) that 2 orthologs of the vertebrate <i>bHLHe22/e23</i> genes, called <i>hlh-17</i> and <i>hlh-32</i>, function redundantly to specify the identity of a single head interneuron class (AUA), as well as an individual motor neuron (VB2); (b) that the <i>PTF1a</i> ortholog <i>hlh-13</i> acts as a terminal selector to control terminal differentiation and function of the sole octopaminergic neuron class in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, RIC; and (c) that the <i>NHLH1/2</i> ortholog <i>hlh-15</i> controls terminal differentiation and function of the peptidergic AVK head interneuron class, a known neuropeptidergic signaling hub in the animal. Strikingly, through null mutant analysis and cell-specific rescue experiments, we find that loss of <i>hlh-15/NHLH</i> in the peptidergic AVK neurons and the resulting abrogation of neuropeptide secretion from these neurons causes a substantially extended lifespan of the animal, which we propose to be akin to hypothalamic control of lifespan in vertebrates. Our functional analysis reveals themes of bHLH gene function during terminal differentiation that are complementary to the earlier lineage specification roles of other bHLH family members. However, such late functions are much more sparsely employed by members of the bHLH transcription factor family, compared to the function of the much more broadly employed homeodomain transcription factor family.

The core nucleation protein, γTubulin (γTub), is localized to dendrite branch points in <i>Drosophila</i> sensory neurons by Wnt receptors and scaffolding proteins on endosomes. However, whether Wnt ligands are important is unknown. We found that Wnt secretion from epithelial cells was required for γTub localization to dendrite branch points. Using RNAi and mutant approaches, we demonstrated that Wnt4 and wntD both position γTub. Moreover, injury-induced increases in neuronal microtubule dynamics required Wnt secretion from epithelial cells. Overexpression of Wnts in epithelial cells increased microtubule dynamics to the same extent as axon injury indicating surrounding cells have an instructive role in neuronal nucleation. To determine how Wnt ligands concentrate microtubule nucleation at dendrite branch points, we tested whether endocytosis is restricted to specific regions of dendrites. Markers of clathrin-mediated endocytosis localized to puncta at branch points. Behavior of these puncta was sensitive to inhibition of endocytosis suggesting they represented endocytic sites. In addition to previously described colocalization of Wnt receptors and scaffolds with Rab5 endosomes, we identified a separate set of Wnt signaling puncta that colocalized with clathrin in dendrites. Moreover, γTub and Wnt scaffolding protein recruitment to branch points was reduced by clathrin RNAi, and injury-induced up-regulation of microtubule dynamics was sensitive to clathrin reduction. We propose that the localization of Wnt endocytic sites to dendrite branch points results in the local generation of microtubule nucleating endosomes.

The peritrophic matrix (PM) acts as a physical barrier that influences the vector competence of mosquitoes. We have previously shown that gut microbiota promotes PM formation in <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identify that the cell wall components of gut commensal bacteria contribute to PM formation. Oral administration of primary cell wall components from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, such as diaminopimelic acid-peptidoglycan (DAP-PGN), lysine-peptidoglycan (Lys-PGN), and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), to mosquitoes, after depleting their gut microbiota with antibiotics, restores the down-regulated expression of the <i>peritrophin1</i> (<i>Per1</i>) gene, which encodes a structural protein of the PM. Moreover, this administration rescues PM formation upon blood ingestion. PGN and LPS are well-known ligands of innate immune signaling pathways in animals. In mosquitoes, the Toll and IMD (immune deficiency) pathways are the 2 major innate immune signaling pathways. We next knocked down the expression of 2 receptors, <i>Pgrp-s1</i> and <i>Pgrp-lc</i>, as well as 2 transcription factors, <i>Rel1</i> and <i>Rel2</i>, which are involved in the Toll and IMD pathways, respectively. Double knockdown of <i>Pgrp-s1</i> and <i>Pgrp-lc</i>, or <i>Rel1</i> and <i>Rel2</i>, compromised <i>Per1</i> expression. Additionally, through dual-luciferase assays and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we identified a 15-bp binding motif (ATAGACACGAGCACC) for Rel1 and Rel2 in the <i>Per1</i> promoter region. To further explore the role of individual Toll and IMD pathways in the regulation of <i>Per1</i> expression, we specifically inhibited the activity of each pathway. While inhibition of the Toll pathway by knocking down <i>Pgrp-s1</i> or <i>Rel1</i> did not affect <i>Per1</i> expression, knockdown of <i>Pgrp-lc</i> or <i>Rel2</i> in the IMD pathway significantly down-regulated <i>Per1</i> expression. These findings suggest that the IMD pathway plays a major role in regulating <i>Per1</i> expression in <i>An</i>. <i>stephensi</i>. In summary, our study uncovers a novel role for bacterial cell wall components in regulating PM formation through activation of mosquito immune signaling pathways.

                <p>by Marie Raynaud, Paola Sanna, Julien Joseph, Julie Clément, Yukiko Imai, Jean-Jacques Lareyre, Audrey Laurent, Nicolas Galtier, Frédéric Baudat, Laurent Duret, Pierre-Alexandre Gagnaire, Bernard de Massy</p>

In many eukaryotes, meiotic recombination occurs preferentially at discrete sites, called recombination hotspots. In various lineages, recombination hotspots are located in regions with promoter-like features and are evolutionarily stable. Conversely, in some mammals, hotspots are driven by PRDM9 that targets recombination away from promoters. Paradoxically, PRDM9 induces the self-destruction of its targets and this triggers an ultra-fast evolution of mammalian hotspots. PRDM9 is ancestral to all animals, suggesting a critical importance for the meiotic program, but has been lost in many lineages with surprisingly little effect on meiosis success. However, it is unclear whether the function of PRDM9 described in mammals is shared by other species. To investigate this, we analyzed the recombination landscape of several salmonids, the genome of which harbors one full-length PRDM9 and several truncated paralogs. We identified recombination initiation sites in <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i> by mapping meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We found that DSBs clustered at hotspots positioned away from promoters, enriched for the H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and the location of which depended on the genotype of full-length <i>Prdm9</i>. We observed a high level of polymorphism in the zinc finger domain of full-length <i>Prdm9</i>, indicating diversification driven by positive selection. Moreover, population-scaled recombination maps in <i>O</i>. <i>mykiss</i>, <i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i> and <i>Salmo salar</i> revealed a rapid turnover of recombination hotspots caused by PRDM9 target motif erosion. Our results imply that PRDM9 function is conserved across vertebrates and that the peculiar evolutionary runaway caused by PRDM9 has been active for several hundred million years.

                <p>by Mallory M. Rice, Shersingh Joseph Tumber-Dávila, Marcella D. Baiz, Susan J. Cheng, Kathy Darragh, Cesar O. Estien, J. W. Hammond, Danielle D. Ignace, Lily Khadempour, Kaitlyn M. Gaynor, Kirby L. Mills, Justine A. Smith, Alex C. Moore</p>

The discipline of ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) has long grappled with issues of inclusivity and representation, particularly for individuals with systematically excluded and marginalized backgrounds or identities. For example, significant representation disparities still persist that disproportionately affect women and gender minorities; Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC); individuals with disabilities; and people who are LGBTQIA+. Recent calls for action have urged the EEB community to directly address issues of representation, inclusion, justice, and equity. One aspect of this endeavor is to examine the use of EEB’s discipline-specific language and terminology, which may have the potential to perpetuate unjust systems and isolate marginalized groups. Through a mixed-methods survey, we examined how members of the EEB community perceive discipline-specific terminology, including how they believe it can be harmful and which terms they identified as problematic. Of the 795 survey respondents, we found that almost half agreed that there are harmful terms in EEB and that many individuals from marginalized groups responded that they have been harmed by such terminology. Most of the terms identified as harmful relate to race, ethnicity, and immigration; sex and gender; geopolitical hierarchies; and historical violence. Our findings suggest there is an urgent need for EEB to confront and critically reassess its discipline-specific terminology. By identifying harmful terms and their impacts, our study represents a crucial first step toward dismantling deeply rooted exclusionary structures in EEB. We encourage individuals, communities, and institutions to use these findings to reevaluate language used in disciplinary research, teaching and mentoring, manuscripts, and professional societies. Rectifying current harms in EEB will help promote a more just and inclusive discipline.

                Background One of the most common strabismus types in children is intermittent exotropia, which predominantly occurs in children between the ages of 2 to 4 years. It may affect visual development and often coexists with refractive errors. Unlike esotropia, which usually links to hyperopia, intermittent exotropia might have a different relationship with refractive errors and thus lead to myopia. This study will investigate the prevalence and distribution of refractive errors in children with intermittent exotropia, challenging the traditionally held relationship between strabismus and hyperopia and its possible contribution to the development of myopia. Methods In this cross-sectional retrospective study from August 2021 to December 2023, 179 patients diagnosed with intermittent exotropia were recruited via an outpatient clinic of Najah Al-Quraishi, Baghdad, Iraq. The refractive errors were compared by autorefractometry and retinoscopy after cycloplegic dilation. Data analysis was constructed under the use of IBM SPSS V.26 for the determination of emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia prevalence. Results Among the 179 patients, emmetropia was the most commonly observed refractive status, present in 68 patients (38%). Low hyperopia and low myopia were also common, with 64 and 40, respectively. A limited number of patients had moderate/high myopia and moderate/high hyperopia; in detail, the prevalence was following: 5% of patients had moderate myopia, while 0.5% of patients suffered from high myopia; symmetrically, 5% were moderate to high hyperopia. From the data collected, a trend emerged for a low refractive error and symmetric refractive error in both eyes. Conclusion Contrasted to prior conventional wisdom about refractive error in strabismus, it established the greater prevalence of emmetropia in patients with intermittent exotropia. The findings call for specific management strategies to be applied in this population.

                The study reported in this paper investigates the impact of the interaction between brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments and its impact on the development of informational concepts among cybersecurity students. The authors collected quantitative data by means of Information Concept Test to determine the levels of information concepts according to the Frayer model (1969). The research sample consists of 80 male and female undergraduate students in Qassim University. The authors classified the participants into four quasi-experimental groups according to their preferred patterns in the infographic. Quantitative analysis of findings from this study shows an effect for the interaction between the variables of brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments in the test scores of information concepts in the post-administration, where the significance level (.011) is less than the significance level (0.05). Findings also revealed that the repetition of information at increasing intervals of time using the infographics is effective to learning concepts in an organized manner and to improving short memory. Furthermore, the mental model’s strategy also helped to retain information. The study recommends encouraging the use of brain-based learning strategies and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments to explore the relationships between different scientific concepts, to expand students’ knowledge, and to discover inter-relationships between different subject elements. The study provides a platform for further research to employ different brain-based learning strategies within e-learning environments to acquire higher-order thinking skills and improve students’ memory and mental capacity with the use of modern technological techniques that achieve learning quality.

                Background Research software is increasingly recognized as critical infrastructure in contemporary science. It spans a broad spectrum, including source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows, and executables, all created for or during research. While research funders have developed programs, initiatives, and policies to bolster research software’s role, there has been no empirical study of how these funders prioritize support for research software. Understanding their priorities is essential to clarify where current support is concentrated and to identify strategic gaps. Methods We conducted an online mixed methods survey of international research funders (n=36) to explore their priorities in supporting research software. The survey gathered data on the specific outcomes funders emphasize in their programs and initiatives for research software. Results The survey revealed that funders place strong emphasis on developing skills, promoting software sustainability, embedding open science practices, building community and collaboration, advancing research software funding mechanisms, increasing software visibility and use, fostering innovation, and ensuring security. Conclusions The findings highlight opportunities to enhance research software’s role through increased funder attention on professional recognition for software contributions and the non-technical, social aspects of research software sustainability. Addressing these areas could lead to more effective support and development of research software, ultimately benefitting the entire research ecosystem.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96317">Aminoglycoside tolerance in Vibrio cholerae engages translational reprogramming associated with queuosine tRNA modification</a></h4>

              
                Tgt is the enzyme modifying the guanine (G) in tRNAs with GUN anticodon to queuosine (Q). <i>tgt</i> is required for optimal growth of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> in the presence of sub-lethal aminoglycoside concentrations. We further explored here the role of the Q34 in the efficiency of codon decoding upon tobramycin exposure. We characterized its impact on the overall bacterial proteome, and elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Q34 modification in antibiotic translational stress response. Using molecular reporters, we showed that Q34 impacts the efficiency of decoding at tyrosine TAT and TAC codons. Proteomics analyses revealed that the anti-SoxR factor RsxA is better translated in the absence of <i>tgt</i>. RsxA displays a codon bias toward tyrosine TAT and overabundance of RsxA leads to decreased expression of genes belonging to SoxR oxidative stress regulon. We also identified conditions that regulate <i>tgt</i> expression. We propose that regulation of Q34 modification in response to environmental cues leads to translational reprogramming of transcripts bearing a biased tyrosine codon usage. In silico analysis further identified candidate genes which could be subject to such translational regulation, among which DNA repair factors. Such transcripts, fitting the definition of modification tunable transcripts, are central in the bacterial response to antibiotics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97179">GnRH pulse generator activity in mouse models of polycystic ovary syndrome</a></h4>

              
                One in ten women in their reproductive age suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that, alongside subfertility and hyperandrogenism, typically presents with increased luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility. As such, it is suspected that the arcuate kisspeptin (ARN<sup>KISS</sup>) neurons that represent the GnRH pulse generator are dysfunctional in PCOS. We used here in vivo GCaMP fiber photometry and other approaches to examine the behavior of the GnRH pulse generator in two mouse models of PCOS. We began with the peripubertal androgen (PPA) mouse model of PCOS but found that it had a reduction in the frequency of ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron synchronization events (SEs) that drive LH pulses. Examining the prenatal androgen (PNA) model of PCOS, we observed highly variable patterns of pulse generator activity with no significant differences detected in ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron SEs, pulsatile LH secretion, or serum testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone concentrations. However, a machine learning approach identified that the ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons of acyclic PNA mice continued to exhibit cyclical patterns of activity similar to that of normal mice. The frequency of ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neuron SEs was significantly increased in algorithm-identified ‘diestrous stage’ PNA mice compared to controls. In addition, ARN<sup>KISS</sup> neurons exhibited reduced feedback suppression to progesterone in PNA mice and their gonadotrophs were also less sensitive to GnRH. These observations demonstrate the importance of understanding GnRH pulse generator activity in mouse models of PCOS. The existence of cyclical GnRH pulse generator activity in the acyclic PNA mouse indicates the presence of a complex phenotype with deficits at multiple levels of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91204">Plural molecular and cellular mechanisms of pore domain KCNQ2 encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                <i>KCNQ2</i> variants in children with neurodevelopmental impairment are difficult to assess due to their heterogeneity and unclear pathogenic mechanisms. We describe a child with neonatal-onset epilepsy, developmental impairment of intermediate severity, and <i>KCNQ2</i> G256W heterozygosity. Analyzing prior KCNQ2 channel cryoelectron microscopy models revealed G256 as a node of an arch-shaped non-covalent bond network linking S5, the pore turret, and the ion path. Co-expression with G256W dominantly suppressed conduction by wild-type subunits in heterologous cells. Ezogabine partly reversed this suppression. <i>Kcnq2</i><sup>G256W/+</sup> mice have epilepsy leading to premature deaths. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells from G256W/+ brain slices showed hyperexcitability. G256W/+ pyramidal cell KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 immunolabeling was significantly shifted from axon initial segments to neuronal somata. Despite normal mRNA levels, G256W/+ mouse KCNQ2 protein levels were reduced by about 50%. Our findings indicate that G256W pathogenicity results from multiplicative effects, including reductions in intrinsic conduction, subcellular targeting, and protein stability. These studies provide evidence for an unexpected and novel role for the KCNQ2 pore turret and introduce a valid animal model of <i>KCNQ2</i> encephalopathy. Our results, spanning structure to behavior, may be broadly applicable because the majority of <i>KCNQ2</i> encephalopathy patients share variants near the selectivity filter.

">Does white matter structure relate to hemispheric language lateralisation? A systematic review</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between functional language lateralisation and diffusion MRI-based white matter metrics remains a subject of considerable interest and complexity. This systematic review aims to synthesise existing diffusion MRI studies examining white matter correlates of functional language dominance. Twenty-five studies were identified through searches of Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid MEDLINE (search period: inception to 16th March 2023) involving adults with epilepsy, tumours, or healthy controls. The results suggest that while the arcuate fasciculus, particularly its fractional anisotropy (FA), is commonly associated with language lateralisation in clinical populations, the findings in healthy individuals are more variable, often influenced by factors such as handedness. Other white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum and uncinate fasciculus, showed less consistent associations with language dominance across studies. Interestingly, temporal lobe regions, especially those involved in semantic processing, exhibited stronger correlations with diffusion measures compared to areas associated with phonological tasks. Methodological inconsistencies, such as variability in sample selection, task design, and analytical techniques, were identified as significant challenges in comparing findings across studies. Future research should aim for larger, more diverse sample sizes, whole-brain approaches, and a wider range of fMRI tasks to better elucidate the role of white matter in language lateralisation. If regions of interest (ROI)-based studies are utilised, a more standardised approach to tract segmentation should be adopted to ensure consistency and improve comparability across studies.

">Attention in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Systematic Review of Affected Domains and Brain-Gut Axis Interactions</a></h4>

              
                Background: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Recent research suggests that attention may be affected in individuals with IBS, potentially influencing symptom perception and emotional distress. Objective: This systematic review aims to investigate the relationship between attention and IBS, focusing on the affected domains of attention and the interactions within the brain-gut axis. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including MEDLINE/PubMed, PsychINFO, and Scopus, from January 1990 to December 2024. Studies were included if they assessed attention in adult IBS patients and employed valid measurement tools. A total of 24 studies were selected for analysis, encompassing various methodologies, including neuroimaging and behavioral assessments. Results: The findings indicate that IBS patients exhibit significant attentional biases, particularly towards gastrointestinal-related stimuli, reflecting heightened sensitivity and hypervigilance. Specific domains of attention, including selective attention, sustained attention, and pre-attentional processing, were identified as being affected. The review highlights the role of psychological factors, such as anxiety and depression, in modulating attention in IBS. Neuroimaging studies revealed altered brain activation patterns in regions associated with attention and emotional processing, suggesting a complex interplay between cognitive function and the brain-gut axis. Conclusion: This systematic review underscores the multifaceted nature of attention in IBS, revealing specific attentional deficits and biases that may contribute to symptom exacerbation and emotional distress. The findings emphasize the need for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing attention in IBS patients.

">The superior colliculus gates dopamine responses to conditioned stimuli in visual classical conditioning</a></h4>

              
                In classical Pavlovian conditioning, it is well-established that midbrain dopamine neurons respond to conditioned stimuli (CS) that predict a reward. However, how the dopamine neurons associate a neutral CS to a reward remains unknown. Here, we show that the superior colliculus (SC) develops neuronal responses to a visual CS during conditioning, which in turn drive the responses of dopamine neurons. Visual responses in the SC were only potentiated when a behaviorally meaningful time interval separated the visual stimulus and reward. Potentiation also required the convergence of visual, dopamine and serotonin inputs to the SC. Importantly, blocking potentiation of the visual response was sufficient to suppress the dopamine responses following a CS. These results reveal a mechanism for how the brain forms associations between unconditioned stimuli and behaviorally meaningful visual information during classical conditioning.

">Targeted stimulation of motor cortex neural ensembles drives learned movements</a></h4>

              
                During the execution of learned motor skills, the neural population in the layer 2/3 (L2/3) of the primary motor cortex (M1) expresses a reproducible spatiotemporal activity pattern. It is debated whether M1 actively participates in generating the activity pattern or it only passively reflects patterned inputs. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this learned activity pattern causally drives the learned movement. We addressed these issues using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with holographic optogenetic stimulation of specific ensembles of M1 L2/3 neurons in mice engaged in a skilled lever-press task. We briefly and synchronously stimulated ~20 neurons whose activity onset in voluntary trials precedes movement onsets. This stimulation, despite lacking temporal patterns, induced movements that resembled the learned movement, while producing spatiotemporal activity patterns in other M1 neurons not directly stimulated that resembled the activity during the voluntary learned movement. Trial-by-trial variability of optogenetically triggered population activity in the non-target neurons correlated with the variability in the induced movements. These trial-by-trial variabilities were predicted by the initial state of M1 population activity immediately preceding the optogenetic stimulation. Stimulation of the neurons whose activity followed voluntary movement onsets failed to induce the learned movement. Thus, the learned activity pattern in M1 L2/3 can be generated when the M1 network is prepared at the optimal initial state and receives precise triggering inputs, supporting the active role of M1 in learned activity generation. The resulting activity pattern then causally drives the learned movement.

">Accumbal acetylcholine signals associative salience</a></h4>

              
                Learning in dynamic environments requires animals to not only associate cues with outcomes but also to determine cue salience, which modulates how quickly related associations are updated. While dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) has been implicated in learning associations, the mechanisms of salience are less understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that acetylcholine (ACh) in the NAcc encodes cue salience. We conducted four odor discrimination experiments in rats while simultaneously measuring accumbal ACh and DA. We found that ACh developed characteristic dips to cues over learning before DA signals differentiated cues by value, with these dips persisting through value decreases and developing faster during meta-learning. The dips reflected the cue salience across learning stages and tasks, as predicted by a hybrid attentional associative learning model that integrated principles from the Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall models, suggesting that accumbal ACh signals encode salience and potentially gate the learning process.

">Maturation of striatal dopamine supports the development of habitual behavior through adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Developmental trajectories during the transition from adolescence to adulthood contribute to the establishment of stable, adult forms of operation. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this transition is crucial for identifying variability in normal development and the onset of psychiatric disorders, which typically emerge during this time. Habitual behaviors can serve as a model for understanding brain mechanisms underlying the stabilization of adult behavior, while also conferring risk for psychopathologies. Dopaminergic (DA) processes in the basal ganglia are thought to facilitate the formation of habits; however, developmental trajectories of habits and the brain systems supporting them have not been characterized in vivo in developing humans. The current study examined trajectories of habitual behavior from adolescence to adulthood and sought to understand how the maturing striatal DA system may act as a potential mechanism in the process of habit formation. We used data from two longitudinal studies (combined n = 217, 10 - 32 years of age, 1-3 visits each, 320 total sessions) to characterize normative developmental trajectories of basal ganglia tissue iron concentration (a proxy for DA-related neurophysiology) and goal-direct and habitual control behaviors in a two-stage decision-making task. Tissue iron concentrations across the basal ganglia and habitual responding during the two-stage sequential decision-making task both increased with age (all p < 0.001). Importantly, habitual responding was associated with tissue iron concentrations in the putamen (F = 4.34, p = 0.014), such that increases in habitual responding were supported by increases in putamen tissue iron concentration during childhood through late adolescence. Exploratory analyses of further subdivisions of anatomical regions found that this association was specific to the posterior putamen. These results provide novel evidence in humans that habitual behavior continues to mature into adulthood and may be supported by increased specialization of reward systems.

">Gut epithelium modifies enteric behaviors during nutritional adversity via distinct peptidergic signaling axes</a></h4>

              
                Interorgan signaling events are emerging as key regulators of behavioral plasticity. The foregut and hindgut circuits of the C. elegans enteric nervous system (ENS) control feeding and defecation behavior, respectively. Here we show that epithelial cells in the midgut integrate feeding state information to control these behavioral outputs by releasing distinct neuropeptidergic signals. In favorable conditions, insulin and non-insulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery. Our findings demonstrate that midgut epithelial cells act as integrators to relay internal state information to distinct parts of the enteric nervous system to control animal behavior.

">Topography of scene memory and perception activity in posterior cortex - a publicly available resource</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior in complex environments requires integrating visual perception with memory of our spatial environment. Recent work has implicated three brain areas in posterior cerebral cortex - the place memory areas (PMAs) that are anterior to the three visual scene perception areas (SPAs) - in this function. However, PMAs' relationship to the broader cortical hierarchy remains unclear due to limited group-level characterization. Here, we examined the PMA and SPA locations across three fMRI datasets (44 participants, 29 female). SPAs were identified using a standard visual localizer where participants viewed scenes versus faces. PMAs were identified by contrasting activity when participants recalled personally familiar places versus familiar faces (Datasets 1-2) or places versus multiple categories (familiar faces, bodies, and objects, and famous faces; Dataset 3). Across datasets, the PMAs were located anterior to the SPAs on the ventral and lateral cortical surfaces. The anterior displacement between PMAs and SPAs was highly reproducible. Compared to public atlases, the PMAs fell at the boundary between externally-oriented networks (dorsal attention) and internally-oriented networks (default mode). Additionally, while SPAs overlapped with retinotopic maps, the PMAs were consistently located anterior to mapped visual cortex. These results establish the anatomical position of the PMAs at inflection points along the cortical hierarchy between unimodal sensory and transmodal, apical regions, which informs broader theories of how the brain integrates perception and memory for scenes. We have released probabilistic parcels of these regions to facilitate future research into their roles in spatial cognition.

">Regulation of eye movements and pupil size in natural scenes</a></h4>

              
                The visual diet of humans is complex in space, time, spectrum, and consequently the activation of the retinal photoreceptors. While analyses of natural scenes have yielded valuable insights, the naturalistic natural stimulus on the retina is not very well understood. In the present study, we performed eye tracking in naturalistic indoor and outdoor real-world scenes. We recorded pupil size, several saccade and fixation metrics, as well as subjective scene perception ratings derived from subjective questionnaires. For the first five seconds of eye tracking, the descriptive data analysis revealed significantly increased average saccade frequency (p =.0025), amplitude (p =.0049), peak velocity (p =.0072), as well as pupil size (p = 1.307e-09) in the indoor environments. After this initial phase, these differences vanished, except for pupil size. Using an exploratory analysis on the whole 4-minute measurement, we found that saccade and fixation metrics, along with scene ratings, showed significantly different correlations between indoor and outdoor conditions. Despite the inherent constraints of such a naturalistic study (reduced ability to exert control over the precise task and the environmental conditions), we contend that the dataset holds substantial value for the field of eye movement research, as it has effectively minimized confounding factors that have been prevalent in previous eye tracking studies.

                Psychedelics have reemerged as potential treatments for mental health disorders, yet their impact on stress-related brain regions remains poorly understood. Here, we provide the first real-time, in vivo evidence of psilocybin-induced neuronal activation, specifically in hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons. Notably, psilocybin elicited more pronounced responses in female mice and produced context-related alterations in threat assessment. Our findings provide valuable insight into the impact of psychedelics on a key stress center in the brain.

">Optimal sparsity in autoencoder memory models of the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Storing complex correlated memories is significantly more efficient when memories are recoded to obtain compressed representations. Previous work has shown that compression can be implemented in a simple neural circuit, which can be described as a sparse autoencoder. The activity of the encoding units in these models recapitulates the activity of hippocampal neurons recorded in multiple experiments. However, these investigations have assumed that the level of sparsity is fixed and that inputs have the same statistics and, hence, that they are uniformly compressible. In contrast, biological agents encounter environments with vastly different memory demands and compressibility. Here, we investigate whether the compressibility of inputs determines optimal sparsity in sparse autoencoders. We find 1) that as the compressibility of inputs increases, the optimal coding level decreases, 2) that the desired coding level diverges from the observed coding level as a function of both memory demand and input compressibility, and 3) that optimal memory capacity is achieved when sparsity is weakly enforced. In addition, we characterize how sparsity and the strength of sparsity enforcement jointly control optimal performance. These results provide predictions for how sparsity in the hippocampus should change in response to environmental statistics and theoretical grounds for why sparsity is dynamically tuned in the brain.

">Looking for the optimal pathway to stimulate hippocampus in human participants using transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS): a simulation study</a></h4>

              
                At present, very limited methods can directly modulate the neural activities in deep brain structures in human participants. Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS), as an emerging and advanced modality of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), has great potential for focally stimulating the subcortical structures that are related to sleep, emotion and the functions of motor of cognition. Due to the focality, the integration of various methods, including magnetic resonance imaging and possible pathways, is important to perform TUS intervention for precise targeting and dosing. Based on structural MRI scans, we constructed a simulation model of low-intensity TUS, with a particular focus on the optimal pathways of targeting hippocampus in human participants. Finally, we outlooked the future perspectives of TUS in clinical applications in neurological and psychiatric fields.

">Tastes and retronasal odours evoke a shared flavour-specific neural code in the human insula</a></h4>

              
                During food consumption, tastes combine with retronasal odours to form flavour, which leads to a link so robust that retronasal odours can elicit taste sensations without concurrent taste stimulation. However, the cortical integration of these parallel sensory signals remains unclear. Here, we combine a flavour-binding paradigm and functional neuroimaging to test whether retronasal odorants evoke encoding patterns in the insula similar to those of their paired tastants. Healthy participants attended a familiarisation session with congruent sweet and savoury flavours followed by two fMRI sessions where they separately received the constituent tastants and odorants. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed classification of retronasal odours within the insula, exhibiting overlapping representations with their associated tastes, particularly in the ventral anterior insula. Additionally, we observed temporal instability in insular taste representations, paralleling findings in rodent gustatory cortex. These findings underscore the robust integration of gustatory and retronasal olfactory processing that underpin the flavour percept.

">In vivo imaging of inferior olive neurons reveals roles of co-activation and cerebellar feedback in olivocerebellar signaling</a></h4>

              
                Complex spikes (CSs), generated by inferior olive (IO) neurons, are foundational to most theories of cerebellar function and motor learning. Despite their importance, recordings from IO neurons in living animals have been limited to single-electrode methods, providing no insights into multineuron dynamics within intact circuits. Here, we used a novel ventral surgical approach that allows calcium imaging-based monitoring of multicellular activity in the IO of anesthetized mice. This method provides direct optical access to the ventral medulla, enabling simultaneous recording of spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity within localized clusters of IO neurons, specifically in the principal (PO) and dorsal accessory olives (DAO). Our findings reveal that spontaneous activity rates and event magnitudes differ between the PO and DAO, consistent with observations from cerebellar cortex recordings in zebrin-positive (Z+) and zebrin-negative (Z-) zones, respectively. We further demonstrate that spontaneous event amplitudes are influenced by co-activation among neighboring neurons, so that events occurring in clusters are larger than single ones. Event co-activation is more pronounced in the PO than in the DAO, potentially explaining the differences in complex spike sizes observed in Z+ and Z- zones. Sensory-evoked events induced by periocular airpuff stimulation were larger than spontaneous ones, as expected. However, this difference diminishes when accounting for the higher levels of co-activation during sensory stimulation. By comparing spontaneous and sensory-evoked events categorized as clustered or single, we find no intrinsic differences in amplitudes, emphasizing the role of co-activation in shaping event magnitude. Next, we optogenetically activated cerebellar nucleo-olivary (N-O) axons, a pathway central to theories of CS generation. To our surprise, while this robustly suppressed spontaneous IO activity, sensory-evoked events showed no reduction in either their probability or waveform. Our findings challenge the traditional view of the N-O pathway as purely inhibitory or desynchronizing, revealing instead a selective suppression of background activity while preserving sensory-driven responses. Together with the role of local co-activation in shaping IO event magnitudes, this work offers new insight into the timing and variation in complex spike sizes and their functional significance for behavior.

">Vesicular glutamate release is necessary for neural tube formation</a></h4>

              
                The brain and spinal cord originate from a neural tube that is preceded by a flat structure known as the neural plate during early embryogenesis. In humans, failure of the neural plate to convert into a tube by the fourth week of pregnancy leads to neural tube defects (NTDs), birth defects with serious neurological consequences. The signaling mechanisms governing the process of neural tube morphogenesis are unclear. Here we show that in Xenopus laevis embryos, neural plate cells release glutamate during neural plate folding in a Ca2+ and vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGluT1)-dependent manner. Vesicular release of glutamate elicits Ca2+ transients in neural plate cells that correlate with activation of Erk1/2. Knocking down or out VGluT1 leads to NTDs through increased expression of Sox2, neural stem cell transcription factor, and neural plate cell proliferation. Exposure during early pregnancy to neuroactive drugs that disrupt these signaling mechanisms might increase the risk of NTDs in offspring.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The evolution of digital technology enhances the broadening of a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s intellectual growth. Research points out that implementing innovative applications of the digital world improves human social, cognitive, and metacognitive behavior. Artificial intelligence chatbots are yet another innovative human-made construct. These are forms of software that simulate human conversation, understand and process user input, and provide personalized responses. Executive function includes a set of higher mental processes necessary for formulating, planning, and achieving a goal. The present study aims to investigate executive function reinforcement through artificial intelligence chatbots, outlining potentials, limitations, and future research suggestions. Specifically, the study examined three research questions: the use of conversational chatbots in executive functioning training, their impact on executive-cognitive skills, and the duration of any improvements. Methods: The assessment of the existing literature was implemented using the systematic review method, according to the PRISMA 2020 Principles. The avalanche search method was employed to conduct a source search in the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and complementary Google Scholar. This systematic review included studies from 2021 to the present using experimental, observational, or mixed methods. It included studies using AI-based chatbots or conversationalists to support executive functions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, memory, attention, cognitive load, and behavioral changes. In addition, this study included general populations with specific neurological conditions, all peer-reviewed, written in English, and with full-text access. However, the study excluded studies before 2021, the literature reviews, systematic reviews, non-AI-based chatbots or conversationalists, studies not targeting the range of executive skills and abilities, studies not written in English, and studies without open access. The criteria aligned with the study objectives, ensuring a focus on AI chatbots and the impact of conversational agents on executive function. The initial collection totaled n = 115 articles; however, the eligibility requirements led to the final selection of n = 10 studies. Results: The findings of the studies suggested positive effects of using AI chatbots to enhance and improve executive skills. Although, several limitations were identified, making it still difficult to generalize and reproduce their effects. Conclusions: AI chatbots are an innovative artificial intelligence tool that can function as a digital assistant for learning and expanding executive skills, contributing to the cognitive, metacognitive, and social development of the individual. However, its use in executive skills training is at a primary stage. The findings highlighted the need for a unified framework for reference and future studies, better study designs, diverse populations, larger sample sizes of participants, and longitudinal studies that observe the long-term effects of their use.</p>

">An Enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder-Based Normative Model for Neuroimaging Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Normative modelling in neuroimaging provides a powerful framework for quantifying individual deviations from expected brain measures as a function of relevant covariates. While most established approaches have focused on analysing distinct variables in isolation, there is a growing need for deep learning-based methods capable of handling multiple response variables simultaneously. Conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) have previously been applied in this context; however, existing inference methods still face challenges in providing reliable probabilistic predictions. In this study, we introduce an enhanced cVAE-based framework for normative modelling of neuroimaging data. Our key contribution is the development of a novel inference method that integrates latent space sampling and bootstrapping. This method directly leverages the generative nature of cVAEs to estimate the conditional distributions of brain measures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes as a test case for developing, testing, and validating the model. Our dataset includes 8,551 normotensive and 18,180 hypertensive participants from the UK Biobank. We evaluated our method against three well-established and popular normative modelling techniques, including Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS), Multivariate Fractional Polynomial Regression (MFPR), and Hierarchical Bayesian Regression (HBR). Our results indicate that the proposed cVAE-based framework achieves comparable performance across various metrics, while capturing individual deviations that correlate with the severity of hypertension. The model is particularly well-suited for high-dimensional, non-linear data, making it a robust tool for assessing individual deviations in brain structure. This enhanced normative modelling architecture paves the way for more nuanced and reliable assessments of brain health, with potential implications for personalised medicine and early detection of neurological disorders.

">Spectral acoustic contributions to musical pleasure are dynamically shaped by autonomic neural inputs</a></h4>

              
                Most people enjoy music and often use music to regulate their emotions. Although pleasure derived from music-listening has been shown to be mediated by dopaminergic signals in the mesolimbic reward network, its relationship with physiology is still poorly understood. Here, we introduced time-warped representational similarity analysis (twRSA) to directly map dynamic representations of multiple modalities across variable-duration stimuli. Our method revealed that although time-varying spectral and tonal acoustic features predicted changes in autonomic neural responses (measured via cardiac, pupil, and respiratory activity) during music-listening, only a small subset was in fact relevant to listeners' on-line pleasure ratings. Despite that, we identified a weak mediation effect of physiology on shaping musical pleasure. Our results thus indicate that whilst musical pleasure may be embodied in bodily responses, the mapping between subjective experience and physiology is likely one-to-many--in line with psychological construction theories of emotion--and not one-to-one as is commonly assumed in classical basic emotion theories.

">Lack of ADAP1/Centaurin-α1 Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment and Neuropathological Hallmarks in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                ArfGAP, with dual PH domain-containing protein 1/Centaurin-(ADAP1/CentA1), is a brain-enriched and highly conserved Arf6 GTPase-activating and Ras-anchoring protein. CentA1 is involved in dendritic outgrowth and arborization, synaptogenesis, and axonal polarization by regulating the actin cytoskeleton dynamics. An increased level of CentA1 and its association with amyloid plaques in the human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain suggest a role for this protein in AD progression. To understand the role of CentA1 in neurodegeneration, we crossbred CentA1 KO mice with the J20 mouse model of AD. We evaluated the behavioral and neuropathological hallmarks of AD and the gene expression profiles in J20 and J20 crossed with CentA1 KO mice (J20 x CentA1 KO) to determine the impact of eliminating CentA1 expression on AD-related phenotypes. Spatial memory assessed by the Morris Water Maze test showed significant impairment in J20 mice, which was rescued in J20 x CentA1 KO. Moreover, neuropathological hallmarks of AD, such as deposits of amyloid plaques and neuroinflammation, were significantly reduced in J20 x CentA1 KO. To identify potential mediators of AD phenotype rescue, we analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between genotypes. We found that changes in the gene profile by deletion of CentA1 from J20 (J20 x CentA1 KO vs J20) were anti-correlated with changes caused by APP overexpression (J20 vs WT), consistent with the rescues of J20 phenotypes by CentA1 KO. In summary, our data indicate that CentA1 is required for the progression of AD phenotypes and that targeting CentA1 signaling at mitochondria might have therapeutic potential for AD prevention or treatment.

">Manipulating Environmental Affordances via Intrinsic Measurement: Evidence from Sensorimotor Brain Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                According to the view of ecological psychology, affordances are perceived directly through the interaction between the observer and the environment, and thus body scaled. Considering the actions from different object agent distances, Tosoni and colleagues have provided a conceptual distinction concerning two types of affordances: macro affordances (also called environmental affordance) and micro affordances. Both of these two types of affordances have been investigated in psychological research since the beginning of this century. However, most of the environmental affordances have not yet been manipulated with a body-scaled setting in the prior research protocol. Inspired by the intrinsic measurement introduced by ecological psychologist Warren (1984) and focusing on environmental affordances, the present study adapted the task of Djebbara et al. (2019) by defining transitional affordance as the body-door height ratios. The current results from subjective data, EEG data and behavioral data showed that affordance can be manipulated intrinsically and covaried with agents' experience, perception and motor interaction. The perception of environmental affordances was based on intrinsic optical information for the relationship between environmental properties and capacities of the observer's own action system. It thus provides empirical support for the need to link ecological psychology and neuro-architecture in experimental protocols.

">C. elegans interprets dietary quality through context-dependent serotonergic modulation</a></h4>

              
                Animals sense their metabolic needs to guide foraging decisions using neuronal pathways that are only partly understood. Here, we systematically investigate how foraging in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is influenced by its bacterial diet, E. coli. By screening C. elegans behavior on 3983 E. coli knockout strains, we identified 22 E. coli metabolic mutants that are aversive to C. elegans in a long-term foraging assay. These include the global metabolic regulator CRP and genes affecting cysteine synthesis, vitamin B6 synthesis, and iron uptake. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with feeding in many animals, allows C. elegans to distinguish wild-type E. coli from these mediocre diets through bidirectional signaling. Serotonin produced by the ADF serotonergic neurons supports attraction to wild-type E. coli with the serotonin receptor genes ser-4 and ser-5, whereas serotonin produced by the NSM serotonergic neurons differentially drives aversion to two mediocre diets through four serotonin receptor genes, ser-1, ser-7, mod-1, and lgc-50. Serotonin receptors act in multiple target neurons, including octopamine-producing neurons that suppress aversion across all diets. In addition, dopamine promotes aversion, in part by inhibiting octopaminergic neurons. These results reveal interactions between neuromodulatory circuits in the context-dependent evaluation of dietary quality.

">Representational drift reflects ongoing balancing of stochastic changes by Hebbian learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidence indicates that even under stable environmental and behavioural conditions responses to sensory stimuli undergo continuous reformatting over the course of days, a condition described as representational drift. However, the processes underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Examining the dynamics of signal and noise correlations among neuron pairs in chronic calcium imaging experiments in the mouse auditory cortex, we investigate how activity-dependent, Hebbian-like plasticity, and activity-independent, stochastic synaptic processes contribute to representational drift. We found that signal correlations predict future noise correlations, suggesting that stimulus-induced co-activation leads to increased effective connectivity between neuron pairs. Moreover, simple linear network models were able to account for the observed temporal dependencies between signal and noise correlations, but only if both Hebbian-like plasticity and stochastic changes of either inputs or recurrent synapses contribute to representational drift. In conclusion, our findings suggest that continuous sensory input-driven Hebbian-like plasticity can balance ongoing stochastic synaptic changes, thereby preventing the network's functional degradation.

">Misspelled-word reading modulates late cortical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Literate humans can effortlessly interpret tens of thousands of words, even when the words are sometimes written incorrectly. This phenomenon suggests a flexible nature of reading that can endure a certain amount of noise. In this study, we investigated where and when brain responses diverged for conditions where misspelled words were resolved as real words or not. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to track the cortical activity as the participants read words with different degrees of misspelling that were perceived to range from real words to complete pseudowords, as confirmed by their behavioral responses. In particular, we were interested in how lexical information survives (or not) along the uncertainty spectrum, and how the corresponding brain activation patterns evolve spatiotemporally. We identified three brain regions that were notably modulated by misspellings: left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT), superior temporal cortex (ST), and precentral cortex (pC). This suggests that resolving misspelled words into stored concepts involves an interplay between orthographic, semantic, and phonological processing. Temporally, these regions showed fairly late and sustained responses selectively to misspelled words. Specifically, an increasing level of misspelling increased the response in ST from 300 ms after stimulus onset; a functionally fairly similar but weaker effect was observed in pC. In vOT, misspelled words were sharply distinguished from real words notably later, after 700 ms. A linear mixed effects (LME) analysis further showed that pronounced and long-lasting misspelling effects appeared first in ST and then in pC, with shorter-lasting activation also observed in vOT. We conclude that reading misspelled words engages brain areas typically associated with language processing, but in a manner that cannot be interpreted merely as a rapid feedforward mechanism. Instead, feedback interactions likely contribute to the late effects observed during misspelled-word reading.

	<p>Background: In neuroscience research about functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), accurate inter-subject image registration is the basis for effective statistical analysis. Traditional fMRI registration methods are usually based on high-resolution structural MRI with clear anatomical structure features. However, this registration method based on structural information cannot achieve accurate functional consistency between subjects since the functional regions do not necessarily correspond to anatomical structures. In recent years, fMRI registration methods based on functional information have emerged, which usually ignore the importance of structural MRI information. Methods: In this study, we proposed a non-rigid cycle consistent bidirectional network with Transformer for unsupervised deformable functional MRI registration. The work achieves fMRI registration through structural MRI registration, and functional information is introduced to improve registration performance. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional registration network that implements forward and reverse registration between image pairs and apply Transformer in the registration network to establish remote spatial mapping between image voxels. Functional and structural information are integrated by introducing the local functional connectivity pattern, the local functional connectivity features of the whole brain are extracted as functional information. The proposed registration method was experimented on real fMRI datasets, and qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the quality of the registration method were implemented on the test dataset using relevant evaluation metrics. We implemented group ICA analysis in brain functional networks after registration. Functional consistency was evaluated on the resulting t-maps. Results: Compared with non-learning-based methods (Affine, Syn) and learning-based methods (Transmorph-tiny, Cyclemorph, VoxelMorph x2), our method improves the peak t-value of t-maps on DMN, VN, CEN, and SMN to 18.7, 16.5, 16.6, and 17.3 and the mean number of suprathreshold voxels (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05, t &amp;amp;gt; 5.01) on the four networks to 2596.25, and there is an average improvement in peak t-value of 23.79%, 12.74%, 12.27%, 7.32%, and 5.43%. Conclusions: The experimental results show that the registration method of this study improves the structural and functional consistency between fMRI with superior registration performance.</p>

	<p>BACKGROUND: Maximal safe resection is the objective of most neuro-oncological operations. Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) may guide the surgeon to improve the extent of safe resection. There is limited evidence comparing the impact of iMRI on the rates of further resection between tumour types. AIM: To investigate the impact of iMRI on the rate of further resection following visualisation of residual tumour. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study identified all intracranial tumour operations performed in the 1.5 T iMRI machine of a single centre (2007&amp;amp;ndash;2023). Patients were identified using SurgiNet and were grouped according to their histopathological diagnosis in accordance with the WHO 2021 classification. The primary outcome was the rate of reoperation due to iMRI visualisation of residual tumours. RESULTS: A total of 574 cases were identified, including 152 low-grade gliomas (LGG), 108 high-grade gliomas (HGG), 194 pituitary neuroendocrine tumours (PitNETs), 15 metastases, and 6 meningiomas. Further resection following iMRI visualisation occurred in 45% of LGG cases, 47% of HGG cases, 29% of PitNET cases, and no meningioma or metastasis cases. Chi-square analysis showed that the rate of further resection after iMRI use across 2018&amp;amp;ndash;2023 was significantly higher than that across 2007&amp;amp;ndash;2012 (46% versus 33%, p = 0.036). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative MRI for guiding further resection was most useful in cases of LGG and HGG, possibly reflecting the difficulty of differentiating these tumour types from normal brain tissue. In addition, there was increased reliance on iMRI over time, which may represent our surgeons becoming accustomed to its use.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the depletion of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies highlight the gut-liver-brain (GLB) axis and its role in PD pathogenesis. The GLB axis forms a dynamic network facilitating bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and central nervous system. Dysregulation within this axis, encompassing gut dysbiosis and microbial metabolites, is emerging as a critical factor influencing PD progression. Our understanding of PD was traditionally centered on neurodegenerative processes within the brain. However, examining PD through the lens of the GLB axis provides new insights. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), kynurenine, serotonin, bile acids, indoles, and dopamine, which are integral to PD pathogenesis by modulation of the GLB axis. Our extensive research included a comprehensive literature review and database searches utilizing resources such as gutMGene and gutMDisorder. These databases have been instrumental in identifying specific microbes and their metabolites, shedding light on the intricate relationship between the GLB axis and PD. This review consolidates existing knowledge and underscores the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions based on the GLB axis and its components, which offer new avenues for future PD research and treatment strategies. While the GLB axis is not a novel concept, this review is the first to focus specifically on its role in PD, highlighting the importance of integrating the liver and microbial metabolites as central players in the PD puzzle.</p>

In a recent study, Blankenship and colleagues reported that in a mouse of AD, ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons are also hyperexcitable, and this hyperexcitability is due to casein kinase 2 (CK2)-dependent SK channel dysfunction, adding new insights into the underlying mechanisms of aberrant neuronal properties in AD.

">Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveals time-dependent and cell-type-specific effects of psilocybin on gene expression</a></h4>

              
                There is growing interest to investigate classic psychedelics as potential therapeutics for mental illnesses. Previous studies have demonstrated that one dose of psilocybin leads to persisting neural and behavioral changes. The durability of psilocybin's effects suggests that there are likely alterations of gene expression at the transcriptional level. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the dorsal medial frontal cortex of male and female mice. Samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 24, or 72 hours after psilocybin or ketamine administration and from control animals. At baseline, major excitatory and GABAergic cell types selectively express particular serotonin receptor transcripts. The psilocybin-evoked differentially expressed genes in excitatory neurons were involved in synaptic plasticity, which were distinct from genes enriched in GABAergic neurons that contribute to mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. The effect of psilocybin on gene expression was time-dependent, including an early phase at 1-2 hours followed by a late phase at 72 hours of transcriptional response after administration. Ketamine administration produced transcriptional changes that show a high degree of correlation to those induced by psilocybin. Collectively, the results reveal that psilocybin produces time-dependent and cell-type specific changes in gene expression in the medial frontal cortex, which may underpin the drug's long-term effects on neural circuits and behavior.

">EXPLORING SOCIAL COGNITION DECLINE ACROSS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SEVERITY: INSIGHTS FROM A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS</a></h4>

              
                The detection of subtle behavioral signs in early stages of Alzheimers Disease (AD) is of great importance to start clinical investigation. Memory and reasoning problems are usually more commonly reported by relatives than those associated with Social Cognition (SC). This study focusing on deficits in SC as a behavioral marker of Alzheimers Disease (AD) investigated: (1) selective impairments in SC domains according to stage of disease; (2) if impairments were better explained by nonsocial cognitive dysfunctions. Sixty-five elderly distributed into groups according to the Mini-Mental State Examination (Healthy, Mild cognitive impairment, Mild-AD, Moderate-AD) participated in the study. All underwent the Edinburgh Social Cognition Test (ESCoT), which investigates the cognitive and affective domains of Theory of Mind, as well as interpersonal and intrapersonal understanding of social norms. The nonsocial cognitive battery included traditional tests of episodic memory, executive functions, verbal fluency and language comprehension. Mediation analysis was performed to understand the influence of nonsocial cognitive skills in SC impairment among groups. Results revealed prominent losses in SC in moderate AD regardless of memory-skills. Theory of mind was a crucial link between social and nonsocial cognitive abilities. Executive functioning, verbal fluency and language comprehension mediated group-related cognitive decline's effects on SC impairment. These findings underscore the complex interplay between cognitive domains in AD and suggest that selective impairments of SC highlight is as potential a marker for tracking the progression of the disease.

">Zero-phase-delay connectivity increases the reliability, concordance with structure, and prognostic ability of functional connectivity metrics</a></h4>

              
                Zero-phase-delay synchrony between the activity of distant neural populations has been robustly observed. Nevertheless, contemporary electroencephalography and magnetencephalography functional connectivity analyses typically exclude zero-phase-delay functional connections, assuming that they are predominantly artefactual. However, the effects of excluding them on the performance of functional connectivity metrics as potential biomarkers are unknown. Here, we showed that most cortico-cortical functional connections occur with zero- or near-zero phase-delay, even where such connectivity was unlikely to be artefactual. Including, rather than excluding, zero-phase-delay connectivity increased the reliability, concordance with structural connectivity, and predictive validity (for longitudinal changes in cognition) of functional connectivity metrics. We found that excluding zero-phase-delay connections penalised functional connectivity strength between the strongest structurally connected regions: stronger structural connections led to functional connections with phase-delays closer to zero, mediated by a shorter signal propagation time. Our findings challenge generally accepted assumptions that zero-phase-exclusive methods are superior to zero-phase-inclusive methods.

">Altered brain-ventricle coupling modes over Alzheimer's disease progression detected with fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The origins of resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) signal fluctuations remain debated. Recent evidence shows coupling between global cortical rsfMRI signals and cerebrospinal fluid inflow in the fourth ventricle, increasing during sleep and decreasing with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, potentially reflecting brain clearance mechanisms. However, the existence of more complex brain-ventricle coupling modes and their relationship to cognitive decline remains unexplored. Analyzing 599 minimally-preprocessed rsfMRI scans from 163 elderly participants across the AD spectrum, we identified distinct brain-ventricle coupling modes that differentiate across groups and correlate with cognitive scores. Beyond the known anti-phase coupling between global brain signals and ventricles - more frequent in cognitively normal controls - we discovered additional modes where specific brain areas temporarily align with ventricle signals. At the cortical level, these modes form canonical resting-state networks, such as the Default Mode Network, which occurs less in AD or the Frontoparietal Network, which correlates positively with memory scores. The direct link between ventricle and brain signals challenges the common practice of removing CSF components from rsfMRI analyses and questions the origin of cortical signal fluctuations forming functional networks, which may reflect region-specific fluid inflow patterns. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between brain clearance mechanisms and network dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Early Noise Exposure and Changes in Medial Olivocochlear Strength Alters Auditory Pathway Development</a></h4>

              
                Periodic spontaneous activity is a key feature of developing sensory systems, essential for the formation and refinement of neural circuits. Before the onset of hearing in altricial mammals, cochlear inner hair cells exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that activates primary afferents to propagate into the central nervous system. This activity, modulated by the medial olivocochlear efferent feedback via 910 nicotinic cholinergic receptors present in inner hair cells, is crucial for auditory system maturation. In this study, we examined the impact of sound exposure at levels below those causing hair cell damage during the critical developmental period by using genetically modified mice - 9 knockout and 9 knock-in models - with either absent or enhanced cholinergic activity. We further assessed how varying levels of medial olivocochlear feedback interact with early-age noise exposure to affect auditory development. Our findings reveal that both increased and absent olivocochlear activity result in altered auditory sensitivity at the onset of hearing and affect ribbon synapse number and morphology. Additionally, early exposure to loud noise caused long lasting changes in the inner ear of wild-type and 9 knockout mice, underscoring the heightened vulnerability during early development. In contrast, mice with enhanced cholinergic activity were protected from these changes. Overall, this work highlights the critical role of medial olivocochlear modulation in proper auditory system development and indicates that early noise exposure can interfere with normal cochlear maturation, resulting in pronounced long-term effects.

">Short-Term Arcade-Action Video Gaming Enhances Working Memory Precision</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Action video games are increasingly recognized for their potential to enhance cognitive capacities, including working memory (WM). However, most studies require extensive training or prior gaming experience. We examined whether a single, short-term session of Snail Mail, an arcade-action video game, could boost WM precision compared to a passive control condition. Method: Thirty six healthy adults (18 34 years) were randomly assigned to either play Snail Mail (Intervention) or watch episodes of Shaun the Sheep (Control) for 30 minutes. Two participants were excluded for unstable performance, yielding a final sample of 34. Participants completed a face emotion recognition memory task before and after the intervention, wherein the absolute error served as the primary metric of WM precision. A mixture model further characterized memory precision, and random guessing. Results: The Intervention group showed a significant reduction in absolute error from pre test to posttest, whereas the Control group exhibited a negative effect size, indicating worsened posttest performance. Mixture model results revealed a significant increase in precision for the Intervention group. Conclusion: These findings indicate that a 30 minute arcade-action game session can meaningfully enhance WM precision, highlighting the feasibility of brief, targeted gaming interventions. Future research should explore longer-term outcomes, generalizability to other cognitive tasks, and optimal intervention protocols for sustained benefits

">Antidepressants promote developmental-like plasticity through remodeling of extracellular matrix</a></h4>

              
                Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Fluoxetine (Flx) are widely used to treat mood and anxiety disorders. Despite decades of use, the molecular logic by which they modulate stress-related behaviors remain poorly understood. Here we show that Flx reactivates a developmental-like plasticity program in the dentate gyrus (DG) by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the hippocampus post-Flx revealed robust transcriptomic reprogramming in the DG, with mature granule cells adopting a juvenile-like transcriptional profile, including upregulation of the developmental gene Sox11. This was accompanied by increased BDNF signaling and enhanced structural remodeling in the mossy fiber pathway. Flx remodeled perisynaptic nets, a novel ECM structures in the DG, and targeted ECM degradation around granule cells reactivated SOX11. Flx treatment mitigated stress-induced fear generalization, and this was phenocopied by direct degradation of ECM in the DG. These findings identify ECM remodeling as a molecular substrate for Flx's effects, linking induction of a developmental-like plasticity program and rejuvenation of mature granule cells to improvements in stress-induced overgeneralization.

                Sensory stimuli vary across a variety of dimensions, like contrast, orientation, or texture. The brain must rely on population representations to disentangle changes in one dimension from changes in another. To understand how the visual system might extract separable stimulus representations, we recorded multiunit neuronal responses to texture images varying along two dimensions: contrast, a property represented as early as the retina, and naturalistic statistical structure, a property that modulates neuronal responses in V2 and V4, but not in V1. We measured how sites in these 3 cortical areas responded to variation in both dimensions. Contrast modulated responses in all areas. In V2 and V4, the presence of naturalistic structure both modulated responses and increased contrast sensitivity. Tuning for naturalistic structure was strongest in V4; tuning in both dimensions was most heterogeneous in V4. We measured how well populations in each area could support the linear readout of both dimensions. Populations in V2 and V4 could support the linear readout of naturalistic structure, but only in V4 did we find evidence for a robust representation that was contrast-invariant.

	<p>Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent, chronic, and severe neuropsychiatric disorder that leads to illness-related disability. Despite the availability of several treatments, many OCD patients respond inadequately, because the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear, necessitating the establishment of many animal models, particularly mouse models, to elucidate disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies better. Although the development of animal models is ongoing, there remain many comprehensive summaries and updates in recent research, hampering efforts to develop novel treatments and enhance existing interventions. This review summarizes the phenotypes of several commonly used models and mechanistic insights from transgenic models of OCD, such as knockout mouse models. In addition, we present the advantages and limitations of these models and discuss their future in helping further understand the pathophysiology and advanced treatment. Here, we highlight current frontline treatment approaches for OCD, including neuromodulation and surgical interventions, and propose potential future directions. By studying gene mutations and observing phenotypes from available OCD animal models, researchers have classified the molecular signatures of each model reminiscent of changes in brain areas and neural pathways, with the hope of guiding the future selection of the most appropriate models for specific research in the OCD field.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: There is growing interest in neuroscience-informed education, as well as neuroscience-derived strategies that maximise learning. Studies on neuroscience literacy and neuromyths, i.e., understandings or misconceptions about the brain, have primarily focused on their prevalence in educators, and few studies have examined their impact on students&amp;amp;rsquo; study habits or academic performance. Methods: To address this gap, we surveyed 576 university students in different academic programmes to investigate the relationship between neuromyths and academic outcomes in university students. In this quantitative, cross-sectional study design, we used a validated neuroscience knowledge survey and the Revised Two-factor Study Process (R-SPQ-2F) Questionnaire. We also inquired about students&amp;amp;rsquo; interest in, exposure to, and awareness of neuroscience, as well as their academic grades. Results: Students showed significant awareness of and interest in neuroscience; this was highest among students in health science programmes and lowest among students in computer and engineering programmes. The most common sources of general neuroscience knowledge were internet articles. Higher neuroscience literacy was associated with higher interest in neuroscience and having taken more neuroscience courses. Neuromyth scores were also better among those with higher neuroscience literacy scores. Higher neuroscience literacy scores were significantly associated with higher grades, higher surface strategy scores, and lower surface motive study habits. Conclusions: Our study sheds light on the variations in foundational neuroscience literacy among students in different academic programmes. It also provides insight into how this foundation affects academic performance and study habits. This insight may help guide educational policymakers to adopt neuroscience-based strategies that may be beneficial for learning.</p>

                <p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) are known to contribute to both protective and pronociceptive processes. However, their contribution to neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI) needs further investigation. In a recent study utilizing TrkB<sup>F616A</sup> mice, it was shown that systemic pharmacogenetic inhibition of TrkB signaling with 1NM-PP1 (1NMP) immediately after SCI delayed the onset of pain hypersensitivity, implicating maladaptive TrkB signaling in pain after SCI. To examine potential neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral outcome, patch-clamp recording was performed in small-diameter dissociated thoracic (T) dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons to evaluate TrkB signaling in uninjured mice and after T10 contusion SCI. Bath-applied 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a selective TrkB agonist, induced a robust inward current in neurons from uninjured mice, which was attenuated by 1NMP treatment. SCI also decreased 7,8-DHF-induced current while increasing the latency to its peak amplitude. Western blot revealed a concomitant decrease in TrkB expression in DRGs adjacent to the spinal lesion. Analyses of cellular and membrane properties showed that SCI increased neuronal excitability, evident by an increase in resting membrane potential and the number of spiking neurons. However, SCI did not increase spontaneous firing in DRG neurons. These results suggest that SCI induced changes in TrkB activation in DRG neurons even though these alterations are likely not contributing to pain hypersensitivity by nociceptor hyperexcitability. Overall, this reveals complex interactions involving TrkB signaling and provides an opportunity to investigate other, presumably peripheral, mechanisms by which TrkB contributes to pain hypersensitivity after SCI.</p>

                <p>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a well-known antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke by inhibiting pyroptosis, a programmed cell death associated with inflammation. This study investigates the impact of HCQ on ischemic stroke pathology using both in vivo and in vitro models. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were treated with HCQ. Neurological deficits, infarct volume, and the expression of pyroptosis markers were evaluated. The results demonstrated that HCQ significantly improved motor function and reduced infarct volume in the MCAO mouse model. In vitro, BV2 microglial cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and oxygen&ndash;glucose deprivation (OGD) were treated with HCQ. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that HCQ effectively suppressed the expression of pyroptosis markers GSDMD and NLRP3 in both in vivo and in vitro models. These findings suggest that HCQ mitigates ischemic stroke damage by inhibiting pyroptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HCQ exerts its neuroprotective effects, offering a promising new avenue for developing safe, cost-effective, and widely applicable stroke treatments. The potential of HCQ to modulate neuroinflammatory pathways presents a significant advancement in ischemic stroke therapy, emphasizing the importance of targeting pyroptosis in stroke management and the broader implications for treating neuroinflammatory conditions.</p>

                This paper presents a study of congruence relations on autometrized algebras. We demonstrate that in a normal autometrized algebra, which satisfies certain conditions, the set of all congruence relations forms a complete sublattice within the set of all equivalence relations. Furthermore, we investigate the property that a congruence-permutable autometrized algebra is also congruence-modular. We also explore several fundamental properties related to congruence relations. Additionally, we introduce the kernel of a homomorphism and establish that it is a congruence relation. Lastly, we examine the homomorphism, isomorphism, and correspondence theorems of autometrized algebra using the concept of congruence.

                Background Termites are a major insect pest affecting agricultural production and woody materials. They cause severe devastation in the ecosystem, and lead to bare soil. This phenomenon causes the soil to become difficult to plow, which in turn leads to a reduction in the productivity of crops. It can cause 100 % yield losses based on crop types, level of the damage, and size of its populations. To manage this pest, different management options have been evaluated in Ethiopia. While insecticide usage is the dominant option, less attention has been given to Entomopathogenic Nematode (EPN) based management options. Therefore, this research was initiated to screen locally collected EPN isolates and evaluate promising isolates under field conditions on maize crop. Methods 37 EPN isolates were screened under laboratory condition, while two isolates were evaluated at field condition. The screening of EPN isolates was laid out in a completely randomized design, and the field evaluation used a completely randomized block design, and treatments were replicated thrice. Mortality of insect, damaged root, stem, cob, damage severity, foraging termites, and yield of the crop data were collected. Results The study indicated that all screened EPN isolates caused mortality on termites under laboratory conditions. The isolates achieved complete mortality of the insect pest within 12 days of exposure. The finding indicated that AEH and S#50 were the more pathogenic and virulent isolates on termites under laboratory conditions and taken to field study. The S#50 isolate was most pathogenic and reduced the infestation and severity of the insect pest on the maize crop under field conditions. Conclusions This result showed that the entomopathogenic nematode isolates have the potential to manage subterranean termites in the maize field. Future studies should be based on collection of local isolates and develop a full package for the virulent isolates.

                Background The "birthday effect" refers to increased mortality around birthdays, although evidence remains mixed, with some studies even indicating reduced mortality. While the effect has a minimal impact on overall mortality, lacks prevention potential, and faces methodological challenges, it offers seminal insights into psychogenic health effects. Methods Major causes of death were analyzed using data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (1987-2022), excluding leap years and cases with imputed dates. The relationship between day of birth and death was assessed using a Poisson count model with overdispersion, and mortality rates (MRs) per 100,000 deaths per year were calculated for ±182 days around birthdays. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) compared these periods to a reference period. Cluster analyses explored mortality rate patterns across age and diagnostic groups. Age was not adjusted for in the Poisson model to avoid zero inflation, with bias from age-related mortality changes assessed separately through sensitivity analyses. Results In the analysis of 1,702,865 deaths over 27 years, an eight percent increase in birthday mortality was observed, equivalent to 22 additional deaths per 100,000 deaths per year. There were 889 excess deaths in the 28 days after the birthday compared to 206 in the 28 days before. Excess birthday mortality was particularly pronounced in men, unmarried individuals, and those with religious affiliations. In individuals aged 85 and older, a pre-birthday dip followed by post-birthday mortality excess was noted. Cardiovascular causes, suicides, and accidents had the highest birthday-related mortality, while diabetes, respiratory diseases, and other conditions showed varied pre- and post-birthday patterns. Conclusions Administrative and age-related biases were ruled out, suggesting the birthday effect is psychogenic. While behavior-linked causes like suicides and accidents had clear birthday patterns, other main causes of death also showed birthday-period effects. Further research, including psychometric and biomarker studies, is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

                <p>by Magnus Pirovino, Christian Iseli, Joseph A. Curran, Bernard Conrad</p>

Catalysis and specifically autocatalysis are the quintessential building blocks of life. Yet, although autocatalytic networks are necessary, they are not sufficient for the emergence of life-like properties, such as replication and adaptation. The ultimate and potentially fatal threat faced by molecular replicators is parasitism; if the polymerase error rate exceeds a critical threshold, even the fittest molecular species will disappear. Here we have developed an autocatalytic RNA early life mathematical network model based on enzyme kinetics, specifically the steady-state approximation. We confirm previous models showing that these second-order autocatalytic cycles are sustainable, provided there is a sufficient nucleotide pool. However, molecular parasites become untenable unless they sequentially degenerate to hyperparasites (i.e. parasites of parasites). Parasite resistance–a parasite-specific host response decreasing parasite fitness–is acquired gradually, and eventually involves an increased binding affinity of hyperparasites for parasites. Our model is supported at three levels; firstly, ribozyme polymerases display Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics and comply with the steady-state approximation. Secondly, ribozyme polymerases are capable of sustainable auto-amplification and of surmounting the fatal error threshold. Thirdly, with growing sequence divergence of host and parasite catalysts, the probability of self-binding is expected to increase and the trend towards cross-reactivity to diminish. Our model predicts that primordial host-RNA populations evolved via an arms race towards a host-parasite-hyperparasite catalyst trio that conferred parasite resistance within an RNA replicator niche. While molecular parasites have traditionally been viewed as a nuisance, our model argues for their integration into the host habitat rather than their separation. It adds another mechanism–with biochemical precision–by which parasitism can be tamed and offers an attractive explanation for the universal coexistence of catalyst trios within prokaryotes and the virosphere, heralding the birth of a primitive molecular immunity.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Monoallelic variants in the transient receptor potential melastatin-related type 3 gene (<i>TRPM3</i>) have been associated with neurodevelopmental manifestations, but knowledge on the clinical manifestations and treatment options is limited. We characterized the clinical spectrum, highlighting particularly the epilepsy phenotype, and the effect of treatments.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed retrospectively the phenotypes and genotypes of 43 individuals with <i>TRPM3</i> variants, acquired from GeneMatcher and collaborations (n = 21), and through a systematic literature search (n = 22). We included all patients with a pathogenic <i>TRPM3</i> variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The median age at the time of the study was 10 years, with a preponderance of girls (60%) versus boys (40%). Frequent findings were developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (93%), global or axial hypotonia (77%), ocular involvement (70%), musculoskeletal anomalies (65%), and dysmorphic features (58%). Epilepsy was diagnosed in 31 patients (72%), classified in all as developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with or without spike wave activation in sleep (DEE/DEE-SWAS). Patients with the variant p.Val1002Met (n = 24) significantly more often had developmental delay and epilepsy. The most effective anti-seizure medication was primidone. All treated patients showed an improvement in seizure frequency, motor and speech development, and/or learning capability with this drug.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Developmental delay/intellectual disability and epilepsy are dominant phenotypic features in patients with <i>TRPM3</i> variants. Given that epilepsy can negatively impact development, screening for awake and sleep electroencephalogram abnormalities and other manifestations are essential to offer early intervention. The TRPM3 channel blocker primidone has shown promising effects and should be considered in every child with a <i>TRPM3</i> gain-of-function variant. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Sonneratia caseolaris, has been widely utilized by the Indonesian. S. caseolaris leaves contain various active compounds, contributing to their popularity in the treatment of various diseases. Mangrove leaves are also known to exhibit very high antioxidant activity. This study aims to assess the antioxidant activity of S . caseolaris leaves extracted using different solvents. The resulting extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) techniques. Methods Analysis of total flavonoids, total phenols, identification of active compounds with Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and bioinformatics were also carried out to obtain temporary conclusions about the antioxidant activity of S. caseolaris leaf extract. Results The results indicated that S. caseolaris leaves extracted with methanol and distilled water exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The analysis of total flavonoids and total phenols yielded results consistent with the antioxidant activity tests. LC-HRMS results identified three compounds in all S. caseolaris leaf extracts with antioxidant activity, namely TEMPO, Choline, and Betaine. TEMPO demonstrated a higher antioxidant activity than Choline and Betaine, as indicated by the binding affinity values in the bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions It is evident that S. caseolaris leaf extracts has the potential to serve as an effective antioxidant agent. Further research is needed to confirm how the potential compounds in S. caseolaris leaf water extracts interact with the target protein Keap1. This research aims to utilize S. caseolaris as active components in food products, thereby enhancing antioxidant consumption among consumers.

                Background Neurodegeneration due to neurotoxicity is one of the phenomena in temporal lobe epilepsy. Experimentally, hippocampal excitotoxicity process can occur due to kainic acid exposure, especially in the CA3 area. Neuronal death, astrocyte reactivity and increased calcium also occur in hippocampal excitotoxicity, but few studies have investigated immediate effect after kainic acid exposure. The organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC) is a useful model for studying the neurodegeneration process, but there are still many protocol differences. In this study, minor modifications were made in the OHSC protocol. Methods OHSC was obtained from three healthy wild type Wistar rats aged P10. Healthy culture slices were obtained and lasted up to 10 days in vitro (DIV 10). Bath application of kainic acid for 48 hours in DIV 10 followed by observation of its initial effects on neurons, astrocytes, and calcium via the expression of MAP2, GFAP, and intracellular calcium imaging, subsequently. Results After 48 h of kainic acid administration, there was a significant increase in intracellular calcium intensity (p = 0.006 < α), accompanied by a significant decrease in MAP2 (p = 0.003 < α) and GFAP (p = 0.010 < α) expression. Conclusion These findings suggest early neuronal and astrocyte damage at the initial onset of hippocampal injury. This implies that astrocyte damage occurs early before an increase in GFAP that characterizes reactive astrogliosis found in other studies. Damage to neurons and astrocytes may be associated with increased intracellular calcium. It is necessary to develop further research regarding regulation of calcium, MAP2, and GFAP at a spatial time after exposure to kainic acid and strategies to reduce damage caused by excitotoxicity.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the healthcare ecosystem, but further research is needed to understand how it can enhance healthcare capabilities. This study analyzes the literature on AI and healthcare capability using the PRISMA approach, applying specific search keywords and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The findings indicate that AI benefits the healthcare ecosystem, significantly influences health outcomes, and transforms medical practices. However, there is limited literature and a lack of understanding regarding how AI enhances healthcare capabilities. Most studies date from 2019, suggesting that COVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of AI systems in healthcare. This research contributes theoretically by developing a framework that clarifies AI’s role in enhancing healthcare capabilities, serving as a foundational model for future studies. It identifies critical gaps in the literature, especially in the Global South, and encourages exploration in under-researched areas where healthcare professionals can benefit from AI. Additionally, it bridges the gap between AI and healthcare, enriching interdisciplinary dialogue relevant to emerging economies facing financial constraints. Practically, the study provides actionable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers in the Global South on leveraging AI to improve service delivery. It sets the stage for empirical research, promoting the testing and refinement of the proposed framework in resource-limited contexts, while raising awareness among healthcare staff, managers, and technology developers about AI’s role in healthcare.

                Background The work experience of seafarers differs significantly from other land-based occupations due to several factors, particularly remoteness and the restricted work environment. This study seeks to examine the impact of burnout and health impairment in the maritime industry, using the Job Demand-Resources theory as a framework. Methods To investigate these phenomena, an online questionnaire was sent to 239 Italian seafarers (94.6% men, Mage = 39.44, SD = 12.8). We tested a mediated Structural Equation Model (SEM) aimed at predicting negative health outcomes. Results The results show that burnout plays a mediating role between job demands (such as workload and cognitive strain) and resources (such as social support and transformational leadership), influencing variables related to health impairment (such as sleep quality and physical well-being). Furthermore, the findings highlight the direct influence of occupational resources on seafarers’ health. Conclusions The discussion highlights the urgent need for more research in the field of organisational psychology in the maritime industry and the discrepancies between these findings, which are consistent with the existing maritime literature, and other studies that do not include seafarers in their sample groups.

                Background and aim This quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a mixture of 0.5% deltamethrin, 0.75% S-bio-allethrin, and 10% piperonyl butoxide (DAP) in eliminating Aedes mosquitoes in 10 areas of a high-risk district for dengue fever. Methods Susceptibility tests for Aedes against deltamethrin (1:1.000) Aedes) were conducted between October 2022 and December 2022. Data analysis using descriptive statistics was presented with frequency percentage, average, standard deviation, median, at 25 and 75 percentiles, and inferential statistics to compare mean differences within and between groups using independent t-test statistics. Results The results showed that these isolates were susceptible to deltamethrin. The mortality difference rate between DAP indoors was significantly more effective than 0.5% deltamethrin at 0.05 (p-value=0.04). The mortality difference rate between the mortality rate of DAP outdoors was statistically significantly greater than 0.5% deltamethrin at a level of 0.05 (p-value<0.001). The mortality difference means of Aedes caused by DAP indoors and outdoors were statistically different at 0.05 (p-value<0.001), and it was found that the effectiveness of 0.5% deltamethrin in eliminating indoors was greater than outdoors by 70.1 (95% CI = 63.78-76.41). Conclusion Combining DAP effectively eliminated Aedes mosquitoes in indoor and outdoor environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-16/v1?src=rss">Artificial Intelligence in the Prediction of Stone-Free Status in Urinary Stone Disease Treated with Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Urolithiasis is one of the most common urological diseases worldwide. One of the most common therapy, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), has a high failure rate. The failure rate can be significantly reduced by identifying the candidates most likely to benefit from ESWL, for example, by using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Decision tree analysis (DTA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) represent a few of the machine learning approaches employed to forecast the stone-free outcome following ESWL. Methods 219 studies were searched through six electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, Proquest, SCOPUS). We employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and adhered to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD). To evaluate the potential bias in all the studies, we utilized the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Results 41,484 patients from 11 studies were included. The ML models highlight varying levels of diagnostic precision, with sensitivity spanning from 35-96%, and specificity ranging from 63-98.4%, and area under the curve falling between 0.49-0.96. It is shown in this study that the accuracy of RF and DTA in predicting stone-free status is superior than ANN. Conclusion ML is a comparable predictive method to statistical analysis in predicting stone-free status. Random forest method and DTA are superior MLs compared to ANN. Stone size, density, and 3D texture analysis are the most important variables to be considered in the ML models and should be included in the models to ensure accuracy of stone-free status prediction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-15/v1?src=rss">Concurrent stunting among under-five children in Egypt [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Stunting still represents a major public health problem in Egypt, impacting around one-third of children under five and leading to a 2-3% drop in Gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, this study examined the trends in the prevalence of stunting and its associated factors among children aged 0-23 months, 24-59 months and 0-59 months in Egypt. Methods The study used combined data from the 2005, 2008, and 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS), with a total sample of 39,857 children aged 0-59 months. A multilevel logistic regression that adjusts for sampling weights and clustering was performed to analyse the factors associated with stunting among children in Egypt. Results The prevalence of stunting was 24.8% in children aged 0-23 months, 24.3% in children aged 24-59 months, and 24.5 % in children aged 0-59 months. After controlling for potential confounders, the common factors associated with stunting in three age groups were mothers with primary education and mothers who did not have an antenatal care (ANC) visit during pregnancy. Maternal short stature (height < 155 cm) was associated with an increased risk of stunting in three age groups compared to mothers taller than 160 cm. Conclusion Addressing the causes of stunting in Egypt necessitates sectoral collaboration, including health, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, and social protection, with the implementation of targeted interventions focusing on children born to short mothers. Interventions must be accessible for families with low socioeconomic status, focusing on improved healthcare access, parent education, and infant and young child feeding practices. A systematic nutrition monitoring framework that enables routine data collection on nutritional outcomes to monitor and improve child health is recommended.

                Metabolic adaptations are key to cancer cell survival in nutrient-limited microenvironments, but strategies for coping with arginine scarcity are poorly understood. Dunlap et al. use CRISPR screening and metabolomics to identify the plasma membrane transporter SLC7A5 as a citrulline transporter essential for cancer cell growth under arginine limitation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91422">Diversity in Notch ligand-receptor signaling interactions</a></h4>

              
                The Notch signaling pathway uses families of ligands and receptors to transmit signals to nearby cells. These components are expressed in diverse combinations in different cell types, interact in a many-to-many fashion, both within the same cell (in cis) and between cells (in trans), and their interactions are modulated by Fringe glycosyltransferases. A fundamental question is how the strength of Notch signaling depends on which pathway components are expressed, at what levels, and in which cells. Here, we used a quantitative, bottom-up, cell-based approach to systematically characterize trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation signaling efficiencies across a range of ligand and Fringe expression levels in Chinese hamster and mouse cell lines. Each ligand (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) and receptor variant (Notch1 and Notch2) analyzed here exhibited a unique profile of interactions, Fringe dependence, and signaling outcomes. All four ligands were able to bind receptors in cis and in trans, and all ligands trans-activated both receptors, although Jag1-Notch1 signaling was substantially weaker than other ligand-receptor combinations. Cis-interactions were predominantly inhibitory, with the exception of the Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 pairs, which exhibited cis-activation stronger than trans-activation. Lfng strengthened Delta-mediated trans-activation and weakened Jagged-mediated trans-activation for both receptors. Finally, cis-ligands showed diverse cis-inhibition strengths, which depended on the identity of the trans-ligand as well as the receptor. The map of receptor-ligand-Fringe interaction outcomes revealed here should help guide rational perturbation and control of the Notch pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88287">Why the brown ghost chirps at night</a></h4>

              
                Since the pioneering work by Moeller, Szabo, and Bullock, weakly electric fish have served as a valuable model for investigating spatial and social cognitive abilities in a vertebrate taxon usually less accessible than mammals or other terrestrial vertebrates. These fish, through their electric organ, generate low-intensity electric fields to navigate and interact with conspecifics, even in complete darkness. The brown ghost knifefish is appealing as a study subject due to a rich electric ‘vocabulary’, made by individually variable and sex-specific electric signals. These are mainly characterized by brief frequency modulations of the oscillating dipole moment continuously generated by their electric organ, and are known as chirps. Different types of chirps are believed to convey specific and behaviorally salient information, serving as behavioral readouts for different internal states during behavioral observations. Despite the success of this model in neuroethology over the past seven decades, the code to decipher their electric communication remains unknown. To this aim, in this study we re-evaluate the correlations between signals and behavior offering an alternative, and possibly complementary, explanation for why these freshwater bottom dwellers emit electric chirps. By uncovering correlations among chirping, electric field geometry, and detectability in enriched environments, we present evidence for a previously unexplored role of chirps as specialized self-directed signals, enhancing conspecific electrolocation during social encounters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100455">The Drosophila hematopoietic niche assembles through collective cell migration controlled by neighbor tissues and Slit-Robo signaling</a></h4>

              
                Niches are often found in specific positions in tissues relative to the stem cells they support. Consistency of niche position suggests that placement is important for niche function. However, the complexity of most niches has precluded a thorough understanding of how their proper placement is established. To address this, we investigated the formation of a genetically tractable niche, the <i>Drosophila</i> Posterior Signaling Center (PSC), the assembly of which had not been previously explored. This niche controls hematopoietic progenitors of the lymph gland (LG). PSC cells were previously shown to be specified laterally in the embryo, but ultimately reside dorsally, at the LG posterior. Here, using live-imaging, we show that PSC cells migrate as a tight collective and associate with multiple tissues during their trajectory to the LG posterior. We find that Slit emanating from two extrinsic sources, visceral mesoderm and cardioblasts, is required for the PSC to remain a collective, and for its attachment to cardioblasts during migration. Without proper Slit-Robo signaling, PSC cells disperse, form aberrant contacts, and ultimately fail to reach their stereotypical position near progenitors. Our work characterizes a novel example of niche formation and identifies an extrinsic signaling relay that controls precise niche positioning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101032">Capsular Polysaccharide Restrains Type VI Secretion in Acinetobacter baumannii</a></h4>

              
                The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a sophisticated, contact-dependent nanomachine involved in interbacterial competition. To function effectively, the T6SS must penetrate the membranes of both attacker and target bacteria. Structures associated with the cell envelope, like polysaccharides chains, can therefore introduce spatial separation and steric hindrance, potentially affecting the efficacy of the T6SS. In this study, we examined how the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> affects T6SS's antibacterial function. Our findings show that the CPS confers resistance against T6SS-mediated assaults from rival bacteria. Notably, under typical growth conditions, the presence of the surface-bound capsule also reduces the efficacy of the bacterium's own T6SS. This T6SS impairment is further enhanced when CPS is overproduced due to genetic modifications or antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bacterium adjusts the level of the T6SS inner tube protein Hcp according to its secretion capacity, by initiating a degradation process involving the ClpXP protease. Collectively, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between T6SS and CPS and how they respond swiftly to environmental challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95267">Nicotine enhances the stemness and tumorigenicity in intestinal stem cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signal pathway</a></h4>

              
                Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism underlying the NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. Hence, this study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs and suggests the use of DBZ as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The p48 MW HPC is a novel low-profile flow diverter covered by a hydrophilic polymer coating with antithrombogenic properties, which may reduce ischemic complications and enable a single antiplatelet therapy after insertion of the stent. In this single-center experience, we describe the efficacy of this device, focusing on the illustration of different therapeutic indications and the outcome in various clinical settings with regard to vessel anatomy, bleeding state, and aneurysm configuration. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our database for all patients being treated with a p48 MW HPC flow diverter between February 2019 and July 2021. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated according to the O&amp;amp;rsquo;Kelly&amp;amp;ndash;Marotta (OKM) scale in the last digital subtraction angiography (DSA) follow-up. Information on complications and medications were collected from our medical records. In addition, to illustrate different indications and clinical settings, we present six of these cases in closer detail. Results: 18 aneurysms in 14 patients were treated with the p48 MW HPC flow diverter and in one case with an additional Derivo device. Periprocedural events occurred in 28.6% of the treated patients, which were all successfully resolved within the same session. Follow-up examination information was available for 67% of patients, of which 75% showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm and 83.3% showed a favorable occlusion result (OKM C-D). Two patients with ruptured aneurysms received a single antiplatelet therapy with ASA without thrombotic complications, at least in the short term. New braid deformation patterns were observed in 16.6% at the follow-up examination, but none with subsequent clinical significance. Conclusions: The p48 MW HPC is safe and effective in the treatment of a wide spectrum of differently configurated, ruptured, and unruptured aneurysms. Single antiplatelet therapy might be an option in selected cases.</p>

	<p>Background: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor deficits and non-motor symptoms, such as depression, which are associated with dopaminergic loss and &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein aggregation in the brain. Objectives: This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of a hydroalcoholic extract of the purple fruit of Eugenia uniflora (PFEU) on motor ability and depressive-like behaviors in a PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in female Wistar rats. Methods: Rats received intranasal administration of MPTP or vehicle, followed by 14 days of oral administration of PFEU (300 or 2000 mg/kg, administered once daily) or vehicle. Depressive-like behavior was assessed using the splash and forced swimming tests, while motor ability was evaluated using the rotarod and open field tests. On day 15, hippocampal tissue was collected for immunoreactivity analysis. Results: MPTP treatment induced depressive-like behavior, which was significantly reversed by PFEU, as evidenced by increased grooming and decreased immobility. No motor coordination or locomotion deficits were observed. Furthermore, PFEU treatment prevented the MPTP-induced increase in hippocampal &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein, p-p53, and Bax while restoring Bcl-2 levels, suggesting neuroprotective effects through the modulation of apoptotic pathways and &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein. Conclusions: These findings support PFEU&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential as a neuroprotective agent for MPTP-induced depressive-like behavior in female rats, highlighting its molecular mechanisms.</p>

                Stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING1) is an immune adaptor protein which promotes innate immune defense mechanisms against pathogens. To enhance our understanding of STING1-associated disease, it is essential to make high-performing antibodies accessible to the scientific community. This study aims to improve reliability of STING1 research as we have characterized sixteen STING1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Higher education is experiencing an increase in students with disabilities, necessitating considering their interests and well-being when preparing educational services. Students with disabilities make up one of the most significant minority groups among students in terms of diversity. Aims This study explored the experiences of students with disabilities at a university in the United Arab Emirates. It also aimed to understand students with disabilities’ social and academic experiences and the factors affecting their university persistence. Methods We used a descriptive qualitative research approach to understand how students with disabilities experience the phenomenon under study. Twenty-five students participated, chosen via purposeful sampling. The data was collected using semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed using content analysis. Results We found four themes that emerged from this study: (1) perceptions about the university, (2) socialization and integration, (3) barriers to the university journey, and (4) support for the journey. Conclusion We found that students with disabilities indicated positive and negative perspectives and experiences. We recommend modifying the physical, social, and educational environments to support the education of students with disabilities. Future studies should employ a more varied sample and include academics and students to collect different perspectives while stressing the students’ experiences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-13/v1?src=rss">Policy Brief: Addressing Barriers and Empowering Entrepreneurs in Lebanon. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This policy brief examines the key factors influencing entrepreneurial success in Lebanon, focusing on gender dynamics, socio-cultural barriers, and systemic challenges. Entrepreneurship plays a critical role in Lebanon’s economic growth, innovation, and job creation, yet local entrepreneurs face significant obstacles. These challenges, including high operational costs, political instability, and gender-based discrimination, are compounded by limited access to resources such as funding, networks, and mentorship, particularly for women. The brief draws on data from the MENA Entrepreneurship and Labour Market Survey (MELMS) to provide insights into Lebanon’s entrepreneurial landscape. Based on the findings, this brief highlights the urgent need for targeted policy interventions aimed at enhancing the entrepreneurial ecosystem and addressing gender inequities. The recommendations include increasing awareness of support services, improving access to financial resources, fostering innovation through tech hubs and R&D incentives, and promoting a more inclusive entrepreneurial culture. To address gender-specific barriers, the brief proposes expanding training and mentorship programs tailored for women, along with targeted outreach efforts to bridge the gap in access to information. Strengthening Lebanon’s entrepreneurial ecosystem through public-private partnerships, international collaborations, and leveraging the Lebanese diaspora is also critical for driving economic resilience. The proposed recommendations call for the establishment of a National Entrepreneurship Strategy that integrates public institutions, NGOs, and private sector initiatives to foster sustainable growth. By creating a more supportive environment for entrepreneurs, Lebanon can unlock its entrepreneurial potential, driving long-term innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness. This brief aims to inform policymakers, donors, and stakeholders of strategic interventions that can contribute to Lebanon’s economic revitalisation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-12/v1?src=rss">Navigating contronyms: A cognitive-semantic analysis of the Arabic semi-preposition /warāʾa/ [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the Arabic semi-prepositional contronym /warā’a/ in the Holy Quran, which conveys the dual meanings of ‘behind’ and ‘in front of.’ By employing cognitive linguistic frameworks—Prototype Theory, Image Schema Theory, Conceptual Metaphor Theory, and Frame Semantics—the research investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying the term’s semantic versatility. Methods An in-depth cognitive linguistic analysis was conducted, supported by collocational analysis to explore how /warā’a/ is interpreted in diverse contexts. The study analyzed both prototypical spatial meanings and their metaphorical extensions, focusing on semantic priming and contextual interpretation. Results The findings reveal that the prototypical spatial meaning of /warā’a/ (‘behind’) dynamically extends to metaphorical and temporal contexts, encompassing ideas of concealment, control, deliberate ignorance, future anticipation, and other nuanced interpretations. The research highlights the role of semantic priming in shaping contextual meanings and offers actionable insights for translation accuracy in religious texts. Conclusions This study fills gaps in existing research by providing a detailed exploration of /warā’a/’s semantic complexity. It bridges theoretical insights and practical applications, offering innovative strategies for linguistics and translation studies. Future research directions include cross-linguistic studies of contronyms, psycholinguistic experiments on contradictory meanings, and culturally-informed cognitive-semantic translation strategies. This work contributes significantly to Arabic linguistics and cognitive translation studies.

                Background Anti-viral therapy is not routinely recommended for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in patients who have persistently elevated serum HBV DNA level (>2000 IU/mL), normal alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and without significant liver fibrosis, defining the indeterminate phase. The objective of the study is to identify the factors associated with the progression of liver fibrosis in chronic HBV infected patients in the indeterminate phase. Methods This is cross-sectional study, conducted in Infectious Disease and Hepato-gastroenterology departments of Farhat Hached university hospital, between January 2008 and January 2022. We have included the Ag HBs (+) patients initially not treated, presenting at the time of the initial evaluation: a viral load> 2,000 IU/L for at least six months, normal ALAT (<40UI) and a fibrosis score F0 and/or F1 (in liverbiopsy or FibroScan). Univariate and logisticreg ression analysis were performed to identify the factors associated with liver fibrosis progression. Results In total, 97 patients were included, with a median age of 32.9± 9.1 years, and a female predominance (sex ratio M/F=0.64). Progression of fibrosis was observed in 16 patients (16.5%) with a mean delay of 70.9±41.1 months. In the univariate analysis, factors associated with progression of fibrosis were the presence of comorbidities (p=0.001), the high initial viral load (p=0.004), the appearance of cytolysis (p=0.001) and the increase in viral load (p=0.002), during follow-up. The AUROC of the initial viral load was 0.664 (95%CI: 0.500-0.820). An intial viral load at 8090 UI/l was associated with the progression of fibrosis with a sensibility of 70.3% and specificity of 63%. Conclusion Factors associated with progression of fibrosis in the indeterminate phase of chronic HBV infection were the presence of comorbidities, and changes of ALAT during follow-up. This leads us to consider extending the therapeutic indications to this group of patients.

                Background Quality of neonatal transport services may impact outcomes. We assessed the effect of skill-based education of ambulance personnel (AP) on outcomes of transported neonates. Methods We conducted a single-arm intervention study (pre and post) over 18 months. We assessed the perceptions and practices of AP on neonatal transport along with ambulance equipment availability/usage. We compared neonatal clinical vital parameters at arrival and clinical outcomes from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) pre versus post intervention. We analysed data using SPSS version 25. Results Of 77 AP receiving education, there was significant (p < 0.001) improvement in the perceptions/practices towards temperature regulation (44.55 ± 23.94 vs. 25.94 ± 21.36), glucose homeostasis (46.27 ± 18.83 vs. 18.60 ± 17.50), maintaining asepsis (67.05 ± 17.53 vs. 39.35 ± 16.85), supporting airway (47.73 ± 25.39), circulation (85.26 ± 23.27 vs. 48.45 ± 25.10), along with ambulance equipment availability/usage postintervention. Of 53 neonates studied post intervention, there was a significant reduction in hypothermia (17% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.001), hypoglycemia (16.9% vs. 38.7%, p=0.010), and prolonged capillary refill time (71.7% vs. 46.8%, p=0.042), improvement in the use of intravenous fluids (69.8% vs. 29%, p <0.001), a reduction in growth from umbilical swabs (15.1% vs. 42%, p=0.002) and duration of NICU stay (p = 0.001). Conclusions After educational intervention there was significant improvement in the perceptions and practices of ‘108’ ambulance personnel towards transporting neonates and a significant decrease in hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and duration of NICU stay with improvement in maintenance of circulation and asepsis in neonates.

                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly affects the respiratory tract, but different organs may be involved including the kidney. Data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of AKI complicating critical forms of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective descriptive case/control monocentric study conducted in a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital over a period of 18 months. Results We enrolled 144 patients, with a mean age of 58±13 years old and a male predominance (sex-ratio: 1.25). Forty-one (28%) developed AKI within a median of 4 days (Q1: 3, Q3: 8.5) after hospitalization. It was staged KDIGO class 3, in about half of the cases. Thirteen patients underwent renal replacement therapy and renal function improved in seven cases. Diabetes (OR: 6.07; 95% CI: (1,30-28,4); p: 0.022), nephrotoxic antibiotics (OR: 21; 95% CI: (3,2-146); p: 0.002), and shock (OR: 12.21; 95% CI: (2.87-51.85); p: 0.031,) were the three independent risk factors of AKI onset. Mortality was significantly higher in AKI group (HR:12; 95% CI: (5.81-18.18); p:0.041) but AKI didn’t appear to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome. In fact, age > 53 years (p: 0.018), septic shock complicating hospital acquired infection (p: 0.003) and mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) were the three prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The incidence of AKI was high in this study and associated to an increased mortality. Diabetes, use of nephrotoxic antibiotics and shock contributed significantly to its occurrence. This underlines the importance of rationalizing antibiotic prescription and providing adequate management of patients with hemodynamic instability in order to prevent consequent AKI.

                Objective To compare iodine density (ID) and contrast-enhanced attenuation value (CEAV) from dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLSCT) scans of lymphomatous, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA), and normal cervical lymph nodes. Methods Data including ID and CEAV were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent DLSCT of the neck between January 2020 and August 2023. Results from each group (lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal) were compared and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic curve. Results 129 cervical lymph nodes were collected from patients who met the inclusion criteria (50, 41, and 38 nodes from the lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal group, respectively). The mean ID of lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal nodes was 1.01±0.27, 1.36±0.28, and 1.45±0.29 mg/mL, respectively. Comparing lymphomatous nodes with metastatic SCCA nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.002) and CEAV (p<0.001). Similarly, when comparing lymphomatous nodes with normal nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.001) and CEAV (p<0.001). The optimal ID cut-off value for distinguishing between lymphomatous and metastatic SCCA nodes was 1.175 mg/ml (specificity of 84.2%, sensitivity 77.8%, AUC 0.788, P = 0.003). The optimal CEAV cut-off value was 77.5 HU (specificity 88.9%, sensitivity 78.9%, AUC 0.851, P<0.001). Conclusions The ID and CEAV measurements from DLSCT were significantly different between lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal lymph nodes. These findings indicate that DLSCT can be used to distinguish between these conditions in the diagnosis of cervical lymph nodes.

                Background Muscarinic receptor agonism and positive allosteric modulation is a promising mechanism of action for treating psychosis, not present in most D2R-blocking antipsychotics. Xanomeline, an M1/M4-preferring agonist, has shown efficacy in late-stage clinical trials, with more compounds being investigated. Therefore, we aim to synthesize evidence on the preclinical efficacy of muscarinic receptor agonists and positive allosteric modulators in animal models of psychosis to provide unique insights and evidence-based information to guide drug development. Methods We plan a systematic review and meta-analysis of in vivo animal studies comparing muscarinic receptor agonists or positive allosteric modulators with control conditions and existing D2R-blocking antipsychotics in animals subjected to any method that induces behavioural changes of relevance for psychosis. We will identify eligible studies by searching multiple electronic databases. At least two independent reviewers will conduct the study selection and data extraction using prespecified forms and assess the risk of bias with the SYRCLE’s tool. Our primary outcomes include locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition measured with standardized mean differences. We will examine other behavioural readouts of relevance for psychosis as secondary outcomes, such as social interaction and cognitive function. We will synthesize the data using multi-level meta-analysis with a predefined random-effects structure, considering the non-independence of the data. In meta-regressions we will explore potential sources of heterogeneity from a predefined list of characteristics of the animal population, model, and intervention. We will assess the confidence in the evidence considering a self-developed instrument thatconsiders the internal and external validity of the evidence.

                Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

                Background Synthetic data’s utility in benchmark studies depends on its ability to closely mimic real-world conditions and reproduce results obtained from experimental data. Building on Nearing et al.’s study (1), who assessed 14 differential abundance tests using 38 experimental 16S rRNA datasets in a case-control design, we are generating synthetic datasets that mimic the experimental data to verify their findings. We will employ statistical tests to rigorously assess the similarity between synthetic and experimental data and to validate the conclusions on the performance of these tests drawn by Nearing et al. (1). This protocol adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines, demonstrating how established reporting frameworks can support robust, transparent, and unbiased study planning. Methods We replicate Nearing et al.’s (1) methodology, incorporating synthetic data simulated using two distinct tools, mirroring the 38 experimental datasets. Equivalence tests will be conducted on a non-redundant subset of 46 data characteristics comparing synthetic and experimental data, complemented by principal component analysis for overall similarity assessment. The 14 differential abundance tests will be applied to synthetic and experimental datasets, evaluating the consistency of significant feature identification and the number of significant features per tool. Correlation analysis and multiple regression will explore how differences between synthetic and experimental data characteristics may affect the results. Conclusions Synthetic data enables the validation of findings through controlled experiments. We assess how well synthetic data replicates experimental data, try to validate previous findings with the most recent versions of the DA methods and delineate the strengths and limitations of synthetic data in benchmark studies. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first computational benchmark study to systematically incorporate synthetic data for validating differential abundance methods while strictly adhering to a pre-specified study protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, contributing to transparency, reproducibility, and unbiased research.

                The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) is a modulator of lipid metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SCD1 plays in health and disease can provide novel insides in therapeutic targets, a process that would be facilitated by the availability of high-quality antibodies. Here we have characterized nine SCD1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Liver diseases cause nearly 2 million deaths worldwide each year, with approximately 1 million deaths from cirrhosis complications and another 1 million from viral hepatitis and liver cancer, according to WHO estimates. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the primary curative option, boasting success rates of 85% in the first year and 75% at five years post-transplant. Despite high costs, LT is considered cost-effective, especially for younger patients with active work years remaining. However, post-transplant complications, particularly intrahepatic cholestasis, present notable challenges. This complication arises from factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, infections, immunological rejection, and surgical complications, all contributing to impaired bile flow and liver damage. Current medical therapies for post-LT cholestasis are limited, with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) frequently used, despite questionable efficacy. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a potent Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist approved by the FDA for treating primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has shown potential benefits in reducing elevated cholestatic liver enzymes. Given its significant effects on liver health, OCA may offer therapeutic value in managing post-transplant cholestasis and improving graft survival. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate OCA’s efficacy compared to UDCA in reducing cholestatic injury and enhancing graft function post-LT. The primary outcomes will focus on a 15% reduction in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline one month. Secondary outcomes include molecular markers, biliary complications, graft rejection, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Results are anticipated to demonstrate that OCA could improve graft survival, reduce complications, and enhance quality of life, potentially setting a new standard in post-LT care if found beneficial.

                <p>by Shoutik Mukherjee, Behtash Babadi, Shihab Shamma</p>

Characterizing neuronal responses to natural stimuli remains a central goal in sensory neuroscience. In auditory cortical neurons, the stimulus selectivity of elicited spiking activity is summarized by a spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF) that relates neuronal responses to the stimulus spectrogram. Though effective in characterizing primary auditory cortical responses, STRFs of non-primary auditory neurons can be quite intricate, reflecting their mixed selectivity. The complexity of non-primary STRFs hence impedes understanding how acoustic stimulus representations are transformed along the auditory pathway. Here, we focus on the relationship between ferret primary auditory cortex (A1) and a secondary region, dorsal posterior ectosylvian gyrus (PEG). We propose estimating receptive fields in PEG with respect to a well-established high-dimensional computational model of primary-cortical stimulus representations. These “cortical receptive fields” (CortRF) are estimated greedily to identify the salient primary-cortical features modulating spiking responses and in turn related to corresponding spectrotemporal features. Hence, they provide biologically plausible hierarchical decompositions of STRFs in PEG. Such CortRF analysis was applied to PEG neuronal responses to speech and temporally orthogonal ripple combination (TORC) stimuli and, for comparison, to A1 neuronal responses. CortRFs of PEG neurons captured their selectivity to more complex spectrotemporal features than A1 neurons; moreover, CortRF models were more predictive of PEG (but not A1) responses to speech. Our results thus suggest that secondary-cortical stimulus representations can be computed as sparse combinations of primary-cortical features that facilitate encoding natural stimuli. Thus, by adding the primary-cortical representation, we can account for PEG single-unit responses to natural sounds better than bypassing it and considering as input the auditory spectrogram. These results confirm with explicit details the presumed hierarchical organization of the auditory cortex.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) after a long latent period in a fraction of infected individuals. These HTLV-1-infected cells typically have phenotypes similar to that of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, but the cell status is not well understood. To extract the inherent information of HTLV-1-infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, we integratively analyzed the ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data of the infected cells. Compared to CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells from healthy donors, we found anomalous chromatin accessibility in HTLV-1infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells derived from ATL cases in terms of location and sample-to-sample fluctuations in open chromatin regions. Further, by focusing on systematically selected genes near the open chromatin regions, we quantified the difference between the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in ATL cases and healthy CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in terms of the correlation between the chromatin structures and the gene expressions. Based on a further analysis of chromatin accessibility, we detected <i>TLL1</i> (Tolloid Like 1) as one of the key genes that exhibit unique gene expressions in ATL cases. A luciferase assay indicated that TLL1 has an isoform-dependent regulatory effect on TGF-<i>β</i>. Overall, this study provides results about the status of HTLV-1-infected cells, which are qualitatively consistent across the different scales of chromatin accessibility, transcription, and immunophenotype.

                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee members’ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Aim This quantitative study aimed to develop and evaluate instruments to measure responsible tourism behavior with high academic standards. Methods Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were employed to test the model’s fit with the empirical data. The sample consists of 550 Generation Y tourists selected through multistage quota random sampling. The instruments were created by the researchers to consist of 45 items, each rated on a 6-point scale. Results The analysis results supported all three hypotheses, with the instruments showing an average reliability of .812. The EFA results indicated that 12 items met the criteria, derived from three main components: environmental (four items), social and cultural (four items), and economic (four items). These components explain 62.118% of the variance in responsible tourism behavior. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis results show that the model fits the empirical data well, with indices meeting the standard criteria: χ2 = 52.790, df = 45, p-value = .198, RMSEA = .034, CFI = .979, TLI = .969, SRMA = .054. Conclusioin In conclusion, the researchers suggest using responsible tourism behavior measurement instruments experimentally to create social indices or to further study causal factors and effects.

                Background The search for efficient treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has highlighted the potential of plant-based therapeutic compounds and eco-friendly processes for producing selenium nanoparticles. This study investigates the antidiabetic potential of Moringa oleifera-mediated biogenic selenium nanoparticles (MO-SeNPs) in diabetic rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced with diabetes via a high-fat diet for 2 weeks followed by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) at 45 mg/kg body weight (BW). The rats were divided into five groups: normal, diabetic control, metformin at 100 mg/kg/BW, and two groups treated with oral administration of MO-SeNPs at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg body weight for 28 days. Food and water intake as well as fasting blood glucose and body weight were measured weekly. After the treatment period, rats were sacrificed, and blood and liver samples were harvested for further analysis. Results MO-SeNPs treatment significantly reduced blood glucose levels (p < 0.05) and restored insulin resistance, with lower dose demonstrating better glycaemic control than larger dose. MO-SeNPs also increased hepatic antioxidant enzyme activity, including GSH-Px, CAT, and T-SOD, which neutralise oxidative stress. MO-SeNPs also improves cardiovascular health by raising HDL and lowering LDL. MO-SeNPs showed hepatoprotective benefits by lowering inflammatory markers such TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, and AGEs, and reduced lipid peroxidation. Diabetes raises inflammatory indicators, causing liver damage and other problems. The reduction in these indicators shows MO-SeNPs reduce liver inflammation and protect the liver. The normalisation of liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP) showed improved liver function. Conclusions The findings suggest that the green synthesis of SeNPs using Moringa oleifera offers a viable alternative for diabetes treatment, highlighting its potential to enhance glycemic control and improve overall metabolic health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-6/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Case report: a rare case of dentigerous cyst in 1-year-old patient. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                One of the most common benign lesions is dentigerous cyst, which is commonly associated with unerupted tooth crowns. Dentigerous cysts in infants may manifest as swelling or a firm mass in the oral cavity. Such cysts arise from dental follicles, and their development can lead to dental complications such as tooth displacement, root resorption of the adjacent teeth, or infection if not treated carefully. Enucleation is the method of choice for the treatment of such lesions. In the current case report, a rare age presented with 1 a old patient was referred to oral and maxillofacial clinics. In the case of right facial swelling and pain for five days ago, intra- and extra-oral examinations were performed. Computed Tomography (CT) demonstrated a well-defined expansile lytic lesion, and parents consented and agreed to proceed with the surgery option. Enucleation was performed surgically, and the patient was followed up for up to 8 months. Significant improvement was noted, with no further complications or recorded complaints.

                Huntingtin encodes a 3144 amino acid protein, with a polyglutamine repeat tract at the N-terminus. Expansion of this repeat tract above a pathogenic threshold of 36 repeats is the causative mutation of Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons. Here we have characterized twenty Huntingtin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background The major component of patchouli oil, patchouli alcohol, is used as fixative and has antimicrobial activity. The function of other components, such as α-guaiene, remains unknown. Therefore, this study reports the antifungal activity of α-guaiene isolated from patchouli oil against for pathogenic fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans ATCC 7102, Microsporum gypseum ATCC 14683, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes ATCC 16404. Methods The material from fraction (249°C-254°C) had the highest α-guaiene. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined using the microdilution technique to evaluate antifungal activity, with n-hexane and medium serving as negative controls, and ketoconazole and fluconazole serving as positive controls. Results The results showed that the MIC value was determined at 45%, 50% for C. albicans, 55%, 60% for A. niger, 50%, 60% for M. gypseum, and 95%, 100% for T. mentagrophytes, respectively. Positive and medium controls demonstrated no microbial growth, whereas negative and growth controls revealed the presence of microorganisms. Fungus resistance to α-guaiene T. mentagrophytes exhibited the highest MIC value. Conclusions Overall, this study reveals that α-guaiene is a promising agent effective against the studied pathogenic fungi.

                Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts wet biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword “liquefaction” emerges as the most popular term in these publications.

                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concurrent illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs and classified based on the severity from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Based on the severity, most pDDIs belong to the ‘moderate’ category (40.07%). Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in identifying and preventing DDIs early, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

<p>A general summary of the experimental design and results of the present experiments.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Evidence suggests that hippocampal (HPC) disruption following learning produces retrograde amnesia on a range of tasks. Many of these tasks do not require HPC function in the anterograde direction suggesting that, in the intact brain, the HPC is actively involved during all forms of learning. However, prior work has also demonstrated double dissociations of HPC and amygdala function, which is inconsistent with this view. Here, we aim to understand this discrepancy by assessing the effects of neurotoxic lesions of the HPC on anterograde and retrograde amnesia for conditioned place preference (CPP). This task is dependent on a network centered on the basolateral amygdala and not the HPC. The results show that extensive HPC damage had no impact on the acquisition or expression of CPP. One explanation for this result is that the task requires multiple, distributed training sessions for conditioning to emerge, and it has been proposed that this parameter may eliminate the need for HPC to support memory. To test this, we completed experiments to probe place learning in the Morris water task, which is thought to always require HPC function, but implemented an over-training procedure before HPC damage. We found that rats were severely impaired suggesting that this task parameter does not always allow non-HPC networks to support learning. Finally, an experiment was designed to test whether memories acquired by distinct memory networks on the same days, within hours of one another, would be linked in HPC. The results showed that they remained independent of one another.</p>
