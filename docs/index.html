              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11012">Attractor-based models for sequences and pattern generation in neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural circuits in the brain perform a variety of essential functions, including input classification, pattern completion, and the generation of rhythms and oscillations that support processes such as breathing and locomotion. There is also substantial evidence that the brain encodes memories and processes information via sequences of neural activity. In this dissertation, we are focused on the general problem of how neural circuits encode rhythmic activity, as in central pattern generators (CPGs), as well as the encoding of sequences. Traditionally, rhythmic activity and CPGs have been modeled using coupled oscillators. Here we take a different approach, and present models for several different neural functions using threshold-linear networks. Our approach aims to unify attractor-based models (e.g., Hopfield networks) which encode static and dynamic patterns as attractors of the network.
  In the first half of this dissertation, we present several attractor-based models. These include: a network that can count the number of external inputs it receives; two models for locomotion, one encoding five different quadruped gaits and another encoding the orientation system of a swimming mollusk; and, finally, a model that connects the fixed point sequences with locomotion attractors to obtain a network that steps through a sequence of dynamic attractors. In the second half of the thesis, we present new theoretical results, some of which have already been published. There, we established conditions on network architectures to produce sequential attractors. Here we also include several new theorems relating the fixed points of composite networks to those of their component subnetworks, as well as a new architecture for layering networks which produces "fusion" attractors by minimizing interference between the attractors of individual layers.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11016">Intramuscular High-Density Micro-Electrode Arrays Enable High-Precision Decoding and Mapping of Spinal Motor Neurons to Reveal Hand Control</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding nervous system activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and neural interfacing. In this study, we propose a novel neural decoding system that enables unprecedented large-scale sampling of muscle activity. Using micro-electrode arrays with more than 100 channels embedded within the forearm muscles, we recorded high-density signals that captured multi-unit motor neuron activity. This extensive sampling was complemented by advanced methods for neural decomposition, analysis, and classification, allowing us to accurately detect and interpret the spiking activity of spinal motor neurons that innervate hand muscles. We evaluated this system in two healthy participants, each implanted with three electromyogram (EMG) micro-electrode arrays (comprising 40 electrodes each) in the forearm. These arrays recorded muscle activity during both single- and multi-digit isometric contractions. For the first time under controlled conditions, we demonstrate that multi-digit tasks elicit unique patterns of motor neuron recruitment specific to each task, rather than employing combinations of recruitment patterns from single-digit tasks. This observation led us to hypothesize that hand tasks could be classified with high precision based on the decoded neural activity. We achieved perfect classification accuracy (100%) across 12 distinct single- and multi-digit tasks, and consistently high accuracy (>96\%) across all conditions and subjects, for up to 16 task classes. These results significantly outperformed conventional EMG classification methods. The exceptional performance of this system paves the way for developing advanced neural interfaces based on invasive high-density EMG technology. This innovation could greatly enhance human-computer interaction and lead to substantial improvements in assistive technologies, offering new possibilities for restoring motor function in clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11064">Parsing altered brain connectivity in neurodevelopmental disorders by integrating graph-based normative modeling and deep generative networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many neurodevelopmental disorders can be understood as divergent patterns of neural interactions during brain development. Advances in neuroimaging have illuminated these patterns by modeling the brain as a network structure using diffution MRI tractography. However, characterizing and quantifying individual heterogeneity in neurodevelopmental disorders within these highly complex brain networks remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present for the first time, a framework that integrates deep generative models with graph-based normative modeling to characterize brain network development in the neurotypical population, which can then be used to quantify the individual-level neurodivergence associated with disorders. Our deep generative model incorporates bio-inspired wiring constraints to effectively capture the developmental trajectories of neurotypical brain networks. Neurodivergence is quantified by comparing individuals to this neurotypical trajectory, enabling the creation of region-wise divergence maps that reveal latent developmental differences at each brain regions, along with overall neurodivergence scores based on predicted brain age gaps. We demonstrate the clinical utility of this framework by applying it to a large sample of children with autism spectrum disorders, showing that the individualized region-wise maps help parse the heterogeneity in autism, and the neurodivergence scores correlate with clinical assessments. Together, we provide powerful tools for quantifying neurodevelopmental divergence in brain networks, paying the way for developing imaging markers that will support disorder stratification, monitor progression, and evaluate therapeutic effectiveness.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11407">A Case for AI Consciousness: Language Agents and Global Workspace Theory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that existing artificial systems are not phenomenally conscious, and that the construction of phenomenally conscious artificial systems would require significant technological progress if it is possible at all. We challenge this assumption by arguing that if Global Workspace Theory (GWT) - a leading scientific theory of phenomenal consciousness - is correct, then instances of one widely implemented AI architecture, the artificial language agent, might easily be made phenomenally conscious if they are not already. Along the way, we articulate an explicit methodology for thinking about how to apply scientific theories of consciousness to artificial systems and employ this methodology to arrive at a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for phenomenal consciousness according to GWT.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11735">Probabilistic Principles for Biophysics and Neuroscience: Entropy Production, Bayesian Mechanics & the Free-Energy Principle</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on three fundamental aspects of biological systems; namely, entropy production, Bayesian mechanics, and the free-energy principle. The contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a greater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion process, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on all coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses Markovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored noise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and meso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a Bayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with their environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the internal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with variational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3) We refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is more specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This says that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising a quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy principle, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and simulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising free energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04525">Enhancing learning in spiking neural networks through neuronal heterogeneity and neuromodulatory signaling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.04525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from neuroscience, particularly with the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs). This has significantly enhanced the replication of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and natural language processing. Despite these advances, ANNs struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency - capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, ANNs often overlook the functional and morphological diversity of the brain, hindering their computational capabilities. Furthermore, incorporating cell-type specific neuromodulatory effects into ANNs with neuronal heterogeneity could enable learning at two spatial scales: spiking behavior at the neuronal level, and synaptic plasticity at the circuit level, thereby potentially enhancing their learning abilities. In this article, we summarize recent bio-inspired models, learning rules and architectures and propose a biologically-informed framework for enhancing ANNs. Our proposed dual-framework approach highlights the potential of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for emulating diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartments to simulate morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how the proposed approach integrates brain-inspired compartmental models and task-driven SNNs, balances bioinspiration and complexity, and provides scalable solutions for pressing AI challenges, such as continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency.

                arXiv:2410.08637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to predict future events or patterns based on previous experience is crucial for many applications such as traffic control, weather forecasting, or supply chain management. While modern supervised Machine Learning approaches excel at such sequential tasks, they are computationally expensive and require large training data. A previous work presented a biologically plausible sequence learning model, developed through a bottom-up approach, consisting of a spiking neural network and unsupervised local learning rules. The model in its original formulation identifies only a specific type of sequence elements composed of synchronous spikes by activating a subset of neurons with identical stimulus preference. In this work, we extend the model to detect and learn sequences of various spatio-temporal patterns (STPs) by incorporating plastic connections in the input synapses. We showcase that the model is able to learn and predict high-order sequences. We further study the robustness of the model against different input settings and parameters.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11249">Disentangling Representations through Multi-task Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.11249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent perception and interaction with the world hinges on internal representations that capture its underlying structure ("disentangled" or "abstract" representations). Disentangled representations serve as world models, isolating latent factors of variation in the world along orthogonal directions, thus facilitating feature-based generalization. We provide experimental and theoretical results guaranteeing the emergence of disentangled representations in agents that optimally solve multi-task evidence aggregation classification tasks, canonical in the cognitive neuroscience literature. The key conceptual finding is that, by producing accurate multi-task classification estimates, a system implicitly represents a set of coordinates specifying a disentangled representation of the underlying latent state of the data it receives. The theory provides conditions for the emergence of these representations in terms of noise, number of tasks, and evidence aggregation time. We experimentally validate these predictions in RNNs trained on multi-task classification, which learn disentangled representations in the form of continuous attractors, leading to zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in predicting latent factors. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework across autoregressive architectures, decision boundary geometries and in tasks requiring classification confidence estimation. We find that transformers are particularly suited for disentangling representations, which might explain their unique world understanding abilities. Overall, our framework puts forth parallel processing as a general principle for the formation of cognitive maps that capture the structure of the world in both biological and artificial systems, and helps explain why ANNs often arrive at human-interpretable concepts, and how they both may acquire exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce a generic, compositional and interpretable class of generative world models that supports open-ended learning agents. This is a sparse class of Bayesian networks capable of approximating a broad range of stochastic processes, which provide agents with the ability to learn world models in a manner that may be both interpretable and computationally scalable. This approach integrating Bayesian structure learning and intrinsically motivated (model-based) planning enables agents to actively develop and refine their world models, which may lead to developmental learning and more robust, adaptive behavior.

Abstract: The impact of initial connectivity on learning has been extensively studied in the context of backpropagation-based gradient descent, but it remains largely underexplored in biologically plausible learning settings. Focusing on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we found that the initial weight magnitude significantly influences the learning performance of biologically plausible learning rules in a similar manner to its previously observed effect on training via backpropagation through time (BPTT). By examining the maximum Lyapunov exponent before and after training, we uncovered the greater demands that certain initialization schemes place on training to achieve desired information propagation properties. Consequently, we extended the recently proposed gradient flossing method, which regularizes the Lyapunov exponents, to biologically plausible learning and observed an improvement in learning performance. To our knowledge, we are the first to examine the impact of initialization on biologically plausible learning rules for RNNs and to subsequently propose a biologically plausible remedy. Such an investigation could lead to predictions about the influence of initial connectivity on learning dynamics and performance, as well as guide neuromorphic design.

                arXiv:2402.08674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are unstructured or randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that both metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of "in-context learning" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples given at inference time. Here, we show that networks capable of ICL can reproduce human-like learning and compositional behavior on rule-governed tasks, while at the same time replicating human behavioral phenomena in tasks lacking rule-like structure via their usual in-weight learning (IWL). Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties than those traditionally attributed to them, and that these can coexist with the properties of their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.

Abstract: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into Neural Networks, enabling them to learn complex patterns. Different activation functions vary in speed and accuracy, ranging from faster but less accurate options like ReLU to slower but more accurate functions like SiLU or SELU. Typically, same activation function is used throughout an entire model architecture. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of using mixed activation functions in YOLO-based models, evaluating their impact on latency, memory usage, and accuracy across CPU, NPU, and GPU edge devices. We also propose a novel approach that leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design YOLO models with optimized mixed activation functions.The best model generated through this method demonstrates a slight improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to baseline model (SiLU), while it is 22.28% faster and consumes 64.15% less memory on the reference NPU device.

                arXiv:2410.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven flight computer, integrating an online free-retraining-prediction model, a swarm control, and an obstacle avoidance strategy, to track dynamic targets using a distributed drone swarm for military applications. To enable dynamic target tracking the swarm requires a trajectory prediction capability to achieve intercept allowing for the tracking of rapid maneuvers and movements while maintaining efficient path planning. Traditional predicative methods such as curve fitting or Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) have low robustness and struggle with dynamic target tracking in the short term due to slow convergence of single agent-based trajectory prediction and often require extensive offline training or tuning to be effective. Consequently, this paper introduces a novel robust adaptive bidirectional fuzzy brain emotional learning prediction (BFBEL-P) methodology to address these challenges. The controller integrates a fuzzy interface, a neural network enabling rapid adaption, predictive capability and multi-agent solving enabling multiple solutions to be aggregated to achieve rapid convergence times and high accuracy in both the short and long term. This was verified through the use of numerical simulations seeing complex trajectory being predicted and tracked by a swarm of drones. These simulations show improved adaptability and accuracy to state of the art methods in the short term and strong results over long time domains, enabling accurate swarm target tracking and predictive capability.

                arXiv:2410.11330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AfterLearnER (After Learning Evolutionary Retrofitting) consists in applying non-differentiable optimization, including evolutionary methods, to refine fully-trained machine learning models by optimizing a set of carefully chosen parameters or hyperparameters of the model, with respect to some actual, exact, and hence possibly non-differentiable error signal, performed on a subset of the standard validation set. The efficiency of AfterLearnER is demonstrated by tackling non-differentiable signals such as threshold-based criteria in depth sensing, the word error rate in speech re-synthesis, image quality in 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs), image generation via Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), the number of kills per life at Doom, computational accuracy or BLEU in code translation, and human appreciations in image synthesis. In some cases, this retrofitting is performed dynamically at inference time by taking into account user inputs. The advantages of AfterLearnER are its versatility (no gradient is needed), the possibility to use non-differentiable feedback including human evaluations, the limited overfitting, supported by a theoretical study and its anytime behavior. Last but not least, AfterLearnER requires only a minimal amount of feedback, i.e., a few dozens to a few hundreds of scalars, rather than the tens of thousands needed in most related published works. Compared to fine-tuning (typically using the same loss, and gradient-based optimization on a smaller but still big dataset at a fine grain), AfterLearnER uses a minimum amount of data on the real objective function without requiring differentiability.

                arXiv:2410.11488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent insights have revealed that rate-coding is a primary form of information representation captured by surrogate-gradient-based Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) in training deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Motivated by these findings, we propose rate-based backpropagation, a training strategy specifically designed to exploit rate-based representations to reduce the complexity of BPTT. Our method minimizes reliance on detailed temporal derivatives by focusing on averaged dynamics, streamlining the computational graph to reduce memory and computational demands of SNNs training. We substantiate the rationality of the gradient approximation between BPTT and the proposed method through both theoretical analysis and empirical observations. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR10-DVS validate that our method achieves comparable performance to BPTT counterparts, and surpasses state-of-the-art efficient training techniques. By leveraging the inherent benefits of rate-coding, this work sets the stage for more scalable and efficient SNNs training within resource-constrained environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tab-ct/rate-based-backpropagation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11502">Offline Model-Based Optimization by Learning to Rank</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.11502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than twenty existing methods.

                arXiv:2410.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep state-space models (Deep SSMs) have shown capabilities for in-context learning on autoregressive tasks, similar to transformers. However, the architectural requirements and mechanisms enabling this in recurrent networks remain unclear. This study demonstrates that state-space model architectures can perform gradient-based learning and use it for in-context learning. We prove that a single structured state-space model layer, augmented with local self-attention, can reproduce the outputs of an implicit linear model with least squares loss after one step of gradient descent. Our key insight is that the diagonal linear recurrent layer can act as a gradient accumulator, which can be `applied' to the parameters of the implicit regression model. We validate our construction by training randomly initialized augmented SSMs on simple linear regression tasks. The empirically optimized parameters match the theoretical ones, obtained analytically from the implicit model construction. Extensions to multi-step linear and non-linear regression yield consistent results. The constructed SSM encompasses features of modern deep state-space models, with the potential for scalable training and effectiveness even in general tasks. The theoretical construction elucidates the role of local self-attention and multiplicative interactions in recurrent architectures as the key ingredients for enabling the expressive power typical of foundation models.

Abstract: This study proposes a retinal prosthetic simulation framework driven by visual fixations, inspired by the saccade mechanism, and assesses performance improvements through end-to-end optimization in a classification task. Salient patches are predicted from input images using the self-attention map of a vision transformer to mimic visual fixations. These patches are then encoded by a trainable U-Net and simulated using the pulse2percept framework to predict visual percepts. By incorporating a learnable encoder, we aim to optimize the visual information transmitted to the retinal implant, addressing both the limited resolution of the electrode array and the distortion between the input stimuli and resulting phosphenes. The predicted percepts are evaluated using the self-supervised DINOv2 foundation model, with an optional learnable linear layer for classification accuracy. On a subset of the ImageNet validation set, the fixation-based framework achieves a classification accuracy of 87.72%, using computational parameters based on a real subject's physiological data, significantly outperforming the downsampling-based accuracy of 40.59% and approaching the healthy upper bound of 92.76%. Our approach shows promising potential for producing more semantically understandable percepts with the limited resolution available in retinal prosthetics.

                arXiv:2404.02911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-driven optimisation framework for analog circuit design in this paper. The primary objective is to determine the device sizes for the optimal performance of analog circuits for a given set of specifications. Our methodology entails employing machine learning models and spice simulations to direct the optimisation algorithm towards achieving the optimal design for analog circuits. Machine learning based global offline surrogate models, with the circuit design parameters as the input, are built in the design space for the analog circuits under study and is used to guide the optimisation algorithm, resulting in faster convergence and a reduced number of spice simulations. Multi-layer perceptron and random forest regressors are employed to predict the required design specifications of the analog circuit. Since the saturation condition of transistors is vital in the proper working of analog circuits, multi-layer perceptron classifiers are used to predict the saturation condition of each transistor in the circuit. The feasibility of the candidate solutions is verified using machine learning models before invoking spice simulations. We validate the proposed framework using three circuit topologies--a bandgap reference, a folded cascode operational amplifier, and a two-stage operational amplifier. The simulation results show better optimum values and lower standard deviations for fitness functions after convergence. Incorporating the machine learning-based predictions proposed in the optimisation method has resulted in the reduction of spice calls by 56%, 59%, and 83% when compared with standard approaches in the three test cases considered in the study.

                arXiv:2405.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-integer (MI) quadratic models subject to quadratic constraints, known as All-Quadratic MI Programs, constitute a challenging class of NP-complete optimization problems. The particular scenario of unbounded integers defines a subclass that holds the distinction of being even undecidable [Jeroslow, 1973]. This complexity suggests a possible soft-spot for Mathematical Programming (MP) techniques, which otherwise constitute a good choice to treat MI problems. We consider the task of minimizing MI convex quadratic objective and constraint functions with unbounded decision variables. Given the theoretical weakness of white-box MP solvers to handle such models, we turn to black-box meta-heuristics of the Evolution Strategies (ESs) family, and question their capacity to solve this challenge. Through an empirical assessment of all-quadratic test-cases, across varying Hessian forms and condition numbers, we compare the performance of the CPLEX solver to modern MI ESs, which handle constraints by penalty. Our systematic investigation begins where the CPLEX solver encounters difficulties (timeouts as the search-space dimensionality increases, D>=30), and we report in detail on the D=64 case. Overall, the empirical observations confirm that black-box and white-box solvers can be competitive, where CPLEX is evidently outperformed on 13% of the cases. This trend is flipped when unboundedness is amplified by a significant translation of the optima, leading to a totally inferior performance of CPLEX at 83% of the cases. We also conclude that conditioning and separability are not intuitive factors in determining the hardness degree of this class of MI problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19650">Few for Many: Tchebycheff Set Scalarization for Many-Objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.19650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization can be found in many real-world applications where some conflicting objectives can not be optimized by a single solution. Existing optimization methods often focus on finding a set of Pareto solutions with different optimal trade-offs among the objectives. However, the required number of solutions to well approximate the whole Pareto optimal set could be exponentially large with respect to the number of objectives, which makes these methods unsuitable for handling many optimization objectives. In this work, instead of finding a dense set of Pareto solutions, we propose a novel Tchebycheff set scalarization method to find a few representative solutions (e.g., 5) to cover a large number of objectives (e.g., $>100$) in a collaborative and complementary manner. In this way, each objective can be well addressed by at least one solution in the small solution set. In addition, we further develop a smooth Tchebycheff set scalarization approach for efficient optimization with good theoretical guarantees. Experimental studies on different problems with many optimization objectives demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

">Fast and robust visual object recognition in young children</a></h4>

              
                By adulthood, humans rapidly identify objects from sparse visual displays and across significant disruptions to their appearance. What are the minimal conditions needed to achieve robust recognition abilities and when might these abilities develop? To test this question, we investigated the upper-limits of children's object recognition abilities. We found that children as young as 3-years-of-age successfully identified objects at speeds of 100 ms (both forward and backward masked) under sparse and disrupted viewing conditions. By contrast, a range computational models implemented with biologically plausible properties or optimized for visual recognition did not reach child-level performance. Models only matched children if they were trained with more data than children are capable of experiencing. These findings highlight the robustness of the human visual system in the absence of extensive experience and identify important developmental constraints for building biologically plausible machines.

">Cell-extrinsic controls over neocortical neuron fate and diversity</a></h4>

              
                Cellular diversity in the neocortex emerges gradually during prenatal and postnatal development. While environmental interactions occur during this extended maturation period, the impact of extrinsic cues on determining the fate of distinct neuron types remains unknown. To address this question, we exposed developing neocortical cells to various environmental conditions and examined how this affects cell fate and diversity. Our developmental analyses reveal a hierarchical molecular program in which cell class-distinguishing features emerge [fi]rst, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics, with distinct developmental paces among cell populations. Environmental contribution was assessed in vivo, using genetically modi[fi]ed mice models in which position or innervation are altered, and in vitro using two-dimensional cultures. Acquisition of cellular identity and diversity remained stable across in vivo models. In contrast, in vitro glutamatergic neurons showed decreased expression of identity-de[fi]ning genes, reduced diversity and alterations in canonical cortical connectivity. Cellular identity and diversity were restored towards in vivo values in organotypic slice cultures. These [fi]ndings reveal cell population-speci[fi]c responses to environmental conditions and highlight the role of extracellular context in shaping cell diversity in the maturing neocortex.

">Disrupted Hippocampal-Prefrontal Networks In A Rat Model Of Fragile X Syndrome: A Study Linking Neural Dynamics To Autism-Like Behavioral Impairments</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is associated with autism spectrum symptoms that are associated with cognitive, learning, and behavioral challenges. We investigated how known molecular disruptions in the Fmr1 knockout (FMR-KO) rat model of FXS negatively impact hippocampal-prefrontal cortex (H-PFC) neural network activity and consequent behavior. Methods: FMR-KO and control rats underwent a battery of behavioral tests assessing sociability, memory, and anxiety. Single-unit electrophysiology recordings were then conducted to measure patterns of neural activity in H-PFC circuit. Advanced mathematical models were used to characterize the patterns that were then compared between groups using generalized linear mixed models. Results: FMR-KO rats demonstrated significant behavioral deficits in sociability, spatial learning, and anxiety, aligning with symptoms of ASD. At the neural level, these rats exhibited abnormal firing patterns in the H-PFC circuit that is critical for learning, memory, and social behavior. The neural networks in FMR-KO rats were also less densely connected and more fragmented, particularly in hippocampal-PFC correlated firing. These findings suggest that disruptions in neural network dynamics underlie the observed behavioral impairments in FMR-KO rats. Conclusion: FMR-KO significantly disrupts several characteristics of action potential firing in the H-PFC network, leading to deficits in social behavior, memory, and anxiety, as seen in FXS. This disruption is characterized by less organized and less resilient hippocampal-PFC networks. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing neural dynamics, such as with brain stimulation, could potentially improve behavior and cognitive functions in autistic individuals.

">ZMYND11 Functions in Bimodal Regulation of Latent Genes and Brain-like Splicing to Safeguard Corticogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Despite the litany of pathogenic variants linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) including autism (ASD) and intellectual disability, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms caused by risk genes remain unclear. Here, we leveraged a human pluripotent stem cell model to uncover the neurodevelopmental consequences of mutations in ZMYND11, a newly implicated risk gene. ZMYND11, known for its tumor suppressor function, encodes a histone-reader that recognizes sites of transcriptional elongation and acts as a co-repressor. Our findings reveal that ZMYND11-deficient cortical neural stem cells showed upregulation of latent developmental pathways, impairing progenitor and neuron production. In addition to its role on histones, ZMYND11 controls a brain-specific isoform switch involving the splicing regulator RBFOX2. Extending our findings to other chromatin-related ASD risk factors revealed similar developmental pathway activation and splicing dysregulation, partially rescuable through ZMYND11's regulatory functions.

">Attention networks engage the default mode network related to policy precision under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                In decision-making, choices impact the present and cascade into future decisions, highlighting the importance of confidence when making a decision. Here, we investigated the meta-network level neural correlates of this confidence by estimating the instantaneous changes in precision in selecting actions and comparing them with brain state trajectories. To confirm the relationship between behavioral and neural signals, we leveraged inter subject correlation to determine how similar the group shared components of time-series of precision-triggered meta-network occurrences are across participants and how this similarity changes during decision-making. We found that policy precision is a proper behavioral signal to explain the meta-network level neural dynamics. It positively correlated with the default mode network (DMN) dominant state, the occurrence of which is mutually exclusive with the dorsal attentional network-(DAN) and frontoparietal network (FPN)-dominant state, the activation of which is speculated to be associated with a highly uncertain state and arises from increased integration between the DAN, FPN, and DMN. Therefore, supporting the novel perspective that the DMN may reflect internal beliefs, these findings indicate that their integration promotes the DAN and FPN to exert attention to decrease uncertainty.

">From movements to words: action monitoring in the medial frontal cortex along a caudal to rostral prediction error gradient</a></h4>

              
                Speech error monitoring recruits the medial frontal cortex (MFC) region in the human brain. Error monitoring-related activity in the MFC has been interpreted both in terms of conflict monitoring and feedback-driven control, but as similar regions of the MFC are implicated in various levels of behavioral control ranging from basic motor movement control to high-level cognitive control functions, a more comprehensive account is needed. Moreover, as speech errors and other actions that involve varying control demands engage a widespread yet partially overlapping set of regions of the MFC, such an account should ideally explain the anatomical distribution of error-related functional activations within the MFC. Here we wanted to assess the hypothesis that the MFC has a similar role in the evaluation of action outcomes for motor and mental actions, operating along a rostral-caudal gradient of higher-lower level control demands involving prediction errors from both sensory and epistemic sources. To this end, we conducted an individual-specific annotation of task-fMRI BOLD activation peaks related to speech errors versus correct productions (i.e. that involve the largest cognitive control demands, Study I and II), tongue movement monitoring (i.e. that involve an intermediate level of cognitive and motor control demands) and tongue movement (i.e. that involve only motor control demands, Study II) in the MFC region. Results revealed overlapping clusters across the three contrasts across the MFC, but importantly both the number of peaks and their relative position along the rostral caudal axis were consistent with a hierarchical rostral caudal processing gradient in the MFC. While tongue movement showed more caudal activation in the MFC, speech errors showed more rostral activation, and tongue movement monitoring patterned in between. Furthermore, the combined results of both studies suggested that activation peaks were located more dorsally for participants that had a paracingulate gyrus, replicating a previously documented effect for movement and further supporting a common functional role of the MFC across very distinct actions.

">Individual variation in the functional lateralization of human ventral temporal cortex: Local competition and long-range coupling</a></h4>

              
                The ventral temporal cortex (VTC) of the human cerebrum is critically engaged in computations related to high-level vision. One intriguing aspect of this region is its asymmetric organization and functional lateralization. Notably, in the VTC, neural responses to words are stronger in the left hemisphere, whereas neural responses to faces are stronger in the right hemisphere. Converging evidence has suggested that left-lateralized word responses emerge to couple efficiently with left-lateralized frontotemporal language regions, but evidence is more mixed regarding the sources of the right-lateralization for face perception. Here, we use individual differences as a tool to adjudicate between three theories of VTC organization arising from: 1) local competition between words and faces, 2) local competition between faces and other categories, 3) long-range coupling with VTC and frontotemporal areas subject to their own local competition. First, in an in-house functional MRI experiment, we demonstrated that individual differences in laterality are both substantial and reliable within a right-handed population of young adults. We found no (anti-)correlation in the laterality of word and face selectivity relative to object responses, and a positive correlation when using selectivity relative to a fixation baseline, challenging ideas of local competition between words and faces. We next examined broader local competition with faces using the large-scale Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. Face and tool laterality were significantly anti-correlated, while face and body laterality were positively correlated, consistent with the idea that generic local representational competition and cooperation may shape face lateralization. Last, we assessed the role of long-range coupling in the development of VTC laterality. Within our in-house experiment, substantial correlation was evident between VTC text laterality and several other nodes of a distributed text-processing circuit. In the HCP data, VTC face laterality was both negatively correlated with frontotemporal language laterality, and positively correlated with social perception laterality in the same areas, consistent with a long-range coupling effect between face and social processing representations, driven by local competition between language and social processing. We conclude that both local and long-range interactions shape the heterogeneous hemispheric specializations in high-level visual cortex.

">Isolating the effect of beat salience on rhythmic auditory stimulation outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is an intervention for gait-disordered populations that involves synchronizing footsteps to regular auditory cues. Previous research has shown that high- groove music (music that induces the desire to move or dance to it) improves gait relative to low- groove music, but how this effect occurs is unclear. Greater beat salience in high-groove music may improve gait because salient beats are easier to synchronize with. Here, we manipulated beat salience by embedding metronome tones to emphasize beat onsets in both high- and low-groove music. We expected that, if beat salience drives gait improvements to high-groove music, then embedding metronome in low-groove music would elicit similar gait improvements (e.g. increased stride velocity). Here, we quantified gait synchronization in terms of period-matching (overall step rate to the cue pace) and phase-matching (individual step onsets to beat onsets). We tested a sample of healthy younger and older adults, with auditory cues matched to 10% faster than baseline. Low- groove music with embedded metronome, compared to without, elicited better period-matching; there were no differences between metronome conditions in high-groove music. These findings suggest gait improvements to high-groove music could be due to its high beat salience. On the other hand, embedded metronome did not improve phase-matching accuracy, but high-groove music did. This suggests that beat salience may not improve gait via easing step-to-beat synchronization, but rather through an overall increase in movement vigor.

">Information transfer from spatial to social distance in rats: implications for the role of the posterior parietal cortex in spatial-social integration</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other social animals can represent and navigate complex networks of social relationships in ways that are suggestive of representation and navigation in space. There is some evidence that cortical regions initially required for processing space have been adapted to include processing of social information. One candidate region for supporting both spatial and social information processing is the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We examined the hypothesis that rats can transfer or generalize distance information across spatial and social domains and that this phenomenon requires the PPC. In a novel apparatus, rats learned to discriminate two conspecifics positioned at different spatial distances (near vs. far) in a goal-driven paradigm. Following spatial learning, subjects were tested on probe trials in which spatial distance was replaced with social distance (cagemate vs. less familiar conspecific). The PPC was chemogenetically inactivated during a subset of probe sessions. We predicted that, in control probe trials, subjects would select conspecifics whose social distance matched the previously learned spatial distance. That is, if trained on the near distance, the rat would choose the highly familiar cagemate, and if trained on the far distance, the rat would choose the less familiar conspecific. Subjects learned to discriminate conspecifics based on spatial distance in our goal-driven paradigm. Moreover, choice for the appropriate social distance in the first probe session was significantly higher than chance. This result suggests that rats transferred learned spatial information to social contexts. Contrary to our predictions, PPC inactivation did not impair spatial to social information transfer. Possible reasons are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that spatial and social distance are processed by shared cognitive mechanisms in the rat model.

	<p>Introduction: This article provides an overview of several experimental models, including in vivo, genetics, chemical, knock-in, knock-out, electrical, in vitro, and optogenetics models, that have been employed to investigate epileptogenesis. The present review introduces a novel categorization of these models, taking into account the fact that the most recent classification that gained widespread acceptance was established by Fisher in 1989. A significant number of such models have become virtually outdated. Objective: This paper specifically examines the models that have contributed to the investigation of partial seizures, generalized seizures, and status epilepticus. Discussion: A description is provided of the primary features associated with the processes that produce and regulate the symptoms of various epileptogenesis models. Numerous experimental epilepsy models in animals have made substantial contributions to the investigation of particular brain regions that are capable of inducing seizures. Experimental models of epilepsy have also enabled the investigation of the therapeutic mechanisms of anti-epileptic medications. Typically, animals are selected for the development and study of experimental animal models of epilepsy based on the specific form of epilepsy being investigated. Conclusions: Currently, it is established that specific animal species can undergo epileptic seizures that resemble those described in humans. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that a comprehensive assessment of all forms of human epilepsy has not been feasible. However, these experimental models, both those derived from channelopathies and others, have provided a limited comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms of this disease.</p>

	<p>Background: Occupational therapy (OT) is an essential component of patient care, and it is especially beneficial if focused on meaningful activities. For ataxic patients, traditional procedures are currently the most efficient, although without specific guidelines and suggestions for virtual reality integration. In this context, this study proposes Hybrid Smart Rehabilitation (HSR) based on mixed reality (MR) as an aid in overcoming limitations of the traditional OT procedures. Methods: MR-HSR is designed specifically for ataxic patients and developed in Unity with the Holographic Remoting setting for run-time intervention on the scene. The subject reaches a book and grabs it with their hand inside a holographic guide with audio-visive feedback. Hand trajectories acquired from eight ataxic patients and eight healthy subjects were compared and new variables were analyzed to evaluate the performance. The Trust in Automation questionnaire was submitted to assess the opinion of the patients. Results: Patients confirmed their trust in the developer and in the improvement that this system can bring to their rehabilitation. The &amp;amp;ldquo;total time&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;sway area&amp;amp;rdquo; of the trajectory were statistically significant and, together with the deviation of the trajectory from the main axis of the guide, although not statistically significant, made it possible to build a classifier. Conclusions: The patient-specific MR-HSR can be considered as an integrative tool for assessing the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s condition by analyzing new quantitative variables which, if matched to the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), could be the basis of a new index to assess the progressiveness of ataxia.</p>

                Background Helicobacter pylori and intestinal parasites are well-known for their high prevalence in children, especially in developing countries. However, their concomitant infections are poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between intestinal parasites and H. pylori among hospitalized children and adolescents with upper gastrointestinal complaints in Northern Lebanon. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 297 hospitalized pediatric patients, aged between 1 and 15 years, who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. The socio-demographic, lifestyle, and gastrointestinal characteristics of all participants were analyzed. Fresh stool samples were collected and screened for the presence of intestinal parasites and H. pylori infections. Results 6.4% of the patients were positive for intestinal parasitic infections, 5.4% were positive for H. pylori infection, and 11.8% were co-infected. The results of the Chi-square test showed that H. pylori infection is significantly associated with parasitic infection but not with a particular species. The most frequent coinfection was H. pylori-Entamoeba histolytica (77.1%). Moreover, H. pylori infection was associated with overcrowding and infrequent washing of vegetables before eating. The prevalence of co-infections increased in patients of mothers with a primary educational level or less. In regards to clinical characteristics, our findings showed a statistically significant relationship between i) gastric reflux and H. pylori, and ii) severe diarrhea and parasitic infection. Conclusion Our data highlighted the association between H. pylori and intestinal parasitic infections. Thus, H. pylori detection could be taken into consideration while screening for parasitic infections in children and adolescents.

                Introduction Rotator cuff (RC) tears are the most common and disabling musculoskeletal ailments among patients with shoulder pain. Although most individuals show improvement in function and pain following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR), a subgroup of patients continue to suffer from persistent shoulder pain following the surgical procedure. Identifying these factors is important in planning preoperative management to improve patient outcomes. Objective This scoping review aims to identify biological factors, psychological factors, and social determinants of health contributing to the development of persistent pain in individuals after the ARCR procedure. Inclusion criteria All prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies reporting the risk factors contributing to persistent pain three months or longer after the ARCR surgery will be considered for this scoping review. Methods Our review will adhere to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology. Four electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus will be searched for studies in the English language. Additional studies can be found by conducting a citation analysis of the included studies. Title and abstract screening will be performed by two independent reviewers following the inclusion criteria, a third reviewer will be consulted about any differences. Next, full-text screening will be conducted, and the remaining search results will be reviewed to extract data, as well as to synthesize findings from all research. An overview of findings will be depicted in tabular format accompanied with a narrative summary of various factors contributing to persistent pain.

                Political or economic interests have led to an empirical zonal delimitation, and the deficient use of Geographic Information Systems does not allow the specific characterisation of the territories. This article aims to determine the spatial analysis of the urban expansion areas of the canton of Tisaleo by integrating Geographic Information Systems, using a quantitative research method. The main components analysed are: the situational diagnosis of the canton through the characterisation of its biophysical component, its human settlements and the public system of facilities and social services that support it. Based on this information, an interrelation of the data collected is carried out to complement a spatial analysis with GIS software (ArcGis/QGis, ESRI, 2018). The results show that in the canton of Tisaleo there are areas suitable for urban growth, but their limits are overdimensioned, i.e. they include areas that do not have the aptitude to be urbanised, as well as rural areas that have the characteristics to be considered urban.

                Background Immediate Dentin Sealing (IDS) is a technique that applies an adhesive layer immediately after tooth preparation, prior to the placement of indirect restorations. This method is gaining attention due to its potential to improve the bond strength and mechanical properties of restorations, particularly in the posterior region where restorations endure significant masticatory forces. The objectif of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effect of IDS on the fracture strength of indirect posterior restorations. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in four databases: Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and PubMed. Inclusion criteria focused on in vitro studies involving human teeth with indirect posterior restorations, published between 2014 and 2023. Studies using IDS were compared to those using conventional methods. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool, and a meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model. The standard mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare fracture strength, with I2 statistics assessing heterogeneity. Forest and funnel plots were employed to visualize results and publication bias, respectively. Discussion The results indicate that IDS generally enhances the fracture strength of indirect posterior restorations, particularly with ceramic materials like lithium disilicate. However, the effectiveness of IDS varies depending on the material and restoration type. While some studies demonstrated improved fracture resistance with IDS, others showed minimal benefit, especially with composite restorations. Additionally, IDS improved marginal adaptation and internal fit but increased the risk of severe failures, such as root fractures.

                Electrocardiograms (ECGs) can be affected by various factors and technical problems. It is rare for an artefact to be the cause of ST-segment elevation, especially in asymptomatic patients. An important distinction between true ST segment elevation caused by myocardial infarction and an artefact is that the baseline elevation in an artefact may begin before or after the appearance of the QRS complex. When confronted with an abnormal ECG with suspicious waveform contours and possibly only one completely normal limb lead, the diagnosis of arterial pulse artefact should be considered. It is important to exclude subjective assessments unless they are clearly labelled as such. When encountering an abnormal ECG with suspicious waveform contours and possibly only one completely normal limb lead, the diagnosis of arterial pulse artefact should be considered.

                Invasive sino-orbital fungal infection is an uncommon, yet severe condition that predominantly affects individuals with compromised immune systems. In this study, we report the case of a 5-month-old immunocompetent infant who exhibited persistent dacryocystitis despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, the patient developed ethmoiditis, orbital subperiosteal abscess, and ulceration of the hard palate. Mycological and histological samples were indicative of Candida infections. The patient underwent sinus surgery and surgical debridement, along with antifungal therapy. The treatment was successful, and the follow-up was uneventful for up to 6 months. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of invasive sino-orbital candidiasis in an immunocompetent infant with dacryocystitis as the entry point. This study explores the clinical features, management approaches, and outcomes of this potentially fatal disease.

                <p>by Shaojun Yu, Junjie Wu, Yumeng Shao, Deqiang Qiu, Zhaohui S. Qin, for the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative </p>

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely applied in the neuroimaging field to discover genetic variants associated with brain-related traits. So far, almost all GWASs conducted in neuroimaging genetics are performed on univariate quantitative features summarized from brain images. On the other hand, powerful deep learning technologies have dramatically improved our ability to classify images. In this study, we proposed and implemented a novel machine learning strategy for systematically identifying genetic variants that lead to detectable nuances on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). For a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), if MRI images labeled by genotypes of this SNP can be reliably distinguished using machine learning, we then hypothesized that this SNP is likely to be associated with brain anatomy or function which is manifested in MRI brain images. We applied this strategy to a catalog of MRI image and genotype data collected by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) consortium. From the results, we identified novel variants that show strong association to brain phenotypes.

Owing to its specialised methodology, palaeoecology is often regarded as a separate field from ecology, even though it is essential for understanding long-term ecological processes that have shaped the ecosystems that ecologists study and manage. Despite advances in ecological modelling, sample dating, and proxy-based reconstructions facilitating direct comparison of palaeoecological data with neo-ecological data, most of the scientific knowledge derived from palaeoecological studies remains siloed. We surveyed a group of palaeo-researchers with experience in crossing the divide between palaeoecology and neo-ecology, to develop Ten Simple Rules for publishing your palaeoecological research in non-palaeo journals. Our 10 rules are divided into the preparation phase, writing phase, and finalising phase when the article is submitted to the target journal. These rules provide a suite of strategies, including improved networking early in the process, building effective collaborations, transmitting results more efficiently and cross-disciplinary, and integrating concepts and methodologies that appeal to ecologists and a wider readership. Adhering to these Ten Simple Rules can ensure palaeoecologists’ findings are more accessible and impactful among ecologists and the wider scientific community. Although this article primarily shows examples of how palaeoecological studies were published in journals for a broader audience, the rules apply to anyone who aims to publish outside specialised journals.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012478">Regularizing hyperparameters of interacting neural signals in the mouse cortex reflect states of arousal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dmitry R. Lyamzin, Andrea Alamia, Mohammad Abdolrahmani, Ryo Aoki, Andrea Benucci</p>

In natural behaviors, multiple neural signals simultaneously drive activation across overlapping brain networks. Due to limitations in the amount of data that can be acquired in common experimental designs, the determination of these interactions is commonly inferred via modeling approaches, which reduce overfitting by finding appropriate regularizing hyperparameters. However, it is unclear whether these hyperparameters can also be related to any aspect of the underlying biological phenomena and help interpret them. We applied a state-of-the-art regularization procedure—automatic locality determination—to interacting neural activations in the mouse posterior cortex associated with movements of the body and eyes. As expected, regularization significantly improved the determination and interpretability of the response interactions. However, regularizing hyperparameters also changed considerably, and seemingly unpredictably, from animal to animal. We found that these variations were not random; rather, they correlated with the variability in visually evoked responses and with the variability in the state of arousal of the animals measured by pupillometry—both pieces of information that were not included in the modeling framework. These observations could be generalized to another commonly used—but potentially less informative—regularization method, ridge regression. Our findings demonstrate that optimal model hyperparameters can be discovery tools that are informative of factors not a priori included in the model’s design.

                <p>by Rachel S. Clein, Megan R. Warren, Joshua P. Neunuebel</p>

Intraspecies aggression has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, as recipients can suffer injuries, decreases in fitness, and become outcasts from social groups. Although animals implement diverse strategies to avoid hostile confrontations, the extent to which social influences affect escape tactics is unclear. Here, we used computational and machine-learning approaches to analyze complex behavioral interactions as mixed-sex groups of mice, <i>Mus musculus</i>, freely interacted. Mice displayed a rich repertoire of behaviors marked by changes in behavioral state, aggressive encounters, and mixed-sex interactions. A distinctive behavioral sequence consistently occurred after aggressive encounters, where males in submissive states quickly approached and transiently interacted with females immediately before the aggressor engaged with the same female. The behavioral sequences were also associated with substantially fewer physical altercations. Furthermore, the male’s behavioral state could be predicted by distinct features of the behavioral sequence, such as kinematics and the latency to and duration of male–female interactions. More broadly, our work revealed an ethologically relevant escape strategy influenced by the presence of females that may serve as a mechanism for de-escalating social conflict and preventing consequential reductions in fitness.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sex differences in the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the incident all-cause dementia and the subtype Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk are unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants (n = 4,171, 54% women, aged 55 to 69 years) were included at baseline and followed up to 40 years. The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) was dichotomized into 2 levels (cutoff: 75th percentile of the FSRP z-scores). Cause-specific hazard models, with death as a competing event, and restricted mean survival time (RMST) model were used to analyze the association between FSRP levels and incident all-cause dementia and AD. Interactions between FSRP and sex were estimated, followed by a sex-stratified analysis to examine the sex modification effect.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>High FSRP was significantly associated with all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.25, robust 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21 to 1.29, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) and AD (HR = 1.58, robust 95% CI = 1.57 to 1.59, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) in cause-specific hazard models. High FSRP was significantly associated with incident dementia (HR = 2.81, robust 95% CI = 2.75 to 2.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and AD (HR = 2.96, robust 95% CI = 2.36 to 3.71, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in women, but not in men. Results were consistent in the RMST models. Current diabetes and high systolic blood pressure as FSRP components were significantly associated with dementia and AD in women but not in men.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>High FSRP in mid- to early late life is a critical risk factor for all-cause dementia and AD, particularly in women. Sex-specific interventions and further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms are warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The discovery of adult-born granule cells (aDGCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus has raised questions regarding how they develop, incorporate into the hippocampal circuitry, and contribute to learning and memory. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of mouse aDGCs as they matured, enabled by using a tamoxifen-induced genetic label to birth date the aDGCs at different animal ages. Importantly, we also undertook immunofluorescence studies of the expression of the immediate early gene Egr1 and compared these findings with the electrophysiology data in the same animals. We examined two groups of animals, with aDGC birthdating when the mice were 2 months and at 7–9 months of age. In both groups, cells 4 weeks old had lower thresholds for current-evoked action potentials than older cells but fired fewer spikes during long current pulses and responded more poorly to synaptic activation. aDGCs born in both 2 and 7–9-month-old mice matured in their intrinsic excitability and synaptic properties from 4–12 weeks postgenesis, but this occurred more slowly for the older age animals. Interestingly, this pattern of intrinsic excitability changes did not correlate with the pattern of Egr1 expression. Instead, the development of Egr1 expression was correlated with the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that in order for aDGCs to fully participate in hippocampal circuitry, as indicated by Egr1 expression, they must have developed enough synaptic input, in spite of the greater input resistance and reduced firing threshold that characterizes young aDGCs.</p>

                Wang et al. show that receptor-like kinase FER controls early seed germination arrest under ABA conditions by regulating the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase CARK1-mediated ABA core signaling pathway. FER promotes the kinase activity of CARK1 via phosphorylations at the activation loop, ultimately leading to increased ABA responses during seed germination.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97754">Light-driven synchronization of optogenetic clocks</a></h4>

              
                Synthetic genetic oscillators can serve as internal clocks within engineered cells to program periodic expression. However, cell-to-cell variability introduces a dispersion in the characteristics of these clocks that drives the population to complete desynchronization. Here, we introduce the optorepressilator, an optically controllable genetic clock that combines the repressilator, a three-node synthetic network in <i>E. coli</i>, with an optogenetic module enabling to reset, delay, or advance its phase using optical inputs. We demonstrate that a population of optorepressilators can be synchronized by transient green light exposure or entrained to oscillate indefinitely by a train of short pulses, through a mechanism reminiscent of natural circadian clocks. Furthermore, we investigate the system’s response to detuned external stimuli observing multiple regimes of global synchronization. Integrating experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that the entrainment mechanism is robust and can be understood quantitatively from single cell to population level.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95678">A new potential strategy for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma treatment by generating serum-based antibodies from tumor-exposed mice</a></h4>

              
                Current cancer treatment strategies continue to face significant challenges, primarily due to tumor relapse, drug resistance, and low treatment efficiency. These issues arise because certain tumor cells adapt to the host immune microenvironment and evade the immune system. This study presents a new cancer immunotherapy strategy using serum-based antibodies from mice exposed to mouse cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (mCSCC). The experiment was conducted in three stages. In the first stage, mCSCC cells were isolated and expanded cultured from DMBA/TPA-induced mCSCC. In the second stage, these expanded tumor cells were injected into healthy mice to stimulate the production of anti-tumor antibodies. In the final stage, therapeutic serum was extracted from these healthy mice and reintroduced into the tumor-bearing mice. An ELISA assay was utilized to analyze the levels of p53, Bcl-xL, NF-κB, and Bax. The results showed that the serum treatment not only reduced tumor volume but also reversed changes in p53, Bcl-xL, NF-κB, and Bax. In conclusion, this study developed a new immunotherapeutic strategy for treating mCSCC. However, further research is needed to fully comprehend the mechanism of this serum treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98844">Ih block reveals separation of timescales in pyloric rhythm response to temperature changes in Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                Motor systems operate over a range of frequencies and relative timing (phase). We studied the role of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I<sub>h</sub>) in regulating these features in the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, <i>Cancer borealis,</i> as temperature was altered from 11°C to 21°C. Under control conditions, rhythm frequency increased monotonically with temperature, while the phases of the pyloric dilator (PD), lateral pyloric (LP), and pyloric (PY) neurons remained constant. Blocking I<sub>h</sub> with cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>) phase advanced PD offset, LP onset, and LP offset at 11°C, and the latter two further advanced as temperature increased. In Cs<sup>+</sup> the frequency increase with temperature diminished and the Q<sub>10</sub> of the frequency dropped from ~1.75 to ~1.35. Unexpectedly in Cs<sup>+</sup>, the frequency dynamics became non-monotonic during temperature transitions; frequency initially dropped as temperature increased, then rose once temperature stabilized, creating a characteristic ‘jag’. Interestingly, these jags persisted during temperature transitions in Cs<sup>+</sup> when the pacemaker was isolated by picrotoxin, although the temperature-induced change in frequency recovered to control levels. Overall, these data suggest that I<sub>h</sub> plays an important role in maintaining smooth transitory responses and persistent frequency increases by different mechanisms in the pyloric circuitry during temperature fluctuations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93656">Contrasting responses to aridity by different-sized decomposers cause similar decomposition rates across a precipitation gradient</a></h4>

              
                Litter decomposition is expected to be positively associated with precipitation despite evidence that decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies. We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping. We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands, possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum, and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92464">Heat Shock Factor 1 forms nuclear condensates and restructures the yeast genome before activating target genes</a></h4>

              
                In insects and mammals, 3D genome topology has been linked to transcriptional states yet whether this link holds for other eukaryotes is unclear. Using both ligation proximity and fluorescence microscopy assays, we show that in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>Heat Shock Response</i> (<i>HSR</i>) genes dispersed across multiple chromosomes and under the control of Heat Shock Factor (Hsf1) rapidly reposition in cells exposed to acute ethanol stress and engage in concerted, Hsf1-dependent intergenic interactions. Accompanying 3D genome reconfiguration is equally rapid formation of Hsf1-containing condensates. However, in contrast to the transience of Hsf1-driven intergenic interactions that peak within 10–20 min and dissipate within 1 hr in the presence of 8.5% (v/v) ethanol, transcriptional condensates are stably maintained for hours. Moreover, under the same conditions, Pol II occupancy of <i>HSR</i> genes, chromatin remodeling, and RNA expression are detectable only later in the response and peak much later (&gt;1 hr). This contrasts with the coordinate response of <i>HSR</i> genes to thermal stress (39°C) where Pol II occupancy, transcription, histone eviction, intergenic interactions, and formation of Hsf1 condensates are all rapid yet transient (peak within 2.5–10 min and dissipate within 1 hr). Therefore, Hsf1 forms condensates, restructures the genome and transcriptionally activates <i>HSR</i> genes in response to both forms of proteotoxic stress but does so with strikingly different kinetics. In cells subjected to ethanol stress, Hsf1 forms condensates and repositions target genes before transcriptionally activating them.

                The R-loop is a common transcriptional by-product that consists of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture -the Smc5/6 complex- plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription. Consistent with this, budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures <i>in vivo</i> and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme <i>in vitro</i>. Collectively, our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94795">Early steps of protein disaggregation by Hsp70 chaperone and class B J-domain proteins are shaped by Hsp110</a></h4>

              
                Hsp70 is a key cellular system counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, associated with stress, ageing, and disease. Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). Here, we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.

                Loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in the eye leads to photoreceptor death and vision loss. Cell replacement strategies using RPE derived in vitro from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Generation of polarized monolayers represents an essential prerequisite for proper RPE function, however, monolayer formation following transplantation of RPE cell suspensions has not been systematically assessed. Using the sodium iodate mouse model of RPE depletion, significant increase in monolayer formation capacity of passage (P) 1 vs. P2 human iPSC-derived RPE cells was observed three weeks after transplantation. Transplant-derived monolayers showed characteristic apicobasal polarity, RPE marker expression, phagocytosis function, and preservation of the host outer nuclear layer. The cell surface marker panel CD54+/PSA-NCAM- was identified to enrich for an RPE subpopulation with high potential for monolayer formation following transplantation. Results underline the importance of defining and isolating competent cell subpopulations for successful RPE transplantation.

                Transmembrane L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) is widely used as a marker to enrich for neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially in plasma. However, this approach lacks sufficient robust validation. This study aimed to assess whether human biofluids are indeed enriched for EVs, particularly neuron-derived EVs, by L1CAM immunoaffinity, utilizing multiple sources (plasma, CSF, conditioned media from iPSC-derived neurons [iNCM]) and different methods (mass spectrometry [MS], nanoparticle tracking analysis [NTA]). Following a systematic multi-step validation approach, we confirmed isolation of generic EV populations using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and polymer-aided precipitation (PPT) - two most commonly applied EV isolation methods - from all sources. Neurofilament light (NfL) was detected in both CSF and blood-derived EVs, indicating their neuronal origin. However, L1CAM immunoprecipitation did not yield enrichment of L1CAM in EV fractions. Instead, it was predominantly found in its free-floating form. Additionally, MS-based proteomic analysis of CSF-derived EVs also did not show L1CAM enrichment. Our study validates EV isolation from diverse biofluid sources by several isolation approaches and confirms that some EV subpopulations in human biofluids are of neuronal origin. Thorough testing across multiple sources by different orthogonal methods, however, does not support L1CAM as a marker to reliably enrich for a specific subpopulation of EVs, particularly of neuronal origin.

In this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving visualizations using differential privacy, employing biomedical data from neuroimaging as a use case. We investigate several approaches based on perturbing correlation values and characterize their privacy cost and the impact of pre- and post-processing. To obtain a better privacy/visual utility tradeoff, we propose workflows for connectogram and seed-based connectivity visualizations, respectively. These workflows successfully generate visualizations similar to their non-private counterparts. Experiments show that qualitative assessments can be preserved while guaranteeing privacy. These results show that differential privacy is a promising method for protecting sensitive information in data visualization.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Age-related decline in balance and postural control is common in healthy elders and is escalated in aging adults with stroke. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as one of the promising brain stimulations adjoining therapeutic exercise to enhance the recovery of balance and motor functions in persons with and without neurological disorders. This review aims to summarize and compare the available evidence of the tDCS on improving balance in the older adults without neurological disorders and the older adults with stroke. Methods: The Ovid (Medline) database was searched from its inception through to 06/15/2024 for randomized controlled trials investigating tDCS for improving balance in older adults with and without stroke. Results: Overall, 20 appropriate studies (including 271 stroke subjects and 259 healthy older adults) were found. The data indicate mixed results of tDCS for improving balance in older adults with and without stroke. Conclusions: Based on current research evidence, we have not found a specific tDCS protocol that is more effective than other tDCS protocols for improving balance and postural control in healthy older adults and older adults with stroke. Further research should explore the ideal tDCS approach, possibly in conjunction with standard interventions, to optimize postural control and balance in healthy older adults and older adults with stroke.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study investigates the classification of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using electroencephalography (EEG) Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) spectrograms and audio Mel-spectrogram data of 52 subjects. The objective is to develop a multimodal classification model that integrates audio and EEG data to accurately identify depressive tendencies. Methods: We utilized the Multimodal open dataset for Mental Disorder Analysis (MODMA) and trained a pre-trained Densenet121 model using transfer learning. Features from both the EEG and audio modalities were extracted and concatenated before being passed through the final classification layer. Additionally, an ablation study was conducted on both datasets separately. Results: The proposed multimodal classification model demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving an Accuracy of 97.53%, Precision of 98.20%, F1 Score of 97.76%, and Recall of 97.32%. A confusion matrix was also used to evaluate the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s effectiveness. Conclusions: The paper presents a robust multimodal classification approach that outperforms state-of-the-art methods with potential application in clinical diagnostics for depression assessment.</p>

                Background Outdoor and indoor air temperature affects human health and wellbeing. Climate change projections suggest that global temperatures will continue to increase, and this poses a threat to health. Buildings (for housing and business purposes) that can protect humans from the adverse effects of temperature are essential, especially in the context of climate change. Method In this cross-sectional study, we measured the indoor temperature inside shipping containers comprising a seven-storey block of apartments and businesses in Johannesburg, South Africa for 14 days. We assessed indoor temperature and relative humidity; evaluated measured temperatures in relation to thresholds known to be associated with adverse health risks; and sought to understand heat-health perceptions and symptoms of people living and working in shipping container units. Results Median indoor apparent temperature (AT) (a combination of temperature and relative humidity) was 16°C with values ranging from 6°C (observed at 8:00) to 42°C (observed at 17:00). Insulated units had temperatures between 2°C and 9°C cooler than the uninsulated unit. Heat-health risks from AT exposure were likely in all units, although there was variation in the number of occurrences that AT measurements exceeded the four symptom bands of caution, extreme caution, danger and extreme danger. Indoor AT was found to be 7°C higher on average when compared to outdoor AT. Some participants believed that their units were hot during hot weather and most people opened windows or did nothing during hot weather. Few participants reported experiencing adverse heat-health impacts, except for experiencing headaches (58%) and feeling tired or weak (40%). Conclusion Residents, tenants, or business owners using shipping containers should consider insulation installation and adequate windows/air conditioning for ventilation, especially in hot climates. Further research and awareness regarding heat-health risks of living or working in these spaces is needed.

                Introduction Throughout history and up until the present, there has been a medicine shortage. In the early 1920s, there was a shortage of insulin, which is when drug scarcity first appeared in the records. Drug shortages are now more prevalent globally than they were back then. The goal of this essay is to pinpoint the key components that make up a definition for medication shortages and to pinpoint the circumstances that should be considered when reporting drug shortages in databases. Understanding the factors that led certain organizations to create their own definition of a medicine shortage was crucial for achieving these goals. The pharmaceutical regulatory environment can be connected to several reasons why there are medication shortages, including parallel trading, quality standards, and business choices to halt or reduce manufacturing. The many rules governing medicine shortages have not yet been the subject of a thorough investigation. This protocol’s objective is to analyze the pertinent legislative and regulatory frameworks in the European pharmaceutical system that affect medication shortages. The objectives of the study will be the non–availability of drugs at an outpatient pharmacy and to analyze the reason of non–availability of drugs. Methods An observational study will be adopted in this study. It includes a collection of data from the patient coming to the outpatient pharmacy of AVBRH Sawangi (Meghe) Wardha. Expected result It can lead to delayed treatment for patients seeking alternative medication. It can also lead to increased healthcare costs if patients seek alternative treatments that are more expensive or require additional medical care. The unavailability of drugs can also lead to frustration and anxiety for patients who need medication to manage their health condition. It can also negatively impact the reputation of the hospital.

                Past research aimed at service recovery has focused on actions that are taken to retain customers, and the possibility of overcoming the mistakes of service delivery, though the multidimensional nature of the service recovery process has begun to move beyond the complaint handling process. In this paper, we identify the most important issues addressed in service recovery and present a framework for addressing them. We used an extensive integrative review methodology. Between 1988 and 2017 the number of articles in these journals was kept between 26 and 30. The majority took a business perspective to study services recovery, while a minority took an inter-disciplinarity perspective. The study’s findings are expected to provide insights into the antecedents and consequences of service recovery performance, particularly how job resources and demands influence employee burnout and work engagement, which in turn affect service recovery performance and customer perceptions of justice. The research aims to contribute to the discourse on service recovery by building a multi-level model that explains the service recovery performance of frontline employees and the impact of the service recovery system on customer justice perceptions. Thus, this research is expected to contribute to robust conclusions on the antecedents and consequences of employee service recovery performance nested within the unit-level construct, i.e., the service recovery system.

                Background Over the past few decades, World Health Organization (WHO) has made massive efforts to promote the development of a vaccine against Lassa virus (LASV), one of the top ten priority pathogens for research and development under the WHO R&D Blueprint for Emerging Infections. To date, several vaccines are at different stages of development. In this scenario, a validated and standardised assay to measure LASV neutralising antibodies is urgently needed for vaccine development and comparison. Methods The neutralisation assay remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy. Here we have proposed a safe and validated pseudotyped neutralisation assay for LASV, taking advantage of the development of the first WHO International Standard and Reference Panel for Anti-Lassa Fever (NIBSC code 21/332). Results and Conclusions The proposed results demonstrate that the pseudotyped luciferase neutralisation assay is a specific serological test for the measurement of LASV neutralising antibodies without cross-reacting with standard sera specific for heterologous viral infections. In addition, the assay is accurate, precise, and linear according to criteria and statistical analyses defined and accepted by international guidelines.

                Background Globalization has expanded the scope of business with many companies relying on the contribution of expatriates to fill skills gap in foreign business operations, transferring management knowledge, launching new operations, and coordinating activities on a global scale. Expatriates, however, face challenges that stem from cultural differences. Their commitment levels depend on how well and how quickly they adjust to the unfamiliar culture(s) of the host country. Methods This study sought to investigate the implications of work factors on commitment of expatriates working in selected mission hospitals in Kenya. It was anchored on the provisions of the Three-Component Commitment and International Adjustment theories and a randomly selected sample of 112 respondents from a target population of 156 medical expatriates. Results and conclusions The results depicted that work-related factors significantly affected employee commitment (β= -1.033, p=0.000). To conclude, we argue that employee commitment amongst expatriates can be enhanced through work factors’ cross-cultural adjustment. We further recommend setting up of cross-cultural adjustment policies for expatriate workers within the workplace, particularly in mission hospitals.

                Background In completely edentulous patients, maintaining the patient’s temporomandibular joint (TMJ) health and intraoral components is very essential, which can be achieved by an accurate interocclusal record, which can be taken by various materials and also at various stages. Simulation of the temporomandibular joint anatomy and mandibular movements is possible on a semi-adjustable articulator, which is widely used in prosthodontics. Transferring the record on articulator is a critical step in the fabrication of complete dentures, so it should be done precisely to reduce chair side time and also to avoid complications for patients. This study examines which material is more accurate and records which stage gives more precision by comparing the Condylar guidance on radiographs. This is because it is a relatively consistent bony landmark and can be used to correlate with clinical methods in terms of verification. The objective is to determine the inter occlusal records created during the Jaw Relation stage and Try-in using reinforced wax and Polyvinyl siloxane and compare these values to the condylar guidance obtained by orthopantomogram (OPG). Methods Recording the Condylar Guidance value on OPG by tracing the Glenoid fossa, Articular eminence, and the Frankfurt Horizontal Plane. Followed by conventional steps in making complete dentures at jaw relation and try-in stage. We will record values of condylar guidance with the two different Interocclusal record materials. Expected result It will help the clinicians to gain knowledge about obtaining precise condylar inclination angle by using suitable interocclusal record materials. Conclusions This study will help us to obtain condylar inclination, which in turn helps the patient’s satisfaction as it preserves the intraoral components and health of TMJ.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1228/v1?src=rss">Recycling of collagen from solid tannery waste and prospective utilization as adhesives. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract This study explores the innovative potential of recycled collagen derived from tannery waste for use in high-performance adhesive formulations. The leather industry generates significant amounts of solid waste, primarily from chromium-tanned leather, which poses substantial environmental challenges. Recent advancements in recycling techniques have opened new avenues for repurposing this waste, particularly through collagen extraction, which comprises about 30-35% of tannery residues. This research systematically reviews the methods and applications of collagen extraction, highlighting the material’s versatility and environmental benefits when used as a bio-adhesive. The review identifies key challenges such as low water resistance, shear strength, and adhesiveness in collagen-based adhesives compared to synthetic counterparts. However, innovative solutions are emerging, including the incorporation of silane coupling agents and cross-linking technologies that significantly improve the water resistance and mechanical properties of these adhesives. Economic analyses further support the viability of using tannery waste-derived collagen in adhesive production, aligning with global sustainability goals and reducing reliance on petrochemical-based adhesives. Despite these advancements, the transition from laboratory research to commercial applications remains a significant challenge. Current studies primarily focus on small-scale experiments, with limited pilot-scale studies available. Nonetheless, the potential for collagen-based adhesives to replace harmful chemicals in industrial applications is promising, especially in sectors requiring biodegradable and non-toxic materials. This review concludes that while significant progress has been made, further research is necessary to overcome existing limitations and fully realize the commercial potential of collagen-based adhesives derived from tannery waste.

                Background Each year, over 340,000 diabetic patients across the world travel to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage. As they carried out important rituals, several complications might be encountered, particularly foot lesions. We’ve been therefore interested, through this study, in the assessment of podiatric risk in diabetic pilgrims. Methods A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in the region of Sousse, Tunisia. The evaluation of diabetic patients preparing for the pilgrimage was conducted in two phases, before and after the pilgrimage. Results Forty-three diabetic patients planning to perform pilgrimage were included in the study. Post-pilgrimage clinical exams revealed hyperkeratosis (96.8%) and superficial fungal infections (61.3%) as the most common podiatric lesions. Foot ulcers attributed to trauma from walking were found in 7% of patients. Our data showed a significant association between foot ulcer risk and lower total cholesterol (p=0.02), HDL cholesterol (p=0.02), LDL cholesterol (p=0.01), as well as higher triglyceride levels (p=0.04) only in univariate analysis. Other diabetes-related risk factors did not show significant correlations. Conclusion Given the increased risk of foot lesions in diabetic pilgrims, a thorough assessment and tailored management based on individual risk levels are essential before, during, and after the pilgrimage.

                Background The crisis in research culture is well documented, covering issues such as a tendency for quantity over quality, unhealthy competitive environments, and assessment based on publications, journal prestige and funding. In response, research institutions need to assess their own practices to promote and advocate for change in the current research ecosystem. The purpose of the scoping review was to explore ‘What does the evidence say about the ‘problem’ with ‘poor’ research culture, what are the benefits of ‘good’ research culture, and what does ‘good’ look like?’ Aims To examine the peer-reviewed and grey literature to explore the interplay between research culture, open research, career paths, recognition and rewards, and equality, diversity, and inclusion, as part of a larger programme of activity for a research institution. Methods A scoping review was undertaken. Six databases were searched along with grey literature. Eligible literature had relevance to academic research institutions, addressed research culture, and were published between January 2017 to May 2022. Evidence was mapped and themed to specific categories. The search strategy, screening and analysis took place between April-May 2022. Results 1666 titles and abstracts, and 924 full text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 253 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. A purposive sampling of relevant websites was drawn from to complement the review, resulting in 102 records included in the review. Key areas for consideration were identified across the four themes of job security, wellbeing and equality of opportunity, teamwork and interdisciplinary, and research quality and accountability. Conclusions There are opportunities for research institutions to improve their own practice, however institutional solutions cannot act in isolation. Research institutions and research funders need to work together to build a more sustainable and inclusive research culture that is diverse in nature and supports individuals’ well-being, career progression and performance.

                Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.

                Background Pakistan served as a host for more than 1.4 million Afghan refugees for more than 40 years. Access to health care is the most important issue faced by refugees, because they might be at a higher risk for certain diseases. This risk can be attributed to a lack of awareness of health care facilities, health beliefs, inadequate hygiene, cultural differences, and malnutrition. Health of individuals is closely associated with their quality of life. Quality of life over the whole lifespan is pivotal to overall life satisfaction. It includes physical wellbeing, mental health, education, occupation, income, personal safety, as well as (religious) freedom. Until now, the health status of Afghan refugees has never been comprehensively investigated in Pakistan. Therefore, an assessment in this regard is needed to explore their health-related quality of life, for securing their human right to health. Methods A cross-sectional study has been designed to describe and explain the health-related quality of life of Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Multistage cluster sampling was applied for selection of study participants. The number of respondents from two regions in Pakistan was drawn through a proportionate sampling technique. A quantitative research method using pre-validated questionnaires was used for data collection. The questionnaire included items to assess well-being, mental health, health literacy, and factors affecting health and health care. Descriptive analysis was used, whereas inferential statistical tests (binary logistic regression model) was also performed. The study received ethically permission by the Advanced Studies and Research Board of the University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Discussion The assessment of Afghan refugee’s quality of life in Pakistan should lead to recommendations disseminated to public and health care officials. This evidence is needed for policymaking related to adequate measures for improving health conditions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

                Background Regular exercise during pregnancy improves fetal and mother outcomes unless contraindicated. Despite being generally safe and beneficial, non-participation in prenatal activity is relatively common among most of the Asian countries due to multiple reasons. In India, findings related to maternal physical activity and its determinant are scant. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the physical activity level and associated factors among pregnant women attending maternal healthcare services in Dakshina Kannada District in India. Method A multi-center community-based cross-sectional study was conducted recruiting 424 pregnant women attending the maternal healthcare facilities at four taluks of Dakshina Kannada district in Karnataka state, India. A structured questionnaire that collected information on socio-demographic, and maternal characteristics was used and the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire tool was used to determine the physical activity during pregnancy. Logistic regression model was used to determine the predictor variables. Results The prevalence of physical inactivity was 40.33%. Physical activity is favorable among pregnant women aged between 25 to 29 years, residing in an urban locality, diploma or graduation and being housewife. Determinants of physical inactivity during pregnancy were sedentary occupation (AOR 7.22, 95% CI 2.2, 23.4), low family income (AOR 3.16, 95% CI 1.414, 7.054), having one child (AOR 5.4, 95% CI 1.3, 22.2), during 2nd trimester (AOR 2.513, 95% CI 1.5, 4.23) and self-reported lack of time (AOR 2.884, 95% CI 1.410, 5.901). Conclusion and recommendation A moderate proportion of pregnant women reported physical inactivity during pregnancy in the Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka. Physical inactivity was associated with sedentary employment, low income, number of children, trimester, and time constraints. Measures should be undertaken to promote the importance of recommended levels of physical activity, enhance access, and support system targeting pregnant women.

                <p>by Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz, Guido Uguzzoni, Kévin Ricard, Francesca Anselmi, Clément Nizak, Andrea Pagnani, Olivier Rivoire</p>

Exquisite binding specificity is essential for many protein functions but is difficult to engineer. Many biotechnological or biomedical applications require the discrimination of very similar ligands, which poses the challenge of designing protein sequences with highly specific binding profiles. Experimental methods for generating specific binders rely on <i>in vitro</i> selection, which is limited in terms of library size and control over specificity profiles. Additional control was recently demonstrated through high-throughput sequencing and downstream computational analysis. Here we follow such an approach to demonstrate the design of specific antibodies beyond those probed experimentally. We do so in a context where very similar epitopes need to be discriminated, and where these epitopes cannot be experimentally dissociated from other epitopes present in the selection. Our approach involves the identification of different binding modes, each associated with a particular ligand against which the antibodies are either selected or not. Using data from phage display experiments, we show that the model successfully disentangles these modes, even when they are associated with chemically very similar ligands. Additionally, we demonstrate and validate experimentally the computational design of antibodies with customized specificity profiles, either with specific high affinity for a particular target ligand, or with cross-specificity for multiple target ligands. Overall, our results showcase the potential of leveraging a biophysical model learned from selections against multiple ligands to design proteins with tailored specificity, with applications to protein engineering extending beyond the design of antibodies.

                <p>by Richard D. J. G. Ho, Kasumi Kishi, Maciej Majka, Anna Kicheva, Marcin Zagorski</p>

A tight regulation of morphogen production is key for morphogen gradient formation and thereby for reproducible and organised organ development. Although many genetic interactions involved in the establishment of morphogen production domains are known, the biophysical mechanisms of morphogen source formation are poorly understood. Here we addressed this by focusing on the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in the vertebrate neural tube. Shh is produced by the adjacently located notochord and by the floor plate of the neural tube. Using a data-constrained computational screen, we identified different possible mechanisms by which floor plate formation can occur, only one of which is consistent with experimental data. In this mechanism, the floor plate is established rapidly in response to Shh from the notochord and the dynamics of regulatory interactions within the neural tube. In this process, uniform activators and Shh-dependent repressors are key for establishing the floor plate size. Subsequently, the floor plate becomes insensitive to Shh and increases in size due to tissue growth, leading to scaling of the floor plate with neural tube size. In turn, this results in scaling of the Shh amplitude with tissue growth. Thus, this mechanism ensures a separation of time scales in floor plate formation, so that the floor plate domain becomes growth-dependent after an initial rapid establishment phase. Our study raises the possibility that the time scale separation between specification and growth might be a common strategy for scaling the morphogen gradient amplitude in growing organs. The model that we developed provides a new opportunity for quantitative studies of morphogen source formation in growing tissues.

                <p>by Adam M. Roth, John H. Buggeln, Joanna E. Hoh, Jonathan M. Wood, Seth R. Sullivan, Truc T. Ngo, Jan A. Calalo, Rakshith Lokesh, Susanne M. Morton, Stephen Grill, John J. Jeka, Michael J. Carter, Joshua G. A. Cashaback</p>

From a game of darts to neurorehabilitation, the ability to explore and fine tune our movements is critical for success. Past work has shown that exploratory motor behaviour in response to reinforcement (reward) feedback is closely linked with the basal ganglia, while movement corrections in response to error feedback is commonly attributed to the cerebellum. While our past work has shown these processes are dissociable during adaptation, it is unknown how they uniquely impact exploratory behaviour. Moreover, converging neuroanatomical evidence shows direct and indirect connections between the basal ganglia and cerebellum, suggesting that there is an interaction between reinforcement-based and error-based neural processes. Here we examine the unique roles and interaction between reinforcement-based and error-based processes on sensorimotor exploration in a neurotypical population. We also recruited individuals with Parkinson’s disease to gain mechanistic insight into the role of the basal ganglia and associated reinforcement pathways in sensorimotor exploration. Across three reaching experiments, participants were given either reinforcement feedback, error feedback, or simultaneously both reinforcement & error feedback during a sensorimotor task that encouraged exploration. Our reaching results, a re-analysis of a previous gait experiment, and our model suggests that in isolation, reinforcement-based and error-based processes respectively boost and suppress exploration. When acting in concert, we found that reinforcement-based and error-based processes interact by mutually opposing one another. Finally, we found that those with Parkinson’s disease had decreased exploration when receiving reinforcement feedback, supporting the notion that compromised reinforcement-based processes reduces the ability to explore new motor actions. Understanding the unique and interacting roles of reinforcement-based and error-based processes may help to inform neurorehabilitation paradigms where it is important to discover new and successful motor actions.

                <p>by Philip Greulich</p>

The fate choices of stem cells between self-renewal and differentiation are often tightly regulated by <i>juxtacrine</i> (cell-cell contact) signalling. Here, we assess how the interplay between cell division, cell fate choices, and juxtacrine signalling can affect the macroscopic ordering of cell types in self-renewing epithelial sheets, by studying a simple spatial cell fate model with cells being arranged on a 2D lattice. We show in this model that if cells commit to their fate directly upon cell division, macroscopic patches of cells of the same type emerge, if at least a small proportion of divisions are symmetric, except if signalling interactions are laterally inhibiting. In contrast, if cells are first ‘licensed’ to differentiate, yet retaining the possibility to return to their naive state, macroscopic order only emerges if the signalling strength exceeds a critical threshold: if then the signalling interactions are laterally inducing, macroscopic patches emerge as well. Lateral inhibition, on the other hand, can in that case generate periodic patterns of alternating cell types (checkerboard pattern), yet only if the proportion of symmetric divisions is sufficiently low. These results can be understood theoretically by an analogy to phase transitions in spin systems known from statistical physics.

                <p>by Ankur Kamboj, Rajiv Ranganathan, Xiaobo Tan, Vaibhav Srivastava</p>

Conventional approaches to enhance movement coordination, such as providing instructions and visual feedback, are often inadequate in complex motor tasks with multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). To effectively address coordination deficits in such complex motor systems, it becomes imperative to develop interventions grounded in a model of human motor learning; however, modeling such learning processes is challenging due to the large DoFs. In this paper, we present a computational motor learning model that leverages the concept of motor synergies to extract low-dimensional learning representations in the high-dimensional motor space and the internal model theory of motor control to capture both fast and slow motor learning processes. We establish the model’s convergence properties and validate it using data from a target capture game played by human participants. We study the influence of model parameters on several motor learning trade-offs such as speed-accuracy, exploration-exploitation, satisficing, and flexibility-performance, and show that the human motor learning system tunes these parameters to optimize learning and various output performance metrics.

A core function of the olfactory system is to determine the valence of odors. In humans, central processing of odor valence perception has been shown to take form already within the olfactory bulb (OB), but the neural mechanisms by which this important information is communicated to, and from, the olfactory cortex (piriform cortex, PC) in humans are not known. To assess communication between the 2 nodes, we simultaneously measured odor-dependent neural activity in the OB and PC from human participants while obtaining trial-by-trial valence ratings. By doing so, we could determine when subjective valence information was communicated, what kind of information was transferred, and how the information was transferred (i.e., in which frequency band). Support vector machine (SVM) learning was used on the coherence spectrum and frequency-resolved Granger causality to identify valence-dependent differences in functional and effective connectivity between the OB and PC. We found that the OB communicates subjective odor valence to the PC in the gamma band shortly after odor onset, while the PC subsequently feeds valence-related information back to the OB in the beta band. Decoding accuracy was better for negative than positive valence, suggesting a focus on negative valence. Critically, we replicated these findings in an independent data set using additional odors across a larger perceived valence range. Combined, these results demonstrate that the OB and PC communicate levels of subjective odor pleasantness across multiple frequencies, at specific time points, in a direction-dependent pattern in accordance with a two-stage model of odor processing.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002840">Widespread regulation of the maternal transcriptome by Nanos in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohammad Marhabaie, Tammy H. Wharton, Sung Yun Kim, Robin P. Wharton</p>

The translational repressor Nanos (Nos) regulates a single target, maternal <i>hunchback</i> (<i>hb)</i> mRNA, to govern abdominal segmentation in the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. Nos is recruited to sites in the 3′ UTR of <i>hb</i> mRNA in collaboration with the sequence-specific RNA-binding protein Pumilio (Pum); on its own, Nos has no binding specificity. Nos is expressed at other stages of development, but very few mRNA targets that might mediate its action at these stages have been described. Nor has it been clear whether Nos is targeted to other mRNAs in concert with Pum or via other mechanisms. In this report, we identify mRNAs targeted by Nos via 2 approaches. First, we identify mRNAs depleted upon expression of a chimera bearing Nos fused to the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) factor Upf1. We find that, in addition to <i>hb</i>, Upf1-Nos depletes approximately 2,600 mRNAs from the maternal transcriptome in early embryos. Virtually all of these appear to be targeted in a canonical, <i>hb</i>-like manner in concert with Pum. In a second, more conventional approach, we identify mRNAs that are stabilized during the maternal zygotic transition (MZT) in embryos from <i>nos</i><sup>-</sup> females. Most (86%) of the 1,185 mRNAs regulated by Nos are also targeted by Upf1-Nos, validating use of the chimera. Previous work has shown that 60% of the maternal transcriptome is degraded in early embryos. We find that maternal mRNAs targeted by Upf1-Nos are hypoadenylated and inefficiently translated at the ovary–embryo transition; they are subsequently degraded in the early embryo, accounting for 59% of all destabilized maternal mRNAs. We suggest that the late ovarian burst of Nos represses a large fraction of the maternal transcriptome, priming it for later degradation by other factors in the embryo.

Inhibitory interneurons are pivotal components of cortical circuits. Beyond providing inhibition, they have been proposed to coordinate the firing of excitatory neurons within cell assemblies. While the roles of specific interneuron subtypes have been extensively studied, their influence on pyramidal cell synchrony in vivo remains elusive. Employing an all-optical approach in mice, we simultaneously recorded hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal cells and probed the network influence of individual interneurons using optogenetics. We demonstrate that CA1 interneurons form a functionally interconnected network that promotes synchrony through disinhibition during awake immobility, while preserving endogenous cell assemblies. Our network model underscores the importance of both cell assemblies and dense, unspecific interneuron connectivity in explaining our experimental findings, suggesting that interneurons may operate not only via division of labor but also through concerted activity.

                <p>by Kevin Yuswan, Xiaofei Sun, Erina Kuranaga, Daiki Umetsu</p>

Epithelial tissues undergo cell turnover both during development and for homeostatic maintenance. Removal of cells is coordinated with the increase in number of newly dividing cells to maintain barrier function of the tissue. In <i>Drosophila</i> metamorphosis, larval epidermal cells (LECs) are replaced by adult precursor cells called histoblasts. Removal of LECs must counterbalance the exponentially increasing adult histoblasts. Previous work showed that the LEC removal accelerates as endocytic activity decreases throughout all LECs. Here, we show that the acceleration is accompanied by a mode switching from isolated single-cell apoptosis to clustered ones induced by the endocytic activity reduction. We identify the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway via extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) activity as the main components downstream of endocytic activity in LECs. The reduced ERK activity, caused by the decrease in endocytic activity, is responsible for the apoptotic mode switching. Initially, ERK is transiently activated in normal LECs surrounding a single apoptotic LEC in a ligand-dependent manner, preventing clustered cell death. Following the reduction of endocytic activity, LEC apoptosis events do not provoke these transient ERK up-regulations, resulting in the acceleration of the cell elimination rate by frequent clustered apoptosis. These findings contrasted with the common perspective that clustered apoptosis is disadvantageous. Instead, switching to clustered apoptosis is required to accommodate the growth of neighboring tissues.

                <p>by Fanny Mazzamurro, Jason Baby Chirakadavil, Isabelle Durieux, Ludovic Poiré, Julie Plantade, Christophe Ginevra, Sophie Jarraud, Gottfried Wilharm, Xavier Charpentier, Eduardo P. C. Rocha</p>

Natural transformation is the only mechanism of genetic exchange controlled by the recipient bacteria. We quantified its rates in 786 clinical strains of the human pathogens <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> (Lp) and 496 clinical and environmental strains of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (Ab). The analysis of transformation rates in the light of phylogeny revealed they evolve by a mixture of frequent small changes and a few large quick jumps across 6 orders of magnitude. In standard conditions close to half of the strains of Lp and a more than a third in Ab are below the detection limit and thus presumably non-transformable. Ab environmental strains tend to have higher transformation rates than the clinical ones. Transitions to non-transformability were frequent and usually recent, suggesting that they are deleterious and subsequently purged by natural selection. Accordingly, we find that transformation decreases genetic linkage in both species, which might accelerate adaptation. Intragenomic conflicts with chromosomal mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and plasmids could explain these transitions and a GWAS confirmed systematic negative associations between transformation and MGEs: plasmids and other conjugative elements in Lp, prophages in Ab, and transposable elements in both. In accordance with the hypothesis of modulation of transformation rates by genetic conflicts, transformable strains have fewer MGEs in both species and some MGEs inactivate genes implicated in the transformation with heterologous DNA (in Ab). Innate defense systems against MGEs are associated with lower transformation rates, especially restriction-modification systems. In contrast, CRISPR-Cas systems are associated with higher transformation rates suggesting that adaptive defense systems may facilitate cell protection from MGEs while preserving genetic exchanges by natural transformation. Ab and Lp have different lifestyles, gene repertoires, and population structure. Nevertheless, they exhibit similar trends in terms of variation of transformation rates and its determinants, suggesting that genetic conflicts could drive the evolution of natural transformation in many bacteria.

     alt="The Role of Parvalbumin Interneurons in Autism Spectrum Disorder"/>
<p>Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons involved in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and potential therapeutic interventions targeting PV interneurons. Multiply genetic and environmental factors could lead to fewer PV interneurons or downregulation of PV protein. Genetic mutations or epigenetic modifications could directly affect PV interneurons development. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction could also impact the integrity of PV interneurons and further disrupt neuronal development and migration. Aberrant PV interneurons result in functional abnormalities within gamma oscillations and neuronal circuits. Targeting PV interneurons presents a promising therapeutic strategy for ASD. Optogenetic stimulation and cell therapy have the potential to restore the function of PV interneurons and alleviate ASD symptoms.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>As an important subtype of GABAergic interneurons, parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play a critical role in regulating cortical circuits and neural networks. Abnormalities in the development or function of PV interneurons have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and language deficits. In this review, we focus on the abnormalities of PV interneurons in ASD, including quantity and function and discuss the underlying mechanisms of impairments in PV interneurons in the pathology of ASD. Finally, we propose potential therapeutic approaches targeting PV interneurons, such as transplanting MGE progenitor cells and utilizing optogenetic stimulation in the treatment of ASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98841">Operation regimes of spinal circuits controlling locomotion and the role of supraspinal drives and sensory feedback</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion in mammals is directly controlled by the spinal neuronal network, operating under the control of supraspinal signals and somatosensory feedback that interact with each other. However, the functional architecture of the spinal locomotor network, its operation regimes, and the role of supraspinal and sensory feedback in different locomotor behaviors, including at different speeds, remain unclear. We developed a computational model of spinal locomotor circuits receiving supraspinal drives and limb sensory feedback that could reproduce multiple experimental data obtained in intact and spinal-transected cats during tied-belt and split-belt treadmill locomotion. We provide evidence that the spinal locomotor network operates in different regimes depending on locomotor speed. In an intact system, at slow speeds (&lt;0.4 m/s), the spinal network operates in a non-oscillating state-machine regime and requires sensory feedback or external inputs for phase transitions. Removing sensory feedback related to limb extension prevents locomotor oscillations at slow speeds. With increasing speed and supraspinal drives, the spinal network switches to a flexor-driven oscillatory regime and then to a classical half-center regime. Following spinal transection, the model predicts that the spinal network can only operate in the state-machine regime. Our results suggest that the spinal network operates in different regimes for slow exploratory and fast escape locomotor behaviors, making use of different control mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95891">Root-specific theanine metabolism and regulation at the single-cell level in tea plants (Camellia sinensis)</a></h4>

              
                Root-synthesized secondary metabolites are critical quality-conferring compounds of foods, plant-derived medicines, and beverages. However, information at a single-cell level on root-specific secondary metabolism remains largely unexplored. <span class="small-caps">L</span>-Theanine, an important quality component of tea, is primarily synthesized in roots, from which it is then transported to new shoots of tea plant. In this study, we present a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-derived map for the tea plant root, which enabled cell-type-specific analysis of glutamate and ethylamine (two precursors of theanine biosynthesis) metabolism, and theanine biosynthesis, storage, and transport. Our findings support a model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation and does not require high co-expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes within the same cell cluster. This study provides novel insights into theanine metabolism and regulation, at the single-cell level, and offers an example for studying root-specific secondary metabolism in other plant systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92925">Delivery of a Jagged1-PEG-MAL hydrogel with pediatric human bone cells regenerates critically sized craniofacial bone defects</a></h4>

              
                Current treatments for congenital and acquired craniofacial (CF) bone abnormalities are limited and costly. Conventional methods involve surgical correction, short-term stabilization, and long-term bone grafting, which may include problematic allografts and limited autografts. While bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been used for bone regeneration, it can cause bone overgrowth and life-threatening inflammation. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapies, though promising, are not Food and Drug Administration approved and are resource intensive. Thus, there is a need for effective, affordable, and less side-effect-prone bone regenerative therapies. Previous research demonstrated that JAGGED1 induces osteoblast commitment in murine cranial neural crest cells through a NOTCH-dependent non-canonical pathway involving JAK2–STAT5. We hypothesize that delivery of JAGGED1 and induction of its downstream NOTCH non-canonical signaling in pediatric human osteoblasts constitutes an effective bone regenerative treatment. Delivering pediatric human bone-derived osteoblast-like cells to an in vivo murine bone loss model of a critically sized cranial defect, we identified that JAGGED1 promotes human pediatric osteoblast commitment and bone formation through p70 S6K phosphorylation. This approach highlights the potential of JAGGED1 and its downstream activators as innovative treatments for pediatric CF bone loss.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100821">A comparative study of the cryo-EM structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)</a></h4>

              
                The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a large multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through the cell cycle by orchestrating the timely proteolysis of mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle regulatory proteins. Although structures of multiple human APC/C complexes have been extensively studied over the past decade, the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> APC/C has been less extensively investigated. Here, we describe medium resolution structures of three <i>S. cerevisiae</i> APC/C complexes: unphosphorylated apo-APC/C and the ternary APC/C<sup>CDH1</sup>-substrate complex, and phosphorylated apo-APC/C. Whereas the overall architectures of human and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> APC/C are conserved, as well as the mechanism of CDH1 inhibition by CDK-phosphorylation, specific variations exist, including striking differences in the mechanism of coactivator-mediated stimulation of E2 binding, and the activation of APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> by phosphorylation. In contrast to human APC/C in which coactivator induces a conformational change of the catalytic module APC2:APC11 to allow E2 binding, in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> apo-APC/C the catalytic module is already positioned to bind E2. Furthermore, we find no evidence of a phospho-regulatable auto-inhibitory segment of APC1, that in the unphosphorylated human APC/C, sterically blocks the CDC20<sup>C-box</sup> binding site of APC8. Thus, although the functions of APC/C are conserved from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to humans, molecular details relating to their regulatory mechanisms differ.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100987">TRPML1 gating modulation by allosteric mutations and lipids</a></h4>

              
                Transient Receptor Potential Mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a lysosomal cation channel whose loss-of-function mutations directly cause the lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV). TRPML1 can be allosterically regulated by various ligands including natural lipids and small synthetic molecules and the channel undergoes a global movement propagated from ligand-induced local conformational changes upon activation. In this study, we identified a functionally critical residue, Tyr404, at the C-terminus of the S4 helix, whose mutations to tryptophan and alanine yield gain- and loss-of-function channels, respectively. These allosteric mutations mimic the ligand activation or inhibition of the TRPML1 channel without interfering with ligand binding and both mutant channels are susceptible to agonist or antagonist modulation, making them better targets for screening potent TRPML1 activators and inhibitors. We also determined the high-resolution structure of TRPML1 in complex with the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> inhibitor, revealing the structural basis underlying this lipid inhibition. In addition, an endogenous phospholipid likely from sphingomyelin is identified in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-bound TRPML1 structure at the same hotspot for agonists and antagonists, providing a plausible structural explanation for the inhibitory effect of sphingomyelin on agonist activation.

                Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels widely used to optically activate or silence selected electrogenic cells, such as individual brain neurons. Here, we describe identifying and characterizing a set of anion-conducting ChRs (ACRs) from diverse taxa and representing various branches of the ChR phylogenetic tree. The <i>Mantoniella squamata</i> ACR (MsACR1) showed high sensitivity to yellow-green light (<i>λ</i><sub>max</sub> at 555 nm) and was further engineered for optogenetic applications. A single amino-acid substitution that mimicked red-light-sensitive rhodopsins like Chrimson shifted the photosensitivity 20 nm toward red light and accelerated photocurrent kinetics. Hence, it was named red and accelerated ACR, raACR. Both wild-type and mutant are capable optical silencers at low light intensities in mouse neurons <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, while raACR offers a higher temporal resolution.

                Changes in chondrocyte gene expression can contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA), and so recognition of the regulative processes during chondrogenesis can lead to a better understanding of OA. microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in chondrocytes/OA, and we have used a combined experimental, bioinformatic, and systems biology approach to explore the multiple miRNA–mRNA interactions that regulate chondrogenesis. A longitudinal chondrogenesis bioinformatic analysis identified paralogues miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators. Experimental work in human cells demonstrated alteration of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p expression led to significant inverse modulation of key chondrogenic genes and extracellular matrix production. miR-199a/b-5p targets <i>FZD6, ITGA3</i> and <i>CAV1</i> were identified by inhibition experiments and verified as direct targets by luciferase assay. The experimental work was used to generate and parameterise a multi-miRNA 14-day chondrogenesis kinetic model to be used as a repository for the experimental work and as a resource for further investigation of this system. This is the first multi-miRNA model of a chondrogenesis-based system, and highlights the complex relationships between regulatory miRNAs, and their target mRNAs.

                Perceiving emotions from the movements of other biological entities is critical for human survival and interpersonal interactions. Here, we report that emotional information conveyed by point-light biological motion (BM) triggered automatic physiological responses as reflected in pupil size. Specifically, happy BM evoked larger pupil size than neutral and sad BM, while sad BM induced a smaller pupil response than neutral BM. Moreover, this happy over sad pupil dilation effect is negatively correlated with individual autistic traits. Notably, emotional BM with only local motion features retained could also exert modulations on pupils. Compared with intact BM, both happy and sad local BM evoked stronger pupil responses than neutral local BM starting from an earlier time point, with no difference between the happy and sad conditions. These results revealed a fine-grained pupil-related emotional modulation induced by intact BM and a coarse but rapid modulation by local BM, demonstrating multi-level processing of emotions in life motion signals. Taken together, our findings shed new light on BM emotion processing, and highlight the potential of utilizing the emotion-modulated pupil response to facilitate the diagnosis of social cognitive disorders.

                Patients with tauopathies present with profoundly different clinical symptoms, even within the same disorder. A central hypothesis in the field, well-supported by biomarker studies and post-mortem pathology, is that clinical heterogeneity reflects differential degeneration of vulnerable neuronal populations responsible for specific neurological functions. Recent work has revealed mechanisms underlying susceptibility of particular cell types, but relating tau load to disrupted behavior -- especially before cell death -- requires a targeted circuit-level approach. Here we studied two distinct balance behaviors in larval zebrafish expressing a human 0N/4R-tau allele in select populations of evolutionarily-conserved and well-characterized brainstem vestibular circuits. We observed that human tau load predicted the severity of circuit-specific deficits in posture and navigation in the absence of cell death. Targeting expression to either mid- or hindbrain balance neurons recapitulated particular deficits in posture and navigation. By parametrically linking tau load in specific neurons to early behavioral deficits, our work moves beyond cell type to close the gap between pathological and neurological conceptions of tauopathy.

                Lenses are vital components of eyes, crafted through the precise arrangement of proteins to achieve transparency and focusing power, and placed appropriately within the eye for the retina to receive sharp, focused images. Maintaining these states is challenging due to substantial post-embryonic eye and lens growth. Here, we gain insights into required processes by exploring consequences of silencing Lens3, a key lens protein, during growth in Thermonectus marmoratus sunburst diving beetle larvae. We show that lens3RNAi leads to opaque aggregates reminiscent of vertebrate lens cataracts, causing the projection of degraded images which impact behaviour in low light. Our findings uncover how complex biological lenses are constructed and further support that visual input is inconsequential for coordinated eye growth in this clade. We highlight the utility of this insect as a tractable model system to investigate the aetiology of lens cataracts and refractive errors in a sophisticated camera-type eye.

                Neural circuits connecting the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus are fundamental networks for sensorimotor processing and their dysfunction has been consistently implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. These recursive, loop circuits have been investigated in animal models and by clinical neuroimaging, however, direct functional access to developing human neurons forming these networks has been limited. Here, we use human pluripotent stem cells to reconstruct an in vitro cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit by creating a four-part loop assembloid. More specifically, we generate regionalized neural organoids that resemble the key elements of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit, and functionally integrate them into loop assembloids using custom 3D-printed biocompatible wells. Volumetric and mesoscale calcium imaging, as well as extracellular recordings from individual parts of these assembloids reveal the emergence of synchronized patterns of neuronal activity. In addition, a multi-step rabies retrograde tracing approach demonstrate the formation of neuronal connectivity across the network in loop assembloids. Lastly, we apply this system to study heterozygous loss of ASH1L gene associated with autism spectrum disorder and Tourette syndrome and discover aberrant synchronized activity in disease model assembloids. Taken together, this human multi-cellular platform will facilitate functional investigations of the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit in the context of early human development and in disease conditions.

">Inhibition Resolves Simon Conflict: Evidence from EEG Decoding</a></h4>

              
                The congruency sequence effect (CSE), a hypothesized marker of top-down cognitive control, refers to a reduced congruency effect after incongruent trials compared to congruent trials. Although this effect has been observed across various distractor interference tasks, the nature of the control processes underlying the CSE remains a topic of active debate. It has been suggested that cognitive control may resolve conflicts in information processing either by (a) enhancing the representation of goal information and/or (b) suppressing the representation of distractor information. The present study aimed to identify the conflict resolution processes within the context of the color Simon task by decoding the goal and distracting information from human scalp EEG signals. For the decoding analysis, models were trained separately for color and location attributes corresponding to goal and distractor information. Additionally, decoding accuracy was calculated in different frequency bands: theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), low beta (12-20 Hz), and high beta (20-30 Hz). Results showed that decoding accuracy for distractor information was reduced when cognitive control was activated and this pattern was only observed in the high beta-frequency band (20-30 Hz). In contrast, no such difference was observed for target information. These findings suggest that cognitive control regulates Simon conflict by inhibiting distractor representation in the brain, thereby preventing unwanted distraction-driven behaviors.

">High-throughput two-photon volumetric brain imaging in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Imaging neural activities across large volumes at subcellular resolution without impeding animal behaviors remains difficult. Here we introduce a high-throughput miniature Bessel-beam two-photon microscope capable of imaging calcium dynamics from neurons and dendrites over a volume of 420 x 420 x 80 m3 during free behavior. We share full description of the microscope and demonstrate calcium imaging of more than 1000 neurons at a time in freely moving mice.

">Axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons</a></h4>

              
                Sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons have a unique pseudo-unipolar morphology in which a stem axon bifurcates into a peripheral and a central axon, with different regenerative abilities. Whereas peripheral DRG axons regenerate, central axons are unable to regrow. Central axon regeneration can however be elicited by a prior conditioning lesion to the peripheral axon. How DRG axon asymmetry is established, remains unknown. Here we developed an in vitro system replicating DRG pseudo-unipolarization and asymmetric axon regeneration. Using this model, we observed that from early development, central DRG axons have a higher density of growing microtubules. This asymmetry was also present in vivo and was abolished by a conditioning lesion that decreased microtubule polymerization of central DRG axons. An axon-specific microtubule-associated protein (MAP) signature, including the severases spastin and katanin and the microtubule regulators CRMP5 and tau, was found and shown to adapt upon conditioning lesion. Supporting its significance, interfering with the DRG MAP signature either in vitro or in vivo, readily abolished central-peripheral asymmetries in microtubule dynamics and regenerative ability. In summary, our data unveil that axon-specific microtubule regulation drives asymmetric regeneration of sensory neuron axons.

">IGF-1 IMPACTS NEOCORTICAL INTERNEURON CONNECTIVITY IN EPILEPTIC SPASM GENERATION AND RESOLUTION</a></h4>

              
                Little is known about the mechanisms that generate epileptic spasms following perinatal brain injury. Recent studies have implicated reduced levels of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in these patients brains. Other studies have reported low levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. In the TTX brain injury model of epileptic spasms, we undertook experiments to evaluate the impact of IGF-1 deficiencies on neocortical interneurons and their role in spasms. Quantitative immunohistochemical analyses revealed that neocortical interneurons that express glutamic acid decarboxylase, parvalbumin, or synaptotagmin 2 co-express IGF-1. In epileptic rats, expression of these three interneuron markers were reduced in the neocortex. IGF-1 expression was also reduced, but surprisingly this loss was confined to interneurons. Interneuron connectivity was reduced in tandem with IGF-1 deficiencies. Similar changes were observed in surgically resected neocortex from infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) patients. To evaluate the impact of IGF-1 deficiencies on interneuron development, IGF-1R levels were reduced in the neocortex of neonatal conditional IGF-1R knock out mice by viral injections. Four weeks later, this experimental maneuver resulted in similar reductions in interneuron connectivity. Treatment with the IGF-1 derived tripeptide, (1-3)IGF-1, abolished epileptic spasms in most animals, rescued interneuron connectivity, and restored neocortical levels of IGF-1. Our results implicate interneuron IGF-1 deficiencies, possibly impaired autocrine IGF-1 signaling and a resultant interneuron dysmaturation in epileptic spasm generation. By restoring IGF-1 levels, (1-3)IGF-1 likely suppresses spasms by rescuing interneuron connectivity. Results point to (1-3)IGF-1 and its analogues as potential novel disease-modifying therapies for this neurodevelopmental disorder.

">Human brain changes after first psilocybin use</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics have robust effects on acute brain function and long-term behavior but whether they also cause enduring functional and anatomical brain changes is unknown. In a placebo-controlled, within-subjects, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging study in 28 healthy, entirely psychedelic-naive participants, anatomical and functional brain changes were detected from one-hour to one-month after a single high-dose (25 mg) of psilocybin. Increases in cognitive flexibility, psychological insight, and well-being were seen at one-month. Diffusion imaging done before and one-month after 25mg psilocybin revealed decreased axial diffusivity bilaterally in prefrontal-subcortical tracts that correlated with decreased brain network modularity over the same time period. Decreased modularity also correlated with improved well-being. Increased cortical signal entropy at 1- and 2-hours post-dosing predicted improved psychological well-being at one-month. Next-day psychological insight mediated the entropy to well-being relationship. All effects were exclusive to 25mg psilocybin; no effects occurred with a 1mg placebo dose.

">Specific Bacterial Taxa and Their Metabolite, DHPS, Linked to Alzheimers Disease, Parkinsons Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are multifactorial disorders frequently associated with gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated bacterial and metabolic dyshomeostasis in the gut microbiome associated with early disease stages across three NDDs, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimers Disease (AD), Parkinsons Disease (PD), and healthy controls (HC) and discovered a previously unrecognized link between a microbial-derived metabolite with an unknown role in human physiology, 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), and NDDs. DHPS was downregulated in AD, ALS, and PD, while Eubacterium and Desulfovibrio, capable of metabolizing this metabolite,1-4 were increased in all disease cohorts. Additionally, select taxa within the Clostridia class had strong negative correlations to DHPS suggesting a potential role in DHPS metabolism. Hydrogen sulfide is a catabolic product of DHPS,1,5 and hydrogen sulfide promotes inflammation,6-8 oxidative stress,9 mitochondrial damage,10 and gut dysbiosis,2,11 known hallmarks of NDD. These findings suggest that cryptic sulfur metabolism via DHPS is a missing link in our current understanding of NDD onset and progression. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide evidence of a conserved gut-brain axis linkage of specific bacterial taxa and their metabolism of DHPS shared by three neurodegenerative diseases.

">Suppression of Visceral Nociception by Selective C-Fiber Transmission Block Using Temporal Interference Sinusoidal Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Chronic visceral pain management remains challenging due to limitations in selective targeting of C-fiber nociceptors. This study investigates temporal interference stimulation (TIS) on dorsal root ganglia (DRG) as a novel approach for selective C-fiber transmission block. We employed (1) GCaMP6 recordings in mouse whole DRG using a flexible, transparent microelectrode array for visualizing L6 DRG neuron activation, (2) ex vivo single-fiber recordings to assess sinusoidal stimulation effects on peripheral nerve axons, (3) in vivo behavioral assessment measuring visceromotor responses (VMR) to colorectal distension in mice, including a TNBS-induced visceral hypersensitivity model, and (4) immunohistological analysis to evaluate immediate immune responses in DRG following TIS. We demonstrated that TIS (2000 Hz and 2020 Hz carrier frequencies) enabled tunable activation of L6 DRG neurons, with the focal region adjustable by altering stimulation amplitude ratios. Low-frequency (20-50 Hz) sinusoidal stimulation effectively blocked C-fiber and A{delta}-fiber transmission while sparing fast-conducting A-fibers, with 20 Hz showing highest efficacy. TIS of L6 DRG reversibly suppressed VMR to colorectal distension in both control and TNBS-induced visceral hypersensitive mice. The blocking effect was fine-tunable by adjusting interfering stimulus signal amplitude ratios. No apparent immediate immune responses were observed in DRG following hours-long TIS. In conclusion, TIS on lumbosacral DRG demonstrates promise as a selective, tunable approach for managing chronic visceral pain by effectively blocking C-fiber transmission. This technique addresses limitations of current neuromodulation methods and offers potential for more targeted relief in chronic visceral pain conditions.

                Herein, we present the 2.0 update of FiNNpy, which expands the toolkit's initial scope from the analysis of multi-site electrophysiological activity to track information propagation to include source reconstruction capability for MEG signals. Following the toolkit's design guidelines, the new functionality has been optimized towards minimal resource consumption, making source reconstruction much faster, especially when executed in a parallelized fashion. Furthermore, several quality-of-life aspects are introduced to support source reconstruction, such as grouping source-space activity into cortical areas, a cohesive documentation & in-code extensive literature references, and wrapping of previously terminal exclusive functions of FreeSurfer.

	<p>Background: There is considerable evidence supporting the elevated risk of mental health problems in individuals with evening chronotype relative to those with morning or intermediate chronotypes. Recent data, however, suggest that this risk may be explained, at least partially, by poor sleep quality. Methods: This study aimed to further clarify the roles of chronotype and sleep quality in mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress) in young individuals (18&amp;amp;ndash;40 years) living in the UK (n = 185) or Germany (n = 209). Results: Consistent with our recent observations in a comparable North Indian sample, we found that poor quality of sleep had significantly positive associations with adverse mental health outcomes both in the UK and Germany-based samples. Significant associations between evening chronotype and poor mental health were also evident, but these associations were fully mediated by poor quality of sleep in both samples. Conclusions: These observations suggest that efforts to identify sleep disruption in a timely manner and promotion of good sleep may prevent mental health problems, especially in individuals with evening chronotype and other known risks for mental disorders.</p>

In homeostasis, it supports synaptic stability, protects neurons, and helps regulate inhibition/excitation. In pathology, it has been described as degraded or even absent. Sensory deprivation has been shown to alter PNN structures. New Methods: Here, we measured the X-ray diffraction patterns of mouse brain tissue to establish a novel method for examining nanoscale brain structures. Two groups of mice were examined, a control group, and one which underwent 30 days (P0-P30) of whisker-trimming - an established method of sensory deprivation, affecting the mouse barrel cortex (whisker sensory processing region of somatosensory cortex). Mice were perfused, and primary somatosensory cortices (barrel cortex) were isolated for x-ray diffraction imaging. Results: X-ray images were characterized using a specially developed machine-learning approach, and the clusters that correspond to the two groups are well separated in the space of the principal components. Conclusions: We hypothesize that such separation is related to the development of nanoscale structural components within PNNs of control mice and the absence of such structures in sensory deprived mice.

">A biophysically-detailed model of inter-areal interactions in cortical sensory processing</a></h4>

              
                Mechanisms of top-down modulation in sensory perception and their relation to underlying connectivity are not completely understood. We present here a biophysically-detailed computational model of two interconnected cortical areas, representing the first steps in a cortical processing hierarchy, as a tool for potential discovery. The model integrates a large body of data from rodent primary somatosensory cortex and reproduces biological features across multiple scales: from a handful of ion channels defining a diversity of electrical types in hundreds of thousands of morphologically detailed neurons, to local and long-range networks mediated by hundreds of millions of synapses. Notably, long-range connectivity in the model incorporates target lamination patterns associated with feed-forward and feedback pathways. We use the model to study the impact of inter-areal interactions on sensory processing. First, we exhibit a cortico-cortical loop between the two model areas (X and Y), wherein sensory input to area X produces a response with two components in time, the first driven by the stimulus and the second by feedback from area Y. We perform a structural and functional characterization of this loop, finding a differential impact of layer-specific pathways in the feed-forward and feedback directions. Second, we explore stimulus discrimination by presenting four different spatially-segregate stimulus patterns. We observe well-defined temporal sequences of functional cell assembly activation, with stimulus specificity in early but not late assemblies in area X, i.e., in the stimulus-driven component of the response but not in the feedback-driven component. We also find the earliest assembly in area Y to be specific to pairs of patterns, consistent with the topography of connections. Finally, we examine the integration of bottom-up and top-down signals. When presenting a second stimulus coincident with the feedback-driven component, we observe an approximate linear superposition of responses. We find the implied lack of interaction consistent with the naive connectivity in the model and the absence of plasticity mechanisms that would underlie the learning of top-down influences. This work represents a first step in the study of inter-areal interactions with biophysically-detailed simulations.

">Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis</a></h4>

              
                A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which encodes a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. By developing a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the model parameters to the characteristics of the evolving signal and, on the other hand, map them to the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases--- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.

">Can we predict sleep health based on brain features? A large-scale machine learning study</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Normal sleep is crucial for brain health. Recent studies have reported robust associations between sleep disturbance and various brain structural and functional traits. However, the complex interplay between sleep health and macro-scale brain organization remains inconclusive. In this study, we aimed to uncover the links between brain imaging features and diverse sleep health-related characteristics by means of Machine Learning (ML). Methods: We used 28,088 participants from the UK Biobank to calculate 4677 structural and functional neuroimaging markers. Then, we employed them to predict self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, easiness getting up in the morning, chronotype, daily nap, daytime sleepiness, and snoring. We built seven different linear and nonlinear ML models for each sleep health-related characteristic to assess their predictability. Results: We performed an extensive ML analysis that involved more than 100,000 hours of computing. We observed relatively low performance in predicting all sleep health-related characteristics (e.g., balanced accuracy ranging between 0.50-0.59). Across all models, the best performance achieved was 0.59, using a Linear SVM to predict easiness getting up in the morning. Conclusions: The low capability of multimodal neuroimaging markers in predicting sleep health-related characteristics, even under extensive ML optimization in a large population sample suggests a complex relationship between sleep health and brain organization.

">Amyloid-beta, alpha-synuclein and tau aggregated co-pathologies enhance neuropathology and neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Lewy pathology due to alpha-synuclein (-syn) inclusions is one of the major hallmarks of Parkinson Disease (PD). A{beta}-Amyloid (A{beta}) and phosphorylated tau, pathologies usually found in Alzheimers Disease (AD), have also been implicated in PD, with over 50% of patients exhibited the co-expression of these proteins (co-pathologies). In both AD and PD postmortem tissue, neuroinflammation, the activation of microglia and resident macrophages and the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery, including T cells and monocytes, are drivers of neurodegeneration. However, how the co-expression of these pathologies contribute to the inflammatory response and overall neurodegenerative disease phenotype remains unknown. To understand how the co-expression of pathologies drives neuropathology, we developed a novel co-pathology model by stereotaxically injecting -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum, and AAV-doublemut tau virus into the entorhinal cortex, of 3-month-old J20 transgenic mice with A{beta} pathology. We analyzed immune cell populations in the brain and periphery at 3 months post-induction (3MPI). At 6MPI, neuronal loss in the hippocampus and substantia nigra pars compacta were assessed along with pathological protein deposition. At 3MPI, the co-pathology mouse model begins to exhibit enhanced pathology load in the cortex and hippocampus. There was a robust neuroinflammatory response in interconnected brain regions, including increased microglial cell number, changes in microglial activation markers, and infiltration of T cells. This was synergistic in the co-pathology model, compared to the individual models, supporting the hypothesis that these collectively may drive the progression of disease.

">Neural mechanisms of adaptive value coding in the amygdala</a></h4>

              
                To address their needs, animals must optimize behavior by integrating external cues with internal state signals, such as hunger or thirst, environmental conditions, and past experiences. Accordingly, the perceived value of a reward varies depending on an animal's current needs. Updating the specific value of rewards predicted by external cues depends on the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, neurophysiological investigations have centered around the assumption of stimulus-invariant value representations and have not been able to account for behavioral findings that support the BLA's ability to represent stimulus-specific value of distinct appetitive or aversive outcomes. To address how the BLA encodes and updates stimulus-specific value representations, we exposed head-fixed mice to distinct sets of gustatory rewards while tracking perceived value using lick microstructural analysis. Two-photon calcium imaging of BLA principal neurons revealed that the magnitude of the BLA population response scaled with perceived reward value and that the values of different rewards were encoded by distinct neuronal subpopulations. Moreover, reward representations rapidly re-scaled when mice were exposed to a reward that was larger than all previous rewards. Finally, value representations depended on an animal's internal state as thirst selectively increased the responses to water rewards whereas aversive experiences strongly attenuated responses to sucrose. Our findings demonstrate that value representations in the BLA are stimulus-specific and highly adaptive to account for changes in relative reward value and to reflect an animal's current affective and homeostatic state. This mechanism enables sensory-specific value updates necessary for state-adapted decision making and learning.

">Integration of distinct cortical inputs to primary and higher order inhibitory cells of the thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex controls its own sensory input in part through top-down inhibitory mechanisms. Descending corticothalamic projections drive GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which govern thalamocortical cell activity via inhibition. Neurons in sensory TRN are organized into primary and higher order (HO) subpopulations, with separate intrathalamic connections and distinct genetic and functional properties. Here, we investigated top-down neocortical control over primary and HO neurons of somatosensory TRN. Projections from layer 6 of somatosensory cortex evoked stronger and more state-dependent activity in primary than in HO TRN, driven by more robust synaptic inputs and potent T-type calcium currents. However, HO TRN received additional, physiologically distinct, inputs from motor cortex and layer 5 of S1. Thus, in a departure from the canonical focused sensory layer 6 innervation characteristic of primary TRN, HO TRN integrates broadly from multiple corticothalamic systems, with unique state-dependence, extending the range of mechanisms for top-down control.

	<p>(1) Background: This study investigates the resting-state brain characteristics of skeleton athletes compared to healthy age-matched non-athletes, using resting-state fMRI to investigate long-term skeleton-training-related changes in the brain. (2) Methods: Eleven skeleton athletes and twenty-three matched novices with no prior experience with skeleton were recruited. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were explored to investigate resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, aiming to elucidate differences in resting-state brain function between the two groups. (3) Results: Compared to the control group, skeleton athletes exhibited significantly higher ALFF in the left fusiform, left inferior temporal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left and right insula, left Rolandic operculum, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Skeleton athletes exhibit stronger functional connectivity in brain regions associated with cognitive and motor control (superior frontal gyrus, insula), as well as those related to reward learning (putamen), visual processing (precuneus), spatial cognition (inferior parietal), and emotional processing (amygdala), during resting-state brain function. (4) Conclusions: The study contributes to understanding how motor training history shapes skeleton athletes&amp;amp;rsquo; brains, which have distinct neural characteristics compared to the control population, indicating potential adaptations in brain function related to their specialized training and expertise in the sport.</p>

	<p>Background: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) among adolescents poses significant risks to academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. This study examines the prevalence and risk factors of EDS in adolescents in Bangladesh and utilizes machine learning approaches to predict the risk of EDS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1496 adolescents using a structured questionnaire. Data were collected through a two-stage stratified cluster sampling method. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS. Machine learning models, including Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), were employed to identify and predict EDS risk factors using Python and Google Colab. Results: The prevalence of EDS in the cohort was 11.6%. SHAP values from the CatBoost model identified self-rated health status, gender, and depression as the most significant predictors of EDS. Among the models, GBM achieved the highest accuracy (90.15%) and precision (88.81%), while CatBoost had comparable accuracy (89.48%) and the lowest log loss (0.25). ROC-AUC analysis showed that CatBoost and GBM performed robustly in distinguishing between EDS and non-EDS cases, with AUC scores of 0.86. Both models demonstrated the superior predictive performance for EDS compared to others. Conclusions: The study emphasizes the role of health and demographic factors in predicting EDS among adolescents in Bangladesh. Machine learning techniques offer valuable insights into the relative contribution of these factors, and can guide targeted interventions. Future research should include longitudinal and interventional studies in diverse settings to improve generalizability and develop effective strategies for managing EDS among adolescents.</p>

                Background Major depression (MD) is a prevalent and disabling condition in Chile, with most cases being treated at the primary care level. In Chilean primary care, the authors have identified key factors associated with more complex presentations of MD and a poorer prognosis, such as a history of childhood trauma, suicidality, and comorbidities. These findings underscore the need for a multidimensional, trauma-informed, and interprofessional approach to the treatment of depression. Methods This protocol is a two-arm, single-blinded, cluster RCT to compare the effectiveness of a collaborative multidimensional approach for depression (CMAD) versus usual care to treat MD in primary care clinics in Chile. In total, 394 depressed adults from 18 to 65 years of age in twelve clinics located in Chile’s Maule Region will be consented to participate in the study. Patients and care teams from each clinic will be randomized to the intervention or to the control arm. Interprofessional teams in the intervention arm will attend 27 hours of didactic and active learning sessions focused on clinical competences to effectively engage, treat and follow up patients with the factors associated to the complex presentation of MD. Team in the control arm will receive 27 didactic sessions on current clinical guidelines for MD. Patients of both arms will be blindly assessed at baseline, three months, and six months. The primary outcome will be the reduction in depressive symptoms, with secondary outcomes including improvements in anxiety symptoms, interpersonal and social functioning, and treatment adherence.

                Background Maternal mortality is the main indicator of maternal health worldwide. The aims of your study were to determine the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in the governorate of Tunis and to identify the main causes of maternal death. Methods We included all maternal deaths between January 2017 and December 2023, reported to the Tunis Regional Health Directorate. The data collected included the MMR per 100000 live birth, sociodemographic characteristics, causes of death, circumstances of death, autopsy findings, and preventability. Results Sixty one maternal deaths were recorded. The average of MMR was 46, 88 per 100000 live births. Two peaks in the MMR were noted in 2017 and 2020. The average age of the patients was 34, 1 years (±5.1). We noted that 43, 75 % of the patients were not residents of the governorate of Tunis. The postpartum period was the most critical. In fact, 83, 33 % of maternal deaths occurred postpartum. Hemorrhage was the main etiology in 20.8% of cases. The second cause was COVID- 19complicationsin 16, 6% of cases. Conclusion This study of maternal mortality in Tunis opens the debate on the effectiveness of maternal health policies in Tunisia and the areas for improvement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1217/v1?src=rss">The usefulness of a rehabilitation programme for people with stress-related disorders - A case from a rehabilitation center in Estonia. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Rehabilitation programs help to improve people’s lives and reduce turnover rates in organisations. The current analysis revealed that dissatisfaction occurred among practitioners, doctors’ overlapping services, and fragmented plans. No comprehensive assessment and rehabilitation program currently exists for stress-related disorders in Estonia indicating an urgent need to conduct research and development programs for clients to reduce stress (Bugarski, Z, et al., 2016). This study research aimed to determine the usefulness of rehabilitation programs for individuals people with stress-related disorders. Method A qualitative approach was used. Methodology The sample included 10 individuals recruited from various rehabilitation centers in Estonia. Convenience sampling was used to select participants for this research. Open- and closed-ended questions were formulated using the 12 questions enclosed in this research. All transcribed interviews were formatted using the code. Extract codes within participant interviews were compared to identify similarities, differences, and closeness, and therefore formulated categories. Results The findings revealed that rehabilitation programs contribute to quality services, self-motivation, daily activities plan, self-control, recovery, attention and concentration, and coping skills, whereas traditional treatment can reduce symptoms but not change people’s lives. Conclusion This study suggests that rehabilitation programs are useful for individuals with stress disorders in the context of the Estonian healthcare system. The rehabilitation program is a useful intervention method revealed in the context of Estonia’s healthcare system, as it improves quality services, increases coping skills, self-control, and cognitive skills, and enhances recovery.

                Eosinophilia serves as an indicator of allergy and parasite infestation. Eosinophil granules are believed to have adverse effects on cells and contribute to oxidative stress. In our current study, we investigated the relationship between eosinophilia and healthy subjects in terms of nuclear DNA damage in peripheral leukocytes. The comet assay was employed to test whole blood samples from 52 subjects in each group. The results revealed that eosinophilia subjects exhibited significantly higher levels of nuclear DNA damage in leukocytes compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, a weak positive association was observed between eosinophil counts and DNA damage. Our findings suggest that eosinophilia is linked to systemic oxidative DNA damage.

                Background Tunisia was one of the most affected nations with COVID-19 disease. The clinical features of this illness range from asymptomatic illness to death. Aim To analyse the survival of patients admitted to a Tunisian tertiary care center (Sahloul University Hospital) and identify independent predictive factors for hospital COVID-19 mortality. Methods A longitudinal study was conducted among confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Sahloul University Hospital between September 2020 and September 2022. Cox univariate regression was used to calculate the Hazard Ratio (HR) of death for patient characteristics regarding the time at risk. Risk factors with a p value of 0.2 or less in the univariate analysis were initially included in the multivariate Cox regression models. Results During the study at Sahloul Hospital, 1978 patients were hospitalized, averaging 55.65 years in age (± 21.39). Among them, 417 deaths occurred, with a median survival of 30 days (± 3.11) [23.904-36.096]. Factors significantly affecting the survival curve were: Age, male gender, comorbidities, diabetes, hypertension, endocrine diseases, obesity, intubation, and ICU admission Multilevel survival analyses revealed that hypertension (aHR 1.24; CI [1.02-1.52]; p=0.028), ICU admission (aHR 12.20- CI [9.56-15.57]; p<10-3), and male gender (HR 1.19; CI [0.98-1.46]; p=0.076) were independent factors associated with COVID-19 mortality. Conclusion Our study concluded the importance of the early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients to decrease this virus mortality. A good understanding of the possible clinical factors associated with COVID-19 severity is helpful for clinicians in identifying patients who are at high risk and require prioritized treatment to minimize death.

                The study aimed at identifying the prevalence of preterm labor and the associated risk factors. Design A quantitative approach using a retrospective case-control study. Setting Tertiary care hospital of Udupi district Karnataka. Population or Sample Women delivered in tertiary care Hospital of Udupi district, Karnataka, were the sample; among them, the cases (250) were the records of the women who had delivered before 37 weeks of gestation, and controls (500) were the records of women who delivered after 37 weeks of gestation and without any complications. Method The study was conducted using a retrospective case-control design by reviewing the case records of women who had delivered in a tertiary care hospital. Main Outcome Measures Women delivered in tertiary care Hospital of Udupi district, Karnataka, and their inpatient records were assessed for risk factors during the antenatal and delivery periods. Results The study revealed that the prevalence of preterm labor was 356 (14.86%) Out of 2402 deliveries. Among them, only 250 were assessed. It was significantly correlated with age, place of residence, degree of education, occupation, marital status, gravid para, number of deliveries, type of deliveries, gap between births, blood type, and religion. Pregnant women who had been exposed or had a risk for preterm labor included those who had been diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension, medication during pregnancy, history of abortion, intense physical labor, and conception dates older than 30 years. Conclusion The preterm labor prevalence can be minimized if the modifiable risk factors are in control. Non-modifiable risk factors require keen supervision. Thus, health professionals must be alert to all modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

                Background Molecular hybridization in drug design is proved to be very successful approach to provide new chemical entities with potential activities and desirable physicochemical properties. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in controlling the behavior and acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins and their inhibition causes block of cell growth, differentiation, changes in gene expression, and death. Consequently, HDAC inhibitors may lead to anticytotoxic activity. An approach of synthesizing hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid via an amino acid or aminoalkanoic acid was considered. This approach is expected to optimize the anticytotoxic activity of the proposed compounds. Methods Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid (2A-E) were synthesized and their chemical structures were confirmed by spectral analyses (FT-IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR). These were subjected to molecular docking on HDAC8 (PDB ID: 1T69). Computational methods were employed using the SwissADME server to predict the ADME parameters and other physicochemical properties. The cytotoxicity evaluation was performed using MTT colorimetric assay. Results Hybrids (2A-E) recorded lower ΔG (-6.322 to - 9.46) than Vorinostat (SAHA, -5.375). ΔG is an affinity scoring function (kcal/mol) and is employed to rank the candidate poses as the sum of the electrostatic and Van der Waals energies. Benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid by a p-aminobenzoic acid (2E) has recorded the lowest docking score of -9.460 and this may refer to the possibility of high inhibitory activity. The hybrids showed no violation from Lipinski’s rule and complied with parameters with low possible passive oral absorption and no penetration into BBB. Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole recorded very interesting results, particularly, 2D and 2E which showed significant and remarkable activity. Conclusions Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid recorded very interesting results, particularly, compounds 2D and 2E which showed significant and remarkable activity on lung cancer cell line type A549.

                Background: Considering the importance of exploring the development of reasoning skills during preschool period and the suitability of using a culturally linguistically relevant story-based approach for the same, the present research intended to profile the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children between 36 and 72 months using a story-based approach. The specific objectives were to develop explanation, prediction, and inference based reasoning tasks around a story and assess the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children using the same. Method: Reasoning tasks across explanation, prediction, and inference domains were developed based on a story and evaluated for its psychometric properties. The developed tasks were then administered to 63 typically developing Indian preschool children attending English medium schools in Mangalore. The preschoolers were equally divided into three age groups, and the responses obtained across the age groups were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: The developed tasks were confirmed to have good psychometric properties like content validity and reliability. The age comparisons of reasoning abilities using one-way ANOVA suggested an increase in reasoning abilities with age during the preschool period. The qualitative analysis further suggested that with increasing age, the nature of reasoning changed from content-based reasoning to reasoning based on prior knowledge which was integrated with the story content. Conclusion: The study describes reasoning skill development using a story-based task in Indian preschoolers. The study findings further provide clinical and educational implications to assess and foster reasoning abilities among preschoolers.

                Background Academic achievement is the result of both effort and perseverance exerted by the students. This mixed-methods study aims to investigate the factors affecting the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was utilized. In the quantitative phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 1008 students (773 females and 235 males) from 23 Syrian universities. A questionnaire consisting of 48 items was designed to be completed by pharmacy students using a 5-point Likert scale. In the qualitative phase, twelve questions were developed to interview thirty pharmacy students from five Syrian universities to obtain in-depth insights into the factors influencing their academic achievement. Results A significant number of students lacked effective time management skills, identified as a weakness among students. The majority of students faced challenges in maintaining a consistent study routine, averaging a score of (2.0). Motivation towards learning emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing academic performance. Lecturers in the pharmacy faculty employed traditional teaching methods (2.01), and the pharmacy curriculum was perceived as lacking modernity (1.92). Quantitative findings demonstrated that pharmacy students experienced exam-related anxiety (2.05), identified as a weakness in the qualitative phase. Factors associated with the Syrian crisis, like unreliable electricity (1.87) and transportation issues (1.83), could have an impact on academic achievement. Economic conditions were identified as challenging to students’ academic performance, negatively affecting the learning process (1.98). Conclusion The results of the study demonstrate that personal factors, lecturers, educational environment, exams, and the Syrian crisis influence the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities.

                Background Neuropathy is common in both Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Leprosy, often resulting in neuropathic ulcers. Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers are frequently misdiagnosed as DM-related, causing delays in appropriate care. This case report underscores the importance of timely recognition and a better understanding of Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers to prevent misdiagnosis and improve patient outcomes. Methods The case report adopt the CARE Guidelines and was conducted at the Wound Care Specialist Clinic, Griya Afiat, Makassar, East Indonesia. Data were collected using a Minimum Data Sheet (MDS) to capture demographics, health history, and history of treatments. A head-to-toe assessment focused on the eyes, hands, and feet, with neuropathy, confirmed using the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament test, and angiopathy was assessed by palpating the dorsal pedis and posterior tibialis pulse. Wound care interventions consisted of cleansing, debridement, and dressing. Given the similarities between Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers and DM-related neuropathic ulcers, the DMIST (depth, maceration, inflammation/infection, size, tissue type of the wound bed, type of wound edge, and tunnelling/undermining) tool was used to evaluate wound healing progress. Results Anamnesis indicated patient has no DM, with normal blood glucose; however, the patient had neuropathic wounds on her feet, asymmetrical eyebrow distribution, and rashes on her hands and calves, with neuropathy confirmed by a monofilament test—initial treatment involved Cadexomer Iodine powder to control bacterial growth and Honey-based gel to promote granulation. Over 62 days, 11 treatments were administered, with an average dressing change every 5.6 days, which improved the DMIST score from 12 to 4 by the end of observation day. Conclusions This case report highlights the significance of distinguishing leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers from those associated with DM to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. By employing comprehensive assessment tools and targeted wound care interventions, significant improvements in wound healing were achieved, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and clinical vigilance in managing Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers.

                <p>by Jessica L. Gaines, Kwang S. Kim, Ben Parrell, Vikram Ramanarayanan, Alvincé L. Pongos, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, John F. Houde</p>

Behavioral speech tasks have been widely used to understand the mechanisms of speech motor control in typical speakers as well as in various clinical populations. However, determining which neural functions differ between typical speakers and clinical populations based on behavioral data alone is difficult because multiple mechanisms may lead to the same behavioral differences. For example, individuals with cerebellar ataxia (CA) produce atypically large compensatory responses to pitch perturbations in their auditory feedback, compared to typical speakers, but this pattern could have many explanations. Here, computational modeling techniques were used to address this challenge. Bayesian inference was used to fit a state feedback control (SFC) model of voice fundamental frequency (<i>fo</i>) control to the behavioral pitch perturbation responses of speakers with CA and typical speakers. This fitting process resulted in estimates of posterior likelihood distributions for five model parameters (sensory feedback delays, absolute and relative levels of auditory and somatosensory feedback noise, and controller gain), which were compared between the two groups. Results suggest that the speakers with CA may proportionally weight auditory and somatosensory feedback differently from typical speakers. Specifically, the CA group showed a greater relative sensitivity to auditory feedback than the control group. There were also large group differences in the controller gain parameter, suggesting increased motor output responses to target errors in the CA group. These modeling results generate hypotheses about how CA may affect the speech motor system, which could help guide future empirical investigations in CA. This study also demonstrates the overall proof-of-principle of using this Bayesian inference approach to understand behavioral speech data in terms of interpretable parameters of speech motor control models.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1210/v1?src=rss">Unleashing the cardioprotective potential of Ezetimibe against Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in Wistar rats: Targeting oxidative stress and NF-κB-mediated inflammation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent antineoplastic agent used in treating various adult and pediatric cancers, but it tends to provoke dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Ezetimibe (EZE), a cholesterol-lowering drug, has been reported to possess defensive actions against oxidative stress and inflammation, which are two of the main proposed mechanisms underlying the development of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), hence, we aimed to inspect the possible protective effect of EZE against DIC in rats. Methods 24 adult male Wistar rats were allocated into four groups of six: control, DOX, 10 mg/kg EZE plus DOX and 20 mg/kg EZE plus DOX. At the end of the study, the experimental rats were anesthetized and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis, after which the hearts were excised and heart tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and gene expression analyses. Results Pretreatment with EZE at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg alleviated cardiac damage induced by DOX, as EZE blunted the rise in serum levels of cardiac injury biomarkers, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Additionally, pretreating rats with EZE at either dose mitigated DOX-induced oxidative stress by elevating the levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), with consequent reduction in the lipid peroxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) in cardiac tissues. Furthermore, pretreatment with either dose of EZE hindered DOX-mediated inflammation, where EZE suppressed cardiac nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and negatively regulated the gene expression of its downstream proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) with either dose and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) with the higher one. Conclusions Our findings indicate that EZE exhibited cardioprotection against DIC in rats, which makes EZE an interesting area for further investigations, animal- and human-wise, that can pave the way for a potential clinical application in preventing DIC in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-486/v2?src=rss">Reliability, validity, and minimal clinically important differences for the Thai-version of the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ-Thai) in patients with chronic venous disease [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are essential for assessing the health of patients with chronic venous disease (CVD). Therefore, we aimed to translate the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire into Thai language (AVVQ-Thai) and evaluate its reliability and validity. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of the AVVQ-Thai also be estimated. Methods International standards for PROM translation were followed including the forward-backwards translation of the AVVQ. Patients with Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) C2-C6 with truncal reflux were prospectively included. Venous interventions were used to treat reflux and varicosities. Patients’ characteristics, venous clinical severity scores (VCSS), EuroQol EQ-5D, and AVVQ-Thai were collected pre- and one-month post-intervention. AVVQ-Thai was also collected one to two weeks after the initial visit by reply-paid postal questionnaire. Results The study included 119 patients (30% C2, 29% C3, 28% C4, 11% C5, and 2% C6). The AVVQ-Thai had good internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.783 and moderate reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.79). The AVVQ-Thai was significantly correlated with VCSS and was able to discriminate patients with different levels of health problems as assessed by EQ-5D at both pre-and post-intervention, demonstrating good construct and discriminative validity. The median AVVQ scores improved significantly after intervention from 15.4 (IQR 8.3, 24.2) to 4.2 (IQR 1.3, 8.4) in C2-C3, and 18.9 (IQR 14.1, 25.5) to 7.3 (IQR 4.6, 16.3) in C4-C6. The MCID of the AVVQ was 6.21 on the 0-100 scale, which equates to the level of difference necessary to be clinically meaningful. Conclusions AVVQ-Thai has satisfactory evidence for internal consistency, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change and is recommended for application in Thailand.

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>The study aimed to compare outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in pediatric patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) versus cardioembolism (CE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Save ChildS and KidClot cohorts were merged. Children with AIS because of FCA or CE that underwent MT were included. The study used the Childhood Arterial Ischemic Stroke Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation (CASCADE) for stroke cause assessment. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models were used to analyze final modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) scores, periprocedural complications, and functional outcomes assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 to 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 60 children with 14 FCA and 46 CE cases. CE etiology was associated with better revascularization (good to excellent thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores) and shift toward better outcomes (common adjusted odds ratio of mRs for CE vs FCA: 0.27, 95% CI: [0.06–0.97], <i>p</i> = 0.039), with no difference in favorable outcome rates. FCA was associated with significantly lower rates of excellent revascularization (21% vs 65%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No difference in complications' rates was observed between the groups (7.2% in FCA vs 5.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.69).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found that pediatric AIS because of CE etiology has more favorable procedural outcomes compared to FCA following MT. This translated to mixed functional outcomes that may be more favorable in the CE group. These findings highlight the need for further research to refine treatment protocols for pediatric stroke, particularly in understanding and managing FCA in children.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pathological studies suggest that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions endure multiple waves of damage and repair; however, the dynamics and characteristics of these processes are poorly understood in patients living with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 128 MS patients (75 relapsing–remitting, 53 progressive) and 72 healthy controls who underwent advanced magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination at baseline and 2 years later. Magnetization transfer saturation and multi-shell diffusion imaging were used to quantify longitudinal changes in myelin and axon volumes within MS lesions. Lesions were grouped into 4 classes (repair, damage, mixed repair damage, and stable). The frequency of each class was correlated to clinical measures, demographic characteristics, and levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stable lesions were the most frequent (<i>n</i> = 2,276; 44%), followed by lesions with patterns of “repair” (<i>n</i> = 1,352; 26.2%) and damage (<i>n</i> = 1,214; 23.5%). The frequency of “repair” lesion was negatively associated with disability (β = −0.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and sNfL (β = −0.16; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at follow-up. The frequency of the “damage” class was higher in progressive than relapsing–remitting patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and was related to disability (baseline: β = −0.078; follow-up: β = −0.076; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and age (baseline: β = −0.078; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Stable lesions were more frequent in relapsing–remitting than in progressive patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and in younger patients versus older (β = −0.07; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline. Further, “mixed” lesions were most frequent in older patients (β = 0.004; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings show that repair and damage processes within MS lesions occur across the entire disease spectrum and that their frequency correlates with patients disability, age, disease duration, and extent of neuroaxonal damage. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96738">Regulatory genome annotation of 33 insect species</a></h4>

              
                Annotation of newly sequenced genomes frequently includes genes, but rarely covers important non-coding genomic features such as the <i>cis</i>-regulatory modules—e.g., enhancers and silencers—that regulate gene expression. Here, we begin to remedy this situation by developing a workflow for rapid initial annotation of insect regulatory sequences, and provide a searchable database resource with enhancer predictions for 33 genomes. Using our previously developed SCRMshaw computational enhancer prediction method, we predict over 2.8 million regulatory sequences along with the tissues where they are expected to be active, in a set of insect species ranging over 360 million years of evolution. Extensive analysis and validation of the data provides several lines of evidence suggesting that we achieve a high true-positive rate for enhancer prediction. One, we show that our predictions target specific loci, rather than random genomic locations. Two, we predict enhancers in orthologous loci across a diverged set of species to a significantly higher degree than random expectation would allow. Three, we demonstrate that our predictions are highly enriched for regions of accessible chromatin. Four, we achieve a validation rate in excess of 70% using in vivo reporter gene assays. As we continue to annotate both new tissues and new species, our regulatory annotation resource will provide a rich source of data for the research community and will have utility for both small-scale (single gene, single species) and large-scale (many genes, many species) studies of gene regulation. In particular, the ability to search for functionally related regulatory elements in orthologous loci should greatly facilitate studies of enhancer evolution even among distantly related species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85042">Cell-cell interaction determines cell fate of mesoderm-derived cell in tongue development through Hh signaling</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of primary cilia leads to genetic disorder, ciliopathies, which shows various malformations in many vital organs such as brain. Multiple tongue deformities including cleft, hamartoma, and ankyloglossia are also seen in ciliopathies, which yield difficulties in fundamental functions such as mastication and vocalization. Here, we found these tongue anomalies in mice with mutation of ciliary protein. Abnormal cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCC) failed to evoke Hh signal for differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into myoblasts, which resulted in abnormal differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into adipocytes. The ectopic adipose subsequently arrested tongue swelling formation. Ankyloglossia was caused by aberrant cell migration due to lack of non-canonical Wnt signaling. In addition to ciliopathies, these tongue anomalies are often observed as non-familial condition in human. We found that these tongue deformities could be reproduced in wild-type mice by simple mechanical manipulations to disturb cellular processes which were disrupted in mutant mice. Our results provide hints for possible future treatment in ciliopathies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99026">Genome-wide mapping of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells</a></h4>

              
                The interplay between G4s and R-loops are emerging in regulating DNA repair, replication, and transcription. A comprehensive picture of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells is currently lacking. Here, we describe the development of HepG4-seq and an optimized HBD-seq methods, which robustly capture native G4s and R-loops, respectively, in living cells. We successfully employed these methods to establish comprehensive maps of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in human HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We discovered that co-localized G4s and R-loops are dynamically altered in a cell type-dependent manner and are largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptional active genes. We further demonstrated the helicase Dhx9 as a direct and major regulator that modulates the formation and resolution of co-localized G4s and R-loops. Depletion of Dhx9 impaired the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs by altering the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops -associated genes. Taken together, our work established that the endogenous co-localized G4s and R-loops are prevalently persisted in the regulatory regions of active genes and are involved in the transcriptional regulation of their linked genes, opening the door for exploring broader roles of co-localized G4s and R-loops in development and disease.

In this study, we used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model as the major analysis method to perform hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on the data from MRC IEU OpenGWAS (18,097 exposure traits and 16 AD outcome traits), and conducted sensitivity analysis with six models, to assess the robustness of the IVW results, to identify various classes of risk or protective factors for AD, early-onset AD, and late-onset AD. We generated 400,274 data entries in total, among which the major analysis method of the IVW model consists of 73,129 records with 4840 exposure traits, which fall into 10 categories: Disease, Medical laboratory science, Imaging, Anthropometric, Treatment, Molecular trait, Gut microbiota, Past history, Family history, and Lifestyle trait. More importantly, a freely accessed online platform called MRAD (<a href="https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/">https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/</a>) has been developed using the Shiny package with MR analysis results. Additionally, novel potential AD therapeutic targets (CD33, TBCA, VPS29, GNAI3, PSME1) are identified, among which CD33 was positively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. TBCA and VPS29 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. GNAI3 and PSME1 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with LOAD, but had no significant causal association with EOAD. The findings of our research advance our understanding of the etiology of AD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92915">Heterozygous expression of a Kcnt1 gain-of-function variant has differential effects on somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing cortical GABAergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                More than 20 recurrent missense gain-of-function (GOF) mutations have been identified in the sodium-activated potassium (K<sub>Na</sub>) channel gene <i>KCNT1</i> in patients with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), most of which are resistant to current therapies. Defining the neuron types most vulnerable to KCNT1 GOF will advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide refined targets for precision therapy efforts. Here, we assessed the effects of heterozygous expression of a <i>Kcnt1</i> GOF variant (<i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup>) on K<sub>Na</sub> currents and neuronal physiology among cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in mice, including those expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV), to identify and model the pathogenic mechanisms of autosomal dominant <i>KCNT1</i> GOF variants in DEEs. Although the <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant had no effects on glutamatergic or VIP neuron function, it increased subthreshold K<sub>Na</sub> currents in both SST and PV neurons but with opposite effects on neuronal output; SST neurons became hypoexcitable with a higher rheobase current and lower action potential (AP) firing frequency, whereas PV neurons became hyperexcitable with a lower rheobase current and higher AP firing frequency. Further neurophysiological and computational modeling experiments showed that the differential effects of the <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant on SST and PV neurons are not likely due to inherent differences in these neuron types, but to an increased persistent sodium current in PV, but not SST, neurons. The <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant also increased excitatory input onto, and chemical and electrical synaptic connectivity between, SST neurons. Together, these data suggest differential pathogenic mechanisms, both direct and compensatory, contribute to disease phenotypes, and provide a salient example of how a pathogenic ion channel variant can cause opposite functional effects in closely related neuron subtypes due to interactions with other ionic conductances.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94001">Transcriptional inhibition after irradiation occurs preferentially at highly expressed genes in a manner dependent on cell cycle progression</a></h4>

              
                In response to DNA double-strand damage, ongoing transcription is inhibited to facilitate accurate DNA repair while transcriptional recovery occurs after DNA repair is complete. However, the mechanisms at play and the identity of the transcripts being regulated in this manner are unclear. In contrast to the situation following UV damage, we found that transcriptional recovery after ionizing radiation (IR) occurs in a manner independent of the HIRA histone chaperone. Sequencing of the nascent transcripts identified a programmed transcriptional response, where certain transcripts and pathways are rapidly downregulated after IR, while other transcripts and pathways are upregulated. Specifically, most of the loss of nascent transcripts occurring after IR is due to inhibition of transcriptional initiation of the highly transcribed histone genes and the rDNA. To identify factors responsible for transcriptional inhibition after IR in an unbiased manner, we performed a whole genome gRNA library CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Many of the top hits on our screen were factors required for protein neddylation. However, at short times after inhibition of neddylation, transcriptional inhibition still occurred after IR, even though neddylation was effectively inhibited. Persistent inhibition of neddylation blocked transcriptional inhibition after IR, and it also leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we uncovered that many inhibitors and conditions that lead to cell cycle arrest in G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> phase also prevent transcriptional inhibition after IR. As such, it appears that transcriptional inhibition after IR occurs preferentially at highly expressed genes in cycling cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97602">Cell class-specific long-range axonal projections of neurons in mouse whisker-related somatosensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                Long-range axonal projections of diverse classes of neocortical excitatory neurons likely contribute to brain-wide interactions processing sensory, cognitive and motor signals. Here, we performed light-sheet imaging of fluorescently labeled axons from genetically defined neurons located in posterior primary somatosensory barrel cortex and supplemental somatosensory cortex. We used convolutional networks to segment axon-containing voxels and quantified their distribution within the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas Common Coordinate Framework. Axonal density was analyzed for different classes of glutamatergic neurons using transgenic mouse lines selectively expressing Cre recombinase in layer 2/3 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Rasgrf2-dCre), layer 4 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Scnn1a-Cre), layer 5 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Tlx3-Cre), layer 5 pyramidal tract projection neurons (Sim1-Cre), layer 5 projection neurons (Rbp4-Cre), and layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (Ntsr1-Cre). We found distinct axonal projections from the different neuronal classes to many downstream brain areas, which were largely similar for primary and supplementary somatosensory cortices. Functional connectivity maps obtained from optogenetic activation of sensory cortex and wide-field imaging revealed topographically organized evoked activity in frontal cortex with neurons located more laterally in somatosensory cortex signaling to more anteriorly located regions in motor cortex, consistent with the anatomical projections. The current methodology therefore appears to quantify brain-wide axonal innervation patterns supporting brain-wide signaling.

                <p>Autonoetic consciousness (ANC), the ability to re-experience personal past events links episodic memory and self-consciousness by bridging awareness of oneself in a past event (i.e., during its encoding) with awareness of oneself in the present (i.e., during the reliving of a past event). Recent neuroscience research revealed a bodily form of self-consciousness, including the sense of agency (SoA) and the sense of body ownership (SoO) that are based on the integration of multisensory bodily inputs and motor signals. However, the relation between SoA and/or SoO with ANC is not known. Here, we used immersive virtual reality technology and motion tracking and investigated the potential association of SoA/SoO with ANC. For this, we exposed participants to different levels of visuomotor and perspectival congruency, known to modulate SoA and SoO, during the encoding of virtual scenes and collected ANC ratings 1 week after the encoding session. In a total of 74 healthy participants, we successfully induced systematic changes in SoA and SoO during encoding and found that ANC depended on the level of SoA experienced during encoding. Moreover, ANC was positively associated with SoA, but only for the scene encoded with preserved visuomotor and perspectival congruency, and such SoA&ndash;ANC coupling was absent for SoO and control questions. Collectively, these data provide behavioral evidence in a novel paradigm that links a key subjective component of bodily self-consciousness during encoding, SoA, to the subjective reliving of those encoded events from one's past, ANC.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0314-24.2024?rss=1">Role of the Nucleus Accumbens in Signaled Avoidance Actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals, humans included, navigate their environments guided by sensory cues, responding adaptively to potential dangers and rewards. Avoidance behaviors serve as adaptive strategies in the face of signaled threats, but the neural mechanisms orchestrating these behaviors remain elusive. Current circuit models of avoidance behaviors indicate that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the ventral striatum plays a key role in signaled avoidance behaviors, but the nature of this engagement is unclear. Evolving perspectives propose the NAc as a pivotal hub for action selection, integrating cognitive and affective information to heighten the efficiency of both appetitive and aversive motivated behaviors. To unravel the engagement of the NAc during active and passive avoidance, we used calcium imaging fiber photometry to examine NAc GABAergic neuron activity in <I>ad libitum</I> moving mice performing avoidance behaviors. We then probed the functional significance of NAc neurons using optogenetics and genetically targeted or electrolytic lesions. We found that NAc neurons code contraversive orienting movements and avoidance actions. However, direct optogenetic inhibition or lesions of NAc neurons did not impair active or passive avoidance behaviors, challenging the notion of their purported pivotal role in adaptive avoidance. The findings emphasize that while the NAc encodes avoidance movements, it is not required for avoidance behaviors, highlighting the distinction between behavior encoding or representation and mediation or generation.</p>

                Introduction In recent years, the number of cardiac surgeries has been on the rise. Several predictive models have been developed to assess the risk of mortality for these patients. EuroSCORE II, a widely used model, demonstrates good discrimination and calibration for the European population, but its accuracy may vary in the Indonesian population. The purpose of this study was to develop a scoring model tailored to Indonesian population, which may have better accuracy in assessing in-hospital mortality risk among adult cardiac surgery patients. Method A retrospective study was conducted using medical records of adult cardiac surgery patients from four participating hospitals. Potential risk factors were included as variables and analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with the L-backward method. Bootstrapping was applied to enhance the model’s validity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for each model, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess discrimination ability, while the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate calibration. Results We extracted data from 4,875 patients, with a mean age of 50.41 years, and most patients were men (63.1%). The majority of patients were in NYHA class I-II. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.5%. From 62 potential variables, 13 variables were included in the final model. Our new model demonstrated strong discrimination and calibration (AUC 0.7564; Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.9510). Conclusion The newly developed scoring model exhibited good discrimination and calibration, making it a promising tool for predicting in-hospital mortality in adult cardiac surgery patients in Indonesia.

                Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the need for resilient health systems. However, Ghana does not seem to achieve commensurate results, suggesting potential gaps in critical interventions. This study examines these gaps by drawing on global experiences to guide Ghana's preparedness for future emergencies. Methods A scoping review based on the synthesis of published journal articles and grey literature was used to gather relevant evidence to address the study’s objective. Peer-reviewed literature searches were conducted in databases, including Medline, Scopus, and Health Sources, supplemented by searches on organizational websites to identify grey literature. We adopted the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) framework to explore how health systems responded to the COVID-19 pandemic globally and draw lessons for strengthening Ghana's health system resilience. We analyzed policy responses in three main areas: pandemic preparedness, crisis management, and response and recovery. Results Ten strategies emerged from the study as critical in strengthening health system resilience against future pandemics. These strategies include whole-of-government engagement, financing for preparedness, community engagement and trust, robust surveillance systems, emergency medical care, diverse workforce development, digital health integration, critical health infrastructure, well-planned commodities/products, and social capital. Each strategy plays a vital role in enhancing preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, highlighting the multifaceted approach needed to mitigate the impact of future pandemics on health systems. Conclusions The identified strategies align with the attributes of a resilient healthcare system. By adopting these strategies, Ghana can build a resilient healthcare system that effectively addresses future challenges, guided by global insights and experiences.

                Background Various studies across different settings have validated Days Alive and Out of Hospital (DAOH) as a valuable outcome for clinical research in surgery and other fields. However, there is no clear consensus on the definitions and methods used to handle and report DAOH in perioperative care studies. Objective We aim to identify, describe, and summarize the available research on DAOH to understand how it is being conceptualized and utilized in clinical studies on perioperative care. Methods We will conduct a scoping review to analyze and synthesize the existing studies using DAOH to measure clinical results on perioperative care. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and CENTRAL. Screening, eligibility, inclusion and data extraction processes will be performed by two reviewers, with a third reviewer solving disagreements. We will present our results descriptively. Conclusions We expect to provide a comprehensive overview of how DAOH is conceptualized and utilized in clinical studies on perioperative care, with particular attention to methodological approaches and the role of electronic health-care records (EHRs) among the different regions.

                <p>by Giacomo Barzon, Ettore Ambrosini, Antonino Vallesi, Samir Suweis</p>

The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions. Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance, manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation, distraction inhibition, and behavioral adaptation. Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks. Therefore, developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states (EEG microstates) and optimal transport theory. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, thus confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. By utilizing a fully data-driven method, this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain.

                <p>by Marta Sampaio, Miguel Rocha, Oscar Dias</p>

<i>Vitis vinifera</i>, also known as grapevine, is widely cultivated and commercialized, particularly to produce wine. As wine quality is directly linked to fruit quality, studying grapevine metabolism is important to understand the processes underlying grape composition. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) have been used for the study of plant metabolism and advances have been made, allowing the integration of omics datasets with GSMMs. On the other hand, Machine learning (ML) has been used to analyze and integrate omics data, and while the combination of ML with GSMMs has shown promising results, it is still scarcely used to study plants. Here, the first GSSM of <i>V</i>. <i>vinifera</i> was reconstructed and validated, comprising 7199 genes, 5399 reactions, and 5141 metabolites across 8 compartments. Tissue-specific models for the stem, leaf, and berry of the Cabernet Sauvignon cultivar were generated from the original model, through the integration of RNA-Seq data. These models have been merged into diel multi-tissue models to study the interactions between tissues at light and dark phases. The potential of combining ML with GSMMs was explored by using ML to analyze the fluxomics data generated by green and mature grape GSMMs and provide insights regarding the metabolism of grapes at different developmental stages. Therefore, the models developed in this work are useful tools to explore different aspects of grapevine metabolism and understand the factors influencing grape quality.

                <p>by George Gabriel, Faisal Mushtaq, J. Ryan Morehead</p>

From tying one’s shoelaces to driving a car, complex skills involving the coordination of multiple muscles are common in everyday life; yet relatively little is known about how these skills are learned. Recent studies have shown that new sensorimotor skills involving re-mapping familiar body movements to unfamiliar outputs cannot be learned by adjusting pre-existing controllers, and that new task-specific controllers must instead be learned “de novo”. To date, however, few studies have investigated de novo learning in scenarios requiring continuous and coordinated control of relatively unpractised body movements. In this study, we used a myoelectric interface to investigate how a novel controller is learned when the task involves an unpractised combination of relatively untrained continuous muscle contractions. Over five sessions on five consecutive days, participants learned to trace a series of trajectories using a computer cursor controlled by the activation of two muscles. The timing of the generated cursor trajectory and its shape relative to the target improved for conditions trained with post-trial visual feedback. Improvements in timing transferred to all untrained conditions, but improvements in shape transferred less robustly to untrained conditions requiring the trained order of muscle activation. All muscle outputs in the final session could already be generated during the first session, suggesting that participants learned the new task by improving the selection of existing motor commands. These results suggest that the novel controllers acquired during de novo learning can, in some circumstances, be constructed from components of existing controllers.

                <p>by Alexis Bénichou, Jean-Baptiste Masson, Christian L. Vestergaard</p>

Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred to as “building blocks of complex networks”. Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enable the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. Here, we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which allows us to compare different motifs and select the collectively most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. Our approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on <i>a priori</i> specification of an appropriate null model. It thus overcomes common problems in hypothesis testing-based motif analysis and guarantees robust statistical inference. We validate our methodology on numerical data and then apply it on synaptic-resolution biological neural networks, as a medium for comparative connectomics, by evaluating their respective compressibility and characterize their inferred circuit motifs.

                <p>by Colby Fronk, Jaewoong Yun, Prashant Singh, Linda Petzold</p>

Symbolic regression with polynomial neural networks and polynomial neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are two recent and powerful approaches for equation recovery of many science and engineering problems. However, these methods provide point estimates for the model parameters and are currently unable to accommodate noisy data. We address this challenge by developing and validating the following Bayesian inference methods: the Laplace approximation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, and variational inference. We have found the Laplace approximation to be the best method for this class of problems. Our work can be easily extended to the broader class of symbolic neural networks to which the polynomial neural network belongs.

                <p>by Amanda Craine, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Christopher T. Villongco, Kevin Vincent, David E. Krummen, Sanjiv M. Narayan, Roy C. P. Kerckhoffs, Jeffrey H. Omens, Francisco Contijoch, Andrew D. McCulloch</p>

In patients with dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF), cardiac conduction abnormalities cause the regional distribution of myocardial work to be non-homogeneous. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using an implantable, programmed biventricular pacemaker/defibrillator, can improve the synchrony of contraction between the right and left ventricles in DHF, resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality and increased quality of life. Since regional work depends on wall stress, which cannot be measured in patients, we used computational methods to investigate regional work distributions and their changes after CRT. We used three-dimensional multi-scale patient-specific computational models parameterized by anatomic, functional, hemodynamic, and electrophysiological measurements in eight patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who received CRT. To increase clinical translatability, we also explored whether streamlined computational methods provide accurate estimates of regional myocardial work.
We found that CRT increased global myocardial work efficiency with significant improvements in non-responders. Reverse ventricular remodeling after CRT was greatest in patients with the highest heterogeneity of regional work at baseline, however the efficacy of CRT was not related to the decrease in overall work heterogeneity or to the reduction in late-activated regions of high myocardial work. Rather, decreases in early-activated regions of myocardium performing negative myocardial work following CRT best explained patient variations in reverse remodeling. These findings were also observed when regional myocardial work was estimated using ventricular pressure as a surrogate for myocardial stress and changes in endocardial surface area as a surrogate for strain. These new findings suggest that CRT promotes reverse ventricular remodeling in human dyssynchronous heart failure by increasing regional myocardial work in early-activated regions of the ventricles, where dyssynchrony is specifically associated with hypoperfusion, late systolic stretch, and altered metabolic activity and that measurement of these changes can be performed using streamlined approaches.

<p>Concluding Schema: Taken together with our previous reports, histaminergic neurons originating from the ventral tuberomammillary nucleus (VTM) project to the olfactory bulb (OB) without much branching prior to the OB. Their axons (orange lines) extended to the granule cell layer (GCL), the internal plexiform layer (IPL), the mitral cell layer (MCL), the external plexiform layer (EPL), the glomerular layer (GL), and the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) in the OB. The maximal density of histaminergic axions is observed in the GL, followed by the ONL and GCL. The glomerulus is enlarged to show a schematic diagram for synaptic transmission. The <span class="smallCaps">l</span>-histidine decarboxylase–immunoreactive (HDC-ir) profiles received asymmetrical synapses (red arrows) from olfactory nerves (ON) and indicate synapses (green arrow) containing pleomorphic vesicles with postsynaptic densities to nonolfactory nerve elements (non-ON), thus forming serial synapses. It also receives asymmetric transmission (red arrow) from a profile that appears to be mitral/tufted (M/T) cell.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Odor information is modulated by centrifugal inputs from other brain regions to the olfactory bulb (OB). Neurons containing monoamines, such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline, are well known as centrifugal inputs; however, the role of histamine, which is also present in the OB, is not well understood. In this study, we examined the histaminergic neurons projecting from the hypothalamus to the OB. We used an antibody against histidine decarboxylase (HDC), a synthesizing enzyme of histamine, to identify histaminergic neurons and assess their localization within the OB and the ultrastructure of their fibers and synapses using multiple immunostaining laser microscopy, ultra-high voltage electron microscopy (EM), and EM to confirm their relationships with other neurons. To further identify the origin nucleus of the histaminergic neurons projecting to the OB, we injected the retrograde tracer FluoroGold and analyzed the pathway to the OB anterogradely. HDC-immunoreactive (-ir) fibers were abundant in the olfactory nerve (ON) layer compared to other monoamines. HDC-ir neurons received asymmetrical synapses from ONs and formed synapses containing pleomorphic vesicles with variable postsynaptic densities to non-ON elements, thus forming serial synapses. We also confirmed that histaminergic neurons project from the rostral ventral tuberomammillary nucleus to the granule cell layer of the OB and, for the first time, successfully visualized their axons from the hypothalamus to the OB. These findings indicate that histamine may regulate odor discrimination in the OB, suggesting a regulatory relationship between hypothalamic function and olfaction. We thus elucidate morphological mechanisms with tuberomammillary nucleus–derived histaminergic neurons involved in olfactory information.</p>

<p>Expression of dopamine receptors (<i>Drd1</i>, <i>Drd2</i>, <i>Drd3—</i>green) was quantified via RNAScope in HVC, Area X, and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of testosterone treated canaries, along with colocalization of <i>VGlut2</i> (orange), <i>Gad2</i> (red), and <i>Egr1</i> (pink). Illustrated are nuclei studied, dopaminergic projections of PAG, and an example HVC section.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Highly sensitive in situ hybridization procedures (RNAScope) were used to quantify the expression of three dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2, and Drd3) in two song control nuclei (HVC and the Area X of the basal ganglia) that are known to receive dopaminergic inputs and in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of male and female canaries. Both sexes were treated with testosterone to ensure they would sing actively. We also determined the excitatory versus inhibitory phenotype of the cells expressing these receptors as well as their activation following a period of song production. The three receptor types were identified in each brain area, with the exception of Drd3 in Area X. The density of cells expressing each receptor varied as a function of receptor type and brain area. Surprisingly few sex differences were detected; they do not seem to explain the sex differences in testosterone-induced song. Overall, the density of Drd-positive cells was much lower in PAG than in the two song control nuclei. In HVC, the majority of cells expressing the three receptor subtypes were VGlut2-positive, whereas colocalization with Vglut2 occurred in few cells in Area X and in an intermediate proportion of cells in PAG. The number of inhibitory cells expressing dopamine receptors was limited. Most dopaminoceptive cells in Area X did not express either excitatory or inhibitory markers. Finally, cellular activation during singing behavior, as measured by the expression of Egr1, was observed in cells expressing each of the three dopamine receptor subtypes, except Drd3 in the PAG.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After severe corticospinal tract damage poststroke in humans, some recovery of strength and movement proximally is evident. It is possible that alternate motor pathways, such as the reticulospinal tract, may be upregulated to compensate for the loss of corticospinal tract input. We investigated the extent of reticulospinal tract excitability modulation and its inter-dependence on the severity of corticospinal tract damage after stroke in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel startle conditioned transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm to elicit ipsilateral motor evoked potentials, an index of reticulospinal tract excitability, in 22 chronic stroke participants with mild to severe corticospinal tract damage and 14 neurotypical age-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was higher in the paretic arm of people with severe corticospinal tract damage compared to their non-paretic arm, people with mild corticospinal tract damage, and age-matched controls. Interestingly, ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was correlated with motor impairment across the entire stroke cohort, whereby individuals with worse impairment exhibited more frequent ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (ie, higher reticulospinal tract excitability).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Following severe corticospinal tract damage, upregulated reticulospinal tract activity may compensate for a loss of corticospinal tract input, providing some proximal recovery of isolated and within-synergy movements, but deficits in performing out of synergy movements and finger fractionation remain. Interventions aimed at modulating the reticulospinal tract could be beneficial or detrimental to ameliorating motor impairment depending on the degree of reliance on this pathway for residual motor output.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1035/v2?src=rss">Role of Artificial intelligence model in prediction of low back pain using T2 weighted MRI of Lumbar spine [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Low back pain (LBP), the primary cause of disability, is the most common musculoskeletal disorder globally and the primary cause of disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are inconclusive and less sensitive for identifying and classifying patients with LBP. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the prediction of LBP using T2 weighted MRI image of the lumbar spine. Methods This was a prospective case-control study. A total of 200 MRI patients (100 cases and controls each) referred for lumbar spine and whole spine screening were included. The scans were performed using 3.0 Tesla MRI (United Imaging Healthcare). T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine were segmented to extract radiomic features. Machine learning (ML) models, such as random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, adaboost, and deep learning methods (DL), such as ResNet and GoogleNet, were used, and performance measures were calculated. Results Our study showed that Random forest and AdaBoost are the most reliable ML models for predicting LBP. Random forest showed high performance with area under curve (AUC) values from 0.83 to 0.88 across all lumbar vertebrae and L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 intervertebral discs (IVDs), with AUCs of 0.88 the highest at L5-S1 IVD (0.92). Adaboost demonstrated high performance at the L2-L5 vertebrae with AUC values of 0.82 to 0.90, with the highest AUC (0.97) at the L5-S1 IVD. Among the DL models, GoogleNet outperformed the other models at 30 epochs with an accuracy of 0.85, followed by ResNet 18 (30 epochs) with an accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion The study demonstrated that ML and DL models can effectively predict LBP from MRI T2 weighted image of the lumbar spine. ML and DL models could also enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LBP, potentially leading to better patient management and outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1187/v1?src=rss">Re-conceptualization of the learning environment as a dynamic system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In Japanese language education, the term "learning environment" is used in various contexts. This paper investigates the term "learning environment" in previous studies and notes that traditional learning environments have been characterized as "morphological characteristics learning environments" focusing on static learners. However, since learning environments involve a dynamic, reciprocal relationship where learners and their surroundings interact and evolve, the paper advocates for a re-conceptualization of "experiential-ecological learning environments" that captures this dynamic nature. Furthermore, to enrich the experiential-ecological learning environment for learners, the presence of learning environment engineers and the meaningful valuing of environmental enrichments is essential. Lastly, the paper emphasizes that by combining various individual learning experiences, it is possible to create a sustainable and richer learning environment.
