	<p>Graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have attracted much attention in the task of electroencephalogram (EEG) emotion recognition. However, most features of current GCNs do not take full advantage of the causal connection between the EEG signals in different frequency bands during the process of constructing the adjacency matrix. Based on the causal connectivity between the EEG channels obtained by Granger causality (GC) analysis, this paper proposes a multi-frequency band EEG graph feature extraction and fusion method for EEG emotion recognition. First, the original GC matrices between the EEG signals at each frequency band are calculated via GC analysis, and then they are adaptively converted to asymmetric binary GC matrices through an optimal threshold. Then, a kind of novel GC-based GCN feature (GC-GCN) is constructed by using differential entropy features and the binary GC matrices as the node values and adjacency matrices, respectively. Finally, on the basis of the GC-GCN features, a new multi-frequency band feature fusion method (GC-F-GCN) is proposed, which integrates the graph information of the EEG signals at different frequency bands for the same node. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GC-F-GCN method achieves better recognition performance than the state-of-the-art GCN methods, for which average accuracies of 97.91%, 98.46%, and 98.15% were achieved for the arousal, valence, and arousal&amp;amp;ndash;valence classifications, respectively.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Obesity is thought to arise, in part, from deficits in the inhibitory control over appetitive behavior. Such motivational processes are regulated by neuromodulators, specifically acetylcholine (ACh), via &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR). These nAChR are highly enriched in the thalamus and contribute to the thalamic gating of cortico-striatal signaling, but also act on the mesoaccumbal reward system. The changes in &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability, however, have not been demonstrated in human obesity thus far. The aim of our study was, thus, to investigate whether there is altered brain &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in individuals with obesity compared to normal-weight healthy controls. Methods: We studied 15 non-smoking individuals with obesity (body mass index, BMI: 37.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.1 kg/m2; age: 39 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14 years, 9 females) and 16 normal-weight controls (non-smokers, BMI: 21.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.7 kg/m2; age: 28 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7 years, 13 females) by using PET and the &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR selective (&amp;amp;minus;)-[18F]flubatine, which was applied within a bolus-infusion protocol (294 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16 MBq). Volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis was performed in order to calculate the regional total distribution volume (VT). Results: No overall significant difference in VT between the individuals with obesity and the normal-weight volunteers was found, while the VT in the nucleus basalis of Meynert tended to be lower in the individuals with obesity (10.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.1 versus 11.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.2; p = 0.10), and the VT in the thalamus showed a tendency towards higher values in the individuals with obesity (26.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.5 versus 25.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.2; p = 0.09). Conclusion: While these first data do not show greater brain &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in human obesity overall, the findings of potentially aberrant &amp;amp;alpha;4&amp;amp;beta;2* nAChR availability in the key brain regions that regulate feeding behavior merit further exploration.</p>

	<p>The body of mammals harbors two distinct types of adipose tissue: while cells within the white adipose tissue (WAT) store surplus energy as lipids, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is nowadays recognized as the main tissue for transforming chemical energy into heat. This process, referred to as &amp;amp;lsquo;non-shivering thermogenesis&amp;amp;rsquo;, is facilitated by the uncoupling of the electron transport across mitochondrial membranes from ATP production. BAT-dependent thermogenesis acts as a safeguarding mechanism under reduced ambient temperature but also plays a critical role in metabolic and energy homeostasis in health and disease. In this review, we summarize the evolutionary structure, function and regulation of the BAT organ under neuronal and hormonal control and discuss its mutual interaction with the central nervous system. We conclude by conceptualizing how better understanding the multifaceted communicative links between the brain and BAT opens avenues for novel therapeutic approaches to treat obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To determine the short- and medium-term therapeutic effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and to study the optimal position of activated contacts for RLS symptoms. Methods: We preoperatively and postoperatively assessed PD Patients with RLS undergoing STN-DBS. Additionally, we recorded the stimulation parameters that induced RLS or relieved RLS symptoms during a follow-up. Finally, we reconstructed the activated contacts&amp;amp;rsquo; position that reduced or induced RLS symptoms. Results: 363 PD patients were enrolled. At the 1-year follow-up, we found that the IRLS sum significantly decreased in the RLS group (preoperative 18.758 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.706, postoperative 8.121 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.083, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The results of the CGI score, MOS sleep, and RLS QLQ all showed that the STN-DBS improved RLS symptoms after one year. Furthermore, the activated contacts that relieved RLS were mainly located in the central sensorimotor region of the STN. Activated contacts in the inferior sensorimotor part of the STN or in the substantia nigra might have induced RLS symptoms. Conclusions: STN-DBS improved RLS in patients with PD in one year, which reduced their sleep disorders and increased their quality of life. Furthermore, the central sensorimotor region part of the STN is the optimal stimulation site.</p>

                <p><b>Brain Sciences, Vol. 12, Pages 1647: Toward a New Approach to Investigate the Role of Working Memory in Stereotype Threat Effects</b></p>

	<p>Stereotype threat arises when the activation of negative stereotypes about a group impairs performance of stigmatized individuals on stereotype relevant tasks. There is ample evidence that stereotype threat leads to performance detriments by consuming executive resources. Several studies indeed showed that working memory (WM) mediates stereotype threat effects among young adults. More recently, researchers have sought to understand whether the same mechanisms underlie age-based stereotype threat, but findings are mixed regarding the role of WM and some authors rather favor a motivational explanation based on regulatory fit. The present review critically appraises the empirical support for distinct forms of stereotype threat effects mediated by distinct mechanisms. We propose a novel approach based on one of the most recent WM models, the time-based resource sharing model, to evaluate the impact of stereotype threat on attentional resources in WM among both young and older adults.</p>

	<p>This article provides an overview of verbal lie detection research. This type of research began in the 1970s with examining the relationship between deception and specific words. We briefly review this initial research. In the late 1980s, Criteria-Based Content Analysis (CBCA) emerged, a veracity assessment tool containing a list of verbal criteria. This was followed by Reality Monitoring (RM) and Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN), two other veracity assessment tools that contain lists of verbal criteria. We discuss their contents, theoretical rationales, and ability to identify truths and lies. We also discuss similarities and differences between CBCA, RM, and SCAN. In the mid 2000s, &amp;amp;lsquo;Interviewing to deception&amp;amp;rsquo; emerged, with the goal of developing specific interview protocols aimed at enhancing or eliciting verbal veracity cues. We outline the four most widely researched interview protocols to date: the Strategic Use of Evidence (SUE), Verifiability Approach (VA), Cognitive Credibility Assessment (CCA), and Reality Interviewing (RI). We briefly discuss the working of these protocols, their theoretical rationales and empirical support, as well as the similarities and differences between them. We conclude this article with elaborating on how neuroscientists can inform and improve verbal lie detection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Networks Implicated in Autobiographical Memory Training</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Training of autobiographical memory has been proposed as an intervention to improve cognitive function. The neural substrates for such improvements are poorly understood. Several brain areas have been previously linked to autobiographical recollection, including structures in the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network. Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes in connectivity within different neural networks support distinct aspects of memory improvement in response to training on a group of 59 human subjects. We found that memory training using olfactory cues increases resting-state intranetwork DMN connectivity, and this associates with improved recollection of cue-specific memories. On the contrary, training decreased resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, a decrease that correlated with improved ability for voluntary recall. Moreover, preliminary data indicate that only the decrease in sensorimotor connectivity associated with the training-induced decrease in the tumor necrosis factor &alpha; (TNF&alpha;) factor, an immune modulation previously linked to improved cognitive performance. We identified functional and biochemical factors that associate with distinct memory processes improved by autobiographical training. Pathways which connect autobiographical memory with both high-level cognition and somatic physiology are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Discounting of Future Rewards and Punishments in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temporal reward discounting describes the decrease of value of a reward as a function of delay. Decision-making between future aversive outcomes is much less studied, and there is no clear decision pattern across studies; while some authors suggest that human and nonhuman animals prefer sooner over later painful shocks, others found the exact opposite. In a series of three experiments, Long&ndash;Evans rats chose between differently timed electric shocks and rewards in a T-maze. In experiment 1, rats chose between early and late painful shocks with identical, long reward delays; in experiment 2, they chose between early reward and early shocks, or late rewards and late shocks; in experiment 3, they chose between early and late rewards, with identical, short delays to the shock. We tested the predictions of two competing hypotheses: the aversive discounting theory assumes that future shocks are discounted, and, hence, less unpleasant than early shocks. The utility from anticipation theory implies that rats derive negative utility from waiting for the shock; late shocks should, hence, be more unpleasant than early shocks. We did not find unanimous evidence for either theory. Instead, our results are more consistent with the <I>post hoc</I> idea that shocks may have negative spill-over effects on reward values, the closer in time a shock is to a subsequent reward, the stronger the reward is devalued. Interestingly and consistent with our theory, we find that, depending on the temporal shock-reward contiguity, rats can be brought to prefer later over sooner rewards of identical magnitudes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">HDAC2 in Primary Sensory Neurons Constitutively Restrains Chronic Pain by Repressing {alpha}2{delta}-1 Expression and Associated NMDA Receptor Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>&alpha;2-1 (encoded by the <I>Cacna2d1</I> gene) is a newly discovered NMDA receptor-interacting protein and is the therapeutic target of gabapentinoids (e.g., gabapentin and pregabalin) frequently used for treating patients with neuropathic pain. Nerve injury causes sustained &alpha;2-1 upregulation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which promotes NMDA receptor synaptic trafficking and activation in the spinal dorsal horn, a hallmark of chronic neuropathic pain. However, little is known about how nerve injury initiates and maintains the high expression level of &alpha;2-1 to sustain chronic pain. Here, we show that nerve injury caused histone hyperacetylation and diminished enrichment of histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2), but not HDAC3, at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter in the DRG. Strikingly, <I>Hdac2</I> knockdown or conditional knockout in DRG neurons in male and female mice consistently induced long-lasting mechanical pain hypersensitivity, which was readily reversed by blocking NMDA receptors, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with gabapentin or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDA receptor interaction at the spinal cord level. <I>Hdac2</I> deletion in DRG neurons increased histone acetylation levels at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter, upregulated &alpha;2-1 in the DRG, and potentiated &alpha;2-1&ndash;dependent NMDA receptor activity at primary afferent central terminals in the spinal dorsal horn. Correspondingly, <I>Hdac2</I> knockdown-induced pain hypersensitivity was blunted in <I>Cacna2d1</I> knockout mice. Thus, our findings reveal that HDAC2 functions as a pivotal transcriptional repressor of neuropathic pain via constitutively suppressing &alpha;2-1 expression and ensuing presynaptic NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord. HDAC2 enrichment levels at the <I>Cacna2d1</I> promoter in DRG neurons constitute a unique epigenetic mechanism that governs acute-to-chronic pain transition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excess &alpha;2-1 proteins produced after nerve injury directly interact with glutamate NMDA receptors to potentiate synaptic NMDA receptor activity in the spinal cord, a prominent mechanism of nerve pain. Because &alpha;2-1 upregulation after nerve injury is long lasting, gabapentinoids relieve pain symptoms only temporarily. Our study demonstrates for the first time the unexpected role of intrinsic HDAC2 activity at the &alpha;2-1 gene promoter in limiting &alpha;2-1 gene transcription, NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity, and chronic pain development after nerve injury. These findings challenge the prevailing view about the role of general HDAC activity in promoting chronic pain. Restoring the repressive HDAC2 function and/or reducing histone acetylation at the &alpha;2-1 gene promoter in primary sensory neurons could lead to long-lasting relief of nerve pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurexin-{beta} Mediates the Synaptogenic Activity of Amyloid Precursor Protein</a></h4>

              
                <p>In addition to its role in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid precursor protein (APP) has physiological roles in synapse development and function. APP induces presynaptic differentiation when presented to axons, but the mechanism is unknown. Here we show that APP binds neurexin to mediate this synaptogenic activity. APP specifically binds &beta; not &alpha; neurexins modulated by splice site 4. Binding to neurexin heparan sulfate glycan and LNS protein domains is required for high-affinity interaction and for full-length APP to recruit axonal neurexin. The synaptogenic activity of APP is abolished by triple knockdown of neurexins in hippocampal neurons pooled from male and female rats. Based on these and previous results, our model is that a dendritic-axonal <I>trans</I> dimer of full-length APP binds to axonal neurexin-&beta; to promote synaptic differentiation and function. Furthermore, soluble sAPPs also bind neurexin-&beta; and inhibit its interaction with neuroligin-1, raising the possibility that disruption of neurexin function by altered levels of full-length APP and its cleavage products may contribute to early synaptic deficits in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The prevailing model for the basis of Alzheimer's disease is the amyloid cascade triggered by altered cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP also has physiological roles at the synapse, but the molecular basis for its synaptic functions is not well understood. Here, we show that APP binds the presynaptic organizing protein neurexin-&beta; and that neurexin is essential for the synaptogenic activity of APP. Furthermore, soluble APP forms generated by APP cleavage also bind neurexin-&beta; and can block interaction with transmembrane synaptogenic ligands of neurexin. These findings reveal a role for neurexin-APP interaction in synapse development and raise the possibility that disruptions of neurexin function may contribute to synaptic and cognitive deficits in the critical early stage of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Vulnerability of the Neonatal Connectome following Postnatal Stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stress following preterm birth can disrupt the emerging foundation of the neonatal brain. The current study examined how structural brain development is affected by a stressful early environment and whether changes in topological architecture at term-equivalent age could explain the increased vulnerability for behavioral symptoms during early childhood. Longitudinal changes in structural brain connectivity were quantified using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and tractography in preterm born infants (gestational age &lt;28 weeks), imaged at 30 and/or 40 weeks of gestation (<I>N</I> = 145, 43.5% female). A global index of postnatal stress was determined based on the number of invasive procedures during hospitalization (e.g., heel lance). Higher stress levels impaired structural connectivity growth in a subnetwork of 48 connections (<I>p</I> = 0.003), including the amygdala, insula, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Findings were replicated in an independent validation sample (<I>N</I> = 123, 39.8% female, <I>n</I> = 91 with follow-up). Classifying infants into vulnerable and resilient based on having more or less internalizing symptoms at two to five years of age (<I>n</I> = 71) revealed lower connectivity in the hippocampus and amygdala for vulnerable relative to resilient infants (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.001). Our findings suggest that higher stress exposure during hospital admission is associated with slower growth of structural connectivity. The preservation of global connectivity of the amygdala and hippocampus might reflect a stress-buffering or resilience-enhancing factor against a stressful early environment and early-childhood internalizing symptoms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The preterm brain is exposed to various external stimuli following birth. The effects of early chronic stress on neonatal brain networks and the remarkable degree of resilience are not well understood. The current study aims to provide an increased understanding of the impact of postnatal stress on third-trimester brain development and describe the topological architecture of a resilient brain. We observed a sparser neonatal brain network in infants exposed to higher postnatal stress. Limbic regulatory regions, including the hippocampus and amygdala, may play a key role as crucial convergence sites of protective factors. Understanding how stress-induced alterations in early brain development might lead to brain (re)organization may provide essential insights into resilient functioning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Object Boundary Detection in Natural Images May Depend on "Incitatory" Cell-Cell Interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional "simple cells," we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes' rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified the following three basic types of cell&ndash;cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, and nonmonotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models, we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition&mdash;a compound effect we call "incitation"&mdash;can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell&ndash;boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer "delta" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell&mdash;a divisively normalized linear filter&mdash;is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell&ndash;cell interconnections in the cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Weakly Correlated Local Cortical State Switches under Anesthesia Lead to Strongly Correlated Global States</a></h4>

              
                <p>During recovery from anesthesia, brain activity switches abruptly between a small set of discrete states. Surprisingly, this switching also occurs under constant doses of anesthesia, even in the absence of stimuli. These metastable states and the transitions between them are thought to form a "scaffold" that ultimately guides the brain back to wakefulness. The processes that constrain cortical activity patterns to these states and govern how states are coordinated between different cortical regions are unknown. If state transitions were driven by subcortical modulation, different cortical sites should exhibit near-synchronous state transitions. Conversely, spatiotemporal heterogeneity would suggest that state transitions are coordinated through corticocortical interactions. To differentiate between these hypotheses, we quantified synchrony of brain states in male rats exposed to a fixed isoflurane concentration. States were defined from spectra of local field potentials recorded across layers of visual and motor cortices. A transition synchrony measure shows that most state transitions are highly localized. Furthermore, while most pairs of cortical sites exhibit statistically significant coupling of both states and state transition times, coupling strength is typically weak. States and state transitions in the thalamic input layer (L4) are particularly decoupled from those in supragranular and infragranular layers. This suggests that state transitions are not imposed on the cortex by broadly projecting modulatory systems. Although each pairwise interaction is typically weak, we show that the multitude of such weak interactions is sufficient to confine global activity to a small number of discrete states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain consistently recovers to wakefulness after anesthesia, but this process is poorly understood. Previous work revealed that, during recovery from anesthesia, corticothalamic activity falls into one of several discrete patterns. The neuronal mechanisms constraining the cortex to just a few discrete states remain unknown. Global states could be coordinated by fluctuations in subcortical nuclei that project broadly to the cortex. Alternatively, these states may emerge from interactions within the cortex itself. Here, we provide evidence for the latter possibility by demonstrating that most pairs of cortical sites exhibit weak coupling. We thereby lay groundwork for future investigations of the specific cellular and network mechanisms of corticocortical activity state coupling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) Coexpression in GABAergic, Glutamatergic, and GABA/Glutamatergic Subpopulations in the Central Extended Amygdala and Ventral Pallidum of Young Male Primates</a></h4>

              
                <p>The central extended amygdala (CEA) and ventral pallidum (VP) are involved in diverse motivated behaviors based on rodent models. These structures are conserved, but expanded, in higher primates, including human. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a canonical "stress molecule" associated with the CEA and VP circuitry across species, is dynamically regulated by stress and drugs of abuse and misuse. CRF's effects on circuits critically depend on its colocation with primary "fast" transmitters, making this crucial for understanding circuit effects. We surveyed the distribution and colocalization of CRF-, VGluT2- (vesicular glutamate transporter 2), and VGAT- (vesicular GABA transporter) mRNA in specific subregions of the CEA and VP in young male monkeys. Although CRF-containing neurons were clustered in the lateral central bed nucleus (BSTLcn), the majority were broadly dispersed throughout other CEA subregions, and the VP. CRF/VGAT-only neurons were highest in the BSTLcn, lateral central amygdala nucleus (CeLcn), and medial central amygdala nucleus (CeM) (74%, 73%, and 85%, respectively). In contrast, lower percentages of CRF/VGAT only neurons populated the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEAc), ventrolateral bed nucleus (BSTLP), and VP (53%, 54%, 17%, respectively), which had higher complements of CRF/VGAT/VGluT2-labeled neurons (33%, 29%, 67%, respectively). Thus, the majority of CRF-neurons at the "poles" (BSTLcn and CeLcn/CeM) of the CEA are inhibitory, while the "extended" BSTLP and SLEAc subregions, and neighboring VP, have a more complex profile with admixtures of "multiplexed" excitatory CRF neurons. CRF's colocalization with its various fast transmitters is likely circuit-specific, and relevant for understanding CRF actions on specific target sites.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The central extended amygdala (CEA) and ventral pallidum (VP) regulate multiple motivated behaviors through differential downstream projections. The stress neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is enriched in the CEA, and is thought to "set the gain" through modulatory effects on coexpressed primary transmitters. Using protein and transcript assays in monkey, we found that CRF neurons are broadly and diffusely distributed in CEA and VP. CRF mRNA<sup>+</sup> neurons colocalize with VGAT (GABA) and VGluT2 (glutamate) mRNAs in different proportions depending on subregion. CRF mRNA was also coexpressed in a subpopulation of VGAT/VGluT2 mRNA ("multiplexed") cells, which were most prominent in the VP and "pallidal"-like parts of the CEA. Heterogeneous CRF and fast transmitter coexpression across CEA/VP subregions implies circuit-specific effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interdigitated Columnar Representation of Personal Space and Visual Space in Human Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Personal space (PS) is the space around the body that people prefer to maintain between themselves and unfamiliar others. Intrusion into personal space evokes discomfort and an urge to move away. Physiologic studies in nonhuman primates suggest that defensive responses to intruding stimuli involve the parietal cortex. We hypothesized that the spatial encoding of interpersonal distance is initially transformed from purely sensory to more egocentric mapping within human parietal cortex. This hypothesis was tested using 7 Tesla (7T) fMRI at high spatial resolution (1.1 mm isotropic), in seven subjects (four females, three males). In response to visual stimuli presented at a range of virtual distances, we found two categories of distance encoding in two corresponding radially-extending columns of activity within parietal cortex. One set of columns (P columns) responded selectively to moving and stationary face images presented at virtual distances that were nearer (but not farther) than each subject's behaviorally-defined personal space boundary. In most P columns, BOLD response amplitudes increased monotonically and nonlinearly with increasing virtual face proximity. In the remaining P columns, BOLD responses decreased with increasing proximity. A second set of parietal columns (D columns) responded selectively to disparity-based distance cues (near or far) in random dot stimuli, similar to disparity-selective columns described previously in occipital cortex. Critically, in parietal cortex, P columns were topographically interdigitated (nonoverlapping) with D columns. These results suggest that visual spatial information is transformed from visual to body-centered (or person-centered) dimensions in multiple local sites within human parietal cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent COVID-related social distancing practices highlight the need to better understand brain mechanisms which regulate "personal space" (PS), which is defined by the closest interpersonal distance that is comfortable for an individual. Using high spatial resolution brain imaging, we tested whether a map of external space is transformed from purely visual (3D-based) information to a more egocentric map (related to personal space) in human parietal cortex. We confirmed this transformation and further showed that it was mediated by two mutually segregated sets of columns: one which encoded interpersonal distance and another that encoded visual distance. These results suggest that the cortical transformation of sensory-centered to person-centered encoding of space near the body involves short-range communication across interdigitated columns within parietal cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Common Neural Account for Social and Nonsocial Decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>To date, social and nonsocial decisions have been studied largely in isolation. Consequently, the extent to which social and nonsocial forms of decision uncertainty are integrated using shared neurocomputational resources remains elusive. Here, we address this question using simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy human participants (young adults of both sexes) and a task in which decision evidence in social and nonsocial contexts varies along comparable scales. First, we identify time-resolved build-up of activity in the EEG, akin to a process of evidence accumulation (EA), across both contexts. We then use the endogenous trial-by-trial variability in the slopes of these accumulating signals to construct parametric fMRI predictors. We show that a region of the posterior-medial frontal cortex (pMFC) uniquely explains trial-wise variability in the process of evidence accumulation in both social and nonsocial contexts. We further demonstrate a task-dependent coupling between the pMFC and regions of the human valuation system in dorso-medial and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex across both contexts. Finally, we report domain-specific representations in regions known to encode the early decision evidence for each context. These results are suggestive of a domain-general decision-making architecture, whereupon domain-specific information is likely converted into a "common currency" in medial prefrontal cortex and accumulated for the decision in the pMFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Little work has directly compared social-versus-nonsocial decisions to investigate whether they share common neurocomputational origins. Here, using combined electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling, we offer a detailed spatiotemporal account of the neural underpinnings of social and nonsocial decisions. Specifically, we identify a comparable mechanism of temporal evidence integration driving both decisions and localize this integration process in posterior-medial frontal cortex (pMFC). We further demonstrate task-dependent coupling between the pMFC and regions of the human valuation system across both contexts. Finally, we report domain-specific representations in regions encoding the early, domain-specific, decision evidence. These results suggest a domain-general decision-making architecture, whereupon domain-specific information is converted into a common representation in the valuation system and integrated for the decision in the pMFC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Maladaptive Laterality in Cortical Networks Related to Social Communication in Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroimaging studies of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) consistently find an aberrant pattern of reduced laterality in brain networks that support functions related to social communication and language. However, it is unclear how the underlying functional organization of these brain networks is altered in ASD individuals. We tested four models of reduced laterality in a social communication network in 70 ASD individuals (14 females) and a control group of the same number of tightly matched typically developing (TD) individuals (19 females) using high-quality resting-state fMRI data and a method of measuring patterns of functional laterality across the brain. We found that a functionally defined social communication network exhibited the typical pattern of left laterality in both groups, whereas there was a significant increase in within- relative to across-hemisphere connectivity of homotopic regions in the right hemisphere in ASD individuals. Furthermore, greater within- relative to across-hemisphere connectivity in the left hemisphere was positively correlated with a measure of verbal ability in both groups, whereas greater within- relative to across-hemisphere connectivity in the right hemisphere in ASD, but not TD, individuals was negatively correlated with the same verbal measure. Crucially, these differences in patterns of laterality were not found in two other functional networks and were specifically correlated to a measure of verbal ability but not metrics of other core components of the ASD phenotype. These results suggest that previous reports of reduced laterality in social communication regions in ASD is because of the two hemispheres functioning more independently than seen in TD individuals, with the atypical right-hemisphere network component being maladaptive.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A consistent neuroimaging finding in individuals with ASD is an aberrant pattern of reduced laterality of the brain networks that support functions related to social communication and language. We tested four models of reduced laterality in a social communication network in ASD individuals and a TD control group using high-quality resting-state fMRI data. Our results suggest that reduced laterality of social communication regions in ASD may be because of the two hemispheres functioning more independently than seen in TD individuals, with atypically greater within- than across-hemisphere connectivity in the right hemisphere being maladaptive.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Dynamics of Competition between Statistical Learning and Episodic Memory in Intracranial Recordings of Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The function of long-term memory is not just to reminisce about the past, but also to make predictions that help us behave appropriately and efficiently in the future. This predictive function of memory provides a new perspective on the classic question from memory research of why we remember some things but not others. If prediction is a key outcome of memory, then the extent to which an item generates a prediction signifies that this information already exists in memory and need not be encoded. We tested this principle using human intracranial EEG as a time-resolved method to quantify prediction in visual cortex during a statistical learning task and link the strength of these predictions to subsequent episodic memory behavior. Epilepsy patients of both sexes viewed rapid streams of scenes, some of which contained regularities that allowed the category of the next scene to be predicted. We verified that statistical learning occurred using neural frequency tagging and measured category prediction with multivariate pattern analysis. Although neural prediction was robust overall, this was driven entirely by predictive items that were subsequently forgotten. Such interference provides a mechanism by which prediction can regulate memory formation to prioritize encoding of information that could help learn new predictive relationships.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When faced with a new experience, we are rarely at a loss for what to do. Rather, because many aspects of the world are stable over time, we rely on past experiences to generate expectations that guide behavior. Here we show that these expectations during a new experience come at the expense of memory for that experience. From intracranial recordings of visual cortex, we decoded what humans expected to see next in a series of photographs based on patterns of neural activity. Photographs that generated strong neural expectations were more likely to be forgotten in a later behavioral memory test. Prioritizing the storage of experiences that currently lead to weak expectations could help improve these expectations in future encounters.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Abstract Encoding of Categorical Decisions in Medial Superior Temporal and Lateral Intraparietal Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Categorization is an essential cognitive and perceptual process for decision-making and recognition. The posterior parietal cortex, particularly the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area has been suggested to transform visual feature encoding into abstract categorical representations. By contrast, areas closer to sensory input, such as the middle temporal (MT) area, encode stimulus features but not more abstract categorical information during categorization tasks. Here, we compare the contributions of the medial superior temporal (MST) and LIP areas in category computation by recording neuronal activity in both areas from two male rhesus macaques trained to perform a visual motion categorization task. MST is a core motion-processing region interconnected with MT and is often considered an intermediate processing stage between MT and LIP. We show that MST exhibits robust decision-correlated motion category encoding and working memory encoding similar to LIP, suggesting that MST plays a substantial role in cognitive computation, extending beyond its widely recognized role in visual motion processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Categorization requires assigning incoming sensory stimuli into behaviorally relevant groups. Previous work found that parietal area LIP shows a strong encoding of the learned category membership of visual motion stimuli, while visual area MT shows strong direction tuning but not category tuning during a motion direction categorization task. Here we show that the medial superior temporal (MST) area, a visual motion-processing region interconnected with both LIP and MT, shows strong visual category encoding similar to that observed in LIP. This suggests that MST plays a greater role in abstract cognitive functions, extending beyond its well known role in visual motion processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Amplified Gliosis and Interferon-Associated Inflammation in the Aging Brain following Diffuse Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with chronic psychiatric complications and increased risk for development of neurodegenerative pathology. Aged individuals account for most TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths. Nonetheless, neurobiological mechanisms that underlie worsened functional outcomes after TBI in the elderly remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to identify pathways that govern differential responses to TBI with age. Here, adult (2 months of age) and aged (16&ndash;18 months of age) male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to diffuse brain injury (midline fluid percussion), and cognition, gliosis, and neuroinflammation were determined 7 or 30 d postinjury (dpi). Cognitive impairment was evident 7 dpi, independent of age. There was enhanced morphologic restructuring of microglia and astrocytes 7 dpi in the cortex and hippocampus of aged mice compared with adults. Transcriptional analysis revealed robust age-dependent amplification of cytokine/chemokine, complement, innate immune, and interferon-associated inflammatory gene expression in the cortex 7 dpi. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the transcriptional data showed that type I interferon (IFN) signaling was significantly enhanced in the aged brain after TBI compared with adults. Age prolonged inflammatory signaling and microgliosis 30 dpi with an increased presence of rod microglia. Based on these results, a STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist, DMXAA, was used to determine whether augmenting IFN signaling worsened cortical inflammation and gliosis after TBI. DMXAA-treated Adult-TBI mice showed comparable expression of myriad genes that were overexpressed in the cortex of Aged-TBI mice, including <I>Irf7</I>, <I>Clec7a</I>, <I>Cxcl10</I>, and <I>Ccl5</I>. Overall, diffuse TBI promoted amplified IFN signaling in aged mice, resulting in extended inflammation and gliosis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Elderly individuals are at higher risk of complications following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Individuals &gt;70 years old have the highest rates of TBI-related hospitalization, neurodegenerative pathology, and death. Although inflammation has been linked with poor outcomes in aging, the specific biological pathways driving worsened outcomes after TBI in aging remain undefined. In this study, we identify amplified interferon-associated inflammation and gliosis in aged mice following TBI that was associated with persistent inflammatory gene expression and microglial morphologic diversity 30 dpi. STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonist DMXAA was used to demonstrate a causal link between augmented interferon signaling and worsened neuroinflammation after TBI. Therefore, interferon signaling may represent a therapeutic target to reduce inflammation-associated complications following TBI.</p>

                Background: Mental foramen (MF) and its accessories are the important anatomical considerations while placing implants or doing surgical procedures in and around the mandibular premolar region. This study aimed to evaluate the shape, size, and location of mental foramen in dentulous and edentulous patients among the Saudi population using 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: In this retrospective study, CBCT scans that were taken between 2015 and 2020 from Riyadh Elm University were retrieved. A total of 180 samples of CBCT (90 dentate and 90 edentulous) were analyzed. Prevalence of different horizontal positions of the mental foramen (P1 to P6) and other additive parameters like the distance from mental foramen to alveolar crest and inferior border of the mandible, along with the mental foramen angle was assessed. The difference in the mental foramen location among dentate and edentulous subjects was assessed. Gender and age variation also was assessed. All the data were statistically analyzed using SPSS. Results: The predominant horizontal position is P4 followed by P3 (59 % in males and 63 % in females at P4, and 15 % each in males and females at P3, respectively). The horizontal position of the mental foramen and gender showed a statistical significance difference, especially at the P3B, P5, and P4 positions. Moreover, a statistically significant difference was seen in the mental foramen to the mandibular inferior border of the mandible (MF_MSB) and the width of mental foramen in the transverse section (MFW). Comparison of the mental foramen among dentate and edentulous subjects showed a statistically significant difference. There was a change in the mental foramen with age. Conclusions: Based on the methodology and sample of this study, it can be concluded that the edentulism only reduced the dimension of the mental foramen opening.

                Endocrine therapy resistance in Luminal Breast Cancer is a significant issue to be tackled, but currently, no specific biomarker could be used to anticipate this event. p53 mutation is widely known as one of Breast Cancer’s most prominent genetic alterations. Its mutation could generate various effects in Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone Receptor molecular works, tangled in events leading to the aggravation of endocrine therapy resistance. Hence the possibility of p53 mutation utilization as an endocrine therapy resistance predictive biomarker is plausible. The purpose of this review is to explore the latest knowledge of p53 role in Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone Receptor molecular actions, thus aggravating the Endocrine Therapy resistance in Luminal Breast Cancer, from which we could define possibilities and limitations to utilize p53 as the predictive biomarker of endocrine therapy resistance in Luminal Breast Cancer.

                Background: HNP1, LL-37, and HBD1 are antimicrobial against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 at the standard inoculum but less active at higher inocula.   Methods: The virtual colony count (VCC) microbiological assay was adapted for high inocula and the addition of yeast tRNA and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase).  96-well plates were read for 12 hours in a Tecan Infinite M1000 plate reader and photographed under 10x magnification.    Results: Adding tRNA 1:1 wt/wt to HNP1 at the standard inoculum almost completely abrogated activity.  Adding RNase 1:1 to HNP1 at the standard inoculum of 5x105 CFU/mL did not enhance activity.  Increasing the inoculum to 6.25x107 CFU/mL almost abrogated HNP1 activity.  However, adding RNase 25:1 to HNP1 enhanced activity at the highest tested concentration of HNP1.  Adding both tRNA and RNase resulted in enhanced activity, indicating that the enhancement effect of RNase overwhelms the inhibiting effect of tRNA when both are present.  HBD1 activity at the standard inoculum was almost completely abrogated by the addition of tRNA, but LL-37 activity was only slightly inhibited by tRNA.  At the high inoculum, LL-37 activity was enhanced by RNase.  HBD1 activity was not enhanced by RNase.  RNase was not antimicrobial in the absence of antimicrobial peptides.  Cell clumps were observed at the high inoculum in the presence of all three antimicrobial peptides and at the standard inoculum in the presence of HNP1+tRNA and HBD1+tRNA.    Conclusions: Antimicrobial peptide-ribonuclease combinations have the potential to be active against high cell concentrations and biofilms, conditions where the antimicrobial agent alone is relatively ineffective.

                Background: Numerous studies have been carried out on the impacts of brand equity and service quality of higher education institutions (HEIs) on their reputation and students’ satisfaction. This research aimed to compare the impact of brand equity and service quality on universities’ reputations, namely Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) in Indonesia and International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) in Malaysia, and Indonesian students’ intention to choose the universities, which is moderated by study expense (price). UIN and IIUM are HEIs with a similar university concept, and Indonesian students have recently shown a high interest in them. The two universities have faculties not only in the field of Islamic studies but in general fields of studies as well, which are usually held by non-Islamic Universities. Therefore, their competitiveness against non-Islamic universities, especially the University of Indonesia (UI) has increased. Methods: The statistical measurement tool used was structural equation modeling (SEM). The number of items stated in the questionnaire was 45. Therefore, minimum data to be collected were 5 × 45 or 225 which rounded up to 228 from Indonesian students at UIN and IIUM (114 UIN students, and 114 Indonesian student respondents from IIUM). Results: The study results show that the universities’ reputations are strongly affected by their brand equity and service quality, which then affect students’ intention to choose the universities. Students had a higher intention to choose IIUM than UIN. The limitation of this research is that the effect of study expense on the intention of Indonesian students to study at UIN or IIUM has not yet been conducted. It will be conducted in the next study. Conclusions: These results are expected to be useful to UIN, IIUM, and especially Politeknik Negeri Jakarta (PNJ) in determining a strategy to enhance their reputations and the intention of Indonesian students to study there.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors in astrocytes exert different effects on behavior and Alzheimer´s-like pathology [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pleiotropic actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the brain are context- and cell-dependent, but whether this holds for their receptors (insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), respectively), is less clear. Methods: We compared mice lacking IR or IGF-IR in glial fibrillary astrocytic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes in a tamoxifen-regulated manner, to clarify their role in this type of glial cells, as the majority of data of their actions in brain have been obtained in neurons. Results: We observed that mice lacking IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP IR KO mice) develop mood disturbances and maintained intact cognition, while at the same time show greater pathology when cross-bred with APP/PS1 mice, a model of familial Alzheimer´s disease (AD). Conversely, mice lacking IGF-IR in GFAP astrocytes (GFAP-IGF-IR KO mice) show cognitive disturbances, maintained mood tone, and show control-dependent changes in AD-like pathology. Conclusions: These observations confirm that the role of IR and IGF-IR in the brain is cell-specific and context-dependent.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Validation of a Thai artificial chatmate designed for cheering up the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected populations of all age groups. The elderly are a high-risk group and are highly vulnerable to COVID-19. Assistive software chatbots can enhance the mental health status of the elderly by providing support and companionship. The objective of this study was to validate a Thai artificial chatmate for the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic and floods. Methods: Chatbot design includes the establishment of a dataset and emotional word vectors in which data consisting of emotional sentences were converted into the word vector form using a pre-trained word2vec model. A word vector was then input into a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained until the model converges using sentence embedding and similarity word segmentation. Sentence vectors were generated by averaging each word vector using an averaged vector method. For approximate similarity matching, the Annoy library was used to create the indices in tree sorting. Data were collected from 22 elderly and assessed by the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). Results: The study revealed that 72.73% of the respondents found the chatbot easy to learn and use, 63.64% of the respondents found the chatbot can autonomously determine the next course of action, and 59.09% of the respondents believed that troubleshooting guidelines were provided for overcoming errors. The accuracy of the chatbot providing a reasonable response is 56.20±13.99%. Conclusions: Most users were satisfied with the chatbot system. The proposed chatbot provided considerable essential insights into the development of assistance systems for the elderly during the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and during the period of national disasters. The model can be expanded to other applications in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Fatty acid composition on diet and carcasses, growth, body indices and profile serum of Asian redtail catfish (Hemibagrus nemurus) fed a diet containing different levels of EPA and DHA [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Asian redtail catfish Hemibagrus nemurus is a promising commercial aquaculture freshwater big-sized Bagridae catfish across Asian countries such as the Mekong, Malay Peninsula, and Indonesia. This study analysed the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) supplementation in diets on changes in fatty acid compositions in feed and fish meat, lipid quality (atherogenic index and thrombogenic index), growth rate, body indicators, and serum metabolites of Hemibagrus nemurus juveniles. Methods: A total of 180 Asian redtail catfish (initial weight 54.80 ± 2.72 g) were fed four levels (0, 3,150, 6,300, and 9,450 mg of EPA+DHA/kg feed) sourced from fish oil. Diets were fed in triplicate in freshwater tarpaulin ponds, with 15 fish per tarpaulin pond. During the experiment, fish were fed 3% per day of the biomass weight. Results: Categorically, there were significant differences in the composition of fatty acids in the feed and fish meat. The atherogenic index was between 1.76 and 1.84, and the thrombogenic index was between 0.81 and 0.89 in all fish meat. Growth performance was significantly different between diets, while body indices did not make a significant difference between diets. The fish meat EPA and DHA showed positive linear relationships with diet EPA (p <0.001, r2 = 90%) and DHA diet (p<0.001, r2 = 85%). Serum metabolites among treatments D2 and D3 diet-fed feed for 60 days did not significantly differ. Glucose (GLU) levels had moderate relationships with triglycerides (TAG) (r2 = 65%), and GLU levels strongly correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (r2 = 81%). Conclusions: Based on diets and whole-body carcass compositions, growth performance, and serum metabolites, Asian redtail catfish fed a diet containing 6,300 mg of EPA+DHA/kg feed are best for food safety.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the synergistic effect of bacteriophage and antibiotics on bacteria: Killers and drivers of resistance evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quentin J. Leclerc, Jodi A. Lindsay, Gwenan M. Knight</p>

Bacteriophage (phage) are bacterial predators that can also spread antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes between bacteria by generalised transduction. Phage are often present alongside antibiotics in the environment, yet evidence of their joint killing effect on bacteria is conflicted, and the dynamics of transduction in such systems are unknown. Here, we combine <i>in vitro</i> data and mathematical modelling to identify conditions where phage and antibiotics act in synergy to remove bacteria or drive AMR evolution. We adapt a published model of phage-bacteria dynamics, including transduction, to add the pharmacodynamics of erythromycin and tetracycline, parameterised from new <i>in vitro</i> data. We simulate a system where two strains of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> are present at stationary phase, each carrying either an erythromycin or tetracycline resistance gene, and where multidrug-resistant bacteria can be generated by transduction only. We determine rates of bacterial clearance and multidrug-resistant bacteria appearance, when either or both antibiotics and phage are present at varying timings and concentrations. Although phage and antibiotics act in synergy to kill bacteria, by reducing bacterial growth antibiotics reduce phage production. A low concentration of phage introduced shortly after antibiotics fails to replicate and exert a strong killing pressure on bacteria, instead generating multidrug-resistant bacteria by transduction which are then selected for by the antibiotics. Multidrug-resistant bacteria numbers were highest when antibiotics and phage were introduced simultaneously. The interaction between phage and antibiotics leads to a trade-off between a slower clearing rate of bacteria (if antibiotics are added before phage), and a higher risk of multidrug-resistance evolution (if phage are added before antibiotics), exacerbated by low concentrations of phage or antibiotics. Our results form hypotheses to guide future experimental and clinical work on the impact of phage on AMR evolution, notably for studies of phage therapy which should investigate varying timings and concentrations of phage and antibiotics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimized phylogenetic clustering of HIV-1 sequence data for public health applications</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Connor Chato, Yi Feng, Yuhua Ruan, Hui Xing, Joshua Herbeck, Marcia Kalish, Art F. Y. Poon</p>

Clusters of genetically similar infections suggest rapid transmission and may indicate priorities for public health action or reveal underlying epidemiological processes. However, clusters often require user-defined thresholds and are sensitive to non-epidemiological factors, such as non-random sampling. Consequently the ideal threshold for public health applications varies substantially across settings. Here, we show a method which selects optimal thresholds for phylogenetic (subset tree) clustering based on population. We evaluated this method on HIV-1 <i>pol</i> datasets (<i>n</i> = 14, 221 sequences) from four sites in USA (Tennessee, Washington), Canada (Northern Alberta) and China (Beijing). Clusters were defined by tips descending from an ancestral node (with a minimum bootstrap support of 95%) through a series of branches, each with a length below a given threshold. Next, we used <i>pplacer</i> to graft new cases to the fixed tree by maximum likelihood. We evaluated the effect of varying branch-length thresholds on cluster growth as a count outcome by fitting two Poisson regression models: a null model that predicts growth from cluster size, and an alternative model that includes mean collection date as an additional covariate. The alternative model was favoured by AIC across most thresholds, with optimal (greatest difference in AIC) thresholds ranging 0.007–0.013 across sites. The range of optimal thresholds was more variable when re-sampling 80% of the data by location (IQR 0.008 − 0.016, <i>n</i> = 100 replicates). Our results use prospective phylogenetic cluster growth and suggest that there is more variation in effective thresholds for public health than those typically used in clustering studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cluster detection with random neighbourhood covering: Application to invasive Group A Streptococcal disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Massimo Cavallaro, Juliana Coelho, Derren Ready, Valerie Decraene, Theresa Lamagni, Noel D. McCarthy, Dan Todkill, Matt J. Keeling</p>

The rapid detection of outbreaks is a key step in the effective control and containment of infectious diseases. In particular, the identification of cases which might be epidemiologically linked is crucial in directing outbreak-containment efforts and shaping the intervention of public health authorities. Often this requires the detection of clusters of cases whose numbers exceed those expected by a background of sporadic cases. Quantifying exceedances rapidly is particularly challenging when only few cases are typically reported in a precise location and time. To address such important public health concerns, we present a general method which can detect spatio-temporal deviations from a Poisson point process and estimate the odds of an isolate being part of a cluster. This method can be applied to diseases where detailed geographical information is available. In addition, we propose an approach to explicitly take account of delays in microbial typing. As a case study, we considered invasive group A Streptococcus infection events as recorded and typed by Public Health England from 2015 to 2020.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tracking human skill learning with a hierarchical Bayesian sequence model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noémi Éltető, Dezső Nemeth, Karolina Janacsek, Peter Dayan</p>

Humans can implicitly learn complex perceptuo-motor skills over the course of large numbers of trials. This likely depends on our becoming better able to take advantage of ever richer and temporally deeper predictive relationships in the environment. Here, we offer a novel characterization of this process, fitting a non-parametric, hierarchical Bayesian sequence model to the reaction times of human participants’ responses over ten sessions, each comprising thousands of trials, in a serial reaction time task involving higher-order dependencies. The model, adapted from the domain of language, forgetfully updates trial-by-trial, and seamlessly combines predictive information from shorter and longer windows onto past events, weighing the windows proportionally to their predictive power. As the model implies a posterior over window depths, we were able to determine how, and how many, previous sequence elements influenced individual participants’ internal predictions, and how this changed with practice.
Already in the first session, the model showed that participants had begun to rely on two previous elements (i.e., trigrams), thereby successfully adapting to the most prominent higher-order structure in the task. The extent to which local statistical fluctuations influenced participants’ responses waned over subsequent sessions, as subjects forgot the trigrams less and evidenced skilled performance. By the eighth session, a subset of participants shifted their prior further to consider a context deeper than two previous elements. Finally, participants showed resistance to interference and slow forgetting of the old sequence when it was changed in the final sessions. Model parameters for individual subjects covaried appropriately with independent measures of working memory. In sum, the model offers the first principled account of the adaptive complexity and nuanced dynamics of humans’ internal sequence representations during long-term implicit skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of SaCas9 orthologs containing a conserved serine residue that determines simple NNGG PAM recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shuai Wang, Chen Tao, Huilin Mao, Linghui Hou, Yao Wang, Tao Qi, Yuan Yang, Sang-Ging Ong, Shijun Hu, Renjie Chai, Yongming Wang</p>

Due to different nucleotide preferences at target sites, no single Cas9 is capable of editing all sequences. Thus, this highlights the need to establish a Cas9 repertoire covering all sequences for efficient genome editing. Cas9s with simple protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) requirements are particularly attractive to allow for a wide range of genome editing, but identification of such Cas9s from thousands of Cas9s in the public database is a challenge. We previously identified PAMs for 16 SaCas9 orthologs. Here, we compared the PAM-interacting (PI) domains in these orthologs and found that the serine residue corresponding to SaCas9 N986 was associated with the simple NNGG PAM requirement. Based on this discovery, we identified five additional SaCas9 orthologs that recognize the NNGG PAM. We further identified three amino acids that determined the NNGG PAM requirement of SaCas9. Finally, we engineered Sha2Cas9 and SpeCas9 to generate high-fidelity versions of Cas9s. Importantly, these natural and engineered Cas9s displayed high activities and distinct nucleotide preferences. Our study offers a new perspective to identify SaCas9 orthologs with NNGG PAM requirements, expanding the Cas9 repertoire.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Leveraging biochemical reactions to unravel functional impacts of cancer somatic variants affecting protein interaction interfaces [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Considering protein mutations in their biological context is essential for understanding their functional impact, interpretation of high-dimensional datasets and development of effective targeted therapies in personalized medicine. Methods: We combined the curated knowledge of biochemical reactions from Reactome with the analysis of interaction-mediating 3D interfaces from Mechismo. In addition, we provided a software tool for users to explore and browse the analysis results in a multi-scale perspective starting from pathways and reactions to protein-protein interactions and protein 3D structures. Results: We analyzed somatic mutations from TCGA, revealing several significantly impacted reactions and pathways in specific cancer types. We found examples of genes not yet listed as oncodrivers, whose rare mutations were predicted to affect cancer processes similarly to known oncodrivers. Some identified processes lack any known oncodrivers, which suggests potentially new cancer-related processes (e.g. complement cascade reactions). Furthermore, we found that mutations perturbing certain processes are significantly associated with distinct phenotypes (i.e. survival time) in specific cancer types (e.g. PIK3CA centered pathways in LGG and UCEC cancer types), suggesting the translational potential of our approach for patient stratification. Our analysis also uncovered several druggable processes (e.g. GPCR signalling pathways) containing enriched reactions, providing support for new off-label therapeutic options. Conclusions: In summary, we have established a multi-scale approach to study genetic variants based on protein-protein interaction 3D structures. Our approach is different from previously published studies in its focus on biochemical reactions and can be applied to other data types (e.g. post-translational modifications) collected for many types of disease.

                Background: The loss of E-cadherin expression and the induction of N-cadherin are known as hallmarks of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, an essential initial step in the process of metastasis in solid tumors. Although several studies have reported expressions of these cadherins in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), their clinical significance is unknown as MM cells are non-epithelial. Methods: In this study, we examined the expression of E- and N-cadherins by immunohistochemistry using bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens from 31 newly diagnosed MM patients and in subsequent biopsy specimens from six of these. Results: Negative E-cadherin expression on BM myeloma cell membranes was significantly associated with the presence of soft-tissue masses arising from bone lesions and breaking through the cortical bone, referred to as extramedullary disease (EMD). Conclusions: Given the aggressive nature of EMD, our study suggests that screening for E-cadherin using BM immunohistochemistry is one measure that could predict the development of EMD in patients with MM.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development of liquid culture media mimicking the conditions of sinuses and lungs in cystic fibrosis and health [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The respiratory tract is a compartmentalised and heterogenous environment. The nasopharynx and sinuses of the upper airways have distinct properties from the lungs and these differences may shape bacterial adaptation and evolution. Upper airway niches act as early colonisation sites for respiratory bacterial pathogens, including those, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that can go on to establish chronic infection of the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite the importance of upper airway environments in facilitating early adaptation to host environments, currently available in vitro models for study of respiratory infection in CF focus exclusively on the lungs. Furthermore, animal models, widely used to bridge the gap between in vitro systems and the clinical scenario, do not allow the upper and lower airways to be studied in isolation. We have developed a suite of culture media reproducing key features of the upper and lower airways, for the study of bacterial adaptation and evolution in different respiratory environments. For both upper and lower airway-mimicking media, we have developed formulations that reflect airway conditions in health and those that reflect the altered environment of the CF respiratory tract. Here, we describe the development and validation of these media and their use for study of genetic and phenotypic adaptations in P. aeruginosa during growth under upper or lower airway conditions in health and in CF.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Morphometric study of the lumbar vertebrae in dried anatomical collections [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The objective of this anatomical study was to perform the morphometry of dried lumbar vertebrae in human cadavers. Methods: This study utilized 200 adult human cadaveric dried lumbar vertebrae. The digital Vernier calipers was used to perform the measurements. The height, antero-posterior length, transverse length of the body of the vertebrae, interpedicular distance at the lateral ends, lamina length, height and thickness, superior and inferior articular facet height and width, mid sagittal and transverse diameter of vertebral foramen, height, width and thickness of the pars inter-articularis were measured. Results: The vertebral body’s anteroposterior length was more at the lower border than at the superior border (p < 0.01). The length of lamina was higher over the right in comparison to the left (p < 0.001). The height of lamina, width of inferior articular facet, diameter of lateral recess and thickness of pars inter-articularis were greater for the left sided specimens (p < 0.01). The statistical significance was not observed for the comparison of the remaining parameters (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This anatomical study offered several dimensions of lumbar vertebrae, which are essential in the surgical practice. The implants at the lumbar vertebrae need to be manufactured based on the anatomical dimensions of that particular sample population.

                Background: Spontaneous remission (SR) has been reported in different hematological malignancies. It has been observed in adult T-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It is generally associated with recovery from an infectious or immunological process, and more recently possibly with clonal hematopoiesis. Case: We reviewed the literature and reported a new case of a 40 year-old man with a morphologic and cytogenetic diagnosis of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) associated with an appendicular abscess. During his hospitalization and surgical management of his appendicitis, we noted SR of the rate of blast cells until cytological and cytogenetic remission of his ALL but unfortunately it did not last too long, moreover our patient relapsed after nine months, received intensive chemotherapy, underwent a placental blood allograft but relapsed again and died. Conclusions: In contrast to SR in other types of cancer, all documented cases of SR in ALL were only transient, so is there a need for early cytotoxic therapy in SR in ALL to delay relapse?

                Background: The objective of this study was to look for the outcome of TKR in obese individuals.    Methods: The data of all patients who had undergone primary TKR between 2005 and 2015 were collected from the QuadruMed Patient Care System and crosschecked with the operating room.  The biometric data of age, gender, weight and postoperative follow up, any complications were collected from the medical charts. Patients were classified as per the BMI (Body Mass Index). BMI is classified as per the WHO classification of 2000    Results Two hundred and four patients fulfilled the criteria for inclusion.  The demographic data is given in Table 2. The average age 59.8±9.3 years. Right side was operated in 103 and left in 101 patients. The average BMI was 35.88±7.47 (Range 21.95-54.78); mean duration of surgery was 163.37±29.9 (Range 88-250) minutes. The range of follow up was 5-14 years with the average of 7.49±2.56 years. There were 18 (8.8%) complications. One hundred and three (50.5%) of the patients belonged to Class II Obesity (BMI ≥36Kg/M2). Between class II obesity and Class III obesity (BMI ≥41Kg/M2, the later had 94.4% of the complications. The level of satisfaction was similar in all the groups at 80%.  High BMI and longer duration of surgery were important and statistically significant risk factors (p <0.0001 and <0.009) for complications during TKA. Post operative data on VAS, Modified Knee Scoring Score and WOMAC grading, showing low scores of all the assessment in the patients with higher BMI.    Conclusions: Our analysis shows that our patients with Class III obesity had over 90% of the complications and we believe that patients in this BMI range should seek ways to reduce their body weight to avoid complications and long-term morbidity.

                Background: Behaviorally conditioned immune functions are suggested to be regulated by bidirectional interactions between CNS and peripheral immune system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the current knowledge about biochemical pathways triggering conditioned immune enhancement is limited, the aim of this pilot study was gaining more insights into that. Methods: Rats were conditioned with camphor smell and poly I:C injection, mimicking a viral infection. Following stimulus re-exposure, animals were sacrificed at different time points, and neural tissues along the HPA axis was analyzed with a rat genome array together with plasma protein using Luminex analysis. Results: In the hypothalamus, we observed a strong upregulation of genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Otx2, Spp1, Fzd6, Zic1), monoaminergic transporter Slc18a2 and opioid-inhibitory G-protein Gpr88 as well as downregulation of dopaminergic receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptide Vip, and pro-melanin-concentrating hormone Pmch. In the pituitary, we recognized mostly upregulation of steroid synthesis in combination with GABAergic, cholinergic and opioid related neurotransmission, in adrenal glands, altered genes showed a pattern of activated metabolism plus upregulation of adrenoceptors Adrb3 and Adra1a. Data obtained from spleen showed a strong upregulation of immunomodulatory genes, chemo-/cytokines and glutamatergic/cholinergic neurotransmission related genes, as also confirmed by increased chemokine and ACTH levels in plasma. Conclusions: Our data indicate that in addition to the classic HPA axis, there could be additional pathways as e.g. the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), connecting brain and immune system, modulating and finetuning communication between brain and immune system.

                How do new ideas come about? The central hypothesis presented here states that insights might happen during mental navigation and correspond to rapid plasticity at the cellular level. We highlight the differences between neocortical and hippocampal mechanisms of insight. We argue that the suddenness of insight can be related to the sudden emergence of place fields in the hippocampus. According to our hypothesis, insights are supported by a state of mind-wandering that can be tied to the process of combining knowledge pieces during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thymic macrophages consist of two populations with distinct localization and origin</a></h4>

              
                Tissue-resident macrophages are essential to protect from pathogen invasion and maintain organ homeostasis. The ability of thymic macrophages to engulf apoptotic thymocytes is well appreciated, but little is known about their ontogeny, maintenance, and diversity. Here, we characterized the surface phenotype and transcriptional profile of these cells and defined their expression signature. Thymic macrophages were most closely related to spleen red pulp macrophages and Kupffer cells and shared the expression of the transcription factor SpiC with these cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the macrophages in the adult thymus are composed of two populations distinguished by the expression of <i>Timd4</i> and <i>Cx3cr1</i>. Remarkably, <i>Timd4</i><sup>+</sup> cells were located in the cortex, while <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages were restricted to the medulla and the cortico-medullary junction. Using shield chimeras, transplantation of embryonic thymuses, and genetic fate mapping, we found that the two populations have distinct origins. <i>Timd4</i><sup>+</sup> thymic macrophages are of embryonic origin, while <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> macrophages are derived from adult hematopoietic stem cells. Aging has a profound effect on the macrophages in the thymus. <i>Timd4</i><sup>+</sup> cells underwent gradual attrition, while <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup>+</sup> cells slowly accumulated with age and, in older mice, were the dominant macrophage population in the thymus. Altogether, our work defines the phenotype, origin, and diversity of thymic macrophages.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Presynaptic contact and activity opposingly regulate postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth</a></h4>

              
                The organization of neural circuits determines nervous system function. Variability can arise during neural circuit development (e.g. neurite morphology, axon/dendrite position). To ensure robust nervous system function, mechanisms must exist to accommodate variation in neurite positioning during circuit formation. Previously we developed a model system in the <i>Drosophila</i> ventral nerve cord to conditionally induce positional variability of a proprioceptive sensory axon terminal, and used this model to show that when we altered the presynaptic position of the sensory neuron, its major postsynaptic interneuron partner modified its dendritic arbor to match the presynaptic contact, resulting in functional synaptic input (Sales et al., 2019). Here we investigate the cellular mechanisms by which the interneuron dendrites detect and match variation in presynaptic partner location and input strength. We manipulate the presynaptic sensory neuron by (a) ablation; (b) silencing or activation; or (c) altering its location in the neuropil. From these experiments we conclude that there are two opposing mechanisms used to establish functional connectivity in the face of presynaptic variability: presynaptic contact stimulates dendrite outgrowth locally, whereas presynaptic activity inhibits postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth globally. These mechanisms are only active during an early larval critical period for structural plasticity. Collectively, our data provide new insights into dendrite development, identifying mechanisms that allow dendrites to flexibly respond to developmental variability in presynaptic location and input strength.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep proteome profiling reveals signatures of age and sex differences in paw skin and sciatic nerve of naïve mice</a></h4>

              
                The age and sex of studied animals profoundly impact experimental outcomes in biomedical research. However, most preclinical studies in mice use a wide-spanning age range from 4 to 20 weeks and do not assess male and female mice in parallel. This raises concerns regarding reproducibility and neglects potentially relevant age and sex differences, which are largely unknown at the molecular level in naïve mice. Here, we employed an optimized quantitative proteomics workflow in order to deeply profile mouse paw skin and sciatic nerves (SCN) – two tissues implicated in nociception and pain as well as diseases linked to inflammation, injury, and demyelination. Remarkably, we uncovered significant differences when comparing male and female mice at adolescent (4 weeks) and adult (14 weeks) age. Our analysis deciphered protein subsets and networks that were correlated with the age and/or sex of mice. Notably, among these were proteins/biological pathways with known (patho)physiological relevance, e.g., homeostasis and epidermal signaling in skin, and, in SCN, multiple myelin proteins and regulators of neuronal development. Extensive comparisons with available databases revealed that various proteins associated with distinct skin diseases and pain exhibited significant abundance changes in dependence on age and/or sex. Taken together, our study uncovers hitherto unknown sex and age differences at the level of proteins and protein networks. Overall, we provide a unique proteome resource that facilitates mechanistic insights into somatosensory and skin biology, and integrates age and sex as biological variables – a prerequisite for successful preclinical studies in mouse disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High-throughput proteomics of nanogram-scale samples with Zeno SWATH MS</a></h4>

              
                The possibility to record proteomes in high throughput and at high quality has opened new avenues for biomedical research, drug discovery, systems biology, and clinical translation. However, high-throughput proteomic experiments often require high sample amounts and can be less sensitive compared to conventional proteomic experiments. Here, we introduce and benchmark Zeno SWATH MS, a data-independent acquisition technique that employs a linear ion trap pulsing (Zeno trap pulsing) to increase the sensitivity in high-throughput proteomic experiments. We demonstrate that when combined with fast micro- or analytical flow-rate chromatography, Zeno SWATH MS increases protein identification with low sample amounts. For instance, using 20 min micro-flow-rate chromatography, Zeno SWATH MS identified more than 5000 proteins consistently, and with a coefficient of variation of 6%, from a 62.5 ng load of human cell line tryptic digest. Using 5 min analytical flow-rate chromatography (800 µl/min), Zeno SWATH MS identified 4907 proteins from a triplicate injection of 2 µg of a human cell lysate, or more than 3000 proteins from a 250 ng tryptic digest. Zeno SWATH MS hence facilitates sensitive high-throughput proteomic experiments with low sample amounts, mitigating the current bottlenecks of high-throughput proteomics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spinosaurus is not an aquatic dinosaur</a></h4>

              
                A predominantly fish-eating diet was envisioned for the sail-backed theropod dinosaur <i>Spinosaurus aegyptiacus</i> when its elongate jaws with subconical teeth were unearthed a century ago in Egypt. Recent discovery of the high-spined tail of that skeleton, however, led to a bolder conjecture that <i>S. aegyptiacus</i> was the first fully aquatic dinosaur. The ‘aquatic hypothesis’ posits that <i>S. aegyptiacus</i> was a slow quadruped on land but a capable pursuit predator in coastal waters, powered by an expanded tail. We test these functional claims with skeletal and flesh models of <i>S. aegyptiacus</i>. We assembled a CT-based skeletal reconstruction based on the fossils, to which we added internal air and muscle to create a posable flesh model. That model shows that on land <i>S. aegyptiacus</i> was bipedal and in deep water was an unstable, slow-surface swimmer (&lt;1 m/s) too buoyant to dive. Living reptiles with similar spine-supported sails over trunk and tail are used for display rather than aquatic propulsion, and nearly all extant secondary swimmers have reduced limbs and fleshy tail flukes. New fossils also show that <i>Spinosaurus</i> ranged far inland. Two stages are clarified in the evolution of <i>Spinosaurus</i>, which is best understood as a semiaquatic bipedal ambush piscivore that frequented the margins of coastal and inland waterways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An ER phospholipid hydrolase drives ER-associated mitochondrial constriction for fission and fusion</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo cycles of fission and fusion at a unified platform defined by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria membrane contact sites (MCSs). These MCSs or nodes co-localize fission and fusion machinery. We set out to identify how ER-associated mitochondrial nodes can regulate both fission and fusion machinery assembly. We have used a promiscuous biotin ligase linked to the fusion machinery, Mfn1, and proteomics to identify an ER membrane protein, ABHD16A, as a major regulator of node formation. In the absence of ABHD16A, fission and fusion machineries fail to recruit to ER-associated mitochondrial nodes and fission and fusion rates are significantly reduced. ABHD16A contains an acyltransferase motif and an α/β hydrolase domain and point mutations in critical residues of these regions fail to rescue the formation of ER-associated mitochondrial hot spots. These data suggest a mechanism whereby ABHD16A functions by altering phospholipid composition at ER-mitochondria MCSs. Our data present the first example of an ER membrane protein that regulates the recruitment of both fission and fusion machineries to mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oscillations support short latency co-firing of neurons during human episodic memory formation</a></h4>

              
                Theta and gamma oscillations in the medial temporal lobe are suggested to play a critical role for human memory formation via establishing synchrony in neural assemblies. Arguably, such synchrony facilitates efficient information transfer between neurons and enhances synaptic plasticity, both of which benefit episodic memory formation. However, to date little evidence exists from humans that would provide direct evidence for such a specific role of theta and gamma oscillations for episodic memory formation. Here we investigate how oscillations shape the temporal structure of neural firing during memory formation in the medial temporal lobe. We measured neural firing and local field potentials in human epilepsy patients via micro-wire electrode recordings to analyze whether brain oscillations are related to co-incidences of firing between neurons during successful and unsuccessful encoding of episodic memories. The results show that phase-coupling of neurons to faster theta and gamma oscillations correlates with co-firing at short latencies (~20-30 ms) and occurs during successful memory formation. Phase-coupling at slower oscillations in these same frequency bands, in contrast, correlates with longer co-firing latencies and occurs during memory failure. Thus, our findings suggest that neural oscillations play a role for the synchronization of neural firing in the medial temporal lobe during the encoding of episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Despite impaired binocular function, binocular disparity integration across the visual field is spared in normal aging and glaucoma</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To examine how binocularly asymmetric glaucomatous visual field damage affects processing of binocular disparity across the visual field. Design: Case-control study. Participants and Controls: A sample of 18 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, 16 age-matched controls, and 13 young controls. Methods: Participants underwent standard clinical assessments of binocular visual acuity, binocular contrast sensitivity, stereoacuity, and perimetry. We employed a previously validated psychophysical procedure to measure how sensitivity to binocular disparity varied across spatial frequencies and visual field sectors, i.e. with full-field stimuli spanning the central 21{degrees} of the visual field, and with stimuli restricted to annular regions spanning 0{degrees}-3{degrees}, 3{degrees}-9{degrees} or 9{degrees}-21{degrees}. Main Outcome Measures: We verified the presence of binocularly asymmetric glaucomatous visual field damage by comparing--between the two eyes--the mean deviation values obtained from the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 24-2 test. To assess the spatial-frequency tuning of disparity sensitivity across the visual field of patients and controls, we fit disparity sensitivity data to log-parabola models and compared fitted model parameters. Lastly, we employed disparity sensitivity measurements from restricted visual field conditions to model different possible scenarios regarding how disparity information is combined across visual field sectors. We adjudicated between the potential mechanisms by comparing model predictions to the observed patterns of disparity sensitivity with full-field stimuli. Results: The interocular difference in HFA 24-2 mean deviation was greater in glaucoma patients compared to both young and age-matched controls (ps=.01). Across participant groups foveal regions preferentially processed disparities at finer spatial scales, whereas periphery regions were tuned for coarser scales (p<.001). Disparity sensitivity also decreased from the fovea to the periphery (p<.001) and across participant groups (ps<.01). Finally, similar to controls, glaucoma patients exhibited near-optimal disparity integration, specifically at low spatial frequencies (p<.001). Conclusions: Contrary to the conventional view that glaucoma spares central vision, we find that glaucomatous damage causes a widespread loss of disparity sensitivity across both foveal and peripheral regions. Despite these losses, cortical integration mechanisms appear to be well preserved, suggesting that glaucoma patients make the best possible use of their remaining binocular function.

	<p>Background: The number of elderly diabetic patients has been increasing recently, and these patients have a higher morbidity of dementia than those without diabetes. Diabetes is associated with an increased risk for the development of dementia in elderly individuals, which is a serious health problem. Objectives: The primary aim was to examine whether diabetes is a risk factor for dementia among elderly individuals. The secondary aim was to apply grey theory to integrate the results and how they relate to cognitive impairments in elderly diabetic patients and to predict which participants are at high risk of developing dementia. Methods: Two hundred and twenty patients aged 50 years or older who were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus were recruited. Information on demographics, disease characteristics, activities of daily living, Mini Mental State Examination, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life was collected via questionnaires. The grey relational analysis approach was applied to evaluate the relationship between the results and health outcomes. Results: A total of 13.6% of participants had cognitive disturbances, of whom 1.4% had severe cognitive dysfunction. However, with regard to sleep disorders, 56.4% had sleep disturbances of varying degrees from light to severe. Further investigation is needed to address this problem. A higher prevalence of sleep disturbances among diabetic patients translates to a higher degree of depressive symptoms and a worse physical and mental health-related quality of life. Furthermore, based on the grey relational analysis, the grey relation coefficient varies from 0.6217~0.7540. Among the subjects, Participant 101 had the highest value, suggesting a need for immediate medical care. In this study, we observed that 20% of the total participants, for whom the grey relation coefficient was 0.6730, needed further and immediate medical care.</p>

	<p>Encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis (ECCL; Haberland syndrome, #613001) is an extremely rare congenital disorder that is manifested by the involvement of the skin, eyes and central nervous system (CNS). We report two cases of children with ECCL diagnosis. First was an 8-year-old girl who presented with symptomatic epilepsy, cerebral palsy and developmental delay. In 2020, she was admitted to the hospital due to the exacerbation of paresis and intensified prolonged epileptic seizures, provoked by infection of the middle ear. Diagnostic imaging revealed radiological changes suggestive of ECCL, providing a reason for the diagnosis, despite the lack of skin and eye anomalies. The second child, a 14-year-old girl, was consulted for subtle clinical signs and epilepsy suspicion. Diagnostic imaging findings were similar, though less pronounced. Based on neuroradiological abnormalities typical for Haberland syndrome, the authors discuss possible ECCL diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake rhythm disturbances have a negative impact on attention. However, how it affects attention and whether the restoration of regular rhythms can restore attention are unclear. This study aims to explore the effects of sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake rhythm disturbances on three subfunctions of attention (alertness, orientation, and executive control) and the restoration of regular rhythms on these functions. Twenty-one participants in the experimental group (who experienced sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake rhythm disturbances for at least one month; aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;26) were required to sleep regularly following a sleep schedule, whereas 20 participants in the control group (who maintained regular sleep for at least three months; aged 19&amp;amp;ndash;22) received no manipulation of their sleep. All participants were assessed using the attention network test three times in six days. All of them wore spectrum activity monitors and kept sleep diaries every day. The results showed that the effects of alertness and executive control in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group. After five days of regular sleep, the difference in the alertness effect between the two groups significantly decreased. These results suggested that under natural conditions, sleep&amp;amp;ndash;wake rhythm disturbances could negatively influence alertness and executive control, and a short period of restoring a regular rhythm has a recovery effect on alertness.</p>

<p>The morphology of the pretectum and associated tegmentum was investigated in crocodilians. These findings are compared with similar structures in other reptiles and birds. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In all vertebrates, the pretectum and associated tegmentum arise from prosomere 1, but the adult derivatives of these embryonic regions are not well defined in reptiles—especially in crocodiles, the reptilian group most closely related to birds. Despite its importance in vision and visuomotor behavior, descriptions of the pretectum in crocodiles are brief and photographs are lacking. To fill this gap in knowledge, the pretectum and associated tegmentum were examined in two crocodilians, <i>Caiman crocodilus</i> and <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, using a variety of histological stains in all three traditional planes of section. These observations were compared with similar studies in other reptiles and birds. These comparisons were hampered by differences in nomenclature and limited data. Nevertheless, pretectal nuclei in receipt of retinal input in crocodiles, other reptiles, and birds were the most easily identified when compared with the present analysis. Despite identifying the traditional nuclei comprising the pretectum of crocodiles, other areas remain to be characterized. Nevertheless, knowledge gained from this description will aid further investigations of this brain region in crocodiles and other reptiles as well as provide a reference for developmental studies in crocodiles.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Zebrafish retinal cone signals shift in spectral shape through larval, juvenile, and adult development as expression patterns of eight cone-opsin genes change. An algorithm extracting signal amplitudes for the component cone spectral types is developed and tested on two thyroxin receptor &beta;2 (tr&beta;2) gain-of-function lines <I>crx:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> and <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I>, allowing correlation between opsin signaling and opsin immunoreactivity in lines with different developmental timing and cell-type expression of this red-opsin-promoting transgene. Both adult transgenics became complete, or nearly complete, "red-cone dichromats," with disproportionately large long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS)1 opsin amplitudes as compared with controls, where LWS1 and LWS2 amplitudes were about equal, and significant signals from SWS1, SWS2, and Rh2 opsins were detected. But in transgenic larvae and juveniles of both lines it was LWS2 amplitudes that increased, with LWS1 cone signals rarely encountered. In <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> embryos at 5 d postfertilization (dpf), red-opsin immunoreactive cone density doubled, but red-opsin amplitudes (LWS2) increased &lt;10%, and green-opsin, blue-opsin, and UV-opsin signals were unchanged, despite co-expressed red opsins, and the finding that an <I>sws1</I> UV-opsin reporter gene was shut down by the <I>gnat2:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> transgene. By contrast both LWS2 red-cone amplitudes and the density of red-cone immunoreactivity more than doubled in 5-dpf <I>crx:mYFP-2A-tr&beta;2</I> embryos, while UV-cone amplitudes were reduced 90%. Embryonic cones with tr&beta;2 gain-of-function transgenes were morphologically distinct from control red, blue or UV cones, with wider inner segments and shorter axons than red cones, suggesting cone spectral specification, opsin immunoreactivity and shape are influenced by the abundance and developmental timing of tr&beta;2 expression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Noninvasive Method for Monitoring Breathing Patterns in Nonhuman Primates Using a Nasal Thermosensor</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Respiration is strongly linked to internal states such as arousal, emotion, and even cognitive processes and provides objective biological information to estimate these states in humans and animals. However, the measurement of respiration has not been established in macaque monkeys, which have been widely used as model animals for understanding various higher brain functions. In the present study, we developed a method to monitor the respiration of behaving monkeys. We first measured the temperature of their nasal breathing, which changes between inspiration and expiration phases, in an anesthetized condition and estimated the respiration pattern. We compared the estimated pattern with that obtained by a conventional chest band method that has been used in humans and applied to anesthetized, but not behaving, monkeys. These respiration patterns matched well, suggesting that the measurement of nasal air temperature can be used to monitor the respiration of monkeys. Furthermore, we confirmed that the respiration frequency in behaving monkeys monitored by the measurement of nasal air temperature was not affected by the orofacial movement of licking to obtain the liquid reward. We next examined the frequency of respiration when they listened to music or white noise. The respiratory frequency was higher when the monkeys listened to music than the noise. This result is consistent with a phenomenon in humans and indicates the accuracy of our monitoring method. These data suggest that the measurement of nasal air temperature enables us to monitor the respiration of behaving monkeys and thereby estimate their internal states.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>An accurate assessment of the time course, components, and magnitude of postsynaptic currents is important for a quantitative understanding of synaptic integration and signaling in dendritic spines. These parameters have been studied in some detail in previous experiments, primarily using two-photon imaging of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes and two-photon uncaging of glutamate. However, even with these revolutionary techniques, there are some missing pieces in our current understanding, particularly related to the time courses of synaptically evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> and [Na<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes. In new experiments, we used low-affinity, linear Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, laser fluorescence stimulation, and a sensitive camera-based detection system, combined with electrical stimulation and two-photon glutamate uncaging, to extend measurements of these spine parameters. We found that (1) almost all synaptically activated Na<sup>+</sup> currents in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron spines in slices from mice of either sex are through AMPA receptors with little Na<sup>+</sup> entry through voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) or NMDA receptor channels; (2) a spectrum of sodium transient decay times was observed, suggesting a spectrum of spine neck resistances, even on the same dendrite; (3) synaptically activated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes are very fast and are almost entirely because of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through NMDA receptors at the time when the Mg<sup>2+</sup> block is relieved by the fast AMPA-mediated EPSP; (4) the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>i</SUB> changes evoked by uncaging glutamate are slower than the changes evoked by synaptic release, suggesting that the relative contribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through NMDA receptors at rest following uncaging is higher than following electrical stimulation.</p>

                Background: Psychosocial research in humanitarian settings has been historically dominated by a focus on distress and disorder. As such, there is a need to establish the validity of instruments for a broad range of psychosocial outcomes, particularly among highly affected and under-represented populations. The current study describes the adaptation and testing of multiple psychosocial instruments among displaced Rohingya mothers in Bangladesh.  Methods: We used baseline data from 600 mothers of malnourished children aged 2 and under enrolled in an intervention study in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Instruments assessed distress (International Depression Symptom Scale [IDSS] and Kessler-6 [K-6]); functional impairment (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS]); subjective wellbeing (global Satisfaction With Life [SWL] and Personal Wellbeing Index [PWI];  and, coping (Brief COPE and locally developed coping items). Instruments were piloted and refined, then used for data collection by Bangladeshi-Rohingya interviewer pairs. We conducted exploratory factor analysis, evaluated internal consistency, examined construct validity through correlation with other scales, and used regression models to explore demographic factors associated with psychosocial health.  Results: Both the WHODAS and coping items fit 2-factor models; other scales were unidimensional. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .76 to .90 for the refined scales. With the exception of coping, scale correlations supported construct validity; separate measures of the same construct were highly correlated, distress and impairment were moderately correlated, and both were inversely correlated with wellbeing. Correlates of poorer psychosocial health included relative socioeconomic disadvantage, current pregnancy, and being unmarried.   Conclusions: Most of the standard psychosocial assessment tools performed adequately, but they did not appear to fully capture local experiences and included items of little local relevance. Findings highlight the need for further mixed methods research to develop a rich battery of instruments with cross-cultural validity, particularly for positive outcomes such as coping which was particularly challenging to assess.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular survey of certain protozoan agents that cause diarrhea in children in Sudan [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Diarrhea is a significant health problem in third world countries; identification of causative agents of diarrhea is essential to apply measures to prevent and control this disease. In addition, scant data are available regarding childhood diarrhea in Sudan. Our research aimed to determine the incidence of specific protozoan pathogens (Entameobia histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and Gardia lambelia) among the young (aged less than five years) in Khartoum, Sudan. Methods We conducted a parasitological cross-sectional survey, and stool samples from 437 patients were examined for E. histolytica, C.  parvum, and G. lambelia using a multiplex real-time PCR method. Results Of the 437 stool samples tested, infection with intestinal parasite was found in 155 (35.5%) cases, and co-infection was identified in 16 (3.7%) cases. G. lambelia (18.8%) and C. parvum (15.8 %) were the most frequently identified parasites, followed by E. histolytica (0.5%). The highest and lowest rates of parasitic infections were seen in the less than two years age group (32.7%), and in the 2–4-year-old group (2.7%), the male children showed higher rates of infections (23.7%) compared to females (11.7%). The incidence of protozoan infection was higher (37.7%) in the rainy season (August to December) (32.7%) in contrast with that (2.7%) in the dry season (April to June). Discussion Our present study demonstrated the high prevalence of G. lambelia and C. parvum in children with diarrhea in Khartoum State and the multiplex real-time technique's usefulness in disclosing pathogenic protozoal agents. Our result highlighted the necessity of developing intervention measurement and control strategies to deal with childhood parasitic diarrhea in this region.

                A sound analysis of DNA sequencing data is important to extract meaningful information and infer quantities of interest. Sequencing and mapping errors coupled with low and variable coverage hamper the identification of genotypes and variants and the estimation of population genetic parameters. Methods and implementations to estimate population genetic parameters from sequencing data available nowadays either are suitable for the analysis of genomes from model organisms only, require moderate sequencing coverage, or are not easily adaptable to specific applications. To address these issues, we introduce ngsJulia, a collection of templates and functions in Julia language to process short-read sequencing data for population genetic analysis. We further describe two implementations, ngsPool and ngsPloidy, for the analysis of pooled sequencing data and polyploid genomes, respectively. Through simulations, we illustrate the performance of estimating various population genetic parameters using these implementations, using both established and novel statistical methods. These results inform on optimal experimental design and demonstrate the applicabil- ity of methods in ngsJulia to estimate parameters of interest even from low coverage sequencing data. ngsJulia provide users with a flexible and efficient framework for ad hoc analysis of sequencing data.ngsJulia is available from: https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Developing dispute resolution policy for conflicts settlement in public-private partnership (PPP) projects in educational institutions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) advocates a 15-20% allocation of the developing nations’ annual budget to educational development, but the available resources are not adequate to support the sector in the global south. Thus, University Hostel Development and Management (UHDM) policy was selected to attract private investors for the provision of educational facilities in Nigerian public universities. The policy considered a public-private partnership (PPP) model to ameliorate the menace of dilapidated infrastructures. Initially, there was massive investors’ participation until contractual disputes started to undermine the success recorded. Therefore, incessant disputes without resourceful resolutions motivate the need to examine this policy and spot the gaps for necessary improvement. Policy: The National Universities Commission (NUC) augments the provision of infrastructure in Nigerian public universities through the UHDM initiative in 2004. Conflicts owing to the multiplicity of stakeholders’ contrasting interests overwhelmed the initiative. Many value-added projects were terminated. The poor condition of facilities lingers to serve as a basic factor for half-baked graduates, low employee productivity and declined socio-economic values of the nation. This brief focuses on the role of formal dispute resolution mechanisms (DRMs) for conflict management in PPP arrangements. By observation, stakeholders rarely envisage potential conflicts, thus, no contemplation of specific DRMs adoption despite the inevitability of contractual disputes. Recommendations: This brief recommends the inclusion of the dispute resolution policy in the PPP Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Recommendations are hereby generated from the analysis of the stakeholders’ opinions on the causes of the dispute, conflict prevention strategies, and the relevant dispute resolution mechanisms peculiar to the PPP contracts in educational institutions. Also, ambiguities in the policy that bordered on an inexplicit institutional framework, lack of PPP experts’ involvement, imperfect contract agreement, and deficiency of feasibility study, are resolved by the recommendations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sampling effects and measurement overlap can bias the inference of neuronal avalanches</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joao Pinheiro Neto, F. Paul Spitzner, Viola Priesemann</p>

To date, it is still impossible to sample the entire mammalian brain with single-neuron precision. This forces one to either use spikes (focusing on few neurons) or to use coarse-sampled activity (averaging over many neurons, e.g. LFP). Naturally, the sampling technique impacts inference about collective properties. Here, we emulate both sampling techniques on a simple spiking model to quantify how they alter observed correlations and signatures of criticality. We describe a general effect: when the inter-electrode distance is small, electrodes sample overlapping regions in space, which increases the correlation between the signals. For coarse-sampled activity, this can produce power-law distributions even for non-critical systems. In contrast, spike recordings do not suffer this particular bias and underlying dynamics can be identified. This may resolve why coarse measures and spikes have produced contradicting results in the past.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Small predators dominate fish predation in coral reef communities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michalis Mihalitsis, Renato A. Morais, David R. Bellwood</p>

Ecosystem processes are challenging to quantify at a community level, particularly within complex ecosystems (e.g., rainforests, coral reefs). Predation is one of the most important types of species interactions, determining several ecosystem processes. However, while it is widely recognised, it is rarely quantified, especially in aquatic systems. To address these issues, we model predation on fish by fish, in a hyperdiverse coral reef community. We show that body sizes previously examined in fish–fish predation studies (based on a metanalysis), only represent about 5% of likely predation events. The average fish predator on coral reefs is just 3.65 cm; the average fish prey just 1.5 cm. These results call for a shift in the way we view fish predation and its ability to shape the species or functional composition of coral reef fish communities. Considered from a functional group approach, we found general agreement in the distribution of simulated and observed predation events, among both predator and prey functional groups. Predation on coral reefs is a process driven by small fish, most of which are neither seen nor quantified.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Bats expand their vocal range by recruiting different laryngeal structures for echolocation and social communication</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonas Håkansson, Cathrine Mikkelsen, Lasse Jakobsen, Coen P. H. Elemans</p>

Echolocating bats produce very diverse vocal signals for echolocation and social communication that span an impressive frequency range of 1 to 120 kHz or 7 octaves. This tremendous vocal range is unparalleled in mammalian sound production and thought to be produced by specialized laryngeal vocal membranes on top of vocal folds. However, their function in vocal production remains untested. By filming vocal membranes in excised bat larynges (<i>Myotis daubentonii</i>) in vitro with ultra-high-speed video (up to 250,000 fps) and using deep learning networks to extract their motion, we provide the first direct observations that vocal membranes exhibit flow-induced self-sustained vibrations to produce 10 to 95 kHz echolocation and social communication calls in bats. The vocal membranes achieve the highest fundamental frequencies (<i>f</i><sub>o</sub><i>’s</i>) of any mammal, but their vocal range is with 3 to 4 octaves comparable to most mammals. We evaluate the currently outstanding hypotheses for vocal membrane function and propose that most laryngeal adaptations in echolocating bats result from selection for producing high-frequency, rapid echolocation calls to catch fast-moving prey. Furthermore, we show that bats extend their lower vocal range by recruiting their ventricular folds—as in death metal growls—that vibrate at distinctly lower frequencies of 1 to 5 kHz for producing agonistic social calls. The different selection pressures for echolocation and social communication facilitated the evolution of separate laryngeal structures that together vastly expanded the vocal range in bats.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Comparative analysis reveals the long-term coevolutionary history of parvoviruses and vertebrates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew A. Campbell, Shannon Loncar, Robert M. Kotin, Robert J. Gifford</p>

Parvoviruses (family <i>Parvoviridae</i>) are small DNA viruses that cause numerous diseases of medical, veterinary, and agricultural significance and have important applications in gene and anticancer therapy. DNA sequences derived from ancient parvoviruses are common in animal genomes and analysis of these <i>endogenous parvoviral elements</i> (EPVs) has demonstrated that the family, which includes twelve vertebrate-specific genera, arose in the distant evolutionary past. So far, however, such “paleovirological” analysis has only provided glimpses into the biology of ancient parvoviruses and their long-term evolutionary interactions with hosts. Here, we comprehensively map EPV diversity in 752 published vertebrate genomes, revealing defining aspects of ecology and evolution within individual parvovirus genera. We identify 364 distinct EPV sequences and show these represent approximately 200 unique germline incorporation events, involving at least five distinct parvovirus genera, which took place at points throughout the Cenozoic Era. We use the spatiotemporal and host range calibrations provided by these sequences to infer defining aspects of long-term evolution within individual parvovirus genera, including mammalian vicariance for genus <i>Protoparvovirus</i>, and interclass transmission for genus <i>Dependoparvovirus</i>. Moreover, our findings support a model of virus evolution in which the long-term cocirculation of multiple parvovirus genera in vertebrates reflects the adaptation of each viral genus to fill a distinct ecological niche. Our findings show that efforts to develop parvoviruses as therapeutic tools can be approached from a rational foundation based on comparative evolutionary analysis. To support this, we published our data in the form of an open, extensible, and cross-platform database designed to facilitate the wider utilisation of evolution-related domain knowledge in parvovirus research.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Increasing plant group productivity through latent genetic variation for cooperation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel E. Wuest, Nuno D. Pires, Shan Luo, Francois Vasseur, Julie Messier, Ueli Grossniklaus, Pascal A. Niklaus</p>

Historic yield advances in the major crops have, to a large extent, been achieved by selection for improved productivity of groups of plant individuals such as high-density stands. Research suggests that such improved group productivity depends on “cooperative” traits (e.g., erect leaves, short stems) that—while beneficial to the group—decrease individual fitness under competition. This poses a problem for some traditional breeding approaches, especially when selection occurs at the level of individuals, because “selfish” traits will be selected for and reduce yield in high-density monocultures. One approach, therefore, has been to select individuals based on ideotypes with traits expected to promote group productivity. However, this approach is limited to architectural and physiological traits whose effects on growth and competition are relatively easy to anticipate. Here, we developed a general and simple method for the discovery of alleles promoting cooperation in plant stands. Our method is based on the game-theoretical premise that alleles increasing cooperation benefit the monoculture group but are disadvantageous to the individual when facing noncooperative neighbors. Testing the approach using the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we found a major effect locus where the rarer allele was associated with increased cooperation and productivity in high-density stands. The allele likely affects a pleiotropic gene, since we find that it is also associated with reduced root competition but higher resistance against disease. Thus, even though cooperation is considered evolutionarily unstable except under special circumstances, conflicting selective forces acting on a pleiotropic gene might maintain latent genetic variation for cooperation in nature. Such variation, once identified in a crop, could rapidly be leveraged in modern breeding programs and provide efficient routes to increase yields.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A hospital-based prospective cohort study to assess the factors associated with transmission dynamics of SARS CoV-2 among healthcare workers in Delhi [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare personnel providing COVID-19 care are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Understanding the factors associated with the transmission of infection among healthcare workers provides input for the development of prevention strategies. The objectives of this study were to study the adherence to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures followed between different categories of healthcare workers, to estimate seroconversion rate based on the type of exposure with COVID-19 patients, and to study the association between seroconversion and IPC practices. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from December 2020 to June 2021 among the healthcare workers in two tertiary healthcare institutes selected by purposive sampling. All Healthcare workers (HCWs) participating in the clinical management or having any exposure to a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case were included. A total of 817 subjects were enrolled in the study. At baseline, details on IPC training and adherence along with details of the type of exposure with the COVID-19 patient were collected. The end-line visit was scheduled at 22-31 (preferably 28 days) days from the first visit for the collection of the symptom diary and end-line form.  Results: Hand hygiene practices were found to be best among paramedics (98.0%), followed by doctors (84.5%) and nurses (90.1%). Maximum HCWs (99.5%; 99.8%; 97.1%) reported using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) appropriately and regular availability of PPE in the hospital setting. Among the various categories of HCWs, nurses had the highest proportion (28.7%) of untrained personnel. Conclusion: The HCWs who had contact with the surroundings of an infected patient showed higher odds of seroconversion although not statistically significant. Further, analyzing the types of PPE used, we found that the use of masks and gloves was protective in preventing infection. Strengthening IPC training through refresher training and demonstrating the correct use of PPE can enhance adherence to IPC measures.

                Background: E-government is an initiative taken by governments worldwide to align the administration of their countries. Governments have utilized the internet as part of a transition into a globalized economy. This helps reduce red tape and procedures in dealing with people in government agencies. This study aims to develop an e-government model as an anti-corruption strategy by applying the Penta-helix model and religiosity as the moderating variable. Methods: The data was gathered from government officials, representatives in business, media, academia, and NGOs, in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2021. Online questionnaires were distributed to 240 respondents from Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition, SPSS v.25 and SEM AMOS v.25 were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings indicate that the Penta-helix elements and religiosity could help to reduce corruption in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Malaysia must increase its human resource competency and embed the religiosity element as a tool to reduce corruption. Conclusion: Penta-helix and religious factors should be incorporated by organizations in Malaysia and Indonesia as part of their strategy in combating corruption.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>While dietary intake is linked to stroke risk, surrogate markers that could inform personalized dietary interventions are lacking. We identified metabolites associated with diet patterns and incident stroke in a nested cohort from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Levels of 162 metabolites were measured in baseline plasma from stroke cases (n = 1,198) and random controls (n = 904). We examined associations between metabolites and a plant-based diet pattern previously linked to reduced stroke risk in REGARDS. Secondary analyses included 3 additional stroke-associated diet patterns: a Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Southern diet. Metabolites were tested using Cox proportional hazards models with incident stroke as the outcome. Replication was performed in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Inverse odds ratio-weighted mediation was used to determine whether metabolites mediated the association between a plant-based diet and stroke risk.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Metabolites associated with a plant-based diet included the gut metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (β = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.14, 0.33], <i>p</i> = 1.14 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), guanosine (β = −0.13, 95% CI [−0.19, −0.07], <i>p</i> = 6.48 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), gluconic acid (β = −0.11, 95% CI [−0.18, −0.04], <i>p</i> = 2.06 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), and C7 carnitine (β = −0.16, 95% CI [−0.24, −0.09], <i>p</i> = 4.14 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). All of these metabolites were associated with both additional diet patterns and altered stroke risk. Mediation analyses identified guanosine (32.6% mediation, <i>p</i> = 1.51 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), gluconic acid (35.7%, <i>p</i> = 2.28 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), and C7 carnitine (26.2%, <i>p</i> = 1.88 × 10<sup>−2</sup>) as mediators linking a plant-based diet to reduced stroke risk.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A subset of diet-related metabolites are associated with risk of stroke. These metabolites could serve as surrogate markers that inform dietary interventions. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Unprecedented early-summer heat stress and forecast of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, 2021-2022 [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is predicted to undergo its sixth mass coral bleaching event during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2021-2022. Coral bleaching-level heat stress over the GBR is forecast to start earlier than any previous year in the satellite record (1985-present). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch (CRW) near real-time satellite-based heat stress products were used to investigate early-summer sea surface temperature (SST) and heat stress conditions on the GBR during late 2021. As of 14 December 2021, values of instantaneous heat stress (Coral Bleaching HotSpots) and accumulated heat stress over a 12-week running window (Degree Heating Weeks) on the GBR were unprecedented in the satellite record. Further, 89% of GBR satellite reef pixels for this date in 2021 had a positive seven-day SST trend of greater than 0.2 degrees Celsius/week. Background temperatures (the minimum temperature over the previous 29 days) were alarmingly high, with 87% of GBR reef pixels on 14 December 2021 being greater than the maximum SST over that same 29-day period for any year from 1985-2020. The GBR is starting the 2021-2022 summer season with more accumulated heat than ever before, which could have disastrous consequences for the health, recovery, and future of this critical reef system.

                Background As serious fracture complications, delayed union and non-union are parts of complications from fracture healing. Growth factors such as BMP-2, VEGF, proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and bone formation BALP, N-Mid-OC are important regulators of the fracture healing process. Red yeast rice (RYR), produced by fermenting Monascus purpureus rice, monacolin K, which is the main ingredient in RYR, was found to play a major role in the anti-inflammatory process and increasing the proliferation of osteoblast in osteoporosis cases. This study aims to examine the effect of RYR in the fracture healing process in delayed union rats through molecular studies of levels of IL-6, BMP- 2, VEGF, BALP, and N-Mid-OC. Methods This study was experimental research that used male rats (Rattus novergicus) which were divided into a control and 3 treatment groups using a random sampling method. Group 1 was given orally 25 mg/kg, Group 2 was 50 mg/kg, Group 3 was 100 mg/kg, and the control group was given a placebo. The rats were then subjected to a delayed union fracture model. Observations were made for two periods on the 14th and 28th days. Results There were no significant differences in serology examination between days 0 and 14 between groups. However, there were significant differences between groups on day 28. IL-6, BMP-2, VEGF, BALP, and N-Mid-OC on day 28 between groups (p<0.001). The group with 100 mg/kg RYR extract was found to be the most influencing serology marker level. RYR 100 mg/kg significantly decreased IL-6, and increased BMP-2, VEGF, BALP, and N-Mid-Osteocalcin, thus enhancing the fracture healing process in the delayed union rats model. Conclusion A red yeast rice dose of 100 mg/KgBW significantly reduced IL-6, increased BMP-2, VEGF, BALP, N-Mid-OC, and RUST Score so as to improve the fracture healing process in delayed union rats.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prospective studies of encephalitis are rare in regions where encephalitis is prevalent, such as low middle income Southeast Asian countries. We compared the diagnostic yield of local and advanced tests in cases of pediatric encephalitis in Myanmar.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Children with suspected subacute or acute encephalitis at Yangon Children's Hospital were prospectively recruited from 2016-2018. Cohort 1 (n = 65) had locally available diagnostic testing, while cohort 2 (n = 38) had advanced tests for autoantibodies (i.e., cell-based assays, tissue immunostaining, studies with cultured neurons) and infections (i.e., BioFire FilmArray multiplex Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) multiplex PCR panel, metagenomic sequencing, and pan-viral serologic testing (VirScan) of cerebrospinal fluid).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty cases (13 in cohort 1 and 7 in cohort 2) were found to have illnesses other than encephalitis. Of the 52 remaining cases in cohort 1, 43 (83%) had presumed infectious encephalitis (PIE) of which 2 cases (4%) had a confirmed infectious etiology (CIE). Nine cases (17%) had presumed autoimmune encephalitis (PAE). Of the 31 cases in cohort 2, 23 (74%) had PIE of which one (3%) had CIE using local tests only, while 8 (26%) had PAE. Advanced tests confirmed an additional 10 (32%) infections, 4 (13%) possible infections and 5 (16%) cases of NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pediatric encephalitis is prevalent in Myanmar, and advanced technologies increase identification of treatable infectious and autoimmune causes. Developing affordable advanced tests to use globally represents a high clinical and research priority to improve diagnosis and prognosis of encephalitis.</p>

                The mechanisms governing distant metastasis formation in colorectal cancer are incompletely understood. Laoukili et al. show that the BRAFV600E oncogene increases the capacity of disseminated tumor cells to withstand metastasis-associated oxidative stress by stimulating glutathione synthesis. This pathway promotes the formation of liver and lung metastases but not peritoneal metastases.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Vitamin B5 rewires Th17 cell metabolism via impeding PKM2 nuclear translocation</a></h4>

              
                In this study, Chen et al. report that diet-derived vitamin B5 restrains Th17 cell differentiation and Th17-associated autoimmune diseases by impeding PKM2 nuclear translocation, thus inhibiting glycolysis and STAT3 phosphorylation. This finding shows a role of VB5 in Th17 cell metabolic rewiring and Th17-associated disease intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Tim-4 reprograms cholesterol metabolism to suppress antiviral innate immunity by disturbing the Insig1-SCAP interaction in macrophages</a></h4>

              
                Cholesterol metabolism is closely related to antiviral response. Tim-4 is a key molecule that regulates macrophage homeostasis. Wang et al. demonstrate that Tim-4 disturbs the Insig1-SCAP interaction and facilitates SREBP2 translocation, eventually leading to the upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in macrophages, which limits the antiviral type I IFN response.

                Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells mediate various immune responses including cancer immunity. Watanabe et al. show that CD28 expression on antigen-presenting T cells (APTCs) is required for iNKT cell development. APTCs acquire B7 from other B7-expressing cells via CD28-dependent trogocytosis and provide critical B7 co-stimulation for iNKT cell development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Large-scale analysis and computer modeling reveal hidden regularities behind variability of cell division patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana embryogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Noise plays a major role in cellular processes and in the development of tissues and organs. Several studies have examined the origin, the integration or the accommodation of noise in gene expression, cell growth and elaboration of organ shape. By contrast, much less is known about variability in cell division plane positioning, its origin and links with cell geometry, and its impact on tissue organization. Taking advantage of the first-stereotyped-then-variable division patterns in the embryo of the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we combined 3D imaging and quantitative cell shape and cell lineage analysis together with mathematical and computer modeling to perform a large-scale, systematic analysis of variability in division plane orientation. Our results reveal that, paradoxically, variability in cell division patterns of <i>Arabidopsis</i> embryos is accompanied by a progressive reduction of heterogeneity in cell shape topology. The paradox is solved by showing that variability operates within a reduced repertoire of possible division plane orientations that is related to cell geometry. We show that in several domains of the embryo, a recently proposed geometrical division rule recapitulates observed variable patterns, suggesting that variable patterns emerge from deterministic principles operating in a variable geometrical context. Our work highlights the importance of emerging patterns in the plant embryo under iterated division principles, but also reveal domains where deviations between rule predictions and experimental observations point to additional regulatory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Latent functional diversity may accelerate microbial community responses to temperature fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                How complex microbial communities respond to climatic fluctuations remains an open question. Due to their relatively short generation times and high functional diversity, microbial populations harbor great potential to respond as a community through a combination of strain-level phenotypic plasticity, adaptation, and species sorting. However, the relative importance of these mechanisms remains unclear. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the degree to which bacterial communities can respond to changes in environmental temperature through a combination of phenotypic plasticity and species sorting alone. We grew replicate soil communities from a single location at six temperatures between 4°C and 50°C. We found that phylogenetically and functionally distinct communities emerge at each of these temperatures, with <i>K</i>-strategist taxa favored under cooler conditions and <i>r</i>-strategist taxa under warmer conditions. We show that this dynamic emergence of distinct communities across a wide range of temperatures (in essence, community-level adaptation) is driven by the resuscitation of latent functional diversity: the parent community harbors multiple strains pre-adapted to different temperatures that are able to ‘switch on’ at their preferred temperature without immigration or adaptation. Our findings suggest that microbial community function in nature is likely to respond rapidly to climatic temperature fluctuations through shifts in species composition by resuscitation of latent functional diversity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tree species and genetic diversity increase productivity via functional diversity and trophic feedbacks</a></h4>

              
                Addressing global biodiversity loss requires an expanded focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity. While most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity, our mechanistic understanding of how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity remains limited. Here, we use a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity, and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. We found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested. Given the complexity of interactions between species and genetic diversity, tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on productivity, we suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A motor neuron disease-associated mutation produces non-glycosylated Seipin that induces ER stress and apoptosis by inactivating SERCA2b</a></h4>

              
                A causal relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the development of neurodegenerative diseases remains controversial. Here, we focused on Seipinopathy, a dominant motor neuron disease, based on the finding that its causal gene product, Seipin, is a protein that spans the ER membrane twice. Gain-of-function mutations of Seipin produce non-glycosylated Seipin (ngSeipin), which was previously shown to induce ER stress and apoptosis at both cell and mouse levels albeit with no clarified mechanism. We found that aggregation-prone ngSeipin dominantly inactivated SERCA2b, the major calcium pump in the ER, and decreased the calcium concentration in the ER, leading to ER stress and apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma-derived cells (HCT116). This inactivation required oligomerization of ngSeipin and direct interaction of the C-terminus of ngSeipin with SERCA2b, and was observed in Seipin-deficient neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells expressing ngSeipin at an endogenous protein level. Our results thus provide a new direction to the controversy noted above.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mother cells control daughter cell proliferation in intestinal organoids to minimize proliferation fluctuations</a></h4>

              
                During renewal of the intestine, cells are continuously generated by proliferation. Proliferation and differentiation must be tightly balanced, as any bias toward proliferation results in uncontrolled exponential growth. Yet, the inherently stochastic nature of cells raises the question how such fluctuations are limited. We used time-lapse microscopy to track all cells in crypts of growing mouse intestinal organoids for multiple generations, allowing full reconstruction of the underlying lineage dynamics in space and time. Proliferative behavior was highly symmetric between sister cells, with both sisters either jointly ceasing or continuing proliferation. Simulations revealed that such symmetric proliferative behavior minimizes cell number fluctuations, explaining our observation that proliferating cell number remained constant even as crypts increased in size considerably. Proliferative symmetry did not reflect positional symmetry but rather lineage control through the mother cell. Our results indicate a concrete mechanism to balance proliferation and differentiation with minimal fluctuations that may be broadly relevant for other tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular reprogramming with ATOH1, GFI1, and POU4F3 implicate epigenetic changes and cell-cell signaling as obstacles to hair cell regeneration in mature mammals</a></h4>

              
                Reprogramming of the cochlea with hair-cell-specific transcription factors such as ATOH1 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for hearing loss. ATOH1 expression in the developing cochlea can efficiently induce hair cell regeneration but the efficiency of hair cell reprogramming declines rapidly as the cochlea matures. We developed Cre-inducible mice to compare hair cell reprogramming with ATOH1 alone or in combination with two other hair cell transcription factors, GFI1 and POU4F3. In newborn mice, all transcription factor combinations tested produced large numbers of cells with the morphology of hair cells and rudimentary mechanotransduction properties. However, 1 week later, only a combination of ATOH1, GFI1 and POU4F3 could reprogram non-sensory cells of the cochlea to a hair cell fate, and these new cells were less mature than cells generated by reprogramming 1 week earlier. We used scRNA-seq and combined scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq to suggest at least two impediments to hair cell reprogramming in older animals. First, hair cell gene loci become less epigenetically accessible in non-sensory cells of the cochlea with increasing age. Second, signaling from hair cells to supporting cells, including Notch signaling, can prevent reprogramming of many supporting cells to hair cells, even with three hair cell transcription factors. Our results shed light on the molecular barriers that must be overcome to promote hair cell regeneration in the adult cochlea.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conservation of oocyte development in germline cysts from Drosophila to mouse</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies show that pre-follicular mouse oogenesis takes place in germline cysts, highly conserved groups of oogonial cells connected by intercellular bridges that develop as nurse cells as well as an oocyte. Long studied in <i>Drosophila</i> and insect gametogenesis, female germline cysts acquire cytoskeletal polarity and traffic centrosomes and organelles between nurse cells and the oocyte to form the Balbiani body, a conserved marker of polarity. Mouse oocyte development and nurse cell dumping are supported by dynamic, cell-specific programs of germline gene expression. High levels of perinatal germ cell death in this species primarily result from programmed nurse cell turnover after transfer rather than defective oocyte production. The striking evolutionary conservation of early oogenesis mechanisms between distant animal groups strongly suggests that gametogenesis and early embryonic development in vertebrates and invertebrates share even more in common than currently believed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Systemic racial disparities in funding rates at the National Science Foundation</a></h4>

              
                Concerns about systemic racism at academic and research institutions have increased over the past decade. Here, we investigate data from the National Science Foundation (NSF), a major funder of research in the United States, and find evidence for pervasive racial disparities. In particular, white principal investigators (PIs) are consistently funded at higher rates than most non-white PIs. Funding rates for white PIs have also been increasing relative to annual overall rates with time. Moreover, disparities occur across all disciplinary directorates within the NSF and are greater for research proposals. The distributions of average external review scores also exhibit systematic offsets based on PI race. Similar patterns have been described in other research funding bodies, suggesting that racial disparities are widespread. The prevalence and persistence of these racial disparities in funding have cascading impacts that perpetuate a cumulative advantage to white PIs across all of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Environmental morphing enables informed dispersal of the dandelion diaspore</a></h4>

              
                Animal migration is highly sensitised to environmental cues, but plant dispersal is considered largely passive. The common dandelion, <i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, bears an intricate haired pappus facilitating flight. The pappus enables the formation of a separated vortex ring during flight; however, the pappus structure is not static but reversibly changes shape by closing in response to moisture. We hypothesised that this leads to changed dispersal properties in response to environmental conditions. Using wind tunnel experiments for flow visualisation, particle image velocimetry, and flight tests we characterised the fluid mechanics effects of the pappus morphing. We also modelled dispersal to understand the impact of pappus morphing on diaspore distribution. Pappus morphing dramatically alters the fluid mechanics of diaspore flight. We found that when the pappus closes in moist conditions, the drag coefficient decreases and thus the falling velocity is greatly increased. Detachment of diaspores from the parent plant also substantially decreases. The change in detachment when the pappus closes increases dispersal distances by reducing diaspore release when wind speeds are low. We propose that moisture-dependent pappus-morphing is a form of informed dispersal allowing rapid responses to changing conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fixation can change the appearance of phase separation in living cells</a></h4>

              
                Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde (PFA) is an essential step in numerous biological techniques as it is thought to preserve a snapshot of biomolecular transactions in living cells. Fixed cell imaging techniques such as immunofluorescence have been widely used to detect liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we compared images, before and after fixation, of cells expressing intrinsically disordered proteins that are able to undergo LLPS. Surprisingly, we found that PFA fixation can both enhance and diminish putative LLPS behaviors. For specific proteins, fixation can even cause their droplet-like puncta to artificially appear in cells that do not have any detectable puncta in the live condition. Fixing cells in the presence of glycine, a molecule that modulates fixation rates, can reverse the fixation effect from enhancing to diminishing LLPS appearance. We further established a kinetic model of fixation in the context of dynamic protein-protein interactions. Simulations based on the model suggest that protein localization in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and notably, the difference between fixation rates of different proteins. Consistent with simulations, live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments showed that a fast overall rate of fixation relative to protein-protein interaction dynamics can minimize fixation artifacts. Our work reveals that PFA fixation changes the appearance of LLPS from living cells, presents a caveat in studying LLPS using fixation-based methods, and suggests a mechanism underlying the fixation artifact.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Improving the accuracy of single-trial fMRI response estimates using GLMsingle</a></h4>

              
                Advances in artificial intelligence have inspired a paradigm shift in human neuroscience, yielding large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets that provide high-resolution brain responses to thousands of naturalistic visual stimuli. Because such experiments necessarily involve brief stimulus durations and few repetitions of each stimulus, achieving sufficient signal-to-noise ratio can be a major challenge. We address this challenge by introducing <i>GLMsingle</i>, a scalable, user-friendly toolbox available in MATLAB and Python that enables accurate estimation of single-trial fMRI responses (<a href="https://glmsingle.org/">glmsingle.org</a>). Requiring only fMRI time-series data and a design matrix as inputs, GLMsingle integrates three techniques for improving the accuracy of trial-wise general linear model (GLM) beta estimates. First, for each voxel, a custom hemodynamic response function (HRF) is identified from a library of candidate functions. Second, cross-validation is used to derive a set of noise regressors from voxels unrelated to the experiment. Third, to improve the stability of beta estimates for closely spaced trials, betas are regularized on a voxel-wise basis using ridge regression. Applying GLMsingle to the Natural Scenes Dataset and BOLD5000, we find that GLMsingle substantially improves the reliability of beta estimates across visually-responsive cortex in all subjects. Comparable improvements in reliability are also observed in a smaller-scale auditory dataset from the StudyForrest experiment. These improvements translate into tangible benefits for higher-level analyses relevant to systems and cognitive neuroscience. We demonstrate that GLMsingle: (i) helps decorrelate response estimates between trials nearby in time; (ii) enhances representational similarity between subjects within and across datasets; and (iii) boosts one-versus-many decoding of visual stimuli. GLMsingle is a publicly available tool that can significantly improve the quality of past, present, and future neuroimaging datasets sampling brain activity across many experimental conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">High spatial resolution analysis using automated indentation mapping differentiates biomechanical properties of normal vs. degenerated articular cartilage in mice</a></h4>

              
                Characterizing the biomechanical properties of articular cartilage is crucial to understanding processes of tissue homeostasis vs. degeneration. In mouse models, however, limitations are imposed by their small joint size and thin cartilage surfaces. Here we present a 3D automated surface mapping system and methodology that allows for mechanical characterization of mouse cartilage with high spatial resolution. We performed repeated indentation mappings, followed by cartilage thickness measurement via needle probing, at 31 predefined positions distributed over the medial and lateral femoral condyles of healthy mice. High-resolution 3D x-ray microscopy (XRM) imaging was used to validate tissue thickness measurements. The automated indentation mapping was reproducible, and needle probing yielded cartilage thicknesses comparable to XRM imaging. When comparing healthy vs. degenerated cartilage, topographical variations in biomechanics were identified, with altered thickness and stiffness (instantaneous modulus) across condyles and within anteroposterior sub-regions. This quantitative technique comprehensively characterized cartilage function in mice femoral condyle cartilage. Hence, it has the potential to improve our understanding of tissue structure-function interplay in mouse models of repair and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional connectivity subtypes associate robustly with ASD diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the changes in functional brain organization in autism is hampered by the extensive heterogeneity that characterizes this neurodevelopmental disorder. Data driven clustering offers a straightforward way to decompose autism heterogeneity into subtypes of connectivity and promises an unbiased framework to investigate behavioral symptoms and causative genetic factors. Yet, the robustness and generalizability of functional connectivity subtypes is unknown. Here, we show that a simple hierarchical cluster analysis can robustly relate a given individual and brain network to a connectivity subtype, but that continuous assignments are more robust than discrete ones. We also found that functional connectivity subtypes are moderately associated with the clinical diagnosis of autism, and these associations generalize to independent replication data. We explored systematically 18 different brain networks as we expected them to associate with different behavioral profiles as well as different key regions. Contrary to this prediction, autism functional connectivity subtypes converged on a common topography across different networks, consistent with a compression of the primary gradient of functional brain organization, as previously reported in the literature. Our results support the use of data driven clustering as a reliable data dimensionality reduction technique, where any given dimension only associates moderately with clinical manifestations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coordinated multiplexing of information about separate objects in visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory receptive fields are large enough that they can contain more than one perceptible stimulus. How, then, can the brain encode information about <i>each</i> of the stimuli that may be present at a given moment? We recently showed that when more than one stimulus is present, single neurons can fluctuate between coding one vs. the other(s) across some time period, suggesting a form of neural multiplexing of different stimuli (Caruso et al., 2018). Here, we investigate (a) whether such coding fluctuations occur in early visual cortical areas; (b) how coding fluctuations are coordinated across the neural population; and (c) how coordinated coding fluctuations depend on the parsing of stimuli into separate vs. fused objects. We found coding fluctuations do occur in macaque V1 but only when the two stimuli form separate objects. Such separate objects evoked a novel pattern of V1 spike count (‘noise’) correlations involving distinct distributions of positive and negative values. This bimodal correlation pattern was most pronounced among pairs of neurons showing the strongest evidence for coding fluctuations or multiplexing. Whether a given pair of neurons exhibited positive or negative correlations depended on whether the two neurons both responded better to the same object or had different object preferences. Distinct distributions of spike count correlations based on stimulus preferences were also seen in V4 for separate objects but not when two stimuli fused to form one object. These findings suggest multiple objects evoke different response dynamics than those evoked by single stimuli, lending support to the multiplexing hypothesis and suggesting a means by which information about multiple objects can be preserved despite the apparent coarseness of sensory coding.

                Our current understanding of focal epilepsy is evolving as increasing evidence suggests that tissue abnormalities may extend beyond the focus. In adults, widespread structural changes remote from the epileptic focus have been demonstrated with MRI, predominantly using morphological markers. However, the underlying pathophysiology of these changes is unclear, and it is not known whether these result from ongoing disease processes or treatment-related side-effects, or whether they emerge earlier. Few studies have focused on children, who typically have shorter disease duration. Fewer still have utilised quantitative MRI, which may provide a more sensitive and interpretable measure of tissue microstructural changes. In this study, we aimed to determine if there were common spatial modes of changes in cortical architecture in children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and secondarily if changes were related to disease severity. To assess cortical microstructure, quantitative T1 and T2 relaxometry (qT1 and qT2) was measured in 89 children - 43 with drug-resistant focal epilepsy [age-range=4-18 years] and 46 healthy controls [age-range=2-18 years]. We assessed depth-dependent qT1 and qT2 values across the cortex, as well as their gradient of change across cortical depths. As a post-hoc analysis, we determined whether global changes seen in group analyses were driven by focal pathologies in individual patients. Finally, we trained a classifier using qT1 and qT2 gradient maps from patients with radiologically-defined abnormalities (MRI-positive) and healthy controls, and tested if this could classify patients without reported radiological abnormalities (MRI-negative). We detected depth-dependent qT1 and qT2 increases in widespread cortical areas, likely representing loss of structure such as altered cortical stratification, gliosis, myelin and iron alterations, oedema-associated increases in free-water, or a combination of these. Changes did not correlate with disease severity measures, suggesting they may appear during cerebral development and represent antecedent neurobiological alterations. Using a classifier trained with MRI-positive patients and controls, sensitivity was 62% at 100% specificity on held-out MRI-negative patients and controls. Our findings suggest the presence of a potential imaging endophenotype of focal epilepsy, detectable irrespective of radiologically-identified abnormalities, and possibly evident at a pre-symptomatic disease stage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Acute effect of antiseizure drugs on background oscillations in Scn1aA1783V Dravet syndrome mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Dravet syndrome (Dravet) is a rare and severe form of developmental epileptic encephalopathy. First-line treatment for DS patients includes valproic acid (VA) or clobazam with or without stiripentol (CLB+STP), while sodium channel blockers like carbamazepine (CBZ) or lamotrigine (LTG) are contraindicated. As patients are rarely seizure-free, drug therapy focuses on reducing the seizure burden, as reported by caregivers. In addition to their effect on epileptic phenotypes, antiseizure medications (ASMs) were shown to modify the properties of background neuronal activity. Nevertheless, little is known about these background properties alternations in Dravet. Methods: Utilizing Dravet mice (DS, Scn1aA1783V/WT), we tested the acute effect of several ASMs on background electrocorticography (ECoG) activity and frequency of interictal spikes. Results: Compared to wild-type mice, background ECoG activity in DS had lower power and reduced phase coherence, which was not corrected by any of the tested ASMs. However, acute administration of Dravet-recommended drugs, including VA or a combination of CLB+STP, caused, in most mice, a reduction of frequency of interictal spikes, alongside an increase in the relative contribution of the beta frequency band. Conversely, CBZ and LTG increased the frequency of interictal spikes with no effect on background spectral properties. Moreover, we uncovered a correlation between the reduction in interictal spike frequency, the drug-induced effect on the power of background activity, and a spectral shift toward higher frequency bands. Significance: These data provide a comprehensive analysis of the effect of selected ASMs on the properties of background neuronal oscillations and highlight a possible correlation between their effect on epilepsy and background activity. Thus, examining these properties, following an acute administration, may be used as an additional tool for rapid evaluation of the therapeutic potential of ASMs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epigenetic and Signaling Determinants of Blood-Brain Barrier-Regulatory Genetic Networks</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the movement of molecules into and out of the central nervous system (CNS). Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation, whereas adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes during BBB formation and maintenance. Here we demonstrate that epigenetic regulators histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevented Wnt/{beta}-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. Low Wnt activity during development modifies BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clustering and temporal organization of sleep spindles underlie motor memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep benefits motor memory consolidation, which is mediated by sleep spindle activity and associated memory reactivations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. However, the particular role of NREM2 and NREM3 sleep spindles and the mechanisms triggering this memory consolidation process remain controversial. Here, simultaneous electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings were collected during night-time sleep following the learning of a motor sequence task. Adopting a time-based clustering approach, we provide evidence that spindles iteratively occur within clustered and temporally organized patterns during both NREM2 and NREM3 sleep. However, the clustering of spindles in trains is related to motor memory consolidation during NREM2 sleep only. Altogether, our findings suggest that the clustering and rhythmic occurrence of spindles during NREM2 sleep may serve as an intrinsic rhythmic sleep mechanism for the timed reactivation and subsequent consolidation of motor memories, through synchronized oscillatory activity within a subcortical-cortical network involved during learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Performance modulations phase-locked to action depend on internal state</a></h4>

              
                Several studies have probed perceptual performance at different times after a self-paced motor action and found frequency-specific modulations of perceptual performance phase-locked to the action. Such action-related modulation has been reported for various frequencies and modulation strengths. In an attempt to establish a basic effect at the population level, we had a relatively large number of participants (n=50) perform a self-paced button press followed by a detection task at threshold, and we applied both fixed- and random-effects tests. The combined data of all trials and participants surprisingly did not show any significant action-related modulation. However, based on previous studies, we explored the possibility that such modulation depends on the participant's internal state. Indeed, when we split trials based on performance in neighboring trials, then trials in periods of low performance showed an action-related modulation at approximately 17 Hz. When we split trials based on the performance in the preceding trial, we found that trials following a ''miss'' showed an action-related modulation at approximately 17 Hz. Finally, when we split participants based on their false-alarm rate, we found that participants with no false alarms showed an action-related modulation at approximately 17 Hz. All these effects were significant in random-effects tests, supporting an inference on the population. Together, these findings indicate that action-related modulations are not always detectable. However, the results suggest that specific internal states such as lower attentional engagement and/or higher decision criterion are characterized by a modulation in the beta-frequency range.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Compression supports low-dimensional representations of behavior across neural circuits</a></h4>

              
                Dimensionality reduction, a form of compression, can simplify representations of information to increase efficiency and reveal general patterns. Yet, this simplification also forfeits information, thereby reducing representational capacity. Hence, the brain may benefit from generating both compressed and uncompressed activity, and may do so in a heterogeneous manner across diverse neural circuits that represent low-level (sensory) or high-level (cognitive) stimuli. However, precisely how compression and representational capacity differ across the cortex remains unknown. Here we predict different levels of compression across regional circuits by using random walks on networks to model activity flow and to formulate rate-distortion functions, which are the basis of lossy compression. Using a large sample of youth (n=1,040), we test predictions in two ways: by measuring the dimensionality of spontaneous activity from sensorimotor to association cortex, and by assessing the representational capacity for 24 behaviors in neural circuits and 20 cognitive variables in recurrent neural networks. Our network theory of compression predicts the dimensionality of activity (t=12.13, p<0.001) and the representational capacity of biological (r=0.53, p=0.016) and artificial (r=0.61, p<0.001) networks. The model suggests how a basic form of compression is an emergent property of activity flow between distributed circuits that communicate with the rest of the network.

                The molecular pathway associated with Multiple sclerosis (MS) is complex and symptomatic treatments are only available right now. Early diagnosis of MS creates a window for healthcare providers to manage the disease more efficiently. Blood-based biomarker study has been done in the past to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes but in this present study, a novel approach has been taken for identifying genes associated with the disease. In this present study, hub genes are identified and the top ten hub genes were used to identify drugs associated with them. Upregulated genes were identified using the dataset GSE21942 (which contains information related to genes identified in the blood of multiple sclerosis patients) and datasets GSE17846 and GSE61741(which contains information related to microRNAs taken from multiple sclerosis patients). Genes associated with microRNAs were identified using miRWalk. Common genes from both miRWalk and the dataset GSE21942 were identified and were subjected to STRINGdb for the creation of a protein-protein interaction network and this network was then imported to Cytoscape for identifying the top ten hub genes. The top ten hub genes were subjected to EnrichR for enrichment analysis of genes. In our study, it was found that CTNNB1 is the gene with the highest degree (116).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Investigations into an overlooked early component of painful nociceptive withdrawal reflex responses in humans</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The role of pain as a warning system necessitates a rapid transmission of information from the periphery for the execution of appropriate motor responses. The nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) is a physiological response to protect the limb from a painful stimulus and is often considered an objective measure of spinal nociceptive excitability. The NWR is commonly defined by its latency in the presumed Adelta-fiber range consistent with the canonical view that fast pain is signaled by Adelta nociceptors. We recently demonstrated that human skin is equipped with ultrafast (A beta range) nociceptors. Here, we investigated the short-latency component of the reflex and explored the relationship between reflex latency and pain perception. Methods: We revisited our earlier work on NWR measurements in which, following convention, only those reflex responses were selected that were in the presumed Adelta range (taken to be latencies greater than or equal to 90 ms in that study). In our current analysis, we expanded the time window to search for shorter latency responses and compared those with pain ratings. Results: In both cohorts, we found an abundance of recordings with short-latency reflex responses. In nearly 90% of successful recordings, only single reflex responses (not dual) were seen which allowed us to compare pain ratings to reflex latencies. We found that shorter latency reflexes were just as painful as those in the conventional latency range. Discussion: We found a preponderance of short-latency painful reflex responses. Based on this finding, we suggest that short-latency responses must be considered in future studies. We predict these might be signaled by the ultrafast nociceptors, warranting further investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A biology-inspired recurrent oscillator network for computations in high-dimensional state space</a></h4>

              
                Biological neuronal networks have the propensity to oscillate. However, it is unclear whether these oscillations are a mere byproduct of neuronal interactions or serve computational purposes. Therefore, we implemented hallmark features of the cerebral cortex in recurrent neuronal networks (RNNs) simulated in silico and examined their performance on common pattern recognition tasks after training with a gradient-based learning rule. We find that by configuring network nodes as damped harmonic oscillators (DHOs), performance is substantially improved over non-oscillating architectures and that the introduction of heterogeneous nodes, conduction delays, and network modularity further improved performance. We furthermore provide a proof of concept of how unsupervised Hebbian learning can work in such networks. Analyses of network activity illustrate how the nonlinear dynamics of coupled DHOs drive performance, and provide plausible a posteriori explanations for a number of physiological phenomena whose function so far has been elusive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuo-proprioceptive recalibration and the sensorimotor map</a></h4>

              
                Spatial perception of our hand is closely linked to our ability to move the hand accurately. We might therefore expect that reach planning would take into account any changes in perceived hand position; in other words, that perception and action relating to the hand should depend on a common sensorimotor map. However, there is evidence to suggest that changes in perceived hand position affect a body representation that functions separately from the body representation used to control movement. Here we examined target-directed reaching before and after participants either did (Mismatch group) or did not (Veridical group) experience a cue conflict known to elicit recalibration in perceived hand position. For the reaching task, participants grasped a robotic manipulandum that positioned their unseen hand for each trial. Participants then briskly moved the handle straight ahead to a visual target, receiving no performance feedback. For the perceptual calibration task, participants estimated the locations of visual, proprioceptive, or combined cues about their unseen hand. The Mismatch group experienced a gradual 70 mm forward mismatch between visual and proprioceptive cues, resulting in forward proprioceptive recalibration. Participants made significantly shorter reaches after this manipulation, consistent with feeling their hand to be further forward than it was, but reaching performance returned to baseline levels after only 10 reaches. The Veridical group, after exposure to veridically-aligned visual and proprioceptive cues about the hand, showed no change in reach distance. These results are not fully consistent with a single common sensorimotor map, but could suggest multiple, interacting body representations.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYIf perceived hand position changes, we might assume this affects the sensorimotor map and, in turn, reaches made with that hand. However, there is evidence for separate body representations involved in perception vs. action. After a cross-sensory conflict that results in proprioceptive recalibration in the forward direction, participants made shorter reaches as predicted, but only briefly. This is not fully consistent with a single common sensorimotor map, but could suggest multiple, interacting body representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrostatic regulation of the cis- and trans-membrane interactions of synaptotagmin-1</a></h4>

              
                Synaptotagmin-1 is a vesicular protein and Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Ca2+ induces synaptotagmin-1 binding to its own vesicle membrane, called the cis-interaction, thus preventing the trans-interaction of synaptotagmin-1 to the plasma membrane. However, the electrostatic regulation of the cis- and trans-membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 was poorly understood in different Ca2+-buffering conditions. Here we provide an assay to monitor the cis- and trans-membrane interactions of synaptotagmin-1 by using native purified vesicles and the plasma membrane-mimicking liposomes (PM-liposomes). Both ATP and EGTA similarly reverse the cis-membrane interaction of synaptotagmin-1 in free [Ca2+] of 10 to 100 uM. High PIP2 concentrations in the PM-liposomes reduce the Hill coefficient of vesicle fusion and synaptotagmin-1 membrane binding; this observation suggests that local PIP2 concentrations control the Ca2+-cooperativity of synaptotagmin-1. Our data provide evidence that Ca2+ chelators, including EGTA and polyphosphate anions such as ATP, ADP, and AMP, electrostatically reverse the cis-interaction of synaptotagmin-1.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing end-tidal CO2, respiration volume per time (RVT), and average gray matter signal for mapping cerebrovascular reactivity amplitude and delay with breath-hold task BOLD fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), defined as the cerebral blood flow response to a vasoactive stimulus, is an imaging biomarker with demonstrated utility in a range of diseases and in typical development and aging processes. A robust and widely implemented method to map CVR involves using a breath-hold task during a BOLD fMRI scan. Recording end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) changes during the breath-hold task is recommended to be used as a reference signal for modeling CVR amplitude in standard units (%BOLD/mmHg) and CVR delay in seconds. However, obtaining reliable PETCO2 recordings requires equipment and task compliance that may not be achievable in all settings. To address this challenge, we investigated two alternative reference signals to map CVR amplitude and delay in a lagged general linear model (lagged-GLM) framework: respiration volume per time (RVT) and average gray matter BOLD response (GM- BOLD). In 8 healthy adults with multiple scan sessions, we compare spatial agreement of CVR maps from RVT and GM-BOLD to those generated with PETCO2. We define a threshold to determine whether a PETCO2 recording has "sufficient" quality for CVR mapping and perform these comparisons in 16 datasets with sufficient PETCO2 and 6 datasets with insufficient PETCO2. When PETCO2 quality is sufficient, both RVT and GM-BOLD produce CVR amplitude maps that are nearly identical to those from PETCO2 (after accounting for differences in scale), with the caveat they are not in standard units to facilitate between-group comparisons. CVR delays are comparable to PETCO2 with an RVT regressor but may be underestimated with the average GM- BOLD regressor. Importantly, when PETCO2 quality is insufficient, RVT and GM-BOLD CVR recover reasonable CVR amplitude and delay maps, provided the participant attempted the breath-hold task. Therefore, our framework offers a solution for achieving high quality CVR maps in both retrospective and prospective studies where sufficient PETCO2 recordings are not available and especially in populations where obtaining reliable measurements is a known challenge (e.g., children). Our results have the potential to improve the accessibility of CVR mapping and to increase the prevalence of this promising metric of vascular health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ApoE isoforms differentially regulate neuronal membrane proteasomes to shift the threshold for pathological aggregation of endogenous Tau</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal membrane proteasomes (NMPs) are a functionally transmembrane subset of 20S proteasomes that degrade newly synthesized proteins. To date, the molecular composition of NMPs is undefined, and moreover, whether NMPs can influence any aspect of protein aggregation with relevance to neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. Using a Cre-dependent conditional knock-in mouse line to endogenously tag the proteasome, we find that NMPs co-purify with ApoE. We discover that NMP membrane localization is differentially modulated by ApoE isoforms (E4<E3<E2) in vitro, in vivo, and in human postmortem samples. This isoform-dependent change in NMP localization inversely correlates with the risk that ApoE isoforms pose for Alzheimers Disease. ApoE4-dependent reduction of NMP localization is strongest in brain regions selectively vulnerable to neurodegeneration. We synthesized selective NMP-specific inhibitors and discovered that NMP inhibition induces aggregation of endogenous and newly synthesized mouse and human Tau isoforms, without the need for seeding or pathogenic mutations. We posit that newly synthesized Tau is exceptionally susceptible to aggregation due to NMP dysfunction. Stereotactic injection of NMP inhibitors in vivo induces aggregation, phosphorylation, somatodendritic mislocalization and pathology of endogenous newly synthesized Tau. Finally, using ApoE-KI/hTau-KI crosses, we find that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the aggregation threshold for Tau. Overall, our data define NMPs as a pivotal proteostasis mechanism underlying the formation of endogenous Tau aggregates, which is directly regulated by the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers Disease.

                SummaryHigh-throughput analysis of behaviour is a pivotal instrument in modern neuroscience, allowing researchers to combine modern genetics breakthrough to unbiased, objective, reproducible experimental approaches. To this extent, we recently created an open-source hardware platform (ethoscope1) that allows for inexpensive, accessible, high-throughput analysis of behaviour in Drosophila or other animal models. Here we equip ethoscopes with a Python framework for data analysis, ethoscopy, designed to be a user-friendly yet powerful platform, meeting the requirements of researchers with limited coding expertise as well as experienced datascientists. Ethoscopy is best consumed in a prebaked Jupyter-based docker container, ethoscope-lab, to improve accessibility and to encourage the use of notebooks as a natural platform to share post-publication data analysis.

Availability and implementationEthoscopy is a Python package available on GitHub and PyPi. Ethoscope-lab is a docker container available on DockerHub. A landing page aggregating all the code and documentation is available at https://lab.gilest.ro/ethoscopy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experience Adaptively Tunes the Timing Rules for Associative Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                A key function of the brain is to learn about the statistical relationships between events in the world. A mechanism of this learning is associative neural plasticity, controlled by the timing between neural events. Here, we show that experience can dramatically alter the timing rules governing associative plasticity to match the constraints of a particular circuit and behavior, thereby improving learning. In normal mice, the timing requirements for associative plasticity in the oculomotor cerebellum are precisely matched to the 120 ms delay for visual feedback about behavioral errors.1 This task-specific specialization of the timing rules for plasticity is acquired through experience; in dark-reared mice that had never experienced visual feedback about oculomotor errors, plasticity defaulted to a coincidence-based rule. Computational modeling suggests two broad strategies for implementing this Adaptive Tuning of the Timing Rules for Associative Plasticity (ATTRAP), which tune plasticity to different features of the statistics of neural activity. The modeling predicts a critical role of this process in optimizing the accuracy of temporal credit assignment during learning; consistent with this, behavioral experiments revealed a delay in the timing of learned eye movements in mice lacking experience-dependent tuning of the timing rules for plasticity. ATTRAP provides a powerful mechanism for matching the timing contingencies for associative plasticity to the functional requirements of a particular circuit and learning task, thereby providing a candidate neural mechanism for meta-learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bimodal stimulation for the reduction of tinnitus using vibration on the skin</a></h4>

              
                Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) affects 1 in 10 adults in the United States, often with damaging psychological consequences. Currently, there exists no cure for most forms of tinnitus. Recently, bimodal stimulation - the pairing of sounds with haptic stimulation - has shown efficacy in reducing the symptoms of tinnitus. Previous bimodal stimulation approaches have used electrical shocks on the tongue, a technique that requires daily in-person sessions at an audiologists office. We here show that excellent results can be achieved wearing a wristband with multiple vibratory motors. Tones are played and the wristband correspondingly vibrates the wrist of the user at different spatial locations depending on the frequency of the tone. We compared the experimental group with a control group who listened to the tones but did not wear the wristband. The tone frequencies were centered on each users tinnitus frequency and the tones were randomized both in frequency and duration. 45 participants with Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) scores of 25 and above were tested. Results show a significantly greater reduction in TFI scores for the experimental group compared to the control. Importantly, with higher baseline severity we find larger differences between the experimental and control groups, revealing greater symptom improvement for those with severe tinnitus. The therapeutic approach of combining sounds with spatially- and temporally-correlated vibrations on the wrist is found to be a simple, time-efficient, and effective procedure to lessen the symptoms of tinnitus.

                The subthalamic nucleus (STN) of the basal ganglia interacts with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and shapes a control loop, specifically when the brain receives contradictory information from either different sensory systems or conflicting information from sensory inputs and prior knowledge that developed in the brain. Experimental studies demonstrated that significant increases in theta activities (2-8 Hz) in both the STN and mPFC as well as increased phase synchronization between mPFC and STN are prominent features of conflict processing. While these neural features reflect the importance of STN-mPFC circuitry in conflict processing, a low-dimensional representation of the mPFC-STN interaction referred to as a cognitive state, that links neural activities generated by these sub-regions to behavioral signals (e.g., the response time), remains to be identified. Here, we propose a new model, namely, the heterogeneous input discriminative-generative decoder (HI-DGD) model, to infer a cognitive state underlying decision-making based on neural activities (STN and mPFC) and behavioral signals (individuals' response time) recorded in 10 Parkinson's disease patients while they performed a Stroop task. PD patients may have conflict processing which is quantitatively (may be qualitative in some) different from healthy population. Using extensive synthetic and experimental data, we showed that the HI-DGD model can diffuse information from neural- and behavioral data simultaneously and estimate cognitive states underlying conflict and non-conflict trials significantly better than traditional methods. Additionally, the HI-DGD model identified which neural features made significant contributions to conflict and non-conflict choices. Interestingly, the estimated features match well with those reported in experimental studies. Finally, we highlight the capability of the HI-DGD model in estimating a cognitive state from a single trial of observation, which makes it appropriate to be utilized in closed-loop neuromodulation systems.

                Humans and other species can remember how long ago specific events happened. Based on a systematic exploration of neural coding and association schemes, we develop different hypotheses about how neural networks with Hebbian plasticity could enable an automatic reconstruction of the time of past events. We assess these hypotheses from a computational perspective and in light of the available behavioral and neurophysiological data. Existing models of how the time of past events can be remembered are special cases of our theory. We conclude that many models lead to indistinguishable behavior and future experiments with neural recordings are needed to disambiguate different models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural and functional specializations of human fast spiking neurons support fast cortical signaling</a></h4>

              
                In rodent cortical networks, fast spiking interneurons (FSINs) provide fast inhibition that synchronizes neuronal activity and is critical for cognitive function. Fast synchronization frequencies are evolutionary conserved in the expanded human neocortex, despite larger neuron-to-neuron distances that challenge fast input-output transfer functions of FSINs. Here, we test which mechanistic specializations of large human FSINs explain their fast-signaling properties in human cortex. With morphological reconstructions, multi-patch recordings, and biophysical modeling we find that despite three-fold longer dendritic path lengths, human FSINs maintain fast inhibition between connected pyramidal neurons through several mechanisms: stronger synapse strength of excitatory inputs, larger dendrite diameter with reduced complexity, faster AP initiation, and faster and larger inhibitory output, while Na+ current activation /inactivation properties are similar. These adaptations underlie short input-output delays in fast inhibition of human pyramidal neurons through FSINs, explaining how cortical synchronization frequencies are conserved despite expanded and sparse network topology of human cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signatures of electrical stimulation driven network interactions in the human limbic system</a></h4>

              
                Stimulation-evoked signals are starting to be used as biomarkers to indicate the state and health of brain networks. The human limbic network, often targeted for brain stimulation therapy, is involved in emotion and memory processing. Previous anatomical, neurophysiological, and functional studies suggest distinct subsystems within the limbic network (Rolls, 2015). Previous studies using intracranial electrical stimulation, however, have emphasized the similarities of the evoked waveforms across the limbic network. We test whether these subsystems have distinct stimulation-driven signatures. In seven patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, we stimulated the limbic system with single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES). Reliable cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) were measured between the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the CCEP waveform in the PCC after hippocampal stimulation showed a unique and reliable morphology, which we term the limbic H-wave. This limbic H-wave was visually distinct and separately decoded from the amygdala to ACC waveform. Diffusion MRI data show that the measured endpoints in the PCC overlap with the endpoints of the parolfactory cingulum bundle rather than the parahippocampal cingulum, suggesting that the limbic H-wave may travel through the fornix, mammillary bodies, and the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT). This was further confirmed by stimulating the ANT, which evoked the same limbic H-wave but with a shorter latency. Limbic subsystems have unique stimulation-evoked signatures that may be used in the future to help develop stimulation therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-range inhibitory axons from medial entorhinal cortex target lateral entorhinal neurons projecting to the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Functionally distinct information encoded by the two main divisions of the entorhinal cortex (EC), the lateral EC (LEC) and the medial EC (MEC), is thought to be first integrated at the level of the hippocampus. Here we examine a circuit connecting MEC to LEC that supports functional interplay at the level of the two entorhinal domains. Using a combination of anatomical, in vitro electrophysiological and behavioral experiments in the mouse, we report that axons from MEC somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons densely distribute in layer I of LEC, where they drive strong and near selective inhibition of principal neurons in layer IIa. This inhibitory pathway is accompanied by MEC glutamatergic axons that innervate multiple layers of LEC and preferentially synapse onto principal neurons in layers IIb and III. Our findings indicate that excitatory and inhibitory projections from MEC may separately regulate the activity of different populations of hippocampal-projecting principal neurons in LEC.

	<p>Research on visual encoding models for functional magnetic resonance imaging derived from deep neural networks, especially CNN (e.g., VGG16), has been developed. However, CNNs typically use smaller kernel sizes (e.g., 3 &amp;amp;times; 3) for feature extraction in visual encoding models. Although the receptive field size of CNN can be enlarged by increasing the network depth or subsampling, it is limited by the small size of the convolution kernel, leading to an insufficient receptive field size. In biological research, the size of the neuronal population receptive field of high-level visual encoding regions is usually three to four times that of low-level visual encoding regions. Thus, CNNs with a larger receptive field size align with the biological findings. The RepLKNet model directly expands the convolution kernel size to obtain a larger-scale receptive field. Therefore, this paper proposes a mixed model to replace CNN for feature extraction in visual encoding models. The proposed model mixes RepLKNet and VGG so that the mixed model has a receptive field of different sizes to extract more feature information from the image. The experimental results indicate that the mixed model achieves better encoding performance in multiple regions of the visual cortex than the traditional convolutional model. Also, a larger-scale receptive field should be considered in building visual encoding models so that the convolution network can play a more significant role in visual representations.</p>

	<p>Transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) is a rare cause of acute amnestic syndromes (AAS), often misdiagnosed as transient global amnesia (TGA). We proposed a scoring system&amp;amp;mdash;the EPIlepsy AMNEsia (EPIAMNE) score&amp;amp;mdash;using quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis to obtain a tool for differentiating TEA from TGA. We retrospectively reviewed clinical information and standard EEGs (stEEG) of 19 patients with TEA and 21 with TGA. We computed and compared Power Spectral Density, demonstrating an increased relative theta power in TGA. We subsequently incorporated qEEG features in EPIAMNE score, together with clinical and stEEG features. ROC curve models and pairwise ROC curve comparison were used to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy for TEA detection of EPIAMNE score, presence of symptoms atypical for TGA (pSymAT) and identification of anomalies (interictal epileptiform or temporal focal spiky transients) at stEEG (PosEEG). Area Under the Curve (AUC) of EPIAMNE score revealed to be higher than PosEEG and pSymAT (AUCEPIAMNE = 0.95, AUCpSymAT = 0.85, AUCPosEEG = 0.67) and this superiority proved to be statistically significant (p-valueEPIAMNE-PosEEG and p-valueEPIAMNE-pSymAT &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, EPIAMNE score classified TEA with higher accuracy than PosEEG and pSymAT. This approach could become a promising tool for the differential diagnosis of AAS, especially for early TEA detection.</p>

	<p>Multiple studies support the relationship between ADHD and overweight/obesity in youth. Different mechanisms may be involved, such as temperamental and psychopathological factors. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that specific temperamental and psychopathological dimensions could mediate the relationship between ADHD and obesity. The sample included 100 children and adolescents (78 males and 22 females; age range 6 to 18 years; mean age 9.90 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.5 years). The assessment procedure included Conners&amp;amp;rsquo; Parent Rating Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Long (CPRS-R:L) as the inclusion criterion for ADHD diagnosis, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a dimensional measure for psychopathology, and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory, which describes four temperamental dimensions: novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence (RD), and persistence (P). While in the whole ADHD sample, the highest scores were found in NS and the lowest in P, ADHD with overweight/obesity, compared to ADHD with normal weight, showed higher HA and RD, lower NS, and higher CBCL Internalizing scores. These findings suggest that ADHD youth with overweight/obesity present specific temperamental and psychopathological features compared to those without overweight/obesity. If confirmed in larger samples, using a control group without ADHD, these temperamental and psychological features may be helpful for an earlier recognition of ADHD patients at higher risk for obesity, and may represent possible targets for temperament-based preventive interventions and tailored treatment programs. These features should be included in the routine assessment of children and adolescents with ADHD and/or are overweight/obese.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) frequently face pragmatic impairments which may result in learning, socialization, and mental health difficulties, therefore early intervention is crucial. In Portugal, the Pragmatic Intervention Programme (PICP) has been recently developed and validated, but its effects are unknown. This study aims to determine the effects of the PICP on preschool-age children with ASD or DLD with pragmatic impairments. Methods: A non-randomized controlled trial has been conducted. The children (n = 20) were assigned to the intervention (n = 11) or the control group (waiting list) (n = 9). Each child attended 24 PICP-based intervention sessions provided by a Speech and Language Therapist in kindergarten. The primary outcome measure was a Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) rated by parents and kindergarten teachers. Secondary outcomes include parent/teacher-reported communication skills (Escala de Avalia&amp;amp;ccedil;&amp;amp;atilde;o de Compet&amp;amp;ecirc;ncias Comunicativas) and an assessment of the child&amp;amp;rsquo;s general language ability (Teste de Linguagem&amp;amp;mdash;Avalia&amp;amp;ccedil;&amp;amp;atilde;o da Linguagem Pr&amp;amp;eacute;-Escolar). Results: GAS results show that all the children in the intervention group made progress. Statistically significant differences between pre- and post-intervention assessments were found for all secondary outcomes. Conclusions: The main findings suggest that the PICP improves language in preschool-age children with ASD and DLD with pragmatic difficulties. Further research is needed to analyse the effects of the PICP for each neurodevelopmental disorder individually. These results are crucial and will contribute to future research and evidence-based practice.</p>

	<p>Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a major mediator of Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways in various cell types throughout the body. Its neuronal isoform CaMKIIa (alpha) centrally integrates physiological but also pathological glutamate signals directly downstream of glutamate receptors and has thus emerged as a target for ischemic stroke. Previous studies provided evidence for the involvement of CaMKII activity in ischemic cell death by showing that CaMKII inhibition affords substantial neuroprotection. However, broad inhibition of this central kinase is challenging because various essential physiological processes like synaptic plasticity rely on intact CaMKII regulation. Thus, specific strategies for targeting CaMKII after ischemia are warranted which would ideally only interfere with pathological activity of CaMKII. This review highlights recent advances in the understanding of how ischemia affects CaMKII and how pathospecific pharmacological targeting of CaMKII signaling could be achieved. Specifically, we discuss direct targeting of CaMKII kinase activity with peptide inhibitors versus indirect targeting of the association (hub) domain of CaMKIIa with analogues of g-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) as a potential way to achieve more specific pharmacological modulation of CaMKII activity after ischemia.</p>

	<p>The aim of this selective review paper is to clarify potential confusion when referring to the term proactive inhibitory control. Illustrated by a concise overview of the literature, we propose defining reactive inhibition as the mechanism underlying stopping an action. On a stop trial, the stop signal initiates the stopping process that races against the ongoing action-related process that is triggered by the go signal. Whichever processes finishes first determines the behavioral outcome of the race. That is, stopping is either successful or unsuccessful in that trial. Conversely, we propose using the term proactive inhibition to explicitly indicate preparatory processes engaged to bias the outcome of the race between stopping and going. More specifically, these proactive processes include either pre-amping the reactive inhibition system (biasing the efficiency of the stopping process) or presetting the action system (biasing the efficiency of the go process). We believe that this distinction helps meaningful comparisons between various outcome measures of proactive inhibitory control that are reported in the literature and extends to experimental research paradigms other than the stop task.</p>

	<p>Peripheral sensory nerve electrical stimulation (PES) excites the primary motor cortex and is expected to improve motor dysfunction post-stroke. However, previous studies have reported a variety of stimulus frequencies and stimulus duration settings, and the effects of these different combinations on primary motor cortex excitability are not clear. We aimed to clarify the effects of different combinations of stimulus frequency and stimulus duration of PES on the excitation of primary motor cortex. Twenty-one healthy individuals (aged &amp;amp;gt; 18 years, right-handed, and without a history of neurological or orthopedic disorders) were included. Each participant experienced three different stimulation frequencies (1, 10, and 50 Hz) and durations (20, 40, and 60 min). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded pre- and post-PES. The outcome measure was the change in primary motor cortex excitability using the MEP ratio. We used a D-optimal design of experiments and response surface analysis to define the optimal combination within nine different settings inducing more satisfying responses. The combination of stimulation frequency and stimulation time that maximized the desirability value was 10 Hz and 40 min, respectively. The results of this study may provide fundamental data for more minimally invasive and effective implementation of PES in patients with stroke.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be the limit between the cognitive changes of aging and early dementia; thus, discriminating between participants with and without MCI is important. In the present study, we aimed to examine the differences in the cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal between individuals with and without MCI. The cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal was measured when the participants (young and elderly controls as well as patients with MCI) performed category fluency, finger tapping, and dual tasks using head-mounted near-infrared spectroscopy; the results were compared between the groups. The cerebral oxyhemoglobin signal trended toward the highest values during the category fluency task in young participants and during the finger-tapping task in elderly participants regardless of the MCI status. The area under the curve was approximately 0.5, indicating a low discrimination ability between elderly participants with and without MCI. The measurement of the blood flow in the prefrontal cortex may not accurately quantify cognitive and motor performance to detect MCI. Finger tapping may increase cerebral blood flow in individuals with and without MCI during the task.</p>

	<p>Objective: The virtual reality (VR)-based path integration task shows substantial promise in predicting dementia risk. However, the reliability and validity in healthy populations need further exploration. The present study investigates the relationship between task indicators and brain structures in a healthy population using a VR-based navigation task, particularly the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus. Methods: Sixty healthy adults were randomly recruited to perform a VR-based path integration task, the digit span task (DST), and an MRI scan. The indicators of the VR-based path integration task were calculated, including the absolute distance error (ADE), degree of angle deviation (DAD), degree of path deviation (DPD), and return time (Time). The reliability of the above indicators was then estimated using the split-half method and Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha. Correlation and regression analyses were then performed to examine the associations between these indicators and age, general cognitive ability (DST), and brain structural measures. Results: ADE, DAD, and DPD showed reasonable split-half reliability estimates (0.84, 0.81, and 0.72) and nice Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha estimates (0.90, 0.86, and 0.96). All indicators correlated with age and DST. ADE and DAD were sensitive predictors of hippocampal volume, and return time was a predictor of EC thickness. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the VR-based path integration task exhibits good reliability and validity in the healthy population. The task indicators are age-sensitive, can capture working memory capacity, and are closely related to the integrity of individual EC and hippocampal structures.</p>

	<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders. Genetics have been shown to have a role in the severity of alcohol&amp;amp;rsquo;s teratogenic effects on the developing brain. We previously identified recombinant inbred BXD mouse strains that show high (HCD) or low cell death (LCD) in the hippocampus following ethanol exposure. The present study aimed to identify gene networks that influence this susceptibility. On postnatal day 7 (3rd-trimester-equivalent), male and female neonates were treated with ethanol (5.0 g/kg) or saline, and hippocampi were collected 7hrs later. Using the Affymetrix microarray platform, ethanol-induced gene expression changes were identified in all strains with divergent expression sets found between sexes. Genes, such as Bcl2l11, Jun, and Tgfb3, showed significant strain-by-treatment interactions and were involved in many apoptosis pathways. Comparison of HCD versus LCD showed twice as many ethanol-induced genes changes in the HCD. Interestingly, these changes were regulated in the same direction suggesting (1) more perturbed effects in HCD compared to LCD and (2) limited gene expression changes that confer resistance to ethanol-induced cell death in LCD. These results demonstrate that genetic background and sex are important factors that affect differential cell death pathways after alcohol exposure during development that could have long-term consequences.</p>

                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health crisis worldwide. In less than 12 months since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, several different COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and deployed mostly in developed countries since January 2021. However, hesitancy to accept the newly developed vaccines is a well-known public health challenge that needs to be addressed. The aim of this study was to measure willingness and hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among health care practitioners' (HCPs) in Saudi Arabia.   Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online self-reported survey was conducted among HCPs in Saudi Arabia between April 4th to April 25th 2021 using snowball sampling. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify the possible factors affecting HCPs’ willingness and hesitancy to receive COVID-19 vaccines.   Results: Out of 776 participants who started the survey, 505 (65%) completed it and were included in the results. Among all HCPs, 47 (9.3%) either said “no” to receive the vaccine [20 (4%)] or were hesitant to receive it [27 (5.3%)]. Of the total number of the HCPs, 376 (74.5%) already received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 48 (9.50%) were registered to receive it. The main reason of agreement to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was “wanting to protect self and others from getting the infection” (24%).   Conclusion: Our findings have shown that hesitancy toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines among HCPs in Saudi Arabia is limited and therefore may not be a serious issue. The outcomes of this study may help to understand factors that lead to vaccine hesitancy in Saudi Arabia and help public health authorities to design targeted health education interventions aiming to increase uptake of these vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characterization of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains in a tertiary care center [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Urinary tract infection(UTI) is one of the commonly prevalent bacterial infection in humans.The uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) expresses a range of virulence factors that contribute to their pathogenicity. The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR)-associated UTI is increasing.This study monitors the distribution of virulence factors among UPEC strains to note the antibiogram, outcome and type of associated UTI. Methods:A prospective cross-sectional time-bound study of six months was done on clinically significant urinary isolates of Escherichia coli. Detection of haemolysin production and serum resistance was done by phenotypic methods. Genotypic characterization of the virulence genes (papC, iutA, hlyA, cnf1) was done by multiplex PCR. Demographic data, clinical history, antibiogram and type of UTI was collected from clinical case records. Results:75 E.coli isolates from patients with suspected UTIs were included. Females had a higher preponderance of UTI (66.7%). 93% of patients were adults and the remaining 7% were from paediatrics.  24 (32%) isolates showed haemolysis by plate haemolysis and all isolates were serum-resistant. Out of 75 isolates, 65 were positive for at least one of four targeted genes, while remaining ten isolates were negative for all four genes.Multidrug resistance was found in 40 (53.3%) isolates. 97.4% of the UTI cases had a favourable clinical outcome at discharge. Mortality due to urosepsis was 2.6%. Conclusion:Association of hemolysin production with resistance to imipenem and norfloxacin in UPEC strains was significant.Presence of hlyA gene is positively associated with ceftazidime resistance. Nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and cefaperazone sulbactam are possible candidates for empirical therapy of UTIs. Drugs like aminoglycosides, carbapenems and fosfomycin may be used as reserve drugs in the treatment of MDR-UTI.However, inappropriate usage can increase antibiotic resistance. Hence proper selection of antibiotics in hospitals taking into account the local antibiogram is needed to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

                With the ongoing cost decrease of genotyping and sequencing technologies, accurate and fast phenotyping remains the bottleneck in the utilizing of plant genetic resources for breeding and breeding research. Although cost-efficient high-throughput phenotyping platforms are emerging for specific traits and/or species, manual phenotyping is still widely used and is a time- and money-consuming step. Approaches that improve data recording, processing or handling are pivotal steps towards the efficient use of genetic resources and are demanded by the research community. Therefore, we developed PhenoApp, an open-source Android app for tablets and smartphones to facilitate the digital recording of phenotypical data in the field and in greenhouses. It is a versatile tool that offers the possibility to fully customize the descriptors/scales for any possible scenario, also in accordance with international information standards such as MIAPPE (Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Furthermore, PhenoApp enables the use of pre-integrated ready-to-use BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt für Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie) scales for apple, cereals, grapevine, maize, potato, rapeseed and rice. Additional BBCH scales can easily be added. The simple and adaptable structure of input and output files enables an easy data handling by either spreadsheet software or even the integration in the workflow of laboratory information management systems (LIMS). PhenoApp is therefore a decisive contribution to increase efficiency of digital data acquisition in genebank management but also contributes to breeding and breeding research by accelerating the labour intensive and time-consuming acquisition of phenotyping data.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">De Novo Brain-Computer Interfacing Deforms Manifold of Populational Neural Activity Patterns in Human Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human brains are capable of modulating innate activities to adapt to novel environments and tasks; for sensorimotor neural system this means acquisition of a rich repertoire of activity patterns that improve behavioral performance. To directly map the process of acquiring the neural repertoire during tasks onto performance improvement, we analyzed net neural populational activity during the learning of its voluntary modulation by brain-computer interface (BCI) operation in female and male humans. The recorded whole-head high-density scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) were subjected to dimensionality reduction algorithm to capture changes in cortical activity patterns represented by the synchronization of neuronal oscillations during adaptation. Although the preserved variance of targeted features in the reduced dimensions was 20%, we found systematic interactions between the activity patterns and BCI classifiers that detected motor attempt; the neural manifold derived in the embedded space was stretched along with motor-related features of EEG by model-based fixed classifiers but not with adaptive classifiers that were constantly recalibrated to user activity. Moreover, the manifold was deformed to be orthogonal to the boundary by <I>de novo</I> classifiers with a fixed decision boundary based on biologically unnatural features. Collectively, the flexibility of human cortical signaling patterns (i.e., neural plasticity) is only induced by operation of a BCI whose classifier required fixed activities, and the adaptation could be induced even the requirement is not consistent with biologically natural responses. These principles of neural adaptation at a macroscopic level may underlie the ability of humans to learn wide-ranging behavioral repertoires and adapt to novel environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Angular Tuning Properties of Low Threshold Mechanoreceptors in Isolated Rat Whisker Hair Follicles</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Angular tuning is preferential sensory response to a directional stimulus and is observed in the whisker tactile system. In whisker hair follicles, there are at least three types of low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs): rapidly adapting (RA), slowly adapting type 1 (SA1), and slowly adapting type 2 (SA2). These LTMRs display angular tuning but their properties remain incompletely studied. Here, we used isolated rat whisker hair follicles and pressure-clamped single-fiber recordings to study angular tuning of these LTMRs. Angular tuning was determined with impulses elicited by ramp-and-hold deflection of whisker hair in 24 directions each at 15&deg; for a total of 360&deg;. We show that RA display impulses during ramp-up, both ramp-up and ramp-down, or ramp-down dynamic phases. Both SA1 and SA2 respond to angular stimuli with slowly adapting impulses in most angles. However, SA1 and SA2 show rapidly adapting responses in other angles. All the three types of LTMRs display strong angular tuning, and there is no significant difference in angular tuning index among them. Population wise, the majority of SA1 are tuned in the caudal direction, a large part of SA2 is tuned in the rostral direction, and RAs are tuned in multiple directions. In the angles showing strong tuning, the three LTMRs respond to increased stimulation amplitudes with increased impulse numbers in a hyperbola relationship, and the responsiveness based on impulse numbers is SA2 &gt; SA1 &gt; RA. Our findings provide new information on angular tuning properties of LTMRs in whisker hair follicles and help to understand directional encoding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Model for the Propagation of Seizure Activity in Normal Brain Tissue</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Epilepsies are characterized by paroxysmal electrophysiological events and seizures, which can propagate across the brain. One of the main unsolved questions in epilepsy is how epileptic activity can invade normal tissue and thus propagate across the brain. To investigate this question, we consider three computational models at the neural network scale to study the underlying dynamics of seizure propagation, understand which specific features play a role, and relate them to clinical or experimental observations. We consider both the internal connectivity structure between neurons and the input properties in our characterization. We show that a paroxysmal input is sometimes controlled by the network while in other instances, it can lead the network activity to itself produce paroxysmal activity, and thus will further propagate to efferent networks. We further show how the details of the network architecture are essential to determine this switch to a seizure-like regime. We investigated the nature of the instability involved and in particular found a central role for the inhibitory connectivity. We propose a probabilistic approach to the propagative/non-propagative scenarios, which may serve as a guide to control the seizure by using appropriate stimuli.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In vitro apical microleakage evaluation for different endodontic sealers by spectrophotometric analysis: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It has been established that several filling techniques can affect apical leakage, which is responsible for 59% of endodontic failures. The primary goal of endodontic therapy is to create a tight seal that aids in repairing the periapical tissues, prevents apical periodontitis, and shields against root canal infection. The study aims to compare the apical sealing ability of epoxy resin based sealer  (AH plus), which is an epoxy-resin-based root canal sealer, GuttaFlow 2, which is a silicone-based root canal sealer, GuttaFlow bioseal is a bioactive glass-based root canal sealer, TotalFill HiFlow bioceramic (BC) sealer is a silicate-based root canal sealer (bioceramic sealer) using a single cone technique by spectrophotometric analysis.  Methods: This study chose 64 maxillary first molars with a straight palatal root. Following palatal roots sectioning to 11 mm from the root apex, the canals were instrumented up to size X4 using Protaper Next. They were separated into  four experimental groups (n = 15) per each group based on the kind of sealer utilized, Group I: AH plus, Group II: GuttaFlow 2, Group III: GuttaFlow bioseal, Group IV: TotalFill BC HiFlow, and two control groups (n =2 for each).  After completing obturation, the dye extraction technique was used to evaluate apical leakage. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical density of the solution after all the dyes were liberated from the interfacial regions. Result: A statistically non-significant difference between the investigated root canal sealers in apical microleakage P > 0.05 was noted. The highest mean values were observed in group IV (0.08046), group I(0.07731), and group II(0.06209), while the lowest mean value in group III (0.05719) Conclusions: All types of sealers used in this investigation showed various amounts of microleakage. None of the sealants could completely close the apical foramen to provide a fluid-tight seal.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anticancer and antiretroviral activities of methanolic extract from Theobroma cacao L pod husk: focusing on the ethyl acetate partition [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many researchers have paid attention to Theobroma cocoa pod husk for its bioactive phytoconstituents which have several medicinal benefits. Herein, we aim to evaluate the methanolic extract from T. cocoa pod husk and its partitions for their anticancer and antiretroviral activities. Methods: The T. cocoa pod husk was macerated using methanol, and then sequentially partitioned with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. MCF-7 and HeLa cells were used to assess the anticancer activities, while the simian retrovirus-2 (SRV-2)-infected A549 cells were used for antiretroviral study. The ethyl acetate partition (TCEA) was then fractionated and screened for in-vitro antioxidant and cytotoxicity. The most active fraction was sub-fractionated and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Results: The results suggested that TCEA had moderate and weak activities against MCF-7 (IC50=53.91 μg/mL) and HeLa cells (IC50=120.71 μg/mL), respectively. TCEA 125 μg/mL had higher anti-SRV-2 activity in comparison with lamivudine 25 μg/mL after 1—7 days of incubation. The GC-MS analysis of the polyphenol-predominated sub-fraction from the most active fraction revealed the presence of lupeol, syringaresinol, catechol, and squalene. Conclusions: TCEA derived from the methanolic extract of T. cacao pod husk had moderate activity against MCF-7 cells and weak activity against HeLa cells. Antiretroviral study suggests that TCEA 125 μg/mL had higher inhibitory activity against SRV-2 replication as compared to lamivudine 25 μg/mL.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Dynamic geographical accessibility assessments to improve health equity: protocol for a test case in Cali, Colombia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This protocol proposes an approach to assessing the place of residence as a spatial determinant of health in cities where traffic congestion might impact health services accessibility. The study provides dynamic travel times presenting data in ways that help shape decisions and spur action by diverse stakeholders and sectors.    Equity assessments in geographical accessibility to health services typically rely on static metrics, such as distance or average travel times. This new approach uses dynamic spatial accessibility measures providing travel times from the place of residence to the health service with the shortest journey time. It will show the interplay between traffic congestion, accessibility, and health equity and should be used to inform urban and health services monitoring and planning.   Available digitised data enable efficient and accurate accessibility measurements for urban areas using publicly available sources and provide disaggregated sociodemographic information and an equity perspective.   Test cases are done for urgent and frequent care (i.e., repeated ambulatory care). Situational analyses will be done with cross-sectional urban assessments; estimated potential improvements will be made for one or two new services, and findings will inform recommendations and future studies.   This study will use visualisations and descriptive statistics to allow non-specialized stakeholders to understand the effects of accessibility on populations and health equity. This includes “time-to-destination” metrics or the proportion of the people that can reach a service by car within a given travel time threshold from the place of residence.   The study is part of the AMORE Collaborative Project, in which a diverse group of stakeholders seeks to address equity for accessibility to essential health services, including health service users and providers, authorities, and community members, including academia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Demographical domains and clinico-radiological characteristics of study cohorts with spontaneous simultaneous multiple intracerebral hemorrhages in a tertiary neurosurgical center in Nepal: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 ap</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous simultaneous multiple intra-cerebral hemorrhages (SMICHs) and its occurrences in different territories of arterial disposition has been viewed as uncommon clinical occurrences, since the pathophysiological and predisposing factors as mechanisms aren’t vividly defined. This research primarily aims for demographic stratification and dichotomization pertaining to risk factors, etiological classifications, anatomical distributions and outcome analysis by focusing on management strategies and pertinent stroke care. Methods: 40 patients presenting to the College of Medical Sciences, Chitwan, Nepal in the last two years were included in the study. The patients with two or more spontaneous SMICHs with affected arterial territories with similar tomographic density based profiling were chosen as samples. Regression analysis was chosen to test three hypotheses. Results: Among our study cohorts, cortical and cortical territory (60%) was the major anatomical patterns of involvement. A conservative approach was undertaken in nine patients (22.5%), whereas surgical intervention was needed in five others (12.5%). A total of 14(35%) patients leaving against medical advice and a further seven (17.5%) patients were referred for adjuvant oncologic care. Mortality was observed among five (12.5%) patients. Hypertension was seen as a significant variable in its pathogenesis. Male patients were more affected. Age groups comprising 36-45years and 56-65 years were involved in 32.5% and 30% of cases respectively. Conclusion: This study proves the need for a national stroke data bank pertaining to spontaneous SMICHs. This will help foster effective patient education during preoperative counseling; as well as formatting a management algorithm combating them.

                Background: Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii infections, but the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) has rendered it ineffective in the vast majority of cases. Combination therapy has grown in popularity over the last decade; this study aims to analyze A.baumannii growth kinetics after exposure to meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam compared with meropenem and amikacin antibiotic combinations in clinically relevant concentrations.  Methods: This experimental laboratory study was conducted on the A. baumannii ATCC 19606 isolate and three clinical isolates that were intermediate or resistant to tested antibiotics. Meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam, as well as meropenem and amikacin, were tested at four different concentrations against isolates. Turbidity measurements were taken at predetermined time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours following exposure; bacterial concentration was enumerated using the agar plate method, with the results plotted in a time-kill curve.   Results: A bactericidal effect was achieved in isolates that were intermediate to ampicillin-sulbactam and resistant to meropenem after the administration of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam combination with a concentration of 4 µg/ml and 16/8 µg/ml, respectively. The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam demonstrated bacteriostatic activity against isolates that were resistant to both antibiotics. Isolates treated with resistant antibiotics showed an increased growth rate compared to the growth control.  Conclusion: The combination of meropenem and ampicillin-sulbactam could be a promising combination therapy in treating CRAB infections. The mechanism and degree of antibiotic resistance in the isolates affect the efficacy of antibiotic combinations; further research is needed to corroborate the findings of this study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of an mHealth application on remote monitoring and self-management of persons with hypertension in a coastal taluk of Udupi district: A study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a major cause of death and disability globally. There is increasing evidence that demonstrates clinically relevant benefits from self-monitoring and self-management of blood pressure. Evidence suggests a reduction of systolic BP by 3.2 mm/hg through self-monitoring. The use of mHealth applications in health care monitoring and self-management can help in the timely delivery of health information. Around 33% of Indians use mHealth applications in their daily life. However, well-designed, user complied mHealth applications are essential to reach the masses and to be effective. A previously conducted study in India demonstrated that applications are not customized according to users' needs and expectations and lacked usability assessment by patients. Therefore, we aimed to develop and test a novel mHealth application on remote monitoring and self-management in hypertension. Methods: The study will be carried out in three phases. The first phase will be an in-depth interview to identify the required parameters to develop a customized mHealth android-based application to monitor hypertension. The second phase is to develop the customized application through the Agile development design using the android studio platform. In the third phase, a community-based cluster randomized trial will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention on the remote monitoring and self-management of people with hypertension. A sample of 236 people from 12 villages will be randomized and the mHealth application will be delivered to the intervention group and the standard regimen will be continued in the control group. Results: In the proposed study if the intervention is found to be helpful, then hypertension patients in the community can be encouraged to install the mHealth application. This application, if found effective can improve the health status, knowledge, and self-care approach among hypertensive patients. Registration: CTR India (CTRI/2022/03/041544).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Efficient inference and identifiability analysis for differential equation models with random parameters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander P. Browning, Christopher Drovandi, Ian W. Turner, Adrianne L. Jenner, Matthew J. Simpson</p>

Heterogeneity is a dominant factor in the behaviour of many biological processes. Despite this, it is common for mathematical and statistical analyses to ignore biological heterogeneity as a source of variability in experimental data. Therefore, methods for exploring the identifiability of models that explicitly incorporate heterogeneity through variability in model parameters are relatively underdeveloped. We develop a new likelihood-based framework, based on moment matching, for inference and identifiability analysis of differential equation models that capture biological heterogeneity through parameters that vary according to probability distributions. As our novel method is based on an approximate likelihood function, it is highly flexible; we demonstrate identifiability analysis using both a frequentist approach based on profile likelihood, and a Bayesian approach based on Markov-chain Monte Carlo. Through three case studies, we demonstrate our method by providing a didactic guide to inference and identifiability analysis of hyperparameters that relate to the statistical moments of model parameters from independent observed data. Our approach has a computational cost comparable to analysis of models that neglect heterogeneity, a significant improvement over many existing alternatives. We demonstrate how analysis of random parameter models can aid better understanding of the sources of heterogeneity from biological data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of path information in visual perception of joint stiffness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by A. Michael West Jr., Meghan E. Huber, Neville Hogan</p>

Humans have an astonishing ability to extract hidden information from the movement of others. In previous work, subjects observed the motion of a simulated stick-figure, two-link planar arm and estimated its stiffness. Fundamentally, stiffness is the relation between force and displacement. Given that subjects were unable to physically interact with the simulated arm, they were forced to make their estimates solely based on observed kinematic information. Remarkably, subjects were able to correctly correlate their stiffness estimates with changes in the simulated stiffness, despite the lack of force information. We hypothesized that subjects were only able to do this because the controller used to produce the simulated arm’s movement, composed of oscillatory motions driving mechanical impedances, resembled the controller humans use to produce their own movement. However, it is still unknown what motion features subjects used to estimate stiffness. Human motion exhibits systematic velocity-curvature patterns, and it has previously been shown that these patterns play an important role in perceiving and interpreting motion. Thus, we hypothesized that manipulating the velocity profile should affect subjects’ ability to estimate stiffness. To test this, we changed the velocity profile of the simulated two-link planar arm while keeping the simulated joint paths the same. Even with manipulated velocity signals, subjects were still able to estimate changes in simulated joint stiffness. However, when subjects were shown the same simulated path with different velocity profiles, they perceived motions that followed a veridical velocity profile to be less stiff than that of a non-veridical profile. These results suggest that path information (displacement) predominates over temporal information (velocity) when humans use visual observation to estimate stiffness.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inference of B cell clonal families using heavy/light chain pairing information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Duncan K. Ralph, Frederick A. Matsen IV</p>

Next generation sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires has become a ubiquitous tool for understanding the antibody-mediated immune response: it is now common to have large volumes of sequence data coding for both the heavy and light chain subunits of the BCR. However, until the recent development of high throughput methods of preserving heavy/light chain pairing information, these samples contained no explicit information on which heavy chain sequence pairs with which light chain sequence. One of the first steps in analyzing such BCR repertoire samples is grouping sequences into clonally related families, where each stems from a single rearrangement event. Many methods of accomplishing this have been developed, however, none so far has taken full advantage of the newly-available pairing information. This information can dramatically improve clustering performance, especially for the light chain. The light chain has traditionally been challenging for clonal family inference because of its low diversity and consequent abundance of non-clonal families with indistinguishable naive rearrangements. Here we present a method of incorporating this pairing information into the clustering process in order to arrive at a more accurate partition of the data into clonally related families. We also demonstrate two methods of fixing imperfect pairing information, which may allow for simplified sample preparation and increased sequencing depth. Finally, we describe several other improvements to the <i>partis</i> software package.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The geometry of representational drift in natural and artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kyle Aitken, Marina Garrett, Shawn Olsen, Stefan Mihalas</p>

Neurons in sensory areas encode/represent stimuli. Surprisingly, recent studies have suggested that, even during persistent performance, these representations are not stable and change over the course of days and weeks. We examine stimulus representations from fluorescence recordings across hundreds of neurons in the visual cortex using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and we corroborate previous studies finding that such representations change as experimental trials are repeated across days. This phenomenon has been termed “representational drift”. In this study we geometrically characterize the properties of representational drift in the primary visual cortex of mice in two open datasets from the Allen Institute and propose a potential mechanism behind such drift. We observe representational drift both for passively presented stimuli, as well as for stimuli which are behaviorally relevant. Across experiments, the drift differs from in-session variance and most often occurs along directions that have the most in-class variance, leading to a significant turnover in the neurons used for a given representation. Interestingly, despite this significant change due to drift, linear classifiers trained to distinguish neuronal representations show little to no degradation in performance across days. The features we observe in the neural data are similar to properties of artificial neural networks where representations are updated by continual learning in the presence of dropout, i.e. a random masking of nodes/weights, but not other types of noise. Therefore, we conclude that a potential reason for the representational drift in biological networks is driven by an underlying dropout-like noise while continuously learning and that such a mechanism may be computational advantageous for the brain in the same way it is for artificial neural networks, e.g. preventing overfitting.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Experimental validation of computerised models of clustering of platelet glycoprotein receptors that signal via tandem SH2 domain proteins</a></h4>

The clustering of platelet glycoprotein receptors with cytosolic YxxL and YxxM motifs, including GPVI, CLEC-2 and PEAR1, triggers activation via phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residues and recruitment of the tandem SH2 (Src homology 2) domain effector proteins, Syk and PI 3-kinase. We have modelled the clustering of these receptors with monovalent, divalent and tetravalent soluble ligands and with transmembrane ligands based on the law of mass action using ordinary differential equations and agent-based modelling. The models were experimentally evaluated in platelets and transfected cell lines using monovalent and multivalent ligands, including novel nanobody-based divalent and tetravalent ligands, by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Ligand valency, receptor number, receptor dimerisation, receptor phosphorylation and a cytosolic tandem SH2 domain protein act in synergy to drive receptor clustering. Threshold concentrations of a CLEC-2-blocking antibody and Syk inhibitor act in synergy to block platelet aggregation. This offers a strategy for countering the effect of avidity of multivalent ligands and in limiting off-target effects.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computational modeling approach for predicting multicell spheroid patterns based on signaling-induced differential adhesion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nikita Sivakumar, Helen V. Warner, Shayn M. Peirce, Matthew J. Lazzara</p>

Physiological and pathological processes including embryogenesis and tumorigenesis rely on the ability of individual cells to work collectively to form multicell patterns. In these heterogeneous multicell systems, cell-cell signaling induces differential adhesion between cells that leads to tissue-level patterning. However, the sensitivity of pattern formation to changes in the strengths of signaling or cell adhesion processes is not well understood. Prior work has explored these issues using synthetically engineered heterogeneous multicell spheroid systems, in which cell subpopulations engage in bidirectional intercellular signaling to regulate the expression of different cadherins. While engineered cell systems provide excellent experimental tools to observe pattern formation in cell populations, computational models of these systems may be leveraged to explore more systematically how specific combinations of signaling and adhesion parameters can drive the emergence of unique patterns. We developed and validated two- and three-dimensional agent-based models (ABMs) of spheroid patterning for previously described cells engineered with a bidirectional signaling circuit that regulates N- and P-cadherin expression. Systematic exploration of model predictions, some of which were experimentally validated, revealed how cell seeding parameters, the order of signaling events, probabilities of induced cadherin expression, and homotypic adhesion strengths affect pattern formation. Unsupervised clustering was also used to map combinations of signaling and adhesion parameters to these unique spheroid patterns predicted by the ABM. Finally, we demonstrated how the model may be deployed to design new synthetic cell signaling circuits based on a desired final multicell pattern.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Attentional enhancement predicts individual differences in visual working memory under go/no-go search conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Tay, John J. McDonald</p>

Attention-control processes transfer relevant information to visual working memory (WM) and prevent irrelevant information from consuming WM resources. Although event-related potentials (ERPs) have revealed attention-control processes associated with enhancement of relevant stimuli (targets) and suppression of irrelevant stimuli (distractors), only the suppressive processes have been found to predict WM capacity. We hypothesised a link between target-enhancement processes and WM capacity would be revealed in a task that requires more control than the conventional visual search paradigms used to study target selection. Here, participants searched for a pop-out target on Go trials and withheld responses on an equal number of randomly intermixed No-Go trials, depending on the colour of the stimulus array. Magnitudes of ERP indices associated with target enhancement (the singleton detection positivity (SDP) and N2pc) were positively correlated with individual differences in WM capacity. These relationships vanished when participants searched for the pop-out target on every trial, regardless of stimulus-array colour. Inhibitory processes associated with suppressing distractors (P<sub>D</sub>) and withholding responses (no-go P3) on No-Go trials did not predict WM capacity. These findings indicate that target-enhancement mechanisms control access to WM in search tasks that require dynamic control and disconfirm the view that the gateway to WM is entirely inhibitory by nature.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Mycobacterium tuberculosis PE15/PPE20 complex transports calcium across the outer membrane</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vishant Boradia, Andrew Frando, Christoph Grundner</p>

The mechanisms by which nutrients traverse the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) outer membrane remain mostly unknown and, in the absence of classical porins, likely involve specialized transport systems. Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are an important nutrient and serve as a second messenger in eukaryotes, but whether bacteria have similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling systems is not well understood. To understand the basis for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport and signaling in <i>Mtb</i>, we determined <i>Mtb’s</i> transcriptional response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Overall, only few genes changed expression, suggesting a limited role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a transcriptional regulator. However, 2 of the most strongly down-regulated genes were the <i>pe15</i> and <i>ppe20</i> genes that code for members of a large family of proteins that localize to the outer membrane and comprise many intrinsically disordered proteins. PE15 and PPE20 formed a complex and PPE20 directly bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-associated phenotypes such as increased ATP consumption and biofilm formation were reversed in a <i>pe15/ppe20</i> knockout (KO) strain, suggesting a direct role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. To test whether the PE15/PPE20 complex has a role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport across the outer membrane, we created a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter strain. A <i>pe15/ppe20</i> KO in the FRET background showed a specific and selective loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that was dependent on the presence of an intact outer cell wall. These data show that PE15/PPE20 form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein complex that selectively imports Ca<sup>2+</sup>, show a distinct transport function for an intrinsically disordered protein, and support the emerging idea of a general family-wide role of PE/PPE proteins as idiosyncratic transporters across the outer membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Posteromedial thalamic nucleus activity significantly contributes to perceptual discrimination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jia Qi, Changquan Ye, Shovan Naskar, Ana R. Inácio, Soohyun Lee</p>

Higher-order sensory thalamic nuclei are densely connected with multiple cortical and subcortical areas, yet the role of these nuclei remains elusive. The posteromedial (POm) thalamic nucleus, the higher-order thalamic nucleus in the rodent somatosensory system, is an anatomical hub broadly connected with multiple sensory and motor brain areas yet weakly responds to passive sensory stimulation and whisker movements. To understand the role of POm in sensory perception, we developed a self-initiated, two-alternative forced-choice task in freely moving mice during active sensing. Using optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation, we show that POm thalamic nucleus plays a significant role in sensory perception and the projection from the primary somatosensory cortex to POm is critical for the contribution of POm in sensory perception during active sensing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Whole-genome scanning reveals environmental selection mechanisms that shape diversity in populations of the epipelagic diatom Chaetoceros</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charlotte Nef, Mohammed-Amin Madoui, Éric Pelletier, Chris Bowler</p>

Diatoms form a diverse and abundant group of photosynthetic protists that are essential players in marine ecosystems. However, the microevolutionary structure of their populations remains poorly understood, particularly in polar regions. Exploring how closely related diatoms adapt to different environments is essential given their short generation times, which may allow rapid adaptations, and their prevalence in marine regions dramatically impacted by climate change, such as the Arctic and Southern Oceans. Here, we address genetic diversity patterns in <i>Chaetoceros</i>, the most abundant diatom genus and one of the most diverse, using 11 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) reconstructed from <i>Tara</i> Oceans metagenomes. Genome-resolved metagenomics on these MAGs confirmed a prevalent distribution of <i>Chaetoceros</i> in the Arctic Ocean with lower dispersal in the Pacific and Southern Oceans as well as in the Mediterranean Sea. Single-nucleotide variants identified within the different MAG populations allowed us to draw a landscape of <i>Chaetoceros</i> genetic diversity and revealed an elevated genetic structure in some Arctic Ocean populations. Gene flow patterns of closely related <i>Chaetoceros</i> populations seemed to correlate with distinct abiotic factors rather than with geographic distance. We found clear positive selection of genes involved in nutrient availability responses, in particular for iron (e.g., ISIP2a, flavodoxin), silicate, and phosphate (e.g., polyamine synthase), that were further supported by analysis of <i>Chaetoceros</i> transcriptomes. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of environmental selection in shaping diatom diversity patterns and provide new insights into their metapopulation genomics through the integration of metagenomic and environmental data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A single N6-methyladenosine site regulates lncRNA HOTAIR function in breast cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Allison M. Porman, Justin T. Roberts, Emily D. Duncan, Madeline L. Chrupcala, Ariel A. Levine, Michelle A. Kennedy, Michelle M. Williams, Jennifer K. Richer, Aaron M. Johnson</p>

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA regulates normal and cancer biology, but knowledge of its function on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) remains limited. Here, we reveal that m6A regulates the breast cancer-associated human lncRNA HOTAIR. Mapping m6A in breast cancer cell lines, we identify multiple m6A sites on HOTAIR, with 1 single consistently methylated site (A783) that is critical for HOTAIR-driven proliferation and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Methylated A783 interacts with the m6A “reader” YTHDC1, promoting chromatin association of HOTAIR, proliferation and invasion of TNBC cells, and gene repression. A783U mutant HOTAIR induces a unique antitumor gene expression profile and displays loss-of-function and antimorph behaviors by impairing and, in some cases, causing opposite gene expression changes induced by wild-type (WT) HOTAIR. Our work demonstrates how modification of 1 base in an lncRNA can elicit a distinct gene regulation mechanism and drive cancer-associated phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The dynamics and determinants of specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in three adult cohorts in the Ecuadorian Andes: a study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: There are limited longitudinal data on the systemic and mucosal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 from Latin America, a region severely affected by COVID-19, and where vaccine strategies have been implemented during the evolving pandemic. Objective: To evaluate determinants of seroprevalence and changes in levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies longitudinally in adults with different levels of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (defined a priori as low, medium, and high based on presumed occupational risk), in two Andean cities in Ecuador. Methods: Longitudinal cohort study of 1,000 adults aged 18 years and older with questionnaire data and sample collection done at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months during the period 2020-2023. Observations collected included WHO-ISARIC questionnaire and peripheral blood and saliva samples for measurement of IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively.  Planned analyses are tailored to the longitudinal nature of the outcomes defined by participants’ antibody levels and aim at estimating their average trends with time since infection in each of the occupational groups, adjusted for demographics and calendar-time levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population. The latter reflect the impact of the national control measures such as vaccinations and movement restrictions. Importance: Understanding the duration and the dynamics of waning immunity to SARS-CoV-2, in the context of exposures to emerging virus variants and immunization, will inform the implementation of targeted public health strategies in the Latin American region. Ethics and Dissemination: This study will observe the bioethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent will be obtained. Samples from participants will be stored for up to three years after which they will be destroyed. The study protocol was approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health Ethics Committee for COVID-19 Research. Antibody results will be provided to participants and participating institutions and to the national health authorities.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Novel Neural Network Biomarker of Botulinum Toxin Efficacy in Isolated Dystonia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated dystonia is characterized by abnormal, often painful, postures and repetitive movements due to sustained or intermittent involuntary muscle contractions. Botulinum toxin (BoTX) injections into the affected muscles are the first line of therapy. However, there are no objective predictive markers or standardized tests of BoTX efficacy that can be utilized for appropriate candidate selection prior to treatment initiation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed a deep learning algorithm, DystoniaBoTXNet, which uses a 3D convolutional neural network architecture and raw structural brain MRI to automatically discover and test a neural network biomarker of BoTX efficacy in 284 patients with four different forms of focal dystonia, including laryngeal dystonia, blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, and writer's cramp.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DystoniaBoTXNet identified clusters in superior parietal, inferior/middle frontal, middle orbital gyrus, inferior temporal cortices, corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and anterior thalamic radiation as components of the treatment biomarker. These regions are known to contribute to both dystonia pathophysiology across a broad clinical spectrum of disorder and the central effects of botulinum toxin treatment. Based on its biomarker, DystoniaBoTXNet achieved an overall accuracy of 96.3%, with 100% sensitivity and 86.1% specificity, in predicting BoTX efficacy in patients with isolated dystonia. The algorithmic decision was computed in 19.2 sec per case.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DystoniaBoTXNet and its treatment biomarker have a high translational potential as an objective, accurate, generalizable, fast, and cost-effective algorithmic platform for enhancing clinical decision-making for BoTX treatment in patients with isolated dystonia.</p>

<p>The moderate to strong associations between gene and protein expression for CB1 receptor in the human brain were observed and we produced the density atlas map of CB1 receptor for the first time in the human brain.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We aimed to integrate genomic mapping from brain mRNA atlas with the protein expression from positron emission tomography (PET) scans of type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor and to compare the predictive power of CB1 receptor with those of other neuroreceptor/transporters using a meta-analysis. Volume of distribution (<i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub>) from F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans, CNR1 gene (Cannabinoid receptor 1) expression, and H3-CP55940 binding were calculated and correlation analysis was performed. Between <i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub> of F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA expression, moderate strength of correlation was observed (<i>rho</i> = .5067, <i>p</i> = .0337). Strong positive correlation was also found between CNR1 mRNA expression and H3-CP55940 binding (<i>r</i> = .6336, <i>p</i> = .0364), validating the finding between F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and CNR1 mRNA. The correlation between <i>V</i>
<sub>
   <i>T</i>
</sub> of F18-FMPEP-d2 PET scans and H3-CP55940 binding was marginally significant (<i>r</i> = .5025, <i>p</i> = .0563). From the meta-analysis, the correlation coefficient between mRNA expression and protein expressions ranged from −.10 to .99, with a pooled effect of .76. In conclusion, we observed the moderate to strong associations between gene and protein expression for CB1 receptor in the human brain, which was validated by autoradiography. We combined the autoradiographic finding with PET of CB1 receptor, producing the density atlas map of CB1 receptor. From the meta-analysis, the moderate to strong correlation was observed between mRNA expression and protein expressions across multiple genes. Further study is needed to investigate the relationship between multiple genes and in vivo proteins to improve and accelerate drug development.</p>
