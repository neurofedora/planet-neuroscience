              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18361">Task-Optimized Convolutional Recurrent Networks Align with Tactile Processing in the Rodent Brain</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensing remains far less understood in neuroscience and less effective in artificial systems compared to more mature modalities such as vision and language. We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy.
  For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19009">Capturing Aperiodic Temporal Dynamics of EEG Signals through Stochastic Fluctuation Modeling</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrophysiological brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), exhibit both periodic and aperiodic components, with the latter often modeled as 1/f noise and considered critical to cognitive and neurological processes. Although various theoretical frameworks have been proposed to account for aperiodic activity, its scale-invariant and long-range temporal dependency remain insufficiently explained. Drawing on neural fluctuation theory, we propose a novel framework that parameterizes intrinsic stochastic neural fluctuations to account for aperiodic dynamics. Within this framework, we introduce two key parameters-self-similarity and scale factor-to characterize these fluctuations. Our findings reveal that EEG fluctuations exhibit self-similar and non-stable statistical properties, challenging the assumptions of conventional stochastic models in neural dynamical modeling. Furthermore, the proposed parameters enable the reconstruction of EEG-like signals that faithfully replicate the aperiodic spectrum, including the characteristic 1/f spectral profile, and long range dependency. By linking structured neural fluctuations to empirically observed aperiodic EEG activity, this work offers deeper mechanistic insights into brain dynamics, resulting in a more robust biomarker candidate than the traditional 1/f slope, and provides a computational methodology for generating biologically plausible neurophysiological signals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19879">The Study of Human Preference Based on Integrated Analysis of N1 and LPP Components</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human preference research is a significant domain in psychology and psychophysiology, with broad applications in psychiatric evaluation and daily life quality enhancement. This study explores the neural mechanisms of human preference judgments through the analysis of event-related potentials (ERPs), specifically focusing on the early N1 component and the late positive potential (LPP). Using a mixed-image dataset covering items such as hats, fruits, snacks, scarves, drinks, and pets, we elicited a range of emotional responses from participants while recording their brain activity via EEG. Our work innovatively combines the N1 and LPP components to reveal distinct patterns across different preference levels. The N1 component, particularly in frontal regions, showed increased amplitude for preferred items, indicating heightened early visual attention. Similarly, the LPP component exhibited larger amplitudes for both preferred and non-preferred items, reflecting deeper emotional engagement and cognitive evaluation. In addition, we introduced a relationship model that integrates these ERP components to assess the intensity and direction of preferences, providing a novel method for interpreting EEG data in the context of emotional responses. These findings offer valuable insights into the cognitive and emotional processes underlying human preferences and present new possibilities for brain-computer interface applications, personalized marketing, and product design.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20027">Multi-modal brain encoding models for multi-modal stimuli</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.20027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20029">Correlating instruction-tuning (in multimodal models) with vision-language processing (in the brain)</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.20029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models, though not explicitly trained to mimic brain recordings, have demonstrated surprising alignment with brain activity. Progress in these models-through increased size, instruction-tuning, and multimodality-has led to better representational alignment with neural data. Recently, a new class of instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged, showing remarkable zero-shot capabilities in open-ended multimodal vision tasks. However, it is unknown whether MLLMs, when prompted with natural instructions, lead to better brain alignment and effectively capture instruction-specific representations. To address this, we first investigate brain alignment, i.e., measuring the degree of predictivity of neural visual activity using text output response embeddings from MLLMs as participants engage in watching natural scenes. Experiments with 10 different instructions show that MLLMs exhibit significantly better brain alignment than vision-only models and perform comparably to non-instruction-tuned multimodal models like CLIP. We also find that while these MLLMs are effective at generating high-quality responses suitable to the task-specific instructions, not all instructions are relevant for brain alignment. Further, by varying instructions, we make the MLLMs encode instruction-specific visual concepts related to the input image. This analysis shows that MLLMs effectively capture count-related and recognition-related concepts, demonstrating strong alignment with brain activity. Notably, the majority of the explained variance of the brain encoding models is shared between MLLM embeddings of image captioning and other instructions. These results suggest that enhancing MLLMs' ability to capture task-specific information could lead to better differentiation between various types of instructions, and thereby improving their precision in predicting brain responses.

                arXiv:2307.15239v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pupil dynamics and fixational eye movements are primarily involuntary processes that actively support visual perception during fixations. Both measures are known to be sensitive to ongoing cognitive and affective processing. In a visual fixation experiment (N=116) we demonstrate that self-recognition, familiar faces, and unfamiliar faces elicit specific responses in pupil dynamics and microsaccade rate. First, the pupil response comprises an immediate pupil constriction followed by a dilation in response to stimulus onsets. We observe attenuated constriction and greater dilation when faces are recognized compared to unknown faces. This effect is strongest for one's own face. Second, microsaccade rates, which generally show inhibitory responses to incoming stimuli, generate stronger inhibition for familiar faces compared to unknown faces. Again, the strongest inhibition is observed in response to one's own face. Our results imply that eye-related physiological measures expose hidden knowledge in face memory and could contribute to biometric authentication and identity validation procedures.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08201">Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.08201v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03458">The classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment improved by dynamic functional network analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.03458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain network analysis using functional MRI has advanced our understanding of cortical activity and its changes in neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia. Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic (time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal information on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach has been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age- and sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol. We examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing the Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for time-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess between-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the HE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level, significant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable (stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the white matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while metastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the amygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis showed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature. Our results highlight shared and unique functional connectivity patterns in both stationary and dynamic functional networks, emphasising the need to include dynamic information in brain network analysis in studies of Alzheimer's spectrum.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11941">Bayesian Dynamical Modeling of Fixational Eye Movements</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2303.11941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans constantly move their eyes, even during visual fixations, where miniature (or fixational) eye movements occur involuntarily. Fixational eye movements comprise slow components (physiological drift and tremor) and fast components (microsaccades). The complex dynamics of physiological drift can be modeled qualitatively as a statistically self-avoiding random walk (SAW model, Engbert, Mergenthaler, Sinn, & Pikovsky, 2011). In this study, we implement a data assimilation approach for the SAW model to explain statistics of fixational eye movements and microsaccades in experimental data obtained from high-resolution eye-tracking. We discuss and analyze the likelihood function for the SAW model, which allows us to apply Bayesian parameter estimation at the level of individual human observers. Based on model fitting, we find a relationship between the activation predicted by the SAW model and the occurrence of microsaccades. The model's latent activation relative to microsaccade onsets and offsets using experimental data lends support to the existence of a triggering mechanism for microsaccades. Our findings suggest that the SAW model can capture individual differences and serve as a tool for exploring the relationship between physiological drift and microsaccades as the two most essential components of fixational eye movements. Our results contribute to understanding individual variability in microsaccade behaviors and the role of fixational eye movements in visual information processing.

                arXiv:2504.20588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency response function (FRF) is an established way to describe the outcome of experiments in posture control literature. The FRF is an empirical transfer function between an input stimulus and the induced body segment sway profile, represented as a vector of complex values associated with a vector of frequencies. For this reason, testing the components of the FRF independently with Bonferroni correction can result in a too-conservative approach. Performing statistics on scalar values defined on the FRF, e.g., comparing the averages, implies an arbitrary decision by the experimenter. This work proposes bootstrap prediction and confidence bands as general methods to evaluate the outcome of posture control experiments, overcoming the foretold limitations of previously used approaches.

                arXiv:2505.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a learning-to-evolve framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: code bloat and a lack of semantic guidance. Bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, and the absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: bloat control and a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.

Abstract: Cognitive control refers to the ability to flexibly coordinate thought and action in pursuit of internal goals. A standard method for assessing cognitive control involves conflict tasks that contrast congruent and incongruent trials, measuring the ability to prioritize relevant information while suppressing interference. We evaluate 108 vision-language models on three classic conflict tasks and their more demanding "squared" variants across 2,220 trials. Model performance corresponds closely to human behavior under resource constraints and reveals individual differences. These results indicate that some form of human-like executive function have emerged in current multi-modal foundational models.

Abstract: It is well known that anti-malware scanners depend on malware signatures to identify malware. However, even minor modifications to malware code structure results in a change in the malware signature thus enabling the variant to evade detection by scanners. Therefore, there exists the need for a proactively generated malware variant dataset to aid detection of such diverse variants by automated antivirus scanners. This paper proposes and demonstrates a generic assembly source code based framework that facilitates any evolutionary algorithm to generate diverse and potential variants of an input malware, while retaining its maliciousness, yet capable of evading antivirus scanners. Generic code transformation functions and a novelty search supported quality metric have been proposed as components of the framework to be used respectively as variation operators and fitness function, for evolutionary algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in generating diverse variants and the generated variants have been shown to evade over 98% of popular antivirus scanners. The malware variants evolved by the framework can serve as antigens to assist malware analysis engines to improve their malware detection algorithms.

                arXiv:2505.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to boost the efficiency and scalability of Evolutionary Rule-based machine Learning (ERL), a key technique in explainable AI. While traditional ERL systems can distribute processes across multiple CPUs, fitness evaluation of candidate rules is a bottleneck, especially with large datasets. The method proposed in this paper, AERL (Accelerated ERL) solves this problem in two ways. First, by adopting GPU-optimized rule sets through a tensorized representation within the PyTorch framework, AERL mitigates the bottleneck and accelerates fitness evaluation significantly. Second, AERL takes further advantage of the GPUs by fine-tuning the rule coefficients via back-propagation, thereby improving search space exploration. Experimental evidence confirms that AERL search is faster and more effective, thus empowering explainable artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2410.19580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With growing environmental concerns, electric vehicles for logistics have gained significant attention within the computational intelligence community in recent years. This work addresses an emerging and significant extension of the electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP), namely EVRP with time windows, simultaneous pickup-delivery, and partial recharges (EVRP-TW-SPD), which has widespread real-world applications. We propose a hybrid memetic algorithm (HMA) for solving EVRP-TW-SPD. HMA incorporates two novel components: a parallel-sequential station insertion (PSSI) procedure for handling partial recharges that can better avoid local optima compared to purely sequential insertion, and a cross-domain neighborhood search (CDNS) that explores solution spaces of both electric and non-electric problem domains simultaneously. These components can also be easily applied to various EVRP variants. To bridge the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world scenarios, we introduce a new, large-scale EVRP-TW-SPD benchmark set derived from real-world applications, containing instances with many more customers and charging stations than existing benchmark instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance advantages of HMA over existing algorithms across a wide range of problem instances. Both the benchmark set and HMA are to be made open-source to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as a brain-inspired and energy-efficient network, is currently facing the pivotal challenge of exploring a suitable and efficient learning framework. The predominant training methodologies, namely Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) and ANN-SNN Conversion, are encumbered by substantial training overhead or pronounced inference latency, which impedes the advancement of SNNs in scaling to larger networks and navigating intricate application domains. In this work, we propose a novel parallel conversion learning framework, which establishes a mathematical mapping relationship between each time-step of the parallel spiking neurons and the cumulative spike firing rate. We theoretically validate the lossless and sorting properties of the conversion process, as well as pointing out the optimal shifting distance for each step. Furthermore, by integrating the above framework with the distribution-aware error calibration technique, we can achieve efficient conversion towards more general activation functions or training-free circumstance. Extensive experiments have confirmed the significant performance advantages of our method for various conversion cases under ultra-low time latency. To our best knowledge, this is the first work which jointly utilizes parallel spiking calculation and ANN-SNN Conversion, providing a highly promising approach for SNN supervised training. Code is available at https://github.com/hzc1208/Parallel_Conversion.

                arXiv:2504.17751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks. From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps. To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However, applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to different evolutionary computation methods.

                arXiv:2411.07120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two complementary techniques for efficient optimization that reduce memory requirements while accelerating training of large-scale neural networks. The first technique, Subset-Norm step size, generalizes AdaGrad-Norm and AdaGrad(-Coordinate) through step-size sharing. Subset-Norm (SN) reduces AdaGrad's memory footprint from $O(d)$ to $O(\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is the model size. For non-convex smooth objectives under coordinate-wise sub-gaussian noise, we show a noise-adapted high-probability convergence guarantee with improved dimensional dependence of SN over existing methods. Our second technique, Subspace-Momentum, reduces the momentum state's memory footprint by restricting momentum to a low-dimensional subspace while performing SGD in the orthogonal complement. We prove a high-probability convergence result for Subspace-Momentum under standard assumptions. Empirical evaluation on pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods. For instance, combining Subset-Norm with Subspace-Momentum achieves Adam's validation perplexity for LLaMA 1B in approximately half the training tokens (6.8B vs 13.1B) while reducing Adam's optimizer-states memory footprint by more than 80\% with minimal additional hyperparameter tuning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03806">Perception-Informed Neural Networks: Beyond Physics-Informed Neural Networks</a></h4>

Abstract: This article introduces Perception-Informed Neural Networks (PrINNs), a framework designed to incorporate perception-based information into neural networks, addressing both systems with known and unknown physics laws or differential equations. Moreover, PrINNs extend the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their variants, offering a platform for the integration of diverse forms of perception precisiation, including singular, probability distribution, possibility distribution, interval, and fuzzy graph. In fact, PrINNs allow neural networks to model dynamical systems by integrating expert knowledge and perception-based information through loss functions, enabling the creation of modern data-driven models. Some of the key contributions include Mixture of Experts Informed Neural Networks (MOEINNs), which combine heterogeneous expert knowledge into the network, and Transformed-Knowledge Informed Neural Networks (TKINNs), which facilitate the incorporation of meta-information for enhanced model performance. Additionally, Fuzzy-Informed Neural Networks (FINNs) as a modern class of fuzzy deep neural networks leverage fuzzy logic constraints within a deep learning architecture, allowing online training without pre-training and eliminating the need for defuzzification. PrINNs represent a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional physics-based modeling and modern data-driven approaches, enabling neural networks to learn from both structured physics laws and flexible perception-based rules. This approach empowers neural networks to operate in uncertain environments, model complex systems, and discover new forms of differential equations, making PrINNs a powerful tool for advancing computational science and engineering.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13525">Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103328">An antisense oligonucleotide-based strategy to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Adults and children with the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome demonstrate cognitive, social, and emotional impairments and high risk for schizophrenia. Work in mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion provided compelling evidence for abnormal expression and processing of microRNAs. A major transcriptional effect of the microRNA dysregulation is upregulation of <i>Emc10,</i> a component of the ER membrane complex, which promotes membrane insertion of a subset of polytopic and tail-anchored membrane proteins. We previously uncovered a key contribution of EMC10 in mediating the behavioral phenotypes observed in 22q11.2 deletion mouse models. Here, we show that expression and processing of miRNAs is abnormal and <i>EMC10</i> expression is elevated in neurons derived from 22q11.2 deletion carriers. Reduction of <i>EMC10 levels</i> restores defects in neurite outgrowth and calcium signaling in patient neurons. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotide administration and normalization of <i>Emc10</i> in the adult mouse brain not only alleviates cognitive deficits in social and spatial memory but remarkably sustains these improvements for over 2 months post-injection, indicating its therapeutic potential. Broadly, our study integrates findings from both animal models and human neurons to elucidate the translational potential of modulating <i>EMC10</i> levels and downstream targets as a specific venue to ameliorate disease progression in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.

">GABA-induced Ca2+ signaling in the primary cilium of neurons</a></h4>

              
                The complex signaling processing in neurons requires establishment of autonomous compartments. The compartment that is unique for neurons and crucial for neuron-neuron signaling is the synapse. Another compartment, that neurons share with all other cells in the body, is the primary cilium. The primary cilium is a solitary organelle, present in almost every neuronal cell type, that extends into the extracellular space for detection of signals. Several GPCRs have been identified as ciliary receptors, and here we show that the metabotropic GABA receptor subtype 1 localizes to primary cilia of neurons across different regions of the mouse brain and that activation of these receptors initiates Ca2+ signaling that is restricted to this organelle. The excitatory nature of GABAergic signaling in primary cilia is opposite to GABA action in other neuronal domains, indicating distinct modes of action of this universal inhibitory neurotransmitter even within the same neuron.

">Differential contributions of low-frequency phase and power in crossmodal temporal prediction: A MEG study</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Our representation of time is embedded within multisensory perception, based on sight, sound, or touch. However, despite being a crucial aspect of daily life, the neural dynamics of cross-modal temporal predictions remain elusive. The objective of this study was to investigate neural correlates of tactile-to-visual influences on temporal prediction using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We hypothesized to observe increased inter-trial phase consistency (ITPC) in the low-frequency delta range (0.5-4 Hz) due to their involvement in temporal prediction. In addition, stronger ITPC values should correlate with a steeper slope of the psychometric function, indicating phase alignments as a likely cause of more consistent temporal predictions. Methods The study was conducted within one MEG session where participants (N=23) carried out a temporal prediction task. Participants observed a visual stimulus moving towards an occluder. Shortly before reaching the occluder, the visual stimulus faded in luminance to make the visual offset less informative. Instead, participants received a brief tactile stimulus to the ipsilateral hand at the time point of disappearance, generating a temporal expectation regarding its reappearance on the opposite side of the occluder. After variable time intervals, a visual stimulus reappeared, and participants had to indicate whether this was too early or too late compared to the movement before disappearance. A non-predictive control condition involved participants judging the variable luminance of the reappearing visual stimulus compared to its initial luminance at the beginning of the trial. Psychometric curves were fitted to the behavioral data of each participant and condition, and MEG recordings were analyzed using time-frequency representations obtained by wavelet convolution. To compare spectral power and ITPC estimates between conditions within frequency bands showing significant differences to the pre-stimulus baseline, we used cluster-based permutation statistics. Pearson's correlations were used to examine the relationship between ITPC or power estimates and the steepness of each participant's psychometric function. Results ITPC analysis revealed strong increases in the delta range around stimulus disappearance and reappearance. Delta ITPC was significantly stronger during temporal prediction compared to the control condition. Clusters included sensors from right temporal and frontal regions, contralaterally to the visuo-tactile stimulus presentation. Only delta ITPC, but not delta power, correlated with the consistency of temporal prediction. Furthermore, temporal prediction was associated with increased alpha power in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as the right superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus, whereas beta power did not show differences between conditions. Conclusion Our findings suggest that increased delta ITPC is likely caused by phase resets driven by the temporal prediction process. Furthermore, our findings indicate that phase alignments occur during crossmodal visuo-tactile-to-visual temporal predictions, even with a combination of non-rhythmic and discrete stimulation. This highlights the broad applicability of phase resets of neural oscillations as a mechanism for predicting timing across various types of stimuli.

">Transient effects in corticospinal and reticulospinal tract excitability induced by motor skill and isometric resistance training</a></h4>

              
                Motor skill and resistance training are commonly used in rehabilitation to enhance neural plasticity. Nonetheless, how each modality impacts the excitability of corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways controlling the lower limb remains poorly understood. Here, we tested how single 30-minute sessions of cue-paced motor skill and isometric resistance training modulate corticospinal, reticulospinal, and spinal excitability in unimpaired adults (N = 23). Using motor-evoked potentials via transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that both training types increased corticospinal excitability, with more substantial effects following motor skill training. In contrast, reticulospinal tract excitability, assessed by StartReact responses, and spinal excitability-measured by H/M ratios, F-wave response amplitude, and persistence-remained largely unchanged. These results suggest that short-term training selectively enhances corticospinal tract excitability without a measurable impact on spinal or reticulospinal circuits. This pathway-specific response may inform strategies for targeting neural plasticity in rehabilitation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Microglia exhibit complex and dynamic morphology that is linked to function. Altered microglia function has been implicated in multiple diseases of the brain, including elevated phagocytosis of neuronal dendritic spines in schizophrenia. However, understanding the relationship between altered microglia and pathophysiology first requires a clearer picture of microglia morphology in the non-diseased brain, which has yet to be fully established. Here, we deploy immunostaining and confocal microscopy to sample over 1,300 microglia from two prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions in postmortem human brain (3 males, 3 females). We use Neurolucida 360 to trace the 3-dimensional structure of these microglia and quantify interactions with dendritic spines. We find that PFC microglia in male subjects display overall more complex branching than in female subjects, and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) microglia are more complexly branched with more round somas than those in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), irrespective of sex. Furthermore, a lower proportion of phagocytic burden in sgACC microglia involves engulfment of dendritic spines compared to DLPFC. Overall, our results paint a detailed and nuanced picture of microglia morphology and function in subjects unaffected by psychiatric or neurologic illness that can be used as a benchmark for future studies of the diseased brain.</span>

">Neuronal feedback loop in the suprachiasmatic nucleus generates robust circadian rhythms</a></h4>

              
                The central circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a network consisting of various types of neurons and glial cells, but its mechanism remains elusive. Here, by monitoring cellular calcium rhythms in vivo in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-deficient mice, we show that arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons intrinsically oscillate with a short period and that VIP amplifies and delays the AVP neuronal rhythm to lengthen its period to ~24 hours. Consistently, the circadian behavior period is shortened and lengthened by VIP receptor disruption and neurotransmission blockade of AVP neurons, respectively. VIP and other neurons occasionally exhibit weak, unstable, long-period calcium rhythms only when AVP neuronal oscillation is attenuated. Together with our previous finding that AVP neurons act as the primary pacesetter cells of the SCN ensemble rhythm, our results indicate that the feedback neuronal circuit of AVP cellular oscillator and VIP peptide signaling is crucial for the robust circadian rhythm.

">The Arp2/3 complex is required for in situ haptotactic response of microglia to iC3b</a></h4>

              
                Microglia maintain brain homeostasis by performing iC3b-mediated synaptic pruning on excessive dendritic spines during neurodevelopment. Cellular interaction with iC3b is mediated by the Arp2/3 complex in other cell types, but understudied in microglia. Using a combination of in vitro and in situ physical confinement studies, we examined CR3-dependent clearance of iC3b in microglia and the role the Arp2/3 complex plays in enabling this clearance. We demonstrated Arp2/3 complex inhibition decreased phagocytosis and cell motility in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microglia-like cells are able to remove immobilized iC3b from the substrate in an Arp2/3-dependent fashion, in a process reminiscent of trogocytic synaptic pruning. We also used a novel approach to immobilize an iC3b gradient onto a substrate and demonstrate Arp2/3-dependent haptotactic migration toward increasing iC3b concentrations. Microglia demonstrate a persistent inability to stably interact with iC3b-coated beads in hippocampal slice cultures upon Arp2/3 complex inhibition. As a whole, the present study establishes new approaches to systematically interrogate molecular pathways relevant to synaptic pruning, advances the understanding of iC3b phagocytosis as a haptotactic response, and confirms that the Arp2/3-dependent haptotactic response is relevant for microglia in their normal physiological microenvironment.

">Epigenetic mechanisms governing cell type specific somatic expansion and toxicity in Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by neuronal dysfunction and degeneration that varies markedly by brain region and cell type. We previously showed that CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the mHTT gene correlates with increased expression of the mismatch repair genes MSH2 and MSH3 in striatal medium spiny neurons1, and demonstrated that, in the striatum and cerebral cortex of individuals with HD, hundreds of genes are dysregulated in neuronal cell types carrying somatically expanded CAG repeat in mHTT1,2. Here we employ comprehensive epigenetic profiling in specific neuronal and glial cell types from the human striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of control and HD donor samples to identify cell type- and species-specific transcriptional control mechanisms in the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH3 and FAN1 that can explain the specificity of somatic CAG expansion in the first stage of HD. In the second, toxic phase of HD we identify two distinct epigenetic mechanisms that disrupt regulation of hundreds of genes in the majority of HD MSNs, including several that cause haploinsufficient neurological disorders. Our data support a mechanistic model of HD pathogenesis in which regulation of mismatch repair gene transcription determines the selectivity of somatic expansion, and DNA methylation stabilizes the toxic effect of mutant huntingtin on HD-modifying proteins MED15 and TCERG1, which regulate enhancer function and transcription elongation.

">Noninvasive focal gene transfer of chemogenetic proteins in the primate brain</a></h4>

              
                The development of chemogenetic neuromodulators, including Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), have enabled focally specific, long-lasting, and reversible neuromodulation in the primate brain. Although systemically delivered synthetic ligands allow for noninvasive actuation of chemogenetic receptors, direct intraparenchymal injection remains atop the available methods to precisely deliver chemogenetic payloads to a specific target of the brain. The requirement of trephination, however, is accompanied by inherent risks of infection, long recovery times, and often tissue damage with concomitant behavioral complications. When considering therapeutic injections, the requirement of transcranial surgery does not translate well to the clinic, especially when repeated administrations are required. Here, we leverage our recent development of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) for noninvasive and focal delivery of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) carrying excitatory Gq-DREADDs to frontal cortical targets (areas 6DR and 8aD) in the marmoset brain. Using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, we demonstrate significant increases in glucose metabolism at the site of viral delivery after administering the DREADD-specific agonist deschloroclozapine (DCZ), as compared to vehicle control. Focal neuronal DREADD expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry at the site of opening. Through comparison of awake resting-state functional connectivity (whole brain connectivity with the sites of delivery) and structural connectivity (directly injected viral neuronal tracing at the sites of delivery) we demonstrate that the increase in glucose metabolism occurs at both mono- and polysynaptically connected brain regions. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability to focally deliver excitatory chemogenetics without the need for surgery, allowing for activation of long-range frontal cortex circuits of the primate brain.

">Mapping early patterning events in human neural development usingan in-vitro microfluidic stem cell model</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell models can provide insights into human brain development at embryonic stages which are normally inaccessible. We previously developed the Microfluidic Stem Cell Regionalisation (MiSTR) model, which recapitulates the rostro-caudal patterning of human neural tube through a WNT activation (WNTa) gradient. Through temporal single cell transcriptomics of rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral gradient-patterned MiSTR, we found that rostro-caudal subtypes were regionally specified and fate determined already during the late epiblast stage, several days before onset of neuralisation at day 3-4. Rostral cells were characterised by expression of HESX1 and SHISA2 during pre-neuralisation and PAX6 during early neuralisation, whereas caudal cells expressed FST and HOXA1 during pre-neuralisation and SOX1 as the dominant neuralising factor. In contrast to the early rostro-caudal specification, response to ventralisation in telencephalic progenitors was developmentally delayed and occurred around day 9. We further uncovered temporal events in human midbrain-hindbrain boundary formation and ventral forebrain patterning, contributing new knowledge on early human neural region-specification.

">Combinatorial mechanisms specify cellular location and neurotransmitter identity during regeneration of planarian neurons</a></h4>

              
                During regenerative neurogenesis, neurons must be created in the right types and locations. Though regenerative neurogenesis is limited in humans, other animals use regenerative neurogenesis to faithfully restore form and function after brain injury. Planarians are flatworms with extraordinary capacity for brain regeneration. Planarians use pluripotent stem cells to create neurons after injury, rather than resident progenitors. In this context, genetic mechanisms that produce diverse neurons with correct local identity remain unknown. Here, we report the discovery of factors important for regenerative neurogenesis of dopaminergic neurons in the planarian central, peripheral, and pharyngeal nervous systems. Distinct genes promote dopaminergic neuronal identity and instruct neurons to inhabit regions of the nervous system. Our results demonstrate that planarian neuronal fate requires factors that simultaneously direct neurotransmitter choice and regional location. Our work suggests that combinatorial direction of cell type could inform and improve exogenous stem cell therapies aimed at precisely replacing neurons.

">Task-relevant cognitive maps in episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive maps support navigation by representing locations in internal spaces with Euclidean distances. Similar organizational principles may govern the representation of non-spatial sensory and conceptual features, enabling higher cognitive functions including decision making and model-based reinforcement learning. Previous studies have shown that medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures support the embedding of stimuli into cognitive maps. However, these studies investigated the generation of novel cognitive maps, while the recruitment of existing semantic knowledge into task-relevant representational spaces and their remapping according to changing goals has not been investigated. In addition, it is not clear how the MTL interacts with neocortical representations of task-relevant stimulus features and whether this influences the formation of novel episodic memory traces. Here we show that the neural representations of natural stimuli in both MTL and neocortex are organized in behaviorally relevant cognitive maps of conceptual features and influence the accessibility of novel memory traces. Cognitive maps organize information into internal spaces with Euclidean distances, adapt to ongoing task demands, and influence performance. Their representational structure matches neural similarities in the MTL, with a specific role of the hippocampus for task-dependent remapping. Further, we isolated task-relevant and stimulus-driven representations of natural stimuli and show how they contribute to the formation of memory traces. Together, our results suggest that conceptual representations are flexibly recruited in spatially organized cognitive maps of task-relevant features and that Euclidean distances in these cognitive maps affect subsequent memory.

">Age and Alzheimer's disease affect functional connectivity along separate axes of functional brain organization</a></h4>

              
                Aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with alterations in functional connectivity (FC), yet their spatial and temporal characteristics remain debated. Whole-cortex functional gradients, which organize regions along axes of functional similarity, are positioned here as a framework for understanding such alterations. Across two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, N=973; ADNI, N=129), we demonstrate that hyper- and hypoconnectivity in both healthy aging and biomarker-confirmed AD progression coexist systematically, forming consistent spatial patterns that align with two distinct axes of brain organization. Using a combination of longitudinal and non-linear analyses, we show that the early (but not late) stages of AD pathology accumulation is associated with functional alteration along the sensory-association axis, a pattern that vanishes in later stages of AD. However, functional alteration along the sensory-association axis is associated with worse cognition throughout the AD spectrum, and even in older adults without AD pathology, suggesting that these FC patterns may reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain. Independently of AD, older age was associated with alterations instead along the executive-nonexecutive axis, a finding that was consistent throughout the adult lifespan. These findings highlight the fundamental role of intrinsic functional organization in shaping how the brain responds to aging and to AD, helping to resolve previously reported discrepancies.

">Diffusion Neuroimaging of Speech Acquisition in Infants</a></h4>

              
                We utilize diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Baby Connectome Project to longitudinally characterize white matter tract maturation across motor, auditory, visual, ventral language, and dorsal language pathways in infants from birth to 24 months of age. Our analysis reveals three primary insights into the neural basis of early speech acquisition. First, association tracts (arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus) exhibit marked immaturity at birth but undergo rapid maturation paralleling motor tracts (corticospinal and thalamo-precentral tract). By 24 months, these association tracts approach maturity levels comparable to primary sensory tracts (acoustic and optic radiation), and the maturation of these motor and association tracts consistently correlate with infants' comprehension of gesture-based phrases. Second, these rapidly maturing association tracts correlate with nearly all developmental domains, including motor skill, social interaction, emotional regulation, living skill, and speech. Conversely, complex speech behaviors correlate broadly across nearly all examined tracts, underscoring extensive neural integration characterized by nonlinear mappings between neural substrates and developmental outcomes. Third, exploratory longitudinal mediation analyses suggest an asymmetric loop of communicative interactions in early infancy: gross-motor skill indirectly facilitates speech development through enhanced social interactions; while social interaction facilitates speech development by refining fine-motor skill. Collectively, these findings highlight motor development as a major developmental driver in early infancy and advocate an integrative, experience-dependent, and dynamic model of early speech acquisition. This study points to future research avenues focused on elucidating how social interactions function as a pivotal catalyst, aligning infants' neural and behavioral development --- from spontaneous, undifferentiated actions toward socially adaptive behaviors.

">Advanced neural activity mapping in brain organoids via field potential imaging with ultra-high-density CMOS microelectrodes.</a></h4>

              
                Human iPSC-derived brain organoids and assembloids have emerged as promising in vitro models for recapitulating human brain development, neurological disorders, and drug responses. However, detailed analysis of their electrophysiological properties requires advanced measurement techniques. Here, we present a novel analytical approach utilizing ultra-high-density (UHD) CMOS microelectrode arrays (MEAs) containing 236,880 electrodes (10.52m x 10.52m each) distributed over a broad sensing area of 32.45mm 2 for field potential imaging (FPI) of brain organoids. Neuronal activity was recorded simultaneously from over 46,000 electrodes interfaced with brain organoids, allowing for the identification of single-cell firing events and the assessment of neuronal network connectivity based on individual spikes. In midbrain organoids, administration of L-DOPA revealed both excitatory and inhibitory cellular responses, with a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of excitatory responses, suggesting enhanced network connectivity. Capitalizing on the spatial and temporal resolution of UHD-CMOS-MEAs, we introduced new endpoints for network activity: propagation speed and propagation area. In cortical organoids, application of the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin led to increased propagation speed, whereas the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 resulted in a broad reduction of propagation area, along with localized increases. As FPI enables direct recording of electrical potential waveforms, frequency-domain analyses were also conducted. Spontaneous activity in cortical organoids exhibited region-specific frequency distributions, with gamma-band activity displaying distinct patterns compared to other frequency bands. Additionally, in midbrain-striatal assembloids, electrophysiological activity was observed in both regions. Connectivity analysis showed that treatment with 4-aminopyridine enhanced inter-organoid connection strength. This large-scale, single-cell-resolved recording approach using UHD-CMOS-MEAs facilitates comprehensive analysis of network connectivity, propagation velocity and propagation area, and frequency characteristics. It represents a powerful platform for advancing our understanding of the electrophysiological functions of brain organoids and assembloids, and holds significant potential for drug screening and disease modeling in human neuroscience research.

">A Forebrain Hub for Cautious Actions via the Midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive goal-directed behavior requires dynamic coordination of movement, motivation, and environmental cues. Among these, cautious actions, where animals adjust their behavior in anticipation of predictable threats, are essential for survival. Yet, their underlying neural mechanisms remain less well understood than those of appetitive behaviors. Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice, we show that glutamatergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are robustly engaged during cue-evoked avoidance and exploratory behavior, encoding both contraversive movement and cautious responding. Targeted lesions and optogenetic manipulations reveal that STN projections to the midbrain, but not to the globus pallidus, are necessary for executing cued avoidance. Moreover, the frequency of STN activation governs response timing, accelerating the initiation of goal-directed actions to the point that it becomes incompatible with passive response, without being aversive. These findings identify a critical role for the STN in orchestrating adaptive goal-directed behavior by directing timely actions via its midbrain projections.

                Acetylcholine modulates anterior cingulate (ACC) and lateral prefrontal (LPFC) cortices for cognitive-motivational integration, via specific m1-m4 muscarinic receptors (mAChR) encoded by CHRM1-4 genes. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and mRNA-protein histology in macaques revealed CHRM3 to be the most enriched mAChR gene in neurons, while m1 predominates at the protein level, likely due to nuclear retention of CHRM3 and cytoplasmic trafficking of CHRM1. CHRM3 and CHRM1 showed strong co-expression and functional overlap, and were transcriptomically-distinct from CHRM2, which was uniquely enriched in deep layer excitatory and PVALB+ inhibitory neurons. Although CHRM+ cell distributions were similar between areas, CHRM1-3+ excitatory neurons in ACC exhibited upregulation of synaptic plasticity genes relative to LPFC. Functional in vitro experiments confirm a more robust cholinergic-mediated decrease in excitatory:inhibitory synaptic ratio in ACC than in LPFC neurons, accompanied by compensatory changes in spine morphology. These findings highlight region-specific acetylcholine signaling essential for flexible processing, learning and memory.

                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to play a central role in human social perception, cognition, and behavior. In adults, the mPFC is involved in representing and interpreting the mental states in self and others. Developmental research using neuroimaging techniques like functional near-infrared spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging has begun to extend these findings into infancy. Novel evidence reviewed in this opinion demonstrates that infant mPFC (1) plays a specialized, proactive, and evaluative role in social perception, (2) is involved in connecting with other minds while interacting and when watching other minds interact, and (3) predicts overt social behavior beyond infancy. These findings suggest that, from early in human ontogeny, the mPFC plays a multifaceted role in social perception, cognition, and behavior.</p>

                Background The Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI) has been verified among a variety of populations. However, there is a lack of existing research on its comprehensive psychometric properties, specifically when used with nursing students. This study examined the WHOQOL-BREF’s unique psychometric features with Thai nursing students in northeast Thailand. Methods In this cross-sectional study, Thai nursing students were recruited using multi-stage simple random sampling from universities located in the northeast of Thailand. The data was collected via self-assessment questionnaires, and the 3,570 participants were then randomly split into two subsamples (group 1, n=2,000, and group 2, n=1,570). After reducing the number of items using statistical methods, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out on group 1 to explore the factor structure of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Finally, group 2 was used in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the EFA’s modified structure along with an assessment of the construct validity of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Results Principal component analysis on a random subsample supported a four-factor model with 24 items, originally suggested for factorial construct validity; these 24 items were distributed across the original four domain. The domain structure for the purpose showed a good fit in the CFA on the other subsample. Internal reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha was greater than 0.70) for both the total scale and subscales. In terms of convergent validity, average variance extracted (AVE) revealed that all WHOQOL-BREF-THAI subscales achieved convergence, with AVE values ranging from 0.50 to 0.69. Conclusion These results reveal that the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI is a valid and reliable tool which health care providers can utilize to measure QOL among Thai nursing students. Therefore, the WHOQOL-BREF can serve as an essential tool for researching the factors influencing nursing students’ QOL, with implications for nursing education.

                Background This study explores the complex relationship between organizational politics, emotional intelligence and employee behavior in contemporary settings. Organizational politics, which is widespread in organizational settings, has a substantial impact on different aspects of employee behavior. Emotional Intelligence has become a vital factor in individuals’ capacity to successfully traverse the complexities of an organization. This study consolidates current material to offer insights into the impact of organizational politics on employee behavior and the mediating role of emotional intelligence in this connection. Methods A survey was undertaken with a sample size of 500 employees hailing from several Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) firms in the Dehradun (Uttarakhand) region. The study employed quantitative methodologies to investigate the correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics and Employee Behavior. The data were evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the hypothesized correlations and mediation effects. Results The study identified substantial correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics, and Employee Behavior. Emotional Intelligence was discovered to have a positive impact on Behavioral Dynamics. Perceived Organizational Politics had a substantial influence on both Emotional Intelligence and Behavioral Dynamics. Factors such as Need for Power, Relationship Conflict, Resource Constraints, Role Conflict, and Workforce Diversity were discovered to have an impact on Perceived Organizational Politics. Conclusions The results confirm strong connections between organizational politics, emotional intelligence, and employee behavior, highlighting the significance of these concepts in comprehending employee behavior in organizational environments. The study proposes that enhancing employees' emotional intelligence can alleviate the adverse effects of organizational politics, resulting in enhanced behavioral dynamics. The study also addresses the limits, outlines potential areas for further research, and highlights the managerial implications. It suggests that firms should prioritize the development of emotional intelligence to cultivate a favorable work environment.

                <p>by Yuxiang Zhan, Francesco Musella, Frank Alber</p>

The genome is organized into distinct chromatin compartments with at least two main classes, a transcriptionally active A and an inactive B compartment, broadly corresponding to euchromatin and heterochromatin. Chromatin regions within the same compartment preferentially interact with each other over regions in the opposite compartment. A/B compartments are traditionally identified from ensemble Hi-C contact frequency matrices using principal component analysis of their covariance matrices. However, defining compartments at the single-cell level from sparse single-cell Hi-C data is challenging, especially since homologous copies are often not resolved. To address this, we present MaxComp, an unsupervised method, for inferring single-cell A/B compartments based on 3D geometric considerations in single-cell chromosome structures—derived either from multiplexed FISH-omics imaging or 3D structure models derived from Hi-C data. By representing each 3D chromosome structure as an undirected graph with edge-weights encoding structural information, MaxComp reformulates compartment prediction as a variant of the Max-cut problem, solved using semidefinite graph programming (SPD) to optimally partition the graph into two structural compartments. Our results show that the population average of MaxComp single-cell compartment annotations closely matches those derived from ensemble Hi-C principal component analysis, demonstrating that compartmentalization can be recovered from geometric principles alone, using only the 3D coordinates and nuclear microenvironment of chromatin regions. Our approach reveals widespread cell-to-cell variability in compartment organization, with substantial heterogeneity across genomic loci. When applied to multiplexed FISH imaging data, MaxComp also uncovers relationships between compartment annotations and transcriptional activity at the single-cell level. In summary, MaxComp offers a new framework for understanding chromatin compartmentalization in single cells, connecting 3D genome architecture, and transcriptional activity with the cell-to-cell variations of chromatin compartments.

                <p>by Owen M. O’Connor, Mary J. Dunlop</p>

Deep learning-based methods for identifying and tracking cells within microscopy images have revolutionized the speed and throughput of data analysis. These methods for analyzing biological and medical data have capitalized on advances from the broader computer vision field. However, cell tracking can present unique challenges, with frequent cell division events and the need to track many objects with similar visual appearances complicating analysis. Existing architectures developed for cell tracking based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have tended to fall short in managing the spatial and global contextual dependencies that are crucial for tracking cells. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Cell-TRACTR (Transformer with Attention for Cell Tracking and Recognition), a novel deep learning model that uses a transformer-based architecture. Cell-TRACTR operates in an end-to-end manner, simultaneously segmenting and tracking cells without the need for post-processing. Alongside this model, we introduce the Cell-HOTA metric, an extension of the Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) metric that we adapted to assess cell division. Cell-HOTA differs from standard cell tracking metrics by offering a balanced and easily interpretable assessment of detection, association, and division accuracy. We test our Cell-TRACTR model on datasets of bacteria growing within a defined microfluidic geometry and mammalian cells growing freely in two dimensions. Our results demonstrate that Cell-TRACTR exhibits strong performance in tracking and division accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while also meeting traditional benchmarks in detection accuracy. This work establishes a new framework for employing transformer-based models in cell segmentation and tracking.

Wavelet analysis has been recognized as a widely used and promising tool in the fields of signal processing and data analysis. However, the application of wavelet-based method in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is little known. Here, we present M-band wavelet-based scRNA-seq multi-view clustering of cells (WMC). We applied for integration of M-band wavelet analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to a panel of single cell sequencing datasets by breaking up the data matrix into an approximation or low resolution component and <i>M</i>–1 detail or high resolution components. Our method is armed with multi-view clustering of cell types, identity, and functional states, enabling missing cell types visualization and new cell types discovery. Distinct to standard scRNA-seq workflow, our wavelet-based approach is a new addition to uncover rare cell types with a fine resolution.

                <p>by Joseph James Tharayil, Jorge Blanco Alonso, Silvia Farcito, Bryn Lloyd, Armando Romani, Elvis Boci, Antonino Cassara, Felix Schürmann, Esra Neufeld, Niels Kuster, Michael Reimann</p>

As the size and complexity of network simulations accessible to computational neuroscience grows, new avenues open for research into extracellularly recorded electric signals. Biophysically detailed simulations permit the identification of the biological origins of the different components of recorded signals, the evaluation of signal sensitivity to different anatomical, physiological, and geometric factors, and selection of recording parameters to maximize the signal information content. Simultaneously, virtual extracellular signals produced by these networks may become important metrics for neuro-simulation validation. To enable efficient calculation of extracellular signals from large neural network simulations, we have developed <i>BlueRecording</i>, a pipeline consisting of standalone Python code, along with extensions to the Neurodamus simulation control application, the CoreNEURON computation engine, and the SONATA data format, to permit online calculation of such signals. In particular, we implement a general form of the reciprocity theorem, which is capable of handling non-dipolar current sources, such as may be found in long axons and recordings close to the current source, as well as complex tissue anatomy, dielectric heterogeneity, and electrode geometries. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this generalized (i.e., non-dipolar) reciprocity-based approach to simulate EEG recordings. We use these tools to calculate extracellular signals from an <i>in silico</i> model of the rat somatosensory cortex and hippocampus and to study signal contribution differences between regions and cell types.

                <p>by William Turner, Charlie Sexton, Philippa A. Johnson, Ella Wilson, Hinze Hogendoorn</p>

Neural processing of sensory information takes time. Consequently, to estimate the current state of the world, the brain must rely on predictive processes—for example, extrapolating the motion of a ball to determine its probable present position. Some evidence implicates early (pre-cortical) processing in extrapolation, but it remains unclear whether extrapolation continues during later-stage (cortical) processing, where further delays accumulate. Moreover, the majority of such evidence relies on invasive neurophysiological techniques in animals, with accurate characterization of extrapolation effects in the human brain currently lacking. Here, we address these issues by demonstrating how precise probabilistic maps can be constructed from human EEG recordings. Participants (<i>N</i> = 18, two sessions) viewed a stimulus moving along a circular trajectory while EEG was recorded. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification, we extracted maps of stimulus location over time and found evidence of a forwards temporal shift occurring across temporally distinct processing stages. This accelerated emergence of position representations indicates extrapolation occurring at multiple stages of processing, with representations progressively shifted closer to real-time. We further show evidence of representational overshoot during early-stage processing following unexpected changes to an object’s trajectory, and demonstrate that the observed dynamics can emerge without supervision in a simulated neural network via spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

                Background Stroke survivors, particularly those of working age, are at an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one–five years of the initial event, largely due to suboptimal management of risk factors. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and occupational factors associated with recurrent stroke in this demographic population. Methods This case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke and 200 ischemic stroke survivors without recurrence, who were recruited from the hospital database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant factors associated with recurrence, which were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 15.1) among cases and 50.6 years (SD = 6.5) among controls. The male-to-female ratios were 1.17:1 and 1.94:1 in the case and control groups, respectively. Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke included female sex (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI [1.10–3.29]), high fasting blood sugar (aOR: 3.70; 95% CI [1.66–8.27]), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 3.63; 95% CI [2.01–6.54]), sedentary lifestyle (aOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.50–5.13]), and lack of workplace support for health (aOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.13–3.63]). The associations between these factors and stroke recurrence varied according to the age group. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle and occupational factors in stroke recurrence among working-age adults. Tailored age-specific prevention strategies—emphasizing physical activity, reduced alcohol use, and improved workplace health environments—may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance health outcomes in this population.

                The alpine tree frog (Litoria verreauxii alpina) is a threatened species found only above 1,200 meters within the Australian Alps. This species’ distribution has been severely limited due to the pathogentic amphibian chytrid fungus, and current populations persist by recruitment. Here, we provide the first publicly available genome for the genus. We used PacBio HiFi reads as well as Omni-C scaffolding data to construct a high-quality genome. We also generated a reproduction focused transcriptome from brain, liver, and gonad tissues. The genome was 2.77 Gb in length and consisted of 962 contigs with a contig N50 of 37.2 Mb and an L50 of 19.

                This study explores the dynamics of mobile genetic elements in the infant gut after cesarean birth. Fernández-Pato et al. show that early infant gut mobilome is highly individual-specific and shaped by feeding mode. Antibiotic exposure at birth has minimal effect, and early mother–infant strain-sharing is rarely detected.

                Demeshkina and Ferré-D'Amaré purify stress granule cores from yeast and mammalian cells. These cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins are a conserved response of eukaryotic cells to stressors; their dysregulation is linked to diseases. These large-scale purifications enabled detailed proteomic and transcriptomic analyses that lay bare the complexity and heterogeneity of the particles.

However, such overt reporting has limitations, leading to research on physiological signals that disclose consciousness without relying on overt behaviour. In this Review, Kronemer, Bandettini and Gonzalez-Castillo explore such covert measures of consciousness in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92757">Commissureless acts as a substrate adapter in a conserved Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase pathway to promote axon growth across the midline</a></h4>

              
                In both vertebrates and invertebrates, commissural neurons prevent premature responsiveness to the midline repellant Slit by downregulating surface levels of its receptor Roundabout1 (Robo1). In <i>Drosophila</i>, Commissureless (Comm) plays a critical role in this process; however, there is conflicting data on the underlying molecular mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved PY motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of Comm are required allow the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of Robo1. Disruption of these motifs prevents Comm from localizing to Lamp1 positive late endosomes and to promote axon growth across the midline in vivo. In addition, we conclusively demonstrate a role for Nedd4 in midline crossing. Genetic analysis shows that <i>nedd4</i> mutations result in midline crossing defects in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic nerve cord, which can be rescued by introduction of exogenous Nedd4. Biochemical evidence shows that Nedd4 incorporates into a three-member complex with Comm and Robo1 in a PY motif-dependent manner. Finally, we present genetic evidence that Nedd4 acts with Comm in the embryonic nerve cord to downregulate Robo1 levels. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Comm promotes midline crossing in the nerve cord by facilitating Robo1 ubiquitination by Nedd4, ultimately leading to its degradation.

">A phase-based mechanism of attentional selection in the auditory system</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual targets are often easier to detect and process if they occur at a predictable time. This perceptual benefit of temporal predictability suggests that neural resources are allocated to specific moments predicted to be most informative, or away from those predicted to be distracting. The sensitivity to sensory information changes with the phase of neural oscillations. An alignment of oscillatory phase according to the predicted time and relevance of expected events has therefore been proposed as a mechanism underlying attentional selection. This hypothesis predicts that opposite phases are aligned to relevant and distracting events so that the former are amplified and the latter suppressed, but such an effect remained to be demonstrated.

We presented 25 human participants with acoustic stimuli that occurred at a predictable or unpredictable time during a pitch-discrimination task. Temporal predictability did not only lead to faster reaction times, but it also aligned the phase of beta oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in anticipation of the stimulus. Crucially, the aligned phase was opposite, depending on whether the stimulus was relevant or a distractor for the task. Single-trial deviations from the mean aligned phases slowed down behavioural responses, demonstrating functional significance of the observed neural effects. All effects occurred in the absence of rhythmic stimulation, an important but rarely tested criterion to rule out spurious phase alignment from preceding events in a stimulus sequence.

We therefore conclude that the alignment of oscillatory phase underlies the selection of sensory information in time. We speculate that beta oscillations allocate neural resources in networks comprising auditory and sensorimotor regions to the expected time of auditory information, facilitating behavioural responses to upcoming events.

">AMPA receptor activation within the prelimbic cortex is necessary for incubated cocaine-craving</a></h4>

              
                The incubation of craving is a behavioral phenomenon in which cue-elicited craving increases during a period of drug abstinence. Incubated cocaine-craving is associated with increased extracellular glutamate within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and this release, particularly within the prelimbic (PL) subregion, is necessary for incubated cocaine-craving. A potential candidate mediating these incubation-driving effects of glutamate release within the PL are alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. To investigate the role of mPFC AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in incubated craving, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 6 h/day for 10 consecutive days. Either during early or later withdrawal, rats were infused intra-PL with the AMPAR antagonist NBQX (0 or 1 {nu}g/0.5 {nu}l per side), followed by 30-min tests for cue-induced responding. Immunoblotting was also conducted to relate the expression of incubated cocaine- and sucrose-craving to AMPAR subunit expression within mPFC subregions. Intra-PL NBQX blocked incubated craving expressed in late, but not early, withdrawal. No incubation-related changes in AMPAR subunit expression were detected within the PL or IL of rats of either sex and no estrus-associated changes in subunit expression were detected in female rats exhibiting incubated cocaine-craving. In contrast, elevated GluA1 expression was observed within the IL of male rats exhibiting an incubation of sucrose-craving. Together, these findings indicate a necessary role for AMPARs within the PL in driving incubated cocaine-craving and suggest that AMPARs located within the IL may be involved also in sucrose-craving selectively in males.

">The representation of facial emotion expands from sensory to prefrontal cortex with development</a></h4>

              
                Facial expression recognition develops rapidly during infancy and improves from childhood to adulthood. As a critical component of social communication, this skill enables individuals to interpret others emotions and intentions. However, the brain mechanisms driving the development of this skill remain largely unclear due to the difficulty of obtaining data with both high spatial and temporal resolution from young children. By analyzing intracranial EEG data collected from childhood (5-10 years old) and post-childhood groups (13-55 years old), we find differential involvement of high-level brain areas in processing facial expression information. For the post-childhood group, both the posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) encode facial emotion features from a high-dimensional, continuous space. However, in children, the facial expression information is only significantly represented in the pSTC, not in the DLPFC. Further, the encoding of complex emotions in pSTC is shown to increase with age. Taken together, these data suggest that young children rely more on low-level sensory areas than on the prefrontal cortex for facial emotion processing, leading us to hypothesize that top-down modulation from prefrontal cortex to pSTC gradually matures during development to enable a full understanding of facial emotions, especially complex emotions which need social and life experience to comprehend.

                The human cerebellar cortex contains the highest density and number of neurons in the human brain, yet this thin and tightly-folded structure has remained largely inaccessible to in-vivo imaging. We introduce an imaging framework to enable high-resolution, comprehensive imaging of the human cerebellar cortex. We validated the in-vivo estimates of cortical morphology against post-mortem measures. Crucially, our findings challenge the commonly held view of the cerebellar cortex as being uniform. Our findings reveal interlobular heterogeneity in both cortical morphology and vascular organization. We demonstrate that this spatial heterogeneity correlates with granular layer cell density. This convergence of morphology, cytoarchitecture and vascularization offers new mechanistic insights and reframes how cerebellar structure and function should be interpreted in health and disease.

">Socio-emotional difficulties observed in alexithymia reflect altered interactions of the semantic and monoaminergic neuromodulatory brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Alexithymia is a multidimensional construct characterized by difficulties in identifying and describing feelings and reduced ability to engage in abstract thinking. Although often co-occurring with other psychological and neurodevelopmental conditions such as anxiety, depression and autism spectrum disorders, alexithymia is believed to be associated with unique alterations within the socio-emotional brain networks. With the semantic and neuromodulatory brainstem systems playing a key role in social and affective cognition, the current work aimed to study their contributions to alexithymia in unprecedented detail. First, we attempted to identify resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the social semantic hubs (superior anterior temporal lobe) and monoamine-producing regions (dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus) linked to each alexithymia domain. Secondly, by deploying tractography and graph analysis of the associated structural network, we intended to identify their potential anatomical correlates. Alexithymia was strongly associated with dysconnectivity within the semantic network, and altered functional connectivity between the neuromodulatory brainstem regions and cortical areas crucial for social cognition and emotion regulation, including medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. On the anatomical level, these findings were paralleled by negative links with network modularity, suggestive of less specialised neural processing, and decreased clustering coefficient of the semantic node in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Despite observing associations with trait-anxiety and emotion suppression for some of the highlighted findings, these phenomena did not mediate the effects of alexithymia. Therefore, the current work highlights the existence of functional and structural alterations within socio-emotional networks as neural markers of alexithymia.

">Multiscale Entropy of Resting-State fMRI Signals Reveals Differences in Brain Complexity in Autism</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundAtypical intrinsic brain activity has been widely observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the temporal complexity of these neural signals remains underexplored. This study aimed to characterise differences in resting-state brain signal complexity between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls using multiscale entropy (MSE).

MethodsResting-state fMRI data were obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), a large multi-site dataset including 397 participants (179 with ASC, 218 neurotypical controls; ASD: Mean age 16.43 years old, SD 7.17 years old; CON: Mean age 15.75 years old, SD 5.67 years old). Voxel-wise multiscale entropy (MSE) features were extracted across multiple temporal scales. Group comparisons were conducted using voxel-wise t-tests and mixed-effects models to identify region- and scale-specific alterations in brain signal complexity.

ResultsIndividuals with ASD showed reduced MSE in prefrontal regions at coarser time scales and elevated MSE in posterior midline regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, at finer scales, followed by a decline across coarser scales. This pattern suggests a shift toward uncorrelated randomness in posterior regions and reduced long-range complexity in frontal areas. No significant associations were found between MSE features and ADOS scores.

ConclusionsThese findings reveal spatially and temporally specific alterations in brain signal complexity in ASD, particularly within the default mode network. Multiscale entropy provides a complementary approach to traditional connectivity and single-scale entropy analyses, offering novel insights into the organisation of intrinsic brain activity in neurodevelopmental conditions.

">Identification and optimization of trans-species reactive TfR1-binding VHH as tools for drug delivery across the blood brain barrier</a></h4>

              
                The treatment of brain diseases is hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a major obstacle for efficient brain exposure of therapeutic agents, in particular biotherapeutics. Different strategies are currently evaluated to enhance drug delivery across the BBB, among which the development of vector molecules that target specific receptors expressed by BBB endothelial cells and involved in receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). In this process, therapeutic cargos conjugated to optimized molecular vectors can undergo trans-endothelial transport and delivery in the brain parenchyma. The transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is enriched in brain endothelial cells and is one of the most studied receptors for drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Several antibodies and molecules derived thereof that target TfR1 have been developed, but few display trans-species reactivity, hindering the transition from preclinical to clinical development. In the present study, we selected and characterized cross-species reactive Variable domain of Heavy chain only antibody from camelids (VHH), and in particular C5 and B8, that bind rodent, rhesus monkey and human TfR1. When fused to a human Immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) Fc region, C5 or B8 monomers or homodimers were taken up by engineered CHO cells expressing the rodent, human and rhesus monkey TfR1, and by rodent or human brain endothelial cells. Key human TfR1 amino-acid residues of the C5 and B8 epitopes were identified based on the generation of human TfR1 mutants. Assessment of their functional binding revealed an original binding region at the interface of the TfR1 dimer. Following systemic injection in mice of VHH-Fc fusions displaying different properties in terms of affinity and avidity toward TfR1, we demonstrated improved brain uptake compared to control molecules encompassing an irrelevant VHH. Brain delivery efficiency of the parental and optimized VHHTfR1 was further demonstrated using Neurotensin (NT)-induced hypothermia (HT) as a read-out in wild-type mice and in B-hTfR transgenic mice expressing the human TfR1 ectodomain. We established in vitro-in vivo correlations between the human TfR1 binding properties determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of VHH-NT affinity variants, and their potential to induce HT in B-hTfR mice. We identified key human TfR1 binding parameters leading to efficient BBB transcytosis i.e.: a rapid dissociation rate and intermediate affinity. Some of the engineered C5 and B8 variants presented promising cross-species reactivity towards the murine, but also rhesus monkey TfR1. We also generated variants with very similar human-rhesus monkey TfR1 binding properties and optimal affinities for TfR1-dependant transcytosis. These VHHs could be further developed as molecular shuttles for the transport of imaging or therapeutic agents, including biomolecules, across the rodent, non-human primate and human BBB, allowing straightforward preclinical to clinical translation.

">Common pitfalls during model specification in psychophysiological interaction analysis</a></h4>

              
                Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis is a widely used regression method in functional neuroimaging for capturing task-dependent changes in connectivity from a seed region. The present work identifies, and provides corrections for, common methodological pitfalls in PPI analysis that compromise model validity. Firstly, if the seed time series is extracted with prewhitening, the temporal structure of the signal is altered and subsequent deconvolution of prewhitened data becomes suboptimal. Furthermore, prewhitening again during model fitting results in double prewhitening of the seed regressor. Secondly, a failure to mean-centre the task regressor when calculating the interaction term can also lead to model misspecification and potentially spurious inferences. By using simulations and empirical language fMRI data from the Australian Epilepsy Project, we demonstrate the adverse effects of these issues, and how they are resolved when corrected. A systematic review of current practices revealed widespread model misspecification, and underreporting of methods, in published PPI studies. We provide clearer reporting guidelines, and advocate for appropriate methods for handling of prewhitening and mean-centring to ensure the validity of PPI analyses.

">The Drosophila wing is a high-throughput and versatile screening tool for Tau-mediated disease mechanisms and drug discovery.</a></h4>

              
                Tau protein contributes to microtubule stability, which is disrupted in Alzheimers disease and other Tauopathies. In these diseases, Tau molecules become hyperphosphorylated, misfolded and aggregated, propagating pathology across the brain. Studies dissecting disease mechanisms or screening disease-modifying therapies rely on animal models that unveil pathogenic events in vivo but also take several weeks or months to complete. Here we describe a versatile experimental paradigm that yields results in days and yet offers all the advantages of a genetically tractable in vivo system: the Drosophila wing disc. Mimicking neurotoxicity, human Tau expression causes cell death in the wing disc leading to quantifiable phenotypes in the adult wing. The neuroprotective peptide NAP ameliorates Tau toxicity in this system, validating it as a cost-effective drug screening tool. Phenocopying adult neurons, Tau toxicity in the wing disc is exacerbated by simulating hyper-phosphorylation and prevented by suppressing aggregation. Additionally, we show that the wing disc can dissect disease mechanisms that underpin clinically relevant Tau variants. Thus, the wing disc offers an in vivo experimental paradigm for fast and efficient exploration of disease mechanism and screening.

">Tau Oligomerization Drives Neurodegeneration via Nuclear Membrane Invagination and Lamin B Receptor Binding in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The microtubule-associated protein tau aggregates into oligomeric complexes that highly correlate with Alzheimers disease (AD) progression. Increasing evidence suggests that nuclear membrane disruption occurs in AD and related tauopathies, but whether this is a cause or consequence of neurodegeneration remains unclear. Using the optogenetically inducible 4R1N Tau::mCherry::Cry2Olig (optoTau) system in iPSC-derived neurons, we demonstrate that tau oligomerization triggers nuclear rupture and nuclear membrane invagination. Pathological tau accumulates at sites of invagination, inducing structural abnormalities in the nuclear envelope and piercing into the nuclear space. These findings were confirmed in the humanized P301S tau (PS19) transgenic mouse model, where nuclear envelope disruption appeared as an early-onset event preceding neurodegeneration. Further validation in post-mortem AD brain tissues revealed nuclear lamina disruption correlating with pathological tau emergence in early-stage patients. Notably, electron microscopy shows that tau-induced nuclear invagination triggers global chromatin reorganization, potentially driving aberrant gene expression and protein translation associated with AD. These findings suggest that nuclear membrane disruption is an early and possibly causative event in tau-mediated neurodegeneration, establishing a mechanistic link between tau oligomerization and nuclear stress. Further investigation into nuclear destabilization could inform clinical strategies for mitigating AD pathogenesis.

">Prelimbic cortical excitatory overdrive and inhibitory underdrive accompany environmental suppression of food seeking</a></h4>

              
                Cues associated with food, such as fast-food advertising, can provoke food cravings and may lead to unhealthy overeating. Environmental enrichment (EE) that enhances cognitive and physical stimulation can reduce cue-evoked sucrose seeking in mice and recruitment of sucrose cue-reactive neurons or  neuronal ensembles in the prelimbic cortex (PL), which regulates appetitive behaviors. Hence, EE provides us with a behavioral model and neuronal targets to identify  anti-craving relevant mechanisms. Here, we investigated in the PL how EE modulated neuronal excitability and activity patterns in cue-reactive neuronal populations. Chemogenetic inhibition of cue-reactive neurons in PL blocked cue-evoked sucrose seeking, thereby confirming the function of these neurons in sucrose cue memory. EE boosted the baseline excitability of  originally, or before EE exposure, cue-reactive, excitatory pyramidal cells in PL. Furthermore, their sucrose cue-specificity was lost - resulting in their persistent activation and non-cue selective activation or  excitatory overdrive. Furthermore, EE reduced recruitment of cue-reactive, inhibitory interneurons reflecting  inhibitory underdrive. Taken together, impaired neuronal food cue processing due to simultaneous prefrontal cortical excitatory  overdrive and inhibitory  underdrive likely underlies EEs anti-craving action, thereby serving as potential neurophysiological targets to develop novel medications that help control food cravings.

">A complex acoustical environment is necessary for maintenance and development in the zebra finch auditory pallium</a></h4>

              
                Postnatal experience is critical to auditory development in vertebrates. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia castanotis) provides a valuable model for understanding how complex social-acoustical environments influence development of the neural circuits that support perception of vocal communication signals. We previously showed that zebra finches raised in the rich acoustical environment of a breeding colony (colony-reared, CR) perform twice as well in an operant discrimination task as birds raised with only their families (pair-reared, PR), and we identified deficits in functional properties within the auditory pallium of PR birds that could explain this behavioral difference. Here, using single-unit extracellular recordings from the L3 subdivision of field L and caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) at three developmental timepoints (18-20, 30-35, and 90-110 days post hatch), we tracked how experience affects the emergence of these functional properties. Whereas CR birds showed stable single-unit response properties from fledging to adulthood alongside improvements in population-level encoding, PR birds exhibited progressive deterioration in neural function. Deficits in PR birds began emerging at 18 days for population metrics and by 30 days for single-unit properties, worsening into adulthood. These included altered spike waveforms, firing rates, selectivity, discriminability, coding efficiency, and noise invariance. Notably, these deficits occurred despite PR birds receiving normal exposure to the song of a male tutor, suggesting that learning to sing is robust enough to compensate for impaired auditory processing. Our findings demonstrate that a complex acoustical environment is necessary for both maintenance and development of the cortical-level auditory circuits that decode conspecific vocalizations.

">GABAergic signaling by VIP interneurons gates running-dependent visual recovery in the adult brain</a></h4>

              
                Experience-dependent plasticity in the adult visual cortex is enhanced by locomotion, a process mediated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. While VIP interneurons are known to signal through both Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and VIP peptide, the specific contributions of these pathways during different forms of plasticity remain unclear. Monocular deprivation (MD) in adult mice alters cortical responses, though more slowly and differently than during a critical period in early life. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging in awake adult mice to dissect the roles of VIP and GABA release from VIP interneurons during adult MD and subsequent binocular recovery. We found comparable level of ocular dominance shifts after MD in mice deficient in either peptidergic or GABA signaling, but disrupting GABA signaling impaired recovery of binocular responses. We also showed that running preferentially enhances contralateral eye responses in binocular primary visual cortex. However, this eye-specific modulation of visual responses by running was altered during recovery from MD and was dependent on VIP signaling pathways. These findings highlight the GABA-mediated inhibition by VIP interneurons as a critical pathway for promoting visual restoration in the adult brain.

Significance StatementUsing longitudinal two-photon imaging in awake adult mice with genetically altered signaling path-ways in VIP interneurons, we demonstrate that GABAergic, but not peptidergic, signaling from VIP interneurons is essential for the recovery of binocular vision following monocular deprivation. We further reveal that locomotion modulates cortical responses in an eye-specific manner, a property dynamically reshaped by plasticity and dependent on VIP interneuron function. These findings identify a discrete inhibitory circuit element that links behavioral state to sensory recovery and highlight GABA release from VIP cells as a potential therapeutic target for restoring visual function in adulthood.

">Early Indirect Neurogenesis transitions to late Direct Neurogenesis in mouse cerebral cortex development</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex must contain the appropriate numbers of neurons in each layer to acquire its proper functional organization. Accordingly, neurogenesis requires precise regulation along development. Cortical neurons are made either directly by Radial Glia Cells (RGCs) that self- consume, or indirectly from RGCs via Intermediate Progenitor Cells (IPCs) and largely preserving the RGC pool. According to the standing model of cortical development, Direct Neurogenesis predominates at early stages of development, and progressively shifts to Indirect Neurogenesis, which predominates at late stages. However, neurogenesis at early stages should be compatible with RGC amplification, and neurogenesis at late stages needs to involve RGC consumption, which seems in conflict with the standing model. Here we studied the modes of neurogenesis along cortical development using multiple approaches, including birthdating, live imaging and MADM clone labeling. Contrary to the established dogma, our data show that Indirect Neurogenesis clearly predominates at early developmental stages, gradually shifting to Direct Neurogenesis at late stages. These findings challenge the current model of cortical neurogenesis, and prompt a re-evaluation of previous and ongoing work about the genetic and molecular mechanisms regulating this process.

">A two-dimensional space of linguistic representations shared across individuals</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to extract meaning from linguistic inputs and package ideas into word sequences is supported by a network of left-hemisphere frontal and temporal brain areas. Despite extensive research, previous attempts to discover differences among these language areas have not revealed clear dissociations or spatial organization. All areas respond similarly during controlled linguistic experiments as well as during naturalistic language comprehension. To search for finer-grained organizational principles of language processing, we applied data-driven decomposition methods to ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI responses from eight participants listening to 200 linguistically diverse sentences. Using a cross-validation procedure that identifies shared structure across individuals, we find that two components successfully generalize across participants, together accounting for about 32% of the explainable variance in brain responses to sentences. The first component corresponds to processing difficulty, and the second--to meaning abstractness; we formally support this interpretation through targeted behavioral experiments and information-theoretic measures. Furthermore, we find that the two components are systematically organized within frontal and temporal language areas, with the meaning-abstractness component more prominent in the temporal regions. These findings reveal an interpretable, low-dimensional, spatially structured representational basis for language processing, and advance our understanding of linguistic representations at a detailed, fine-scale organizational level.

                Most of the food produced globally is consumed in urban centres, and urban populations rely heavily on purchasing the foods they consume in place of growing, catching, or producing food themselves. Urban populations are thus highly dependent on the types of foods available to them and their relative prices. Rapid urbanization is catalysing changes across the food system and in turn, shaping urban diets. Traditionally viewed as a problem predominantly faced by rural areas, food insecurity and malnutrition (both undernutrition and overweight and obesity) are on the rise in urban areas globally. Likewise, urban environments can foster unsafe food environments, increasing the risk of foodborne illnesses and death. Considering an increasingly urbanized world, this paper describes critical links between food systems and urban health. It identifies housing development, digitalization, labour transitions and dietary transitions as emerging and interrelated trends that are changing the way people access, purchase and consume food in urban areas. This paper proposes potential interventions and tools for holistic, city-led policies and actions that make healthier and safer food more available and affordable for everyone, to inspire and encourage practitioners and policymakers at the city, regional, national and international levels to increase their ambition and act urgently.

                Pain and inflammation are the consequences of sore throat, dental and oral procedures, infections, ulcers and head and neck chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and their management is of fundamental importance to avoid distress in patients. Benzydamine hydrochloride (HCl) is a topical indolic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, endowed with analgesic and anesthetic activity, and with antimicrobial (including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria) and antifungal properties (targeting Candida albicans and non-albicans strains), used in odontostomatology, otorhinolaryngology, and gynecology for its properties. This molecule has a lipophilic nature, showing high affinity with cell membranes and exhibiting membrane stabilization properties, resulting in local anesthesia, an effect related also to the interaction of the drug with cationic channels. Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzydamine HCl is a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase and consequently its primary mechanisms of action are not related to arachidonic acid metabolism and do not affect the biosynthesis of the inflammation mediators prostanoids, prostacyclin, thromboxane and leukotrienes. Benzydamine HCl is able to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with consequent analgesia. Moreover, benzydamine HCl is able to inhibit leukocyte-endothelial interactions and platelet aggregation. Here we review the most updated clinical data available on benzydamine HCl local application as spray, mouthwash or gargling and evidence of its effectiveness in inflammatory and/or septic conditions in the otorhinolaryngology and odontostomatology settings, with particular reference to sore throat, oral inflammation, dental plaque, tonsillitis/tonsillectomy and chemo- or radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Novel formulations for oral and oromucosal/buccal/intraoral administration of benzydamine HCl are also reviewed, including in situ gelling formulations to be sprayed onto the damaged oral mucosa. Finally, novel data on the potential role of benzydamine HCl in nociceptor excitability are introduced.

                Background Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a mental disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, impaired decision-making abilities, abnormalities in brain functioning, and specific genetic markers. Ethnic and racial factors influence the development and presentation of schizophrenia, with different groups experiencing different levels of risk and exhibiting different patterns of mental disorders. Objective We sought to investigate the executive function and decision-making profile of Schizophrenia participants from Barranquilla, Colombia, which have a high genetic mixture and significant ethnic and racial diversity. Methods The sample consists of 40 individuals, 20 diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and 20 controls. We use the BANFE neuropsychological battery and the Iowa Gambling task to measure executive function and decision-making processes. Results The study found differences in cognitive performance, measured by the Neuropsychological Battery of Executive Functions and Frontal Lobes, in the medial orbit, anterior prefrontal, dorsolateral, and total executive function measures. In decision-making, as measured by the Iowa Gambling Test, there were also differences between the two groups, with those with schizophrenia performing worse and showing a preference for disadvantageous options. The study also found that there were no significant differences in socio-demographic characteristics between the two groups but that there were differences in terms of socio-economic status and educational level. Conclusion This study found that individuals with paranoid schizophrenia had significant differences in their prefrontal cortex compared to those without the condition, specifically in the dorsolateral and orbital-prefrontal cortex. These differences may be linked to difficulties adjusting to their environment and processing reinforcement, leading to impaired learning and arousal disturbances.

                Background Hitherto, BDNF levels in humans have been primarily measured in serum and/or plasma where these levels are readily measurable, but primarily reflect the content of BDNF in blood platelets. By contrast, previous attempts to measure BDNF levels in readily accessible human body fluids such as saliva have been complicated by a lack of sensitivity and/or specificity of BDNF ELISAs (see Discussion). Recently, the suitability of a highly sensitive BDNF ELISA assay was validated using mouse plasma and serum where conventional BDNF ELISA fail to detect BDNF. In this report, we demonstrate that BDNF levels in human saliva are extremely low, in the low pg/mL range, yet detectable in all saliva samples tested. Methods Saliva samples were collected from healthy volunteers by a passive drool method. All samples were aliquoted and immediately frozen to keep at -80°C until use. At the time of use, the samples were thawed, centrifuged to remove any remaining particles and BDNF measurement conducted by using a previously validated BDNF ELISA assay (see below). Recombinant mature BDNF was used as a reference. Results The intra-assay variability was in the range of CV = 1.8 to 4.9%. Saliva samples could be kept frozen at -80°C for 2 months until use for measurements, but more than 4 freeze and thaw cycles caused BDNF losses presumably due to structural change of the antigen. The measurements were not affected by the method of collection provided the samples were diluted at least 2-fold. Conclusions The results indicate that human saliva samples collected in a non-invasive fashion can be used as a source of material to try and correlate BDNF levels with human conditions of interest. These results also confirm those of an independent study published recently using the same BDNF ELISA kit to measure BDNF levels in human saliva samples.

Under <i>in vivo</i> conditions, CA1 pyramidal cells from the hippocampus display transitions from single spikes to bursts. It is believed that subthreshold hyperpolarization and depolarization, also known as down and up-states, play a pivotal role in these transitions. Nevertheless, a central impediment to correlating suprathreshold (spiking) and subthreshold activity has been the technical difficulties of this type of recordings, even with widely used calcium imaging or multielectrode recordings. Recent work using voltage imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators has been able to correlate spiking patterns with subthreshold activity in a variety of CA1 neurons, and recent computational models have been able to capture these transitions. In this work, we used a computational model of a CA1 pyramidal cell to investigate the role of intrinsic conductances and oscillatory patterns in generating down and up-states and their modulation in the transition from single spiking to bursting. Specifically, the emergence of distinct spiking resonances between these two spiking modes that share the same voltage traces in the presence of theta or gamma oscillatory inputs, a phenomenon we call interleaved single and bursting spiking resonance. We noticed that these resonances do not necessarily overlap in frequency or amplitude, underscoring their relevance for providing flexibility to neural processing. We studied the conductance values of three current types that are thought to be critical for the bursting behavior: persistent sodium current (<i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub>, delayed rectifier potassium (<i>I</i><sub>KDR</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub>, and hyperpolarization-activated current (<i>I</i><sub>h</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>h</sub>. We conclude that the intricate interplay of ionic currents significantly influences the neuronal firing patterns, transitioning from single to burst firing during sustained depolarization. Specifically, the intermediate levels of <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> facilitate spiking resonance at gamma frequency inputs. The resonance characteristics vary between single and burst firing modes, each displaying distinct amplitudes and resonant frequencies. Furthermore, low <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and high <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> values lock bursting to theta frequencies, while high <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and low <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> values lock single spiking to gamma frequencies. Lastly, the duration of quiet intervals plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of transitioning to either bursting or single spiking modes. We confirmed that the same features were present in previously recorded in vivo voltage-imaging data. Understanding these dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying neuronal excitability under <i>in vivo</i> conditions.

Bayesian accounts of perception, such as predictive processing, suggest that perceptions integrate expectations and sensory experience, and thus assimilate to expected values. Furthermore, more precise expectations should have stronger influences on perception. We tested these hypotheses using a within-subject paradigm that independently manipulated the mean, variance (precision), and skewness of cues presented as ratings from 10 prior participants. Forty-five participants reported their expectations regarding the painfulness of thermal stimuli or the visual contrast of flickering checkerboards. In a second session, similar (sham) cues were each followed by either a noxious thermal or a visual stimulus. Perceptions assimilated to cue-based expectations in both modalities, but precision effects were modality-specific: more precise cues enhanced assimilation in visual perception only, while higher uncertainty slightly increased reported pain. fMRI analysis revealed that the cues affected higher-level affective and cognitive systems–including assimilation to the cue mean in a neuromarker of endogenous pain processing and in the nucleus accumbens, and activity consistent with aversive prediction-error-like encoding in the periaqueductal gray during pain perception–but not early perceptual processing systems. Furthermore, behavioral and computational models of the expectation session revealed that expectations were biased towards extreme values in both modalities, and towards low-pain cues specifically. These findings suggest that predictive processing theories should be extended with mechanisms such as selective attention to outliers, and that expectation generation and its perceptual effects are mostly modality-specific and primarily influence higher-level processes rather than early perception, at least when cues are not reinforced.

Fungi can cause devastating invasive infections, typically in immunocompromised patients. Treatment is complicated both by the evolutionary similarity between humans and fungi and by the frequent emergence of drug resistance. Studies in fungal pathogens have long been slowed by a lack of high-throughput tools and community resources that are common in model organisms. Here we demonstrate a high-throughput transposon mutagenesis and sequencing (TN-seq) system in <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> that enables genome-wide determination of gene essentiality. We employed a random forest machine learning approach to classify the <i>C. neoformans</i> genome as essential or nonessential, predicting 1,465 essential genes, including 302 that lack human orthologs. These genes are ideal targets for new antifungal drug development. TN-seq also enables genome-wide measurement of the fitness contribution of genes to phenotypes of interest. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the genome-wide contribution of genes to growth in fluconazole, a clinically used antifungal. We show a novel role for the well-studied <i>RIM101</i> pathway in fluconazole susceptibility. We also show that insertions of transposons into the 5′ upstream region can drive sensitization of essential genes, enabling screenlike assays of both essential and nonessential components of the genome. Using this approach, we demonstrate a role for mitochondrial function in fluconazole sensitivity, such that tuning down many essential mitochondrial genes via 5′ insertions can drive resistance to fluconazole. Our assay system will be valuable in future studies of <i>C. neoformans</i>, particularly in examining the consequences of genotypic diversity.

     alt="Resting-State Brain Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations: A Comparative Study Across Different Frequency Bands in Student Pilots"/>
<p>In our study, we selected pilot trainees as subjects and utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to analyze the impact of flight training on their brains. After examining the correlations between classical and sub-band brain regions and behavioral tests, we discovered that flight training induced changes in the superior frontal gyrus, posterior central gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus of the pilot trainees' brains.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In this study, we aimed to investigate changes in the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF) in different frequency bands in flight trainees using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technology to explore the impact of flight training on brain functional changes. The study included 39 flight trainees and 37 well-matched healthy controls. MATLAB software was used to perform two-sample <i>t</i>-tests on the mALFF values of the subjects in different frequency bands to identify intergroup differences. SPSS software was used to perform correlation analysis between the different brain areas and the results of the Berg Card Sorting Test (BCST). The results revealed significant differences in mALFF values in multiple brain areas, including the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus, between the two groups. Sub-bands revealed more differential brain areas compared to the classical band, and these differential brain areas were significantly correlated with the total accuracy of the BCST. Under resting conditions, flight trainees who underwent flight training showed significant differences from the control group in brain regions related to cognitive executive control, somatosensory function, memory function, and other functions. This may be related to the learning of critical flight skills, such as emergency operations, maneuvering the aircraft for takeoff, landing, and re-flight during executive flight training. Meanwhile, the sub-band is more sensitive to information about brain functional activities than the classical band, which provides a new perspective for further exploring the changes in pilot brain functional mechanisms in the future.</p>
