                Background Darwin assumed that the peacock’s long train was maladaptive and was the indirect effect of selection by female mate choice based on the train’s beauty. While a relationship between the feathers’ elaborate features and mating success has been shown, what features of the train females are attracted to remains controversial. Methods We used museum specimens to examine the anatomical plan underlying feather development responsible for the symmetry of the train. We developed a model based on an alternate arrangement of primordial feather buds during development and locations of concentric circles of symmetric eyespot distribution using the pattern seen on the train as a template. Results We observed a zigzag pattern of feather follicles that determined both the number and the hexagonal arrangement of eyespots on the train. Our model explained not only the alternate arrangement of feathers on the train but also the arrangement of the concentric color rings of the eyespots. While the zigzag pattern explains the symmetry, complexity, and structural beauty of the peacock’s train, it also precludes variation in eyespot number except by annual addition of new rows of feathers as a function of age. Conclusions Since eyespot number and feather length are developmentally correlated and an asymptotic function of a male’s age, their effects on female choice would be confounded and inseparable, and male vigor would be a crucial factor affecting male fitness. Females may not always choose males with the largest number of eyespots, as older males may lack vigor. We propose a multimodal model of female choice where females see eyespot and train size not as separate traits but as one complex trait combining both. The new model may be able to explain conflicting results and why eyespot number alone may not be sufficient to explain female choice.

     alt="Heterogeneity of brain extracellular matrix and astrocyte activation"/>
<p>Astrocyte resting phenotype is directed by its extracellular matrix (ECM), where the composition of both ECM and astrocyte subtypes varies by brain region. Astrocyte activation is not only a result of the injury or disease stimulus, but also of its ECM which can be significantly altered in a pathological state.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>From the blood brain barrier to the synaptic space, astrocytes provide structural, metabolic, ionic, and extracellular matrix (ECM) support across the brain. Astrocytes include a vast array of subtypes, their phenotypes and functions varying both regionally and temporally. Astrocytes' metabolic and regulatory functions poise them to be quick and sensitive responders to injury and disease in the brain as revealed by single cell sequencing. Far less is known about the influence of the local healthy and aging microenvironments on these astrocyte activation states. In this forward-looking review, we describe the known relationship between astrocytes and their local microenvironment, the remodeling of the microenvironment during disease and injury, and postulate how they may drive astrocyte activation. We suggest technology development to better understand the dynamic diversity of astrocyte activation states, and how basal and activation states depend on the ECM microenvironment. A deeper understanding of astrocyte response to stimuli in ECM-specific contexts (brain region, age, and sex of individual), paves the way to revolutionize how the field considers astrocyte-ECM interactions in brain injury and disease and opens routes to return astrocytes to a healthy quiescent state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25342?af=R">The interplay between glucose and ketone bodies in neural stem cell metabolism</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glucose is the primary energy source for neural stem cells (NSCs), supporting their proliferation, differentiation, and quiescence. However, the high demand for glucose during brain development often exceeds its supply, leading to the utilization of alternative energy sources including ketone bodies. Ketone bodies, including β-hydroxybutyrate, are short-chain fatty acids produced through hepatic ketogenesis and play a crucial role in providing energy and the biosynthetic components for NSCs when required. The interplay between glucose and ketone metabolism influences NSC behavior and fate decisions, and disruptions in these metabolic pathways have been linked to neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, ketone bodies exert neuroprotective effects on NSCs and modulate cellular responses to oxidative stress, energy maintenance, deacetylation, and inflammation. As such, understanding the interdependence of glucose and ketone metabolism in NSCs is crucial to understanding their roles in NSC function and their implications for neurological conditions. This article reviews the mechanisms of glucose and ketone utilization in NSCs, their impact on NSC function, and the therapeutic potential of targeting these metabolic pathways in neurological disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0292-23.2024?rss=1">Functional Recovery Associated with Dendrite Regeneration in PVD Neuron of Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>PVD neuron of <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> is a highly polarized cell with well-defined axonal, and dendritic compartments. PVD neuron operates in multiple sensory modalities including the control of both nociceptive touch sensation and body posture. Although both the axon and dendrites of this neuron show a regeneration response following laser-assisted injury, it is rather unclear how the behavior associated with this neuron is affected by the loss of these structures. It is also unclear whether neurite regrowth would lead to functional restoration in these neurons. Upon axotomy, using a femtosecond laser, we saw that harsh touch response was specifically affected leaving the body posture unperturbed. Subsequently, recovery in the touch response is highly correlated to the axon regrowth, which was dependent on DLK-1/MLK-1 MAP Kinase. Dendrotomy of both major and minor primary dendrites affected the wavelength and amplitude of sinusoidal movement without any apparent effect on harsh touch response. We further correlated the recovery in posture behavior to the type of dendrite regeneration events. We found that dendrite regeneration through the fusion and reconnection between the proximal and distal branches of the injured dendrite corresponded to improved recovery in posture. Our data revealed that the axons and dendrites of PVD neurons regulate the nociception and proprioception in worms, respectively. It also revealed that dendrite and axon regeneration lead to the restoration of these differential sensory modalities.</p>

                <p>by David M. Bland, Dan Long, Rebecca Rosenke, B. Joseph Hinnebusch</p>

<i>Yersinia pestis</i>, the causative agent of plague, is a highly lethal vector-borne pathogen responsible for killing large portions of Europe’s population during the Black Death of the Middle Ages. In the wild, <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i> cycles between fleas and rodents; occasionally spilling over into humans bitten by infectious fleas. For this reason, fleas and the rats harboring them have been considered the main epidemiological drivers of previous plague pandemics. Human ectoparasites, such as the body louse (<i>Pediculus humanus humanus</i>), have largely been discounted due to their reputation as inefficient vectors of plague bacilli. Using a membrane-feeder adapted strain of body lice, we show that the digestive tract of some body lice become chronically infected with <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i> at bacteremia as low as 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/ml, and these lice routinely defecate <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i>. At higher bacteremia (≥1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml), a subset of the lice develop an infection within the Pawlowsky glands (PGs), a pair of putative accessory salivary glands in the louse head. Lice that developed PG infection transmitted <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i> more consistently than those with bacteria only in the digestive tract. These glands are thought to secrete lubricant onto the mouthparts, and we hypothesize that when infected, their secretions contaminate the mouthparts prior to feeding, resulting in bite-based transmission of <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i>. The body louse’s high level of susceptibility to infection by gram-negative bacteria and their potential to transmit plague bacilli by multiple mechanisms supports the hypothesis that they may have played a role in previous human plague pandemics and local outbreaks.

                <p>by John G. Robinson, Danielle LaBruna, Tim O’Brien, Peter J. Clyne, Nigel Dudley, Sandy J. Andelman, Elizabeth L. Bennett, Avecita Chicchon, Carlos Durigan, Hedley Grantham, Margaret Kinnaird, Sue Lieberman, Fiona Maisels, Adriana Moreira, Madhu Rao, Emma Stokes, Joe Walston, James EM Watson</p>

The Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), signed in 2022 by Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, recognized the importance of area-based conservation, and its goals and targets specify the characteristics of protected and conserved areas (PCAs) that disproportionately contribute to biodiversity conservation. To achieve the GBF’s target of conserving a global area of 30% by 2030, this Essay argues for recognizing these characteristics and scaling them up through the conservation of areas that are: extensive (typically larger than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>); have interconnected PCAs (either physically or as part of a jurisdictional network, and frequently embedded in larger conservation landscapes); have high ecological integrity; and are effectively managed and equitably governed. These areas are presented as “Nature’s Strongholds,” illustrated by examples from the Congo and Amazon basins. Conserving Nature’s Strongholds offers an approach to scale up initiatives to address global threats to biodiversity.

                Fibroblasts are cells of mesenchymal origin that are found throughout the body. While these cells have several functions, their integral roles include maintaining tissue architecture through the production of key extracellular matrix components, and participation in wound healing after injury. Fibroblasts are also key mediators in disease progression during fibrosis, cancer, and other inflammatory diseases. Under these perturbed states, fibroblasts can activate into inflammatory fibroblasts or contractile myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts require various growth factors and mitogenic molecules for survival, proliferation, and differentiation. While the activity of mitogenic growth factors on fibroblasts in vitro was characterized as early as the 1970s, the proliferation and differentiation effects of growth factors on these cells in vivo are unclear. Recent work exploring the heterogeneity of fibroblasts raises questions as to whether all fibroblast cell states exhibit the same growth factor requirements. Here, we will examine and review existing studies on the influence of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), and transforming growth factor β receptor (TGFβR) on fibroblast cell states.

High-risk neuroblastoma is highly aggressive and survival is poor despite intensive multi-modal therapies with significant toxicity. Novel therapies are desperately needed. The Zika virus (ZIKV) can access the nervous system and there is growing interest in employing ZIKV as a potential therapy against paediatric nervous system tumours, including neuroblastoma. Methods Here, we perform extensive data mining, integration and re-analysis of ZIKV infection datasets to highlight molecular mechanisms that may govern the oncolytic response in neuroblastoma cells. We collate infection data of multiple neuroblastoma cell lines by different ZIKV strains from a body of published literature to inform the susceptibility of neuroblastoma to the ZIKV oncolytic response. Integrating published transcriptomics, interaction proteomics, dependency factor and compound datasets we propose the involvement of multiple host systems during ZIKV infection. Results Through data mining of published literature, we observed most paediatric neuroblastoma cell lines to be highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and propose the PRVABC59 ZIKV strain to be the most promising candidate for neuroblastoma oncolytic virotherapy. ZIKV induces TNF signalling, lipid metabolism, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and downregulates cell cycle and DNA replication processes. ZIKV infection is dependent on sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-regulated lipid metabolism and three protein complexes; V-ATPase, ER Membrane Protein Complex (EMC) and mammalian translocon. We propose ZIKV non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) as a likely mediator of ZIKVs interaction with IRE1-mediated UPR, lipid metabolism and mammalian translocon. Conclusions Our work provides a significant understanding of ZIKV infection in neuroblastoma cells, which will facilitate the progression of ZIKV-based oncolytic virotherapy through pre-clinical research and clinical trials.

                Background Group B streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of infant sepsis, meningitis and death despite intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. A vaccine is urgently required, and two candidates are in advanced clinical trials. For successful GBS vaccine implementation, especially if a vaccine is licensed based on an immunological threshold, there must be cross-sector engagement, effective advocacy, robust plans for phase IV studies and equitable access. Meeting A round-table discussion, held at St George’s University of London, reviewed the current position of GBS vaccines in the UK context, focusing on phase IV plans, convening a diverse group of stakeholders from across the UK, with a role in GBS vaccine licensure, advocacy, implementation or effectiveness evaluation. Presentations outlined the latest UK epidemiology, noting the rising infant invasive GBS (iGBS) infection rates from 1996 to 2021 for both early and late onset disease, with the highest disease rates in Black infants (1.1/1000 livebirths vs white infants (0.81/1000 livebirths). Potential coverage of the candidate vaccines was high (>95%). Regulatory input suggested that EU regulators would consider waiving the need for a pre-licensure efficacy study if a putative correlate of protection could be adequately justified. Phase IV study methodologies for a GBS vaccine were considered, largely based on previous UK maternal vaccine assessments, such as a nationwide cohort study design using a vaccine register and a maternal services dataset. Other strategies were also discussed such as a cluster or stepped-wedge randomised trial to evaluate implementation outcomes. Opportunities for advocacy, education and engagement with additional key partners were discussed and identified. Conclusions With an approved GBS vaccine a near possibility, planning of phase IV studies and identification of critical barriers to implementation are urgently needed. Cross-sector engagement is essential and will facilitate a successful pathway.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) are key components of the brain's memory and navigation systems. Lesions of either region produce profound deficits in spatial cognition and HPC neurons exhibit well-known spatial firing patterns (place fields). Recent studies have also identified an array of navigation-related firing patterns in the RSC. However, there has been little work comparing the response properties and information coding mechanisms of these two brain regions. In the present study, we examined the firing patterns of HPC and RSC neurons in two tasks which are commonly used to study spatial cognition in rodents, open field foraging with an environmental context manipulation and continuous T-maze alternation. We found striking similarities in the kinds of spatial and contextual information encoded by these two brain regions. Neurons in both regions carried information about the rat's current spatial location, trajectories and goal locations, and both regions reliably differentiated the contexts. However, we also found several key differences. For example, information about head direction was a prominent component of RSC representations but was only weakly encoded in the HPC. The two regions also used different coding schemes, even when they encoded the same kind of information. As expected, the HPC employed a sparse coding scheme characterized by compact, high contrast place fields, and information about spatial location was the dominant component of HPC representations. RSC firing patterns were more consistent with a distributed coding scheme. Instead of compact place fields, RSC neurons exhibited broad, but reliable, spatial and directional tuning, and they typically carried information about multiple navigational variables. The observed similarities highlight the closely related functions of the HPC and RSC, whereas the differences in information types and coding schemes suggest that these two regions likely make somewhat different contributions to spatial cognition.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Microglia are a specialized type of neuroimmune cells that undergo morphological and molecular changes through multiple signaling pathways in response to pathological protein aggregates, neuronal death, tissue injury, or infections. Microglia express Trem2, which serves as a receptor for a multitude of ligands enhancing their phagocytic activity. Trem2 has emerged as a critical modulator of microglial activity, especially in many neurodegenerative disorders. Human TREM2 mutations are associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Trem2 plays dual roles in neuroinflammation and more specifically in disease-associated microglia. Most recent developments on the molecular mechanisms of Trem2, emphasizing its role in uptake and clearance of amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates and other tissue debris to help protect and preserve the brain, are encouraging. Although Trem2 normally stimulates defense mechanisms, its dysregulation can intensify inflammation, which poses major therapeutic challenges. Recent therapeutic approaches targeting Trem2 via agonistic antibodies and gene therapy methodologies present possible avenues for reducing the burden of neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the promise of Trem2 as a therapeutic target, especially for Aβ-associated AD, and calls for more mechanistic investigations to understand the context-specific role of microglial Trem2 in developing effective therapies against neurodegenerative diseases.

">Melanin-concentrating hormone promotes feeding through the lateral septum</a></h4>

              
                Feeding is necessary for survival but can be hindered by anxiety or fear, thus neural systems that can regulate anxiety states are key to elucidating the expression of food-related behaviors. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a neuropeptide produced in the lateral hypothalamus that promotes feeding and anxiogenesis. The orexigenic actions of MCH that prolong ongoing homeostatic or hedonic feeding are context-dependent and more prominent in male than female rodents, but it is not clear where MCH acts to initiate feeding. The lateral septum (LS) promotes feeding and suppresses anxiogenesis when inhibited, and it comprises the densest projections from MCH neurons. However, it is not known whether the LS is a major contributor to MCH-mediated feeding. As MCH inhibits LS cells by MCH receptor (MCHR1) activation, MCH may promote feeding via the LS. We bilaterally infused MCH into the LS and found that MCH elicited a rapid and long-lasting increase in the consumption of standard chow and a palatable, high sugar diet in male and female mice; these MCH effects were blocked by the co-administration of a MCHR1 antagonist TC- MCH 7c. Interestingly, the orexigenic effect of MCH was abolished in a novel, anxiogenic environment even when presented with a food reward, but MCH did not induce anxiety-like behaviors. These findings indicated the LS as a novel region underlying orexigenic MCH actions, which stimulated and enhanced feeding in both sexes in a context -dependent manner that was most prominent in the homecage.

">Discriminating neural ensemble patterns through dendritic computations in randomly connected feedforward networks</a></h4>

              
                Co-active or temporally ordered neural ensembles are a signature of salient sensory, motor, and cognitive events. Local convergence of such patterned activity as synaptic clusters on dendrites could help single neurons harness the potential of dendritic nonlinearities to decode neural activity patterns. We combined theory and simulations to assess the likelihood of whether projections from neural ensembles could converge onto synaptic clusters even in networks with random connectivity. Using rat hippocampal and cortical network statistics, we show that clustered convergence of axons from 3-4 different co-active ensembles is likely even in randomly connected networks, leading to representation of arbitrary input combinations in at least ten target neurons in a 100,000 population. In the presence of larger ensembles, spatiotemporally ordered convergence of 3-5 axons from temporally ordered ensembles is also likely. These active clusters result in higher neuronal activation in the presence of strong dendritic nonlinearities and low background activity. We mathematically and computationally demonstrate a tight interplay between network connectivity, spatiotemporal scales of subcellular electrical and chemical mechanisms, dendritic nonlinearities, and uncorrelated background activity. We suggest that dendritic clustered and sequence computation is pervasive, but its expression as somatic selectivity requires confluence of physiology, background activity, and connectomics.

">FDA-Approved MEK1/2 Inhibitor, Trametinib, Protects Mice from Cisplatin and Noise-Induced Hearing Loss</a></h4>

              
                Hearing loss is one of the most common types of disability; however, there is only one FDA-approved drug to prevent any type of hearing loss. Treatment with the highly effective chemotherapy agent, cisplatin, and exposure to high decibel noises are two of the most common causes of hearing loss. The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, a phosphorylation cascade consisting of RAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, has been implicated in both types of hearing loss. Pharmacologically inhibiting BRAF or ERK1/2 is protective from noise and cisplatin-induced hearing loss in multiple mouse models. Trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, protects from cisplatin induced outer hair cell death in mouse cochlear explants; however, to the best of our knowledge, inhibiting MEK1/2 has not yet been shown to be protective from hearing loss in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that trametinib protects from cisplatin-induced hearing loss in a translationally relevant mouse model and does not interfere with cisplatin's tumor killing efficacy in cancer cell lines. Higher doses of trametinib were toxic to mice when combined with cisplatin but lower doses of the drug were protective from hearing loss without any known toxicity. Trametinib also protected mice from noise-induced hearing loss and synaptic damage. This study shows that MEK1/2 inhibition protects from both insults of hearing loss and that targeting all three kinases in the MAPK pathway protect from cisplatin and noise-induced hearing loss in mice.

">Facial expression recognition is modulated by approach-avoidance behavior</a></h4>

              
                Facial expression recognition influences approach-avoidance behaviors, but do approach-avoidance behaviors affect facial expression recognition? We conducted psychophysical experiments to this end, indicating a reverse causal relationship. In a virtual reality space, 3D face stimulus facial expressions varied on seven level, from happy to angry in Experiments 1 and 3 and from happy to fearful in Experiment 2. Participants were asked to perform according to one of the following conditions in response to the stimulus. Participants 1) approached (one-meter forward), 2) avoided (one-meter backward), 3) were approached by, or 4) were avoided by the 3D model. Then, participants selected facial expressions. Experiment 1 revealed that participants recognized the face as angrier when they avoided it rather than when it avoided them. Experiment 2 showed that participants recognized the face as happy when approaching and fearful when avoiding, irrespective of who acted. Experiment 3 revealed that participants recognized the face as angrier when the face approached them rather than when they approached if both parties were physically close. Accordingly, approach-avoidance behavior changes facial expression recognition, indicating a reverse causal relationship. We posit that unconscious learning rooted in biological instincts creates this connection.

                Background: The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is hypothesized to be relatively spared in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). Yet, detailed examination of MTL subfield volumes and drivers of atrophy in amnestic EOAD is lacking. Methods: BioFINDER-2 participants with memory impairment, abnormal amyloid-beta status and tau-PET were included. Forty-one EOAD individuals aged <65 years and, as comparison, late-onset AD (LOAD, >70 years, n=154) and amyloid-beta-negative cognitively unimpaired controls were included. MTL subregions and biomarkers of (co-)pathologies were measured. Results: AD groups showed smaller MTL subregions compared to controls. Atrophy patterns were similar across AD groups, although LOAD showed thinner entorhinal cortices compared to EOAD. EOAD showed lower WMH compared to LOAD. No differences in MTL tau-PET or transactive response DNA binding protein 43-proxy positivity was found. Conclusions: We found in vivo evidence for MTL atrophy in amnestic EOAD and overall similar levels to LOAD of MTL tau pathology and co-pathologies.

">Opioid Modulation of Differential Gene Expression and Neuronal Differentiation in the Ventricular-Subventricular Zone of Adult Male Zebra Finches</a></h4>

              
                The endogenous opioid system modulates diverse functions including pain, physiological functions and motivation. We had earlier demonstrated an increase in cell proliferation in the neurogenic niche of adult male zebra finches, following administration of the general opioid antagonist, naloxone. Since the mechanisms underlying opioid modulation of neurogenesis are poorly understood, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying cell proliferation differentiation induced by the opioid system. Systemic naloxone or vehicle administration in adult male birds was followed by a whole transcriptome microarray assay of the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). The analysis revealed 26 differentially expressed transcripts (expression fold change [&ge;] 1.5), encoding genes important for neuronal functions. The transcriptomics analysis using microarray identified a significant increase in the expression of precursor miRNA tgu-mir-124-201 transcript following inhibition of opioid receptors by naloxone. Our results suggested that the administration of naloxone triggers an increase in the expression of the pro-differentiating microRNA, miR-124, in the brains of adult zebra finches. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that the expression of miR-124-3p was higher in the V-SVZ of naloxone-treated versus control birds. Furthermore, the density of neuroblasts was higher in the ventral V-SVZ adjacent to the striatal nucleus Area X, but not in the V-SVZ above the pallial nucleus, HVC, both of which are involved in singing. Since miR-124 targets signalling pathways important for neuronal proliferation and differentiation, our findings suggest that microRNA-124 may be involved in the increase in neurogenesis in adult songbirds induced by altering opioid modulation.

">Cerebellar control over inter-regional excitatory/inhibitory dynamics discriminates execution from observation of an action</a></h4>

              
                The motor learning theory anticipates that cerebro-cerebellar loops perform sensorimotor prediction thereby regulating motor control. This operation has been identified during action execution (AE) and observation (AO) but the causal interaction between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex remained unclear. Here we used Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) to study functional MRI (fMRI) data obtained during a squeeze ball task in either the AE or AO conditions. In both cases, active regions included bilateral primary visual cortex (V1), left primary motor cortex (M1), left supplementary motor and premotor cortex (SMAPMC), left cingulate cortex (CC), left superior parietal lobule (SPL), and right cerebellum (CRBL). AE and AO networks showed the same fixed effective connectivity, with pathways between V1, CRBL, SMAPMC and CC wired in a closed loop. However, the cerebellar communication towards the cerebral cortex switched from excitatory in AE to inhibitory in AO. Moreover, in AE only, signal modulation was non-linear from SMAPMC to CRBL and within the CRBL self-connection, supporting the role of the CRBL in elaborating motor plans received from SMAPMC. Thus, the need for motor planning and the presence of a sensorimotor feedback in AE discriminate the modality of forward control operated by the CRBL on SMAPMC. While the underlying circuit mechanisms remain to be determined, these results reveal that the CRBL differentially controls the excitatory/inhibitory dynamics of inter-regional effective connectivity depending on its functional engagement, opening new prospective for the design of artificial sensorimotor controllers and for the investigation of neurological diseases.

">Targeting DBS to the centrolateral thalamic nucleus improves movement in a lesion-based model of acquired cerebellar dystonia in mice</a></h4>

              
                Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder and an incapacitating co-morbidity in a variety of neurologic conditions. Dystonia can be caused by genetic, degenerative, idiopathic, and acquired etiologies, which are hypothesized to converge on a dystonia network consisting of the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. In acquired dystonia, focal lesions to subcortical areas in the network - the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum - lead to a dystonia that can be difficult to manage with canonical treatments, including deep brain stimulation (DBS). While studies in animal models have begun to parse the contribution of individual nodes in the dystonia network, how acquired injury to the cerebellar outflow tracts instigates dystonia; and how network modulation interacts with symptom latency remain as unexplored questions. Here, we present an electrolytic lesioning paradigm that bilaterally targets the cerebellar outflow tracts. We found that lesioning these tracts, at the junction of the superior cerebellar peduncles and the medial and intermediate cerebellar nuclei, resulted in acute, severe dystonia. We observed that dystonia is reduced with one hour of DBS of the centrolateral thalamic nucleus, a first order node in the network downstream of the cerebellar nuclei. In contrast, one hour of stimulation at a second order node in the short latency, disynaptic projection from the cerebellar nuclei, the striatum, did not modulate the dystonia in the short-term. Our study introduces a robust paradigm for inducing acute, severe dystonia, and demonstrates that targeted modulation based on network principles powerfully rescues motor behavior. These data inspire the identification of therapeutic targets for difficult to manage acquired dystonia.

">Investigating neurometabolite changes in response to median nerve stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Rhythmic median nerve stimulation (MNS) at 10Hz has been shown to cause a substantial reduction in tic frequency in individuals with Tourette Syndrome. The mechanism of action is currently unknown, but is hypothesised to involve entrainment of oscillations within the sensorimotor cortex. Objective: We used functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) to explore the dynamic effects of MNS on neurometabolite concentrations. Methods: Here, we investigated the effects of rhythmic and arrhythmic 10Hz MNS on glutamate (Glu) and GABA concentrations in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex in 15 healthy controls, using a blocked fMRS design. We used a Mescher-Garwood-semi-localised by adiabatic selective refocusing (MEGA-sLASER) sequence at 7T. Results: Our results show no difference in the difference-from-baseline measures between the two stimulation conditions. Looking at the effect of MNS over both conditions there is a trend for an initial increase in Glu/tCr (total creatine) followed by a decrease over time, whereas GABA/tCr decreased during each stimulation block. Conclusion: These results suggest that despite entrainment of oscillations during rhythmic MNS, there are no significant differences in the tonic neuromodulatory effects of rhythmic and arrhythmic stimulation. The reduction in glutamate over the course of stimulation may reflect a decrease in glutamatergic firing due to adaptation. This may make it less likely that an involuntary movement is generated during continuous stimulation.

                Methamphetamine (METH) induces reward effects. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a role in regulating top-down. The hippocampus is closely involved reward memory. However, the direct projects from the PFC to the hippocampus have not been studied well. Here, we use conditioned place preference (CPP), a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9 (rAAV2/9) and optogenetic approaches to explore a role in METH-CPP for a novel pathway projecting from the medial prefrontal prelimbic cortex (PrL) directly to the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1). Expressing CaMKII-ChR2 or CaMKII-eNpHR3.0 in the PrL and optically stimulating in the dCA1 blocks or enhances METH-CPP, respectively. Moreover, silencing the PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway with tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) enhances METH-CPP. These results identify a novel PrL-to-dCA1 glutamatergic pathway regulating METH-CPP.

">Dynamic valuation bias explains social influence on cheating behavior</a></h4>

              
                Observing immoral behavior increases one's dishonesty by social influence and learning processes. The neurocomputational mechanisms underlying such moral contagion remain unclear. We tested different mechanistic hypotheses to account for moral contagion. We used model-based fMRI and a new cheating game in which participants were sequentially placed in honest and dishonest social norm contexts. Participants' cheating behavior increased in the dishonest norm context but was unchanged in the honest. The best model to account for behavior indicated that participants' valuation was dynamically biased by learning that others had cheated. At the time of choice, the internalization of social norms was implemented in the lateral prefrontal cortex and biased valuations of cheating. During learning, simulation of others' cheating behavior was encoded in the posterior superior temporal sulcus. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how learning about others' dishonesty biases individuals' valuation of cheating but does not alter one's established preferences.

">IK channel confers fine-tuning of rod bipolar cell excitation and synaptic transmission in the retina</a></h4>

              
                During retinal visual processing, rod bipolar cells (RBCs) transfer scotopic signals from rods to AII amacrine cells as second-order neurons. Elucidation of the RBC excitation/inhibition is essential for understanding the visual signal transmission. Although excitation and extrinsic inhibitory mechanisms have been studied, intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. We focused on RBC's prominent K+ current, which exhibits voltage and Ca2+ dependence. We isolated and confirmed intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IK) and in RBCs using the patch-clamp method with IK inhibitors (clotrimazole and TRAM34). The regulation of the IK current primarily relies on Ca2+ influx via low-threshold Ca2+ channels during RBC excitation. It mediates RBC repolarization and oscillation, enabling fast and transient synaptic transmission to AII amacrine cells. Our findings highlight the unique role of the IK channel in RBC, suggesting that it plays a critical role in the scotopic pathway by fine-tuning RBC activity.

	<p>In the processing of emotions, the brain prepares and reacts in distinctive manners depending upon the negative or positive nuance of the emotion elicitors. Previous investigations showed that negative elicitors generally evoke more intense neural activities than positive and neutral ones, as reflected in the augmented amplitude of all sub-components of the event-related potentials (ERP) late posterior positivity (LPP) complex, while less is known about the emotion of disgust. The present study aimed to examine whether the LPP complex during the processing of disgust stimuli showed greater amplitude than other emotion elicitors with negative or positive valences, thus confirming it as a neural marker of disgust-related negativity bias at earlier or later stages. Thus, in the present study, we leveraged the ERP technique during the execution of an affective self-administered visual stimuli task to disentangle the neural contributions associated with images of positive, negative, disgust, or neutral images. Crucially, we showed that handling with disgust elicitors prompted the greatest neural activity and the highest delay during self-administration. Overall, we demonstrated progressive neural activities associated with the unpleasantness of the emotion elicitors and peculiar processing for disgust compared with all other emotions.</p>

	<p>The utility of transcranial sonography (TCS) remains unclarified for the auxiliary diagnosis of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). We investigated iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and TCS during the examination and diagnosis of high-signal-intensity substantia nigra lesion (HSI-SNL) incidence in PD patients previously diagnosed with dopamine transporter scintigraphy (DAT). The subjects were 67 patients with definitively diagnosed PD after DAT evaluation. Patients with midbrain substantia nigra visible during TCS who previously underwent MIBG were analyzed. The SN+ group comprised patients with extensive pathological HSI-SNL of Okawa class III/IV observed during TCS. The MIBG+ group comprised patients with a heart-to-mediastinum ratio of &amp;amp;le;2.2 during MIBG. TCS was performed to divide patients into the SN+ and SN&amp;amp;minus; groups, and patient characteristics and MIBG findings were compared between the groups. PD was definitively diagnosed in 67 patients, among whom midbrain was visualized during TCS in 43 (64.1%) patients and pathological HSI-SNL was observed in 24 (35.8%). The MIBG findings were normal in six patients (27.3%) with HSI-SNL, and abnormal in seven (63.6%) without HSI-SNL. No significant differences were noted by Okawa classification in clinical characteristics based on the presence or absence of HSI-SNL. Multiple patients with normal findings during MIBG may have HSI-SNL. Thus, confirmatory imaging of HSI-SNL with TCS may be useful for diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Background: This work aimed to study the Village Test (VT) in a group of patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and compare the results with those of a group of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls. Methods: A total of 50 patients with AD, 28 patients with MCI, and 38 controls were evaluated. All participants underwent the VT and an extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Results: The mean ages of the participants were 74.4 years for those with AD, 74 for those with MCI, and 70.2 for the controls. The AD group built smaller and essential villages with a scarce use of pieces, a poor use of dynamic pieces, and scarce use of human figures. All constructions were often concentrated in the center of the table. Conclusions: The villages built by the AD group represent a cognitive and affective coarctation and indicate a sense of existential disorientation and isolation. The VT is a useful aid for getting in touch with the inner emotional and existential states of patients with AD, and it could represent a complementary screening tool for orienting cognitive impairment diagnoses.</p>

	<p>The role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is not well understood, even though it is critical for neuronal structure and signaling. This systematic review identified the top deregulated ECM-related pathways in studies that used gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) to document transcriptomic, proteomic, or genomic alterations in PD. PubMed and Google scholar were searched for transcriptomics, proteomics, or genomics studies that employed GSEA on data from PD tissues or cells and reported ECM-related pathways among the top-10 most enriched versus controls. Twenty-seven studies were included, two of which used multiple omics analyses. Transcriptomics and proteomics studies were conducted on a variety of tissue and cell types. Of the 17 transcriptomics studies (16 data sets), 13 identified one or more adhesion pathways in the top-10 deregulated gene sets or pathways, primarily related to cell adhesion and focal adhesion. Among the 8 proteomics studies, 5 identified altered overarching ECM gene sets or pathways among the top 10. Among the 4 genomics studies, 3 identified focal adhesion pathways among the top 10. The findings summarized here suggest that ECM organization/structure and cell adhesion (particularly focal adhesion) are altered in PD and should be the focus of future studies.</p>

	<p>Background: We aimed to study anxiety, depression and quality of life in smokers after stroke by sex. Methods: A longitudinal prospective study with a 24-month follow-up of acute stroke patients who were previously active smokers. Anxiety and depression were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, and quality of life was evaluated with the EQ-5D questionnaire. Results: One hundred and eighty patients participated (79.4% men); their mean age was 57.6 years. Anxiety was most prevalent at 3 months (18.9% in men and 40.5% in women) and depression at 12 months (17.9% in men and 27% in women). The worst perceived health occurred at 24 months (EQ-VAS 67.5 in men and 65.1 in women), which was associated with depression (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and Rankin Scale was worse in men (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and depression in women (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Continued tobacco use was associated with worse perceived health at 3 months in men (p = 0.034) and at 12 months in both sexes. Predictor variables of worse perceived health at 24 months remaining at 3 and 12 months were tobacco use in men and neurological damage in women. Conclusion: Differences by sex are observed in the prevalence of anxiety and depression and associated factors and in the predictive factors of perceived health.</p>

	<p>Excessive and prolonged alcohol use can have long-term severe neurological consequences. The mechanisms involved may be complicated; however, new evidence seems to indicate the involvement of iron accumulation and neuroinflammation. Prolonged alcohol consumption has been linked to the accumulation of iron in specific regions of the brain. Evidence suggests that excess iron in the brain can trigger microglia activation in response. This activation leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, which can cause damage to neurons and surrounding brain tissue. Additionally, iron-induced oxidative stress and inflammation can disrupt the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier, allowing immune cells from the periphery to infiltrate the brain. This infiltration can lead to further neuroinflammatory responses. Inflammation in the brain subsequently disrupts neuronal networks, impairs synaptic plasticity, and accelerates neuronal cell death. Consequently, cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and decision-making are compromised. Additionally, chronic neuroinflammation can hasten the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, further exacerbating cognitive impairment. Therefore, alcohol could act as a trigger for iron-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Overall, the mechanisms at play here seem to strongly link alcohol with cognitive decline, with neuroinflammation resulting from alcohol-induced iron accumulation playing a pivotal role.</p>

	<p>Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a multisystemic, rare, inherited, progressive and adult-onset disease, affecting the sensory-motor nerves, heart, autonomic function, and other organs. There are over 130 mutations known in the TTR gene. The His90Asn mutation has been previously reported in several reports, but its pathogenetic role is still debated. We report two sporadic cases of adult women with a heterozygous His90Asn mutation in TTR gene and neurological involvement extensively investigated. A typical Congo red-positive pathologic deposition of amyloid fibrils in the salivary glands was documented in one subject. Patients were successfully treated with patisiran with a good clinical outcome. These data support a pathogenetic role of His90Asn mutation in hATTR, and suggest early treatment in symptomatic carriers of His90Asn mutation.</p>

                Background Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) co-morbidity is one of the rising public health problems. There is growing evidence that DM is an important risk factor for TB. This study was carried out to know the prevalence of DM among newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients registered in District Tuberculosis Centre and to assess the risk factors of DM among TB patients. Methods In a cross-sectional study, newly detected sputum positive pulmonary TB patients were screened for DM (those having symptoms of DM). Furthermore, they were diagnosed by detecting blood glucose levels (≥200 mg/dL). Mean, standard deviation (SD), Chi-squared and Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact tests were used to determine the significant associations. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results A total of 215 TB patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DM among TB patients was found to be 23.7% (2.8% known and 97.8% new cases). Significant associations were found between age (>46 years old), educational status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, presence of DM symptoms and family history of DM. Conclusions Routine screening for DM is mandatory due to its increasing prevalence, which may help in early diagnosis and to reduce complications by proper management that in turn helps in the successful outcome of TB treatment.

                Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a potentially malignant disorder, is developed by progressive fibrous tissue deposition in connective tissue along with atrophy of oral mucosa. Histological sections also show the mast cell infiltration in submucosa which may indicate their possible role in this entity. Abundant availability of biochemicals in mast cells like histamine and serine proteases like chymase may be released and play specific pathways in the disease pathophysiology. Possibly, if the histamine release has some part to play, diamine oxidase may also be found to have a relationship as it metabolizes histamine. The present study is proposed to identify the presence of chymase, histamine, and diamine oxidase in both, serum as well as tissue by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) respectively. This study may provide probable insight into the mast cell-related chemicals and their association with OSMF.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-518/v1?src=rss">The development of a roadmap for Health Technology Assessment implementation in Moldova [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Moldova strives for universal health coverage (UHC) and considers health technology assessment (HTA) an important policy instrument to inform the choice of services that should be covered to progressively realize UHC. It plays a key role in determining which technologies are coved, considering various dimensions often including cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and feasibility. This paper reports on work undertaken to develop a roadmap for HTA implementation, using evidence-informed deliberative processes (EDPs) as the guiding framework. Methods Between 2020 and 2022, we undertook several activities that informed the roadmap. We conducted a needs assessment and an assessment of European HTA best practices using a combination of desk research, interviews and surveys. We then conducted a document review of six selected HTA systems, complimented by expert interviews from three neighbouring countries. Results The roadmap provided a suggested HTA process, which included instructions on how to execute the different steps of the EDP framework to enhance the legitimacy of HTA-informed decision-making. The roadmap encompasses several aspects such as how to organize stakeholder involvement, how to identify and operationalize decision criteria, and how to make the decision process transparent. Guidance was given to the country on establishing a legal framework for HTA; a communication strategy; strengthening capacity and leveraging HTA expertise. The country was also given tailored advice on the positioning of the HTA-agency, first as an entity within the Ministry of Health or the National Agency of Public Health but with the long-term vision for it to be independent of any state institution. Conclusions Despite several challenges, including a partial disruption because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the development of the roadmap for HTA implementation was completed and agreed upon by the Ministry of Health in Moldova. This work has helped motivate and support the country in HTA institutionalization.

                Background This study aimed to determine the relationships between hematological parameters- hemoglobin, Total Leucocyte Counts (TLC), platelet counts, Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC), Absolute Lymphocyte Counts (ALC), Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index (SII), Neutrophil Monocyte Ratio (NMR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and the severity of COVID 19 infections and their use in predicting severity of COVID-19 infections. Methods and Material This was a prospective, observational, single-center study of 573 symptomatic adult inpatients of COVID 19 admitted to our tertiary care center. Statistical analysis used The above-mentioned hematological parameter levels were noted and compared between the two categories of COVID-19 infection, namely non-severe and severe COVID-19 using logistic regression methods. Their cut-off values were detected using the ROC curve. Results The median TLC, ANC, NLR, SII, NMR, PLR were notably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that NMR (OR=1.029, p=0.006) and ALC (OR=0.999, p=0.002) were statistically significant independent predictors of COVID-19 severity Conclusions The hematological parameters mentioned, can be used for predicting severe COVID-19 infections at admission. ALC and NMR levels could be used as hematological markers to predict severity of COVID-19 in adult patients with their cut off values being < 1105 cells/cubic millimeter and > 10.434 respectively.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Premature newborns are susceptible to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a vasoproliferative disease of the developing retinal vessels, which is a major cause of potentially avoidable blindness. Due to geographical variations in newborn care, geographic variations in the epidemiology of ROP have been observed internationally during the last several decades. There was a correlation between the severity of the condition and the number of prenatal, postnatal, and other risk factors. This study aimed to examine the incidence and risk factors associated with retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants. Methods A retrospective review of preterm newborns evaluated for retinopathy of prematurity between January 2016 and December 2022 was carried out at King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Khobar, Saudi Arabia. Infants who fulfilled the screening criteria (GA < 34 or Birth Weight (WT) ≤ 1500 g) underwent the screening test, and the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity was used to classify retinopathy of prematurity. Risk factors and demographic information regarding ROP were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 20) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Among the 200 preterm neonates that were evaluated and admitted to neonatal critical care units, 37% exhibited premature retinopathy, with 46.7% of those cases being in stage 1. The development of ROP was linked to gestational age, length of mechanical ventilation, septicemia, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory distress syndrome, and septicemia, according to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Conclusion The incidence of total retinopathy in premature infants in this population was 37%. Evaluating these risk factors during the screening of high-risk premature infants will help determine the appropriate timing of examinations and treatment.

                Background Septic shock is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction, with fluid resuscitation being a cornerstone of management. However, indiscriminate fluid administration can lead to fluid overload and worsen outcomes. Extravascular lung water (EVLW) estimation by lung ultrasound has emerged as a promising tool for guiding fluid therapy in septic shock, allowing clinicians to assess pulmonary edema and tailor resuscitation strategies accordingly. Methods This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the utility of EVLW estimation by lung ultrasound in guiding fluid resuscitation therapy in adult patients with septic shock admitted to a rural tertiary care teaching hospital. Eligible patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) will undergo baseline demographic and clinical assessments, including lung ultrasound, to quantify EVLW using B-line analysis. Fluid resuscitation therapy will be initiated based on EVLW findings, with subsequent adjustments guided by repeat lung ultrasound examinations at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-initiation. Outcome measures include changes in mean PaO2/FiO2 ratios, respiratory parameters, renal function, fluid balance, and mortality rates. Expected Outcome We anticipate that EVLW-guided fluid resuscitation therapy will lead to more precise and tailored management of septic shock, potentially reducing the incidence of fluid overload, ARDS, and renal dysfunction. By optimizing fluid management strategies based on individual patient characteristics and responses, we aim to improve clinical outcomes and enhance the delivery of care for patients with septic shock.

The self-organization of cells relies on the profound complexity of protein-protein interactions. Challenges in directly observing these events have hindered progress toward understanding their diverse behaviors. One notable example is the interaction between molecular motors and cytoskeletal systems that combine to perform a variety of cellular functions. In this work, we leverage theory and experiments to identify and quantify the rate-limiting mechanism of the initial association between a cargo-bound kinesin motor and a microtubule track. Recent advances in optical tweezers provide binding times for several lengths of kinesin motors trapped at varying distances from a microtubule, empowering the investigation of competing models. We first explore a diffusion-limited model of binding. Through Brownian dynamics simulations and simulation-based inference, we find this simple diffusion model fails to explain the experimental binding times, but an extended model that accounts for the ADP state of the molecular motor agrees closely with the data, even under the scrutiny of penalizing for additional model complexity. We provide quantification of both kinetic rates and biophysical parameters underlying the proposed binding process. Our model suggests that a typical binding event is limited by ADP state rather than physical search. Lastly, we predict how these association rates can be modulated in distinct ways through variation of environmental concentrations and physical properties.

                <p>by Maria J. Hagelaars, Milica Nikolic, Maud Vermeulen, Sylvia Dekker, Carlijn V. C. Bouten, Sandra Loerakker</p>

Apical-basal polarization in renal epithelial cells is crucial to renal function and an important trigger for tubule formation in kidney development. Loss of polarity can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which can lead to kidney pathologies. Understanding the relative and combined roles of the involved proteins and their interactions that govern epithelial polarity may provide insights for controlling the process of polarization via chemical or mechanical manipulations in an <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i> setting. Here, we developed a computational framework that integrates several known interactions between integrins, Rho-GTPases Rho, Rac and Cdc42, and polarity complexes Par and Scribble, to study their mutual roles in the emergence of polarization. The modeled protein interactions were shown to induce the emergence of polarized distributions of Rho-GTPases, which in turn led to the accumulation of apical and basal polarity complexes Par and Scribble at their respective poles, effectively recapitulating polarization. Our multiparametric sensitivity analysis suggested that polarization depends foremost on the mutual inhibition between Rac and Rho. Next, we used the computational framework to investigate the role of integrins and GTPases in the generation and disruption of polarization. We found that a minimum concentration of integrins is required to catalyze the process of polarization. Furthermore, loss of polarization was found to be only inducible via complete degradation of the Rho-GTPases Rho and Cdc42, suggesting that polarization is fairly stable once it is established. Comparison of our computational predictions against data from <i>in vitro</i> experiments in which we induced EMT in renal epithelial cells while quantifying the relative Rho-GTPase levels, displayed that EMT coincides with a large reduction in the Rho-GTPase Rho. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential roles of integrins and Rho-GTPases in the establishment and disruption of apical-basal polarity and thereby provide handles for the <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i> regulation of polarity.

Recent pandemics like COVID-19 highlighted the importance of rapidly developing diagnostics to detect evolving pathogens. CRISPR-Cas technology has recently been used to develop diagnostic assays for sequence-specific recognition of DNA or RNA. These assays have similar sensitivity to the gold standard qPCR but can be deployed as easy to use and inexpensive test strips. However, the discovery of diagnostic regions of a genome flanked by conserved regions where primers can be designed requires extensive bioinformatic analyses of genome sequences. We developed the Python package krisp to aid in the discovery of primers and diagnostic sequences that differentiate groups of samples from each other, using either unaligned genome sequences or a variant call format (VCF) file as input. Krisp has been optimized to handle large datasets by using efficient algorithms that run in near linear time, use minimal RAM, and leverage parallel processing when available. The validity of krisp results has been demonstrated in the laboratory with the successful design of a CRISPR diagnostic assay to distinguish the sudden oak death pathogen <i>Phytophthora ramorum</i> from closely related <i>Phytophthora</i> species. Krisp is released open source under a permissive license with all the documentation needed to quickly design CRISPR-Cas diagnostic assays.

                <p>by Alexander Kroll, Sahasra Ranjan, Martin J. Lercher</p>

The activities of most enzymes and drugs depend on interactions between proteins and small molecules. Accurate prediction of these interactions could greatly accelerate pharmaceutical and biotechnological research. Current machine learning models designed for this task have a limited ability to generalize beyond the proteins used for training. This limitation is likely due to a lack of information exchange between the protein and the small molecule during the generation of the required numerical representations. Here, we introduce ProSmith, a machine learning framework that employs a multimodal Transformer Network to simultaneously process protein amino acid sequences and small molecule strings in the same input. This approach facilitates the exchange of all relevant information between the two molecule types during the computation of their numerical representations, allowing the model to account for their structural and functional interactions. Our final model combines gradient boosting predictions based on the resulting multimodal Transformer Network with independent predictions based on separate deep learning representations of the proteins and small molecules. The resulting predictions outperform recently published state-of-the-art models for predicting protein-small molecule interactions across three diverse tasks: predicting kinase inhibitions; inferring potential substrates for enzymes; and predicting Michaelis constants <i>K</i><sub>M</sub>. The Python code provided can be used to easily implement and improve machine learning predictions involving arbitrary protein-small molecule interactions.

                <p>by James Ryu, Amin Nejatbakhsh, Mahdi Torkashvand, Sahana Gangadharan, Maedeh Seyedolmohadesin, Jinmahn Kim, Liam Paninski, Vivek Venkatachalam</p>

Tracking body parts in behaving animals, extracting fluorescence signals from cells embedded in deforming tissue, and analyzing cell migration patterns during development all require tracking objects with partially correlated motion. As dataset sizes increase, manual tracking of objects becomes prohibitively inefficient and slow, necessitating automated and semi-automated computational tools. Unfortunately, existing methods for multiple object tracking (MOT) are either developed for specific datasets and hence do not generalize well to other datasets, or require large amounts of training data that are not readily available. This is further exacerbated when tracking fluorescent sources in moving and deforming tissues, where the lack of unique features and sparsely populated images create a challenging environment, especially for modern deep learning techniques. By leveraging technology recently developed for spatial transformer networks, we propose ZephIR, an image registration framework for semi-supervised MOT in 2D and 3D videos. ZephIR can generalize to a wide range of biological systems by incorporating adjustable parameters that encode spatial (sparsity, texture, rigidity) and temporal priors of a given data class. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach in a variety of applications, including tracking the body parts of a behaving mouse and neurons in the brain of a freely moving <i>C. elegans</i>. We provide an open-source package along with a web-based graphical user interface that allows users to provide small numbers of annotations to interactively improve tracking results.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011543">Interpretable metric learning in comparative metagenomics: The adaptive Haar-like distance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Evan D. Gorman, Manuel E. Lladser</p>

Random forests have emerged as a promising tool in comparative metagenomics because they can predict environmental characteristics based on microbial composition in datasets where <i>β</i>-diversity metrics fall short of revealing meaningful relationships between samples. Nevertheless, despite this efficacy, they lack biological insight in tandem with their predictions, potentially hindering scientific advancement. To overcome this limitation, we leverage a geometric characterization of random forests to introduce a data-driven phylogenetic <i>β</i>-diversity metric, the adaptive Haar-like distance. This new metric assigns a weight to each internal node (i.e., split or bifurcation) of a reference phylogeny, indicating the relative importance of that node in discerning environmental samples based on their microbial composition. Alongside this, a weighted nearest-neighbors classifier, constructed using the adaptive metric, can be used as a proxy for the random forest while maintaining accuracy on par with that of the original forest and another state-of-the-art classifier, CoDaCoRe. As shown in datasets from diverse microbial environments, however, the new metric and classifier significantly enhance the biological interpretability and visualization of high-dimensional metagenomic samples.

<i>Where’s Whaledo</i> is a software toolkit that uses a combination of automated processes and user interfaces to greatly accelerate the process of reconstructing animal tracks from arrays of passive acoustic recording devices. Passive acoustic localization is a non-invasive yet powerful way to contribute to species conservation. By tracking animals through their acoustic signals, important information on diving patterns, movement behavior, habitat use, and feeding dynamics can be obtained. This method is useful for helping to understand habitat use, observe behavioral responses to noise, and develop potential mitigation strategies. Animal tracking using passive acoustic localization requires an acoustic array to detect signals of interest, associate detections on various receivers, and estimate the most likely source location by using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of sounds on multiple receivers. <i>Where’s Whaledo</i> combines data from two small-aperture volumetric arrays and a variable number of individual receivers. In a case study conducted in the Tanner Basin off Southern California, we demonstrate the effectiveness of <i>Where’s Whaledo</i> in localizing groups of <i>Ziphius cavirostris</i>. We reconstruct the tracks of six individual animals vocalizing concurrently and identify <i>Ziphius cavirostris</i> tracks despite being obscured by a large pod of vocalizing dolphins.

                <p>by Sanjeevani Choudhery, Michael A. DeJesus, Aarthi Srinivasan, Jeremy Rock, Dirk Schnappinger, Thomas R. Ioerger</p>

An important application of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology is for identifying chemical-genetic interactions (CGIs). Discovery of genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics can yield insights to drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. The objective is to identify CRISPRi mutants whose relative abundance is suppressed (or enriched) in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, reflecting synergistic behavior. Different sgRNAs for a given target can induce a wide range of protein depletion and differential effects on growth rate. The effect of sgRNA strength can be partially predicted based on sequence features. However, the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein. For essential genes, sgRNA efficiency can be empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth rate. We observe that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity, producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength (and less so for sgRNAs that induce too much or too little target depletion). To capture this interaction, we propose a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR (for Dose-Response model) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation. We use CRISPRi-DR to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> to identify genes that interact with antibiotics. This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, which we show via an CRISPRi dataset for <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> growth on different carbon sources. The performance is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods. However, for noisier datasets, some of these methods generate far more significant interactions, likely including many false positives, whereas CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision, which we observed in both empirical and simulated data.

                <p>by Jacob L. Steenwyk, Nicole King</p>

Reconstructing the tree of life remains a central goal in biology. Early methods, which relied on small numbers of morphological or genetic characters, often yielded conflicting evolutionary histories, undermining confidence in the results. Investigations based on phylogenomics, which use hundreds to thousands of loci for phylogenetic inquiry, have provided a clearer picture of life’s history, but certain branches remain problematic. To resolve difficult nodes on the tree of life, 2 recent studies tested the utility of synteny, the conserved collinearity of orthologous genetic loci in 2 or more organisms, for phylogenetics. Synteny exhibits compelling phylogenomic potential while also raising new challenges. This Essay identifies and discusses specific opportunities and challenges that bear on the value of synteny data and other rare genomic changes for phylogenomic studies. Synteny-based analyses of highly contiguous genome assemblies mark a new chapter in the phylogenomic era and the quest to reconstruct the tree of life.

Alkenyl oxindoles have been characterized as autophagosome-tethering compounds (ATTECs), which can target mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) for lysosomal degradation. In order to expand the application of alkenyl oxindoles for targeted protein degradation, we designed and synthesized a series of heterobifunctional compounds by conjugating different alkenyl oxindoles with bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor JQ1. Through structure-activity relationship study, we successfully developed JQ1-alkenyl oxindole conjugates that potently degrade BRD4. Unexpectedly, we found that these molecules degrade BRD4 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, rather than the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Using pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening, we revealed that JQ1-alkenyl oxindole conjugates recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4<sup>DCAF11</sup> for substrate degradation. Furthermore, we validated the most potent heterobifunctional molecule HL435 as a promising drug-like lead compound to exert antitumor activity both in vitro and in a mouse xenograft tumor model. Our research provides new employable proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) moieties for targeted protein degradation, providing new possibilities for drug discovery.

                <p>by Sofie De Schrijver, Thomas Decramer, Peter Janssen</p>

Neurons responding during action execution and action observation were discovered in the ventral premotor cortex 3 decades ago. However, the visual features that drive the responses of action observation/execution neurons (AOENs) have not been revealed at present. We investigated the neural responses of AOENs in ventral premotor area F5c of 4 macaques during the observation of action videos and crucial control stimuli. The large majority of AOENs showed highly phasic responses during the action videos, with a preference for the moment that the hand made contact with the object. They also responded to an abstract shape moving towards but not interacting with an object, even when the shape moved on a scrambled background, implying that most AOENs in F5c do not require the perception of causality or a meaningful action. Additionally, the majority of AOENs responded to static frames of the videos. Our findings show that very elementary stimuli, even without a grasping context, are sufficient to drive responses in F5c AOENs.

                Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease, caused by the new coronavirus known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and exhibits diverse clinical outcomes and symptoms in infected individuals, emphasizing the need to investigate how human genetic diversity influences the virus’s impact. This study aims to employ in silico methods to identify epitopes capable of eliciting an immune response, focusing on the most prevalent HLA-I and HLA-II alleles in the Moroccan population. Methods Our research consisted in predicting peptide-binding affinities between the most prevalent HLA Class I and Class II alleles in the Moroccan population and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) peptides of variants isolated from strains of Moroccan patients. We performed the same analyses for SARS-CoV-2 wild type S protein to assess the ability of these HLA alleles to interact with peptides in the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Results In a broader sense, 12 distinct HLA Class I and Class II alleles in the Moroccan population have been identified as possibly interacting with 19 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Findings of this study must be validated in both in vitro and in vivo models. Conclusions These data may help clarify the issue of host cell susceptibility and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may guide further research to uncover potential targets for the vaccination strategy.

                Background In hospitals, one of the main service components is an intensive care unit (ICU) that provides aggressive therapy for critically ill and high-risk patients. The availability of ICU beds has been progressively growing in Africa, but many studies show that the ICU mortality rate is very high. However, many of those studies are only descriptive and focus on medical or surgical patients. This study includes patients from all wards except pediatrics. Methods A retrospective cohort study was carried out in the intensive care unit at Yekatit 12 Hospital, Ethiopia. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe the probability of survival in ICU stay. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for the multivariate analysis to determine the possible associations of predictor variables and to obtain the adjusted hazard ratios. A statistically significant association was declared at p <0.05 with a 95% confidence interval. Results The survival rate was 69.7% with a mortality rate of 30.3%. This study confirmed that the risk of mortality among ICU patients was the education status of the study participants, attending primary education was twice that of patients attending higher education with an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) (AHR=2.097, 95% CI:1.081,4.067). Patients admitted to ICU because of shock were more than four times at risk of death compared to other causes (AHR= 4.51, 95% CI: 2.41, 8.45). The risk of mortality among ICU patients admitted because of brain injury was more than two times compared to other patients (AHR=2.77, 95% CI: 1.18, 6.47). Patients with respiratory failure were more than two times at risk of mortality (AHR=2.42, 95% CI: 1.19, 4.87). Conclusions The survival of ICU patients was low. Formal education level, patients admitted for shock, brain injury, and respiratory failure were found to be significantly associated with the survival of ICU patients.

                Background Acute appendicitis is a typical surgical emergency requiring prompt and accurate diagnosis for timely intervention. This prospective observational comparative study aims to assess the diagnostic efficacy of two scoring systems, the Yash scoring system and the Fenyo-Lindberg scoring system, compared to the gold standard of histopathological diagnosis. The study is conducted at A.V.B.R.H., a tertiary care hospital in Central India, focusing on providing valuable insights into the comparative performance of these scoring systems in the local patient population. Methods The study adopts a prospective observational comparative design, enrolling clinically diagnosed cases of acute appendicitis from the outpatient and inpatient departments of the Surgery department at A.V.B.R.H. Patients willing to undergo surgery are included. At the same time, those with complicating factors or contraindications are excluded. Data collection involves thorough clinical evaluations, scoring system assessments, and comprehensive investigations, with histopathology as the reference standard. Statistical analyses include descriptive statistics, comparative analyses, primary outcome assessments, and regression analyses, ensuring a robust evaluation of the diagnostic efficacy of the scoring systems. Expected Outcome Anticipated outcomes include a comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic efficacy of the Yash and Fenyo-Lindberg scoring systems in acute appendicitis. The study aims to identify which scoring system demonstrates superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, providing valuable information for clinical decision-making. The results will contribute to optimizing diagnostic protocols for acute appendicitis, potentially influencing patient management and surgical interventions. This study’s findings are expected to be relevant to the local setting and broader contexts, enhancing the knowledge surrounding acute appendicitis diagnosis.

                Background Vitamin D may play an important role in later-life physical and cognitive health. Vitamin D status is standardly assessed in serum and plasma; however, collection, transport, and storage costs make large epidemiologic studies challenging. We assessed the agreement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) quantification from dried blood spots (DBS) as compared to standard plasma assessment among older Indian adults. Methods A total of 58 adults over 45 years of age who resided in Pune, India were enrolled in the study from July 2020 to June 2021. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to assess 25(OH)D3 concentrations in paired plasma and DBS samples. Results Plasma and DBS 25(OH)D3 concentrations were highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation = 0.976). The median 25(OH)D3 concentration of the study population assessed by plasma was 14.6 ng/mL (Q1=12.0, Q3= 18.1) while the median concentration assessed in DBS was 12.8 ng/mL (Q1=11.0, Q3= 16.6). 25(OH)D3 concentrations measured from DBS were on average 6% (95% CI: 2-13%) lower than concentrations assessed by plasma across the observed 25(OH)D3 distribution. Conclusions We found good agreement between 25(OH)D3 quantification between DBS and plasma and our findings indicate that DBS can be used in epidemiologic studies of vitamin D among Indian adults.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of dietary caffeine intake on striatal dopamine function and clinical symptoms in Parkinson disease in a cross-sectional and longitudinal setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred sixty-three early Parkinson disease patients and 40 healthy controls were investigated with [<sup>123</sup>I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography, and striatal dopamine transporter binding was evaluated in association with the level of daily coffee consumption and clinical measures. After a median interval of 6.1 years, 44 patients with various caffeine consumption levels underwent clinical and imaging reexamination including blood caffeine metabolite profiling.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Unmedicated early Parkinson disease patients with high coffee consumption had 8.3 to 15.4% lower dopamine transporter binding in all studied striatal regions than low consumers, after accounting for age, sex, and motor symptom severity. Higher caffeine consumption was further associated with a progressive decline in striatal binding over time. No significant effects of caffeine on motor function were observed. Blood analyses demonstrated a positive correlation between caffeine metabolites after recent caffeine intake and dopamine transporter binding in the ipsilateral putamen.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Chronic caffeine intake prompts compensatory and cumulative dopamine transporter downregulation, consistent with caffeine's reported risk reduction in Parkinson disease. However, this decline does not manifest in symptom changes. Transiently increased dopamine transporter binding after recent caffeine intake has implications for dopaminergic imaging guidelines.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of our study is to better understand the genetic architecture and pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). We hypothesized that a fraction of iPD patients may harbor a combination of common variants in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used mitochondria-specific polygenic risk scores (mitoPRSs) and created pathway-specific mitoPRSs using genotype data from different iPD case–control datasets worldwide, including the Luxembourg Parkinson's Study (412 iPD patients and 576 healthy controls) and COURAGE-PD cohorts (7,270 iPD cases and 6,819 healthy controls). Cellular models from individuals stratified according to the most significant mitoPRS were subsequently used to characterize different aspects of mitochondrial function.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Common variants in genes regulating <i>Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS</i>-PRS<i>)</i> were significantly associated with a higher PD risk in independent cohorts (Luxembourg Parkinson's Study odds ratio, OR = 1.31[1.14–1.50], <i>p</i>-value = 5.4e-04; COURAGE-PD OR = 1.23[1.18–1.27], <i>p</i>-value = 1.5e-29). Functional analyses in fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neuronal progenitors revealed significant differences in mitochondrial respiration between iPD patients with high or low <i>OXPHOS</i>-PRS (<i>p</i>-values &lt; 0.05). Clinically, iPD patients with high <i>OXPHOS</i>-PRS have a significantly earlier age at disease onset compared to low-risk patients (false discovery rate [FDR]-adj <i>p</i>-value = 0.015), similar to prototypic monogenic forms of PD. Finally, iPD patients with high <i>OXPHOS</i>-PRS responded more effectively to treatment with mitochondrially active ursodeoxycholic acid.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>OXPHOS</i>-PRS may provide a precision medicine tool to stratify iPD patients into a pathogenic subgroup genetically defined by specific mitochondrial impairment, making these individuals eligible for future intelligent clinical trial designs. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Through a comparative analysis across brain regions and risk situations, Casanova et al. demonstrate the distinctive role of the prelimbic cortex (PL) in fear-related behavior representation: the PL promptly detects threat stimuli and adjusts its neuronal configuration accordingly, resulting in a change in freezing representation, which is necessary for memory-associated fear expression.

">Endogenous opioid dynamics in the dorsal striatum sculpt neural activity to control goal-directed action</a></h4>

              
                Endogenous neuropeptides are uniquely poised to regulate neuronal activity and behavior across multiple timescales. Traditional studies ascribing neuropeptide contributions to behavior lack spatiotemporal precision. The endogenous opioid dynorphin is highly enriched in the dorsal striatum, known to be critical for regulating goal-directed behavior. However, the locus, the precise timescale, or functional role of endogenous dyn-KOR signaling on goal-directed behavior is unknown. Here, we report that local, time-locked dynorphin release from the dorsomedial striatum is necessary and sufficient for goal-directed behavior using a suite of high resolution modern approaches including in vivo two-photon imaging, neuropeptide biosensor detection, conditional deletions and time-locked optogenetic manipulations. We discovered that glutamatergic axon terminals from the basolateral amygdala evoke striatal dynorphin release, resulting in retrograde presynaptic GPCR inhibition during behavior. Collectively, our findings isolate a causal role for endogenous neuropeptide release at rapid timescales, and subsequent GPCR activity for tuning and promoting fundamental goal-directed behaviors.

">Kif1a and intact microtubules maintain synaptic-vesicle populations at ribbon synapses in zebrafish hair cells</a></h4>

              
                Sensory hair cells of the inner ear utilize specialized ribbon synapses to transmit sensory stimuli to the central nervous system. This sensory transmission necessitates rapid and sustained neurotransmitter release, which relies on a large pool of synaptic vesicles at the hair-cell presynapse. Work in neurons has shown that kinesin motor proteins traffic synaptic material along microtubules to the presynapse, but how new synaptic material reaches the presynapse in hair cells is not known. We show that the kinesin motor protein Kif1a and an intact microtubule network are necessary to enrich synaptic vesicles at the presynapse in hair cells. We use genetics and pharmacology to disrupt Kif1a function and impair microtubule networks in hair cells of the zebrafish lateral-line system. We find that these manipulations decrease synaptic-vesicle populations at the presynapse in hair cells. Using electron microscopy, along with in vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we show that a diminished supply of synaptic vesicles adversely affects ribbon-synapse function. Kif1a mutants exhibit dramatic reductions in spontaneous vesicle release and evoked postsynaptic calcium responses. Additionally, we find that kif1a mutants exhibit impaired rheotaxis, a behavior reliant on the ability of hair cells in the lateral line to respond to sustained flow stimuli. Overall, our results demonstrate that Kif1a-based microtubule transport is critical to enrich synaptic vesicles at the active zone in hair cells, a process that is vital for proper ribbon-synapse function.

">Human birth tissue products as a regenerative medicine to inhibit post-surgical pain through multi-modal action</a></h4>

              
                Pain after surgery causes significant suffering. Opioid analgesics cause severe side effects and accidental death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain and, more importantly, preventing its transition to a chronic state. In a mouse model of post-surgical pain, local application of Clarix Flo (FLO), a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity without exhibiting known side effects of opioid use in mice. Importantly, preemptive drug treatment also inhibited the transition of post-surgical pain to a prolonged state. This effect was achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways, and indirect pain relief by attenuating immune cell recruitment. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3) from human AM that has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3 induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain and unravel the underlying mechanisms.

">Decoding the Role of Secondary Motor Cortex Neuronal Ensembles during Cocaine Self-Administration: Insights from Longitudinal in vivo Calcium Imaging via Miniscopes</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings in our lab demonstrated that the risk of cocaine relapse is closely linked to the hyperexcitability of cortical pyramidal neurons in the secondary motor cortex (M2), noticeable 45 days after cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA). The present study was designed to explore the underlying mechanisms of neuronal alterations in M2. Our hypothesis was that M2 neurons were affected directly by cocaine taking behaviors. This hypothesis was tested by monitoring individual neuronal activity in M2 using MiniScopes for in vivo Ca2+ imaging in C57BL/6J mice when they had access to cocaine IVSA as a reinforcement (RNF) contingent to active lever press (ALP) but not to inactive lever press (ILP). With support of our established pipeline to processing Ca2+ imaging data, the current study was designed to monitor M2 neuronal ensembles at the single-neuron level in real time with high temporal resolution and high throughput in each IVSA session and longitudinally among multiple IVSA sessions. Specifically, five consecutive 1-hr daily IVSA sessions were used to model the initial cocaine taking behaviors. Besides detailed analyses of IVSA events (ALP, ILP, and RNF), the data from Ca2+ imaging recordings in M2 were analyzed by (1) comparing neuronal activation within a daily IVSA session (i.e., the first vs. the last 15 min) and between different daily sessions (i.e., the first vs. the last IVSA day), (2) associating Ca2+ transients with individual IVSA events, and (3) correlating Ca2+ transients with the cumulative effects of IVSA events. Our data demonstrated that M2 neurons are exquisitely sensitive to and significantly affected by concurrent operant behaviors and the history of drug exposure, which in turn sculpt the upcoming operant behaviors and the response to drugs. As critical nodes of the reward loop, M2 neurons appear to be the governing center orchestrating the establishment of addiction-like behaviors.

">Neuraminidase 1 regulates the cellular state of microglia by modulating the sialylation of Trem2</a></h4>

              
                Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) cleaves terminal sialic acids from sialoglycoproteins in endolysosomes and at the plasma membrane. As such, NEU1 regulates immune cells, primarily those of the monocytic lineage. Here we examined how Neu1 influences microglia by modulating the sialylation of full-length Trem2 (Trem2-FL), a multifunctional receptor that regulates microglial survival, phagocytosis, and cytokine production. When Neu1 was deficient/downregulated, Trem2-FL remained sialylated, accumulated intracellularly, and was excessively cleaved into a C-terminal fragment (Trem2-CTF) and an extracellular soluble domain (sTrem2), enhancing their signaling capacities. Sialylated Trem2-FL (Sia-Trem2-FL) did not hinder Trem2-FL-DAP12-Syk complex assembly but impaired signal transduction through Syk, ultimately abolishing Trem2-dependent phagocytosis. Concurrently, Trem2-CTF-DAP12 complexes dampened NFkB signaling, while sTrem2 propagated Akt-dependent cell survival and NFAT1 mediated production of TNFa and CCL3. Because NEU1 and Trem2 are implicated in neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD) and sialidosis, modulating NEU1 activity represents a therapeutic approach to broadly regulate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.

                While glial dysfunction has been implicated in the development of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, the role of glial cell morphology in neurodegeneration is underexplored. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, mutants of the gene drop-dead (drd) exhibit adult neurodegeneration and extremely short lifespans. The morphology of one class of glia, the cortex glia (CG), is abnormal in drd mutants. In controls, the CGs form a continuous network that wraps around all neuronal cell bodies, but in drd mutants, individual CGs are stunted and the CG network is disrupted. These phenotypes are present on the first day of adulthood. Apoptosis is the central mechanism of cell death in drd mutants; widespread cell death is observed on the first day of adulthood and increases with age and is primarily neuronal. Apoptotic cells are found both within and outside of the remaining CG network, with significant variation in the distribution among individual brains. The degree of cell death and CG network breakdown in young adults could explain why drd mutant flies die within the first week of adulthood. The Drosophila drd mutant is a unique model of adult neurodegeneration that provides new insight into the breakdown in interaction between glia and neuronal cell bodies.

">Huntingtin loss-of-function contributes to transcriptional deregulation in Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by the expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene, which results in a long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein (HTT). In this study, we searched for networks of deregulated RNAs that contribute to initial transcriptional changes in HD neuronal cells and HTT-deficient cells. We used RNA-seq (including small RNA sequencing) to analyze a set of isogenic, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs); and we observed numerous changes in gene expression and substantial dysregulation of miRNA expression in HD and HTT-knockout (HTT-KO) cell lines. The gene set that was upregulated in both HD and HTT-KO cells was enriched in genes that are associated with DNA binding and regulation of transcription. For both of these models, we confirmed the substantial upregulation of the transcription factors (TFs) TWIST1, SIX1, TBX1, TBX15, MSX2, MEOX2 and FOXD1 in NSCs and medium spiny neuron (MSN)-like cells. Moreover, we identified miRNAs that were consistently deregulated in HD and HTT-KO NSCs and MSN-like cells, including miR-214, miR-199, and miR-9. We suggest that these miRNAs function in the network that regulates TWIST1 and HTT expression via regulatory feed-forward loop (FFL) in HD. Additionally, we reported that the expression of selected TFs and miRNAs tended to progressively change during the neural differentiation of HD cells, what was not observed in HTT-KO model. Based on comparing the HD and HTT-KO cell lines, we propose that early transcriptional deregulation in HD is largely caused by loss of HTT function.

">Canonical neurodevelopmental trajectories of structural and functional manifolds</a></h4>

              
                Organisational gradients refer to a continuous low-dimensional embedding of brain regions and can quantify core organisational principles of complex systems like the human brain. Mapping how these organisational principles are altered or refined across development and phenotypes is essential to understanding the relationship between brain and behaviour. Taking a developmental approach and leveraging longitudinal and cross-sectional data from two multi-modal neuroimaging datasets, spanning the full neurotypical-neurodivergent continuum, we charted the organisational variability of structural (N = 887) and functional (N = 728) gradients, across childhood and adolescence (6-19 years old). Across datasets, despite differing phenotypes, we observe highly similar structural and functional gradients. These gradients, or organisational principles, are highly stable across development, with the exact same ordering across early childhood into mid-adolescence. However, there is substantial developmental change in the strength of embedding within those gradients: by modelling developmental trajectories as non-linear splines, we show that structural and functional gradients exhibit sensitive periods and are refined across development. Specifically, structural gradients gradually contract in low-dimensional space as networks become more integrated, whilst the functional manifold expands, indexing functional specialisation. The coupling of these structural and functional gradients follows a unimodal-association axis and varies across individuals, with developmental effects concentrated in the more plastic higher-order networks. Importantly, these developmental effects on coupling, in these higher-order networks, are attenuated in the neurodivergent sample. Finally, we mapped structure-function coupling onto dimensions of psychopathology and cognition and demonstrate that coupling is a robust predictor of dimensions of cognition, such as working memory, but not psychopathology. In summary, across clinical and community samples, we demonstrate consistent principles of structural and functional brain organisation, with progressive structural integration and functional segregation. These are gradients are established early in life, refined through development, and their coupling is a robust predictor of working memory.

">Impaired Cortico-Amygdala Functional Connectivity Can Drive Social Behavior Deficits in Synucleinopathies</a></h4>

              
                The small molecule protein alpha-synuclein forms insoluble aggregates in a group of neurological disorders, including Parkinsons disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, that are collectively called synucleinopathies. However, it remains poorly understood how the aggregated alpha-synuclein disrupts normal connectivity and function of complex neural circuits, prior to robust neurodegeneration, leading to the manifestation of various motor, emotion, and cognitive symptoms in synucleinopathies. In the present study, we combined electrophysiology, optogenetics, mouse model of synucleinopathies, and behavioral analysis to address this question. Using an alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils-based mouse model of synucleinopathies, we reported dynamic changes in the levels of alpha-synuclein pathology in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuits. Such dynamic changes associated with an accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates within cortical glutamatergic afferents to the BLA at an initial stage, followed by gradual loss of cortical inputs and BLA principal neurons at late stage. Moreover, we found that the cortical, but not the thalamic, afferents to the BLA showed functional impairments that were highly correlated with the manifestation of defected sociability in mice with alpha-synuclein pathology. Furthermore, we provided experimental evidence showing that the impaired social behavior of mice was rescued by chemogenetic stimulation of cortico-BLA inputs. Altogether, we presented a series of evidence to delineate key circuit events associated with alpha-synuclein pathology development in a complex neuronal network. The present work highlights the necessity of a thorough investigation of functional consequences of alpha-synuclein aggregation to advance our understand of pathophysiology of synucleinopathies and development of effective therapies.

">Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 reprograms microglia to improve cognitive functions by inhibiting ERK/STAT3 signalling pathway in a model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microgliosis is one of the early hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that plays a crucial role in AD-associated neuroinflammation. However, strategies to harness microglial activation without affecting its homeostatic function are currently lacking. Our recent finding revealed astrocyte secreted cytokine Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) improves memory and cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice model of AD. Here, we investigated the possible mechanism of ICAM-1 that involves modification of microglial activation state and function. Methods: We treated primary microglia cultures with amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) in presence or absence of ICAM-1 and then assessed microglial inflammatory activation and phagocytic clearance of A{beta} by western blotting and confocal imaging. We further treated 5xFAD mice with ICAM-1 intraperitoneally and ICAM-1 antagonist lifitegrast intranasally to assess the beneficial effect of ICAM-1 on A{beta} mediated microgliosis, synaptic protein expressions and cognitive deficits. Results: Here we report that, ICAM-1 inhibits microglial inflammatory activation by inhibiting ERK-STAT3 pathway which is indispensable for microglial inflammation. Moreover, ICAM-1 was found to potentiate microglia to engulf and eliminate A{beta} in primary culture and reduced A{beta} plaque load and associated microglial activation in 5xFAD mice hippocampus. This reduced plaque levels and associated microgliosis in turn refurbished synaptic protein expressions and improved cognition and memory in these mice. Interestingly, ICAM-1 mediated microglial modification along with cognitive improvement was partially lost when ICAM-1-LFA-1 interaction was inhibited. Conclusion: Taken together these findings delineate the importance of ERK/STAT3 pathway in A{beta} mediated microglial inflammation and the modulatory role of ICAM-1 in microglial activation and phagocytosis in order to improve clearance of A{beta} and associated memory and cognitive impairments.

">Signatures of social pain empathy: general and process-specific brain-wide representations of social exclusion and separation</a></h4>

              
                Empathy can be elicited by physiological pain, as well as in social contexts. Although physiological and different social contexts induce a strong subjective experience of empathy, the general and context-specific neural representations remain elusive. Here, we combine fMRI with multivariate pattern analysis to establish neurofunctional models for pain empathy triggered by social exclusion and separation. Our findings revealed both overlapping and distinct neural representations for social exclusion and separation empathy across cortical and subcortical regions. This study established an evolutionary model that traces the progression from social pain to physiological pain empathy. In conclusion, this study establishes neural decoding models for pain empathy evoked by social exclusion and social separation, revealing their neural foundations and interconnectedness of empathy induced by social and physiological stimuli. These findings deepen our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying social pain empathy and provide robust neuromarkers to precisely evaluate empathy across physiological and social domains.

">GluN2B-mediated regulation of silent synapses for receptor specification and addiction memory</a></h4>

              
                Psycho-stimulants including cocaine elicit stereotyped, addictive behaviors. Re-emergence of silent synapses containing only NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) is a critical mediator of addiction memory and seeking behaviors. Despite the predominant abundance of GluN2B-containing NMDARs in silent synapses, their operational mechanisms are not fully understood. Using conditional depletion/deletion of GluN2B at D1-expressing accumbal medium spiny neurons, we examine the synaptic and behavioral actions that silent synapses incur after repeated exposure to cocaine. GluN2B ablation reduces the proportion of silent synapses, but some of them can persist by substitution to GluN2C, which drives the aberrantly-facilitated synaptic incorporation of calcium-impermeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). The resultant precocious maturation of silent synapses impairs addiction memory but elevates locomotor activity, which can be normalized by blockade of calcium-impermeable AMPAR trafficking. Collectively, GluN2B supports the competence of cocaine-induced silent synapses for specifying subunit composition of AMPARs, and thereby expression of addition memory and the related behaviors.

">Sexual dimorphism in histamine regulation of striatal dopamine</a></h4>

              
                Background Many neuropsychiatric disorders show sex differences in prevalence and presentation. For example, Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is diagnosed 3-5 times more often in males. Dopamine modulation of the basal ganglia is implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric conditions, including TS. Motivated by an unexpected genetic finding in a family with TS, we previously characterized the modulation of striatal dopamine by histamine. Methods We used microdialysis to analyze striatal dopamine response to the targeted infusion of histamine and histamine agonists. siRNA knockdown of histamine receptors was used to identify the cellular mediators of observed effects. Results Intracerebroventricular histamine reduced striatal dopamine in male mice, replicating previous work. Unexpectedly, histamine increased striatal dopamine in females. Targeted infusion of selected agonists revealed that the effect in males depends on H2R receptors in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Knockdown of H2R in SNc GABAergic neurons abrogated the effect, identifying these cells as a key locus of histamine's regulation of dopamine in males. In females, in contrast, H2R had no role; instead, H3R agonists in the striatum increased striatal dopamine. Strikingly, the effect of histamine on dopamine in females was modulated by the estrous cycle, appearing in estrus/proestrus but not in metestrus/diestrus. Conclusions These findings confirm the regulation of striatal dopamine by histamine but identify marked sexual dimorphism in and estrous modulation of this effect. These findings may shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of other sex differences in the striatal circuitry, perhaps including the marked sex differences seen in TS and related neuropsychiatric conditions.

">L-Dopa incorporation into tubulin alters microtubule dynamics and reduces dendritic spine invasion and synapse maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that L-Dopa, a tyrosine analog used in Parkinson's disease treatment, can be incorporated into -tubulin C-terminal tail via the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) and polymerize into microtubules. In this work, we demonstrated that mature wild type hippocampal neurons treated with L-Dopa exhibited reduced dendritic spine density, primarily affecting mature dendritic spines. In these neurons, L-Dopa treatment significantly reduced tyrosinated -tubulin levels without altering detyrosinated or {Delta}2 -tubulin levels, suggesting the formation of a new tubulin pool, likely composed of L-Dopa--tubulin. In vitro analysis of the activity of the purified VASH1-SVBP complex, the most abundant tubulin carboxypeptidase in brain, revealed that L-Dopa incorporation into -tubulin modified the binding of the complex to microtubules and reduced its carboxypeptidase activity. These results suggest that L-Dopa incorporation into tubulin alters the properties of microtubules and affects their ability to interact with the enzyme. To confirm the implication of L-Dopa-microtubules in dendritic spine alterations observed in wild type neurons, we analyzed the effect of L-Dopa treatment in neurons lacking the enzymes of the -tubulin detyrosination/tyrosination cycle. In these cells, L-Dopa cannot be incorporated into -tubulin due to the absence of the ligase (in TTL KO neurons) or the reduction of detyrosinated -tubulin levels (in SVBP KO neurons). L-Dopa treatment did not modify dendritic spine density in TLL KO or SVBP KO neurons, clearly demonstrating that the alterations in dendritic spines seen in WT neurons are due to the incorporation of L-Dopa into tubulin. Further analysis revealed that L-Dopa treatment decreased the percentage of spines containing excitatory synapses in wild type neurons, but not in TTL KO or SVBP KO neurons, suggesting a cumulative synaptic defect due to L-Dopa incorporation into microtubules. Additionally, L-Dopa altered microtubule dynamics by increasing catastrophe frequency and reducing comet lifetime, which led to fewer microtubules entering dendritic spines and decreased spine resistance to pruning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that L-Dopa incorporation into -tubulin drastically affects synaptic homeostasis, reaffirming the importance of balanced detyrosination/tyrosination of tubulin within the synaptic compartment. The abnormal dynamics of L-Dopa-microtubules and the reduction of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses highlight a novel mechanism of L-Dopa-induced synaptotoxicity.

">Decoding the amplitude and slope of continuous signals into spikes with a spiking point neuron model</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we harness the signal processing potential of neurons, utilizing the Izhikevich point neuron model to efficiently decode the slope or amplitude of fluctuating continuous input signals. Using biophysically detailed compartmental neurons often requires significant computational resources. We present a novel approach to create behaviours and simulate these interactions in a lower-dimensional space, thereby reducing computational requirements. We began by conducting an extensive search of the Izhikevich parameter space, leading to the first significant outcome of our study: i) the identification of optimal parameter sets for generating slope or amplitude detectors, thereby achieving signal processing goals using neurons. Next, we compared the performance of the slope detector we discovered with a biophysically detailed two-compartmental pyramidal neuron model. Our findings revealed several key observations: ii) bursts primarily occurred on the rising edges of similar input signals, iii) our slope detector exhibited bidirectional slope detection capabilities, iv) variations in burst duration encoded the magnitude of input slopes in a graded manner. Overall, our study demonstrates the efficient and accurate simulation of dendrosomatic behaviours. Real-time applications in robotics or neuromorphic hardware can utilize our approach. While biophysically detailed compartmental neurons are compatible with such hardware, Izhikevich point neurons are more efficient. This work has the potential to facilitate the simulation of such interactions on a larger scale, encompassing a greater number of neurons and neuronal connections for the same computational power.

">No effect of additional education on long-term brain structure: a preregistered natural experiment in over 30,000 individuals.</a></h4>

              
                Education is related to a wide variety of beneficial health, behavioral, and societal outcomes. However, whether education causes longterm structural changes in the brain remains unclear. A pressing challenge is that individuals self-select into continued education, thereby introducing a wide variety of environmental and genetic confounders. Fortunately, natural experiments allow us to isolate the causal impact of increased education from individual (and societal) characteristics. Here, we exploit a policy change in the UK (the 1972 ROSLA act) that increased the amount of mandatory schooling from 15 to 16 years of age to study the impact of education on long-term structural brain outcomes in a large (n~30.000, UK Biobank) sample. Using regression discontinuity, a causal inference method, we find no effect from an additional year of education on any structural neuroimaging outcomes. This null result is robust across modalities, regions, and analysis strategies. An additional year of education is a substantial cognitive intervention, yet we find no evidence for sustained experience-dependent plasticity. Our results provide a challenge for prominent accounts of cognitive or brain reserve theories which identify education as a major protective factor to lessen adverse aging effects. Our preregistered findings are one of the first implementations of regression discontinuity on neural data; opening the door for causal inference in population-based neuroimaging.

                Although aging significantly elevates the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, how age-related neuroinflammation preconditions the brain toward pathological progression is ill-understood. To comprehend the scope of type I interferon (IFN-I) activity in the aging brain, we surveyed IFN-I-responsive reporter mice and detected age-dependent signal escalation in multiple brain cell types from various regions. Selective ablation of Ifnar1 from microglia in aged mice significantly reduced overall brain IFN-I signature, dampened microglial reactivity, lessened neuronal loss, and diminished the accumulation of lipofuscin, a core hallmark of cellular aging in the brain. Overall, our study demonstrates pervasive IFN-I activity during normal mouse brain aging and reveals a pathogenic role played by microglial IFN-I signaling in perpetuating neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and molecular aggregation. These findings extend the understanding of a principal axis of age-related inflammation in the brain, and provide a rationale to modulate aberrant immune activation to mitigate neurodegenerative process at all stages.

">Sensitivity to visual features in inattentional blindness</a></h4>

              
                The relation between attention, perception and awareness is among the most fundamental problems in the science of the mind. One of the most striking and well-known phenomena bearing on this question is inattentional blindness (IB; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Mack & Rock, 1998; Most et al., 2001, 2005). In IB, naive observers fail to report clearly visible stimuli when their attention is otherwise engaged -- famously even missing a gorilla parading before their eyes (Simons & Chabris, 1999). This phenomenon and the research programs it has motivated carry tremendous theoretical significance, both as crucial evidence that awareness requires attention (Cohen et al., 2012; Prinz, 2012; Noah & Mangun, 2020) and as a key tool in seeking the neural correlates of consciousness (Rees et al., 1999; Pitts et al., 2014; Hutchinson, 2019). However, these and other implications critically rest on a notoriously biased measure: asking participants whether they noticed anything unusual (and interpreting negative answers as reflecting a complete lack of visual awareness). Here, in the largest ever set of IB studies, we show that inattentionally blind participants can successfully report the location, color and shape of the stimuli they deny noticing. This residual visual sensitivity shows that perceptual information remains accessible in IB. We further show that subjective reports in IB are conservative, by introducing absent trials where no IB stimulus is presented; this approach allows us to show for the first time that observers are systematically biased to report not noticing in IB -- essentially 'playing it safe' in reporting their sensitivity. This pair of results is consistent with an alternative hypothesis about IB, namely that subjects retain awareness of stimuli they fail to report. Overall, these data provide the strongest evidence to date of significant residual visual sensitivity in IB, and even cast doubt on claims that awareness requires attention.

	<p>This study addresses an issue in attentional distribution in a binocular visual system using RSVP tasks under Attentional Blink (AB) experimental protocols. In Experiment 1, we employed dichoptic RSVP to verify whether, under interocular competition, attention may be captured by a monocular channel. Experiment 2 was a control experiment, where a monoptic RSVP assessed by both or only one eye determines whether Experiment 1 monocular condition results were due to an allocation of attention to one eye. Experiment 3 was also a control experiment designed to determine whether Experiment 1 results were due to the effect of interocular competition or to a diminished visual contrast. Results from Experiment 1 revealed that dichoptic presentations caused a delay in the type stage of the Wyble&amp;amp;rsquo;s eSTST model, postponing the subsequent tokenization process. The delay in monocular conditions may be further explained by a visual attenuation, due to fusion of target and an empty frame. Experiment 2 evidenced the attentional allocation to monocular channels when forced by eye occlusion. Experiment 3 disclosed that monocular performance in Experiment 1 differs significantly from conditions with interocular competition. While both experiments revealed similar performance in monocular conditions, rivalry conditions exhibit lower detection rates, suggesting that competing stimuli was not responsible for Experiment 1 results. These findings highlight the differences between dichoptic and monoptic presentations of stimuli, particularly on the AB effect, which appears attenuated or absent in dichoptic settings. Furthermore, results suggest that monoptic presentation and binocular fusion stages were a necessary condition for the attentional allocation.</p>

	<p>Background: People with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (pwPD) present alterations of spatiotemporal gait parameters that impact walking ability. While preliminary studies suggested that dual-task gait training improves spatiotemporal gait parameters, it remains unclear whether dual-task gait training specifically improves dual-task gait performance compared to single-task gait training. The aim of this review is to assess the effect of dual-task training relative to single-task gait training on specific gait parameters during dual-task tests in pwPD. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), searching three electronic databases. Two reviewers independently selected RCTs, extracted data, and applied the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (Version 2) and the GRADE framework for assessing the certainty of evidence. The primary outcomes were dual-task gait speed, stride length, and cadence. Secondary outcomes included dual-task costs on gait speed, balance confidence, and quality of life. Results: We included 14 RCTs (548 patients). Meta-analyses showed effects favoring dual-task training over single-task training in improving dual-task gait speed (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.20&amp;amp;ndash;0.77; 11 studies; low certainty evidence), stride length (mean difference [MD] = 0.09 m, 95% CI = 0.04&amp;amp;ndash;0.14; 4 studies; very low certainty evidence), and cadence (MD = 5.45 steps/min, 95% CI = 3.59&amp;amp;ndash;7.31; 5 studies; very low certainty evidence). We also found a significant effect of dual-task training over single-task training on dual-task cost and quality of life, but not on balance confidence. Conclusions: Our findings support the use of dual-task training relative to single-task training to improve dual-task spatiotemporal gait parameters in pwPD. Further studies are encouraged to better define the features of dual-task training and the clinical characteristics of pwPD to identify better responders.</p>

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition is increasingly pivotal in the realm of affective brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces. In this paper, we propose TSANN-TG (temporal&amp;amp;ndash;spatial attention neural network with a task-specific graph), a novel neural network architecture tailored for enhancing feature extraction and effectively integrating temporal&amp;amp;ndash;spatial features. TSANN-TG comprises three primary components: a node-feature-encoding-and-adjacency-matrices-construction block, a graph-aggregation block, and a graph-feature-fusion-and-classification block. Leveraging the distinct temporal scales of features from EEG signals, TSANN-TG incorporates attention mechanisms for efficient feature extraction. By constructing task-specific adjacency matrices, the graph convolutional network with an attention mechanism captures the dynamic changes in dependency information between EEG channels. Additionally, TSANN-TG emphasizes feature integration at multiple levels, leading to improved performance in emotion-recognition tasks. Our proposed TSANN-TG is applied to both our FTEHD dataset and the publicly available DEAP dataset. Comparative experiments and ablation studies highlight the excellent recognition results achieved. Compared to the baseline algorithms, TSANN-TG demonstrates significant enhancements in accuracy and F1 score on the two benchmark datasets for four types of cognitive tasks. These results underscore the significant potential of the TSANN-TG method to advance EEG-based emotion recognition.</p>

	<p>The International Conference on Sports Concussion, held every four years since 2001, has been instrumental in forming the international consensus on sports-related concussions. However, due to the unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19, not only the Tokyo Olympics 2020, but also the initially scheduled sixth conference was postponed multiple times. Finally, the 6th International Conference on Sports Concussion took place in Amsterdam at the end of October 2022. In July 2023, the Amsterdam Declaration, reflecting the outcomes of this sixth conference, was released. This paper provides an overview of the conference, in which significant updates were revealed and introduced, including revisions to the definition of sports-related concussions, as well as the latest version of the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT), known as SCAT6, the Office Assessment Tool (SCOAT), and the updated staged return-to-play protocol.</p>

	<p>Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment represents the gold standard therapy for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients. L-DOPA therapy shows many side effects, among them, L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) remain the most problematic. Several are the mechanisms underlying these processes: abnormal corticostriatal neurotransmission, pre- and post-synaptic neuronal events, changes in gene expression, and altered plasticity. In recent years, researchers have also suggested non-neuronal mechanisms as a possible cause for LIDs. We reviewed recent clinical and pre-clinical studies on neuroinflammation contribution to LIDs. Microglia and astrocytes seem to play a strategic role in LIDs phenomenon. In particular, their inflammatory response affects neuron-glia communication, synaptic activity and neuroplasticity, contributing to LIDs development. Finally, we describe possible new therapeutic interventions for dyskinesia prevention targeting glia cells.</p>

                Vemuri et al. demonstrate the critical role of dynamic RNA polymerase II activity in driving transcriptome shifts during intestinal differentiation. The intestinal transcription factor HNF4 sculpts a favorable chromatin landscape and is required for dynamic polymerase recruitment driving differentiation.

	<p>Postconcussion syndrome (PCS) is one of the leading complications that may appear in patients after mild head trauma. Every day, thousands of people, regardless of age, gender, and race, are diagnosed in emergency departments due to head injuries. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a significant public health problem, impacting an estimated 1.5 million people in the United States and up to 69 million people worldwide each year, with 80% of these cases being mild. An analysis of the available research and a systematic review were conducted to search for a solution to predicting the occurrence of postconcussion syndrome. Particular biomarkers that can be examined upon admission to the emergency department after head injury were found as possible predictive factors of PCS development. Setting one unequivocal definition of PCS is still a challenge that causes inconsistent results. Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE), Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), Serum Protein 100 B (s100B), and tau protein are found to be the best predictors of PCS development. The presence of all mentioned biomarkers is confirmed in severe TBI. All mentioned biomarkers are used as predictors of PCS. A combined examination of NSE, GFAP, UCH-1, S100B, and tau protein should be performed to detect mTBI and predict the development of PCS.</p>

	<p>The foveal load hypothesis assumes that the ease (or difficulty) of processing the currently fixated word in a sentence can influence processing of the upcoming word(s), such that parafoveal preview is reduced when foveal load is high. Recent investigations using pseudo-character previews reported an absence of foveal load effects in Chinese reading. Substantial Chinese studies to date provide some evidence to show that parafoveal words may be processed orthographically, phonologically, or semantically. However, it has not yet been established whether parafoveal processing is equivalent in terms of the type of parafoveal information extracted (orthographic, phonological, semantic) under different foveal load conditions. Accordingly, the present study investigated this issue with two experiments. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; eye movements were recorded as they read sentences in which foveal load was manipulated by placing a low- or high-frequency word N preceding a critical word. The preview validity of the upcoming word N + 1 was manipulated in Experiment 1, and word N + 2 in Experiment 2. The parafoveal preview was either identical to word N + 1(or word N + 2); orthographically related; phonologically related; semantically related; or an unrelated pseudo-character. The results showed robust main effects of frequency and preview type on both N + 1 and N + 2. Crucially, however, interactions between foveal load and preview type were absent, indicating that foveal load does not modulate the types of parafoveal information processed during Chinese reading.</p>

	<p>Neuroeconomics merges neuroscience, economics, and psychology to investigate the neural basis of decision making. Decision making involves assessing outcomes with subjective value, shaped by emotions and experiences, which are crucial in economic decisions. Functional MRI (fMRI) reveals key areas of the brain, including the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, that are involved in subjective value representation. Collaborative interdisciplinary efforts are essential for advancing the field of neuroeconomics, with implications for clinical interventions and policy design. This review explores subjective value in neuroeconomics, highlighting brain regions identified through fMRI studies.</p>

                <p>The mechanisms by which brain insults lead to subsequent epilepsy remain unclear. Insults including trauma, stroke, infections, and long seizures (status epilepticus, SE) increase the nuclear expression and chromatin binding of the neuron-restrictive silencing factor/RE-1 silencing transcription factor (NRSF/REST). REST/NRSF orchestrates major disruption of the expression of key neuronal genes, including ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, potentially contributing to epileptogenesis. Accordingly, transient interference with REST/NRSF chromatin binding after an epilepsy-provoking SE suppressed spontaneous seizures for the 12&nbsp;d duration of a prior study. However, whether the onset of epileptogenesis was suppressed or only delayed has remained unresolved. The current experiments determined if transient interference with REST/NRSF chromatin binding prevented epileptogenesis enduringly or, alternatively, slowed epilepsy onset. Epileptogenesis was elicited in adult male rats via systemic kainic acid-induced SE (KA-SE). We then determined if decoy, NRSF-binding&ndash;motif oligodeoxynucleotides (NRSE-ODNs), given twice following KA-SE (1) prevented REST/NRSF binding to chromatin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, or (2) prevented the onset of spontaneous seizures, measured with chronic digital video-electroencephalogram. Blocking NRSF function transiently after KA-SE significantly lengthened the latent period to a first spontaneous seizure. Whereas this intervention did not influence the duration and severity of spontaneous seizures, total seizure number and seizure burden were lower in the NRSE-ODN compared with scrambled-ODN cohorts. Transient interference with REST/NRSF function after KA-SE delays and moderately attenuates insult-related hippocampal epilepsy, but does not abolish it. Thus, the anticonvulsant and antiepileptogenic actions of NRSF are but one of the multifactorial mechanisms generating epilepsy in the adult brain.</p>

                <p>Mismatch negativity (MMN) is commonly recognized as a neural signal of prediction error evoked by deviants from the expected patterns of sensory input. Studies show that MMN diminishes when sequence patterns become more predictable over a longer timescale. This implies that MMN is composed of multiple subcomponents, each responding to different levels of temporal regularities. To probe the hypothesized subcomponents in MMN, we record human electroencephalography during an auditory local&ndash;global oddball paradigm where the tone-to-tone transition probability (local regularity) and the overall sequence probability (global regularity) are manipulated to control temporal predictabilities at two hierarchical levels. We find that the size of MMN is correlated with both probabilities and the spatiotemporal structure of MMN can be decomposed into two distinct subcomponents. Both subcomponents appear as negative waveforms, with one peaking early in the central-frontal area and the other late in a more frontal area. With a quantitative predictive coding model, we map the early and late subcomponents to the prediction errors that are tied to local and global regularities, respectively. Our study highlights the hierarchical complexity of MMN and offers an experimental and analytical platform for developing a multitiered neural marker applicable in clinical settings.</p>

                <p>Current theories of decision-making propose that decisions arise through competition between choice options. Computational models of the decision process estimate how quickly information about choice options is integrated and how much information is needed to trigger a choice. Experiments using this approach typically report data from well-trained participants. As such, we do not know how the decision process evolves as a decision-making task is learned for the first time. To address this gap, we used a behavioral design separating learning the value of choice options from learning to make choices. We trained male rats to respond to single visual stimuli with different reward values. Then, we trained them to make choices between pairs of stimuli. Initially, the rats responded more slowly when presented with choices. However, as they gained experience in making choices, this slowing reduced. Response slowing on choice trials persisted throughout the testing period. We found that it was specifically associated with increased exponential variability when the rats chose the higher value stimulus. Additionally, our analysis using drift diffusion modeling revealed that the rats required less information to make choices over time. These reductions in the decision threshold occurred after just a single session of choice learning. These findings provide new insights into the learning process of decision-making tasks. They suggest that the value of choice options and the ability to make choices are learned separately and that experience plays a crucial role in improving decision-making performance.</p>

                Scientists and medical experts are beginning to understand the significant role that a woman’s past reproductive experiences play in her potential risk of developing heart disease. Reproductive history is seldom considered when assessing the cardiovascular risk. Infertility, high blood pressure, and hypertension are risk factors for heart disease. Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether the apparent increase in risk could be influenced by other risk factors associated with infertility such as irregular menstruation, thyroid conditions, and waist circumference. This study aimed to investigate the association between cardiovascular risk and infertility in women and those who are fertile. The objectives of this study were to estimate the levels of serum creatinine kinase (MB) in both infertile and fertile control groups, as well as to estimate the LDL and HDL levels in the same groups. The study group comprised 78 participants, of which 39 were fertile and 39 were infertile. CK (MB), HDL, LDL, Uric acid, and high sensitivity C reactive Protein (hs-CRP) levels were analyzed. In this study, we discuss how infertility may share common pathways with cardiovascular diseases. Numerous mechanisms may be involved in mediating infertility, including ovulatory abnormalities, endometriosis, and uterine fibroids. For example, in addition to having lower HDL levels, women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are more likely to have higher levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL. PCOS patients typically exhibit elevated UA levels and hyperuricemia, which are commonly associated with increased androgen levels.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-509/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Radiological diagnosis of atypical meningioma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Meningiomas are one of the most commonly occurring, extra-axial, primary tumors of central nervous system that are slow-growing in nature with a female predominance mostly occurring in the mid-late twenties. The clinical symptoms of atypical meningioma include headache, seizures, change in personality or behavior, development of a localized neurologic impairment, drowsiness, confusion, loss of hearing or tinnitus, fatigue on exertion, projectile vomiting and visual disturbances. If a meningioma is left untreated, it can cause problems such as loss of neurological function, weakness/numbness, hearing or vision loss, and balance problems. Sometimes there are worsening signs of persistent headaches, origin of new episodes of seizures, or increased intracranial pressure and neurological evaluation should be performed, followed by radiological studies if necessary. The best investigations for early diagnosis are CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans (MRI). Total surgical excision of the tumor is the best management option for the neurological symptoms. In certain situations, such as atypical, malignant, or recurrent meningioma, radiation with a cumulative dose of 45-60 Gy is now employed There is a long-term re-occurrence rate of completely and incompletely resected atypical meningioma. Radiotherapy is beneficial in patients with low surgical risk, meningiomas in surgically inaccessible areas, and advanced age. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy can be attempted when meningiomas are unresectable. In recurrent meningiomas, chemotherapy with hydroxyurea appears to be fairly active and has been mildly beneficial, as has hormonal therapy with progesterone antagonists. Thus, early diagnosis and management are essential to reduce neurological compromise and imprdaove the survival rate of patients with brain tumors.

                Background Nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR is the standard procedure for COVID-19 testing. In patients with tracheostomy with an altered airway that bypasses the nasopharynx, the yield of samples from different sites is unknown. This information will be essential for formulating a sample collection method for COVID-19 RT-PCR testing in patients undergoing tracheostomy. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal secretion (via closed-circuit secretion suction) samples were collected from 100 patients with a non-plugging tracheostomy tube at Thammasat University Hospital, Pathum Thani, Thailand. The participants were aged between 1-96 years old for screening purposes during the pandemic. The detection results and cycle threshold (Ct) values from each site were analyzed using McNemar’s test with a 95% confidence interval. Results Four participants had positive results. One patient tested positive only for the nasopharyngeal swab, whereas the other tested positive only for the tracheal secretion sample. No statistically significant difference was found between the discordant and concordant groups (P = 1). Conclusions We found two discordant results among the four positive cases in the 100 patients. One patient tested positive only from the nasopharyngeal swab, whereas the other tested positive only from the tracheal sample. The percentage of agreement was 98, and the kappa coefficient value was 65.64% (p <0.001). According to these results, one sample from the nasopharynx or tracheal tube should be sufficient to determine the infection status of low-risk patients. For highly suspicious cases, multisite sampling should be performed. This study showed discordance in COVID-19 RT-PCR screening results using samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal secretions in tracheotomized patients. A multiple-site sample is suggested for highly suspicious patients with tracheostomy.

                Background The “all-on-four” concept represents a significant advancement in dental implantology. particularly beneficial in cases of extensive jaw bone loss where invasive bone regeneration procedures are typically required. However, the successful implementation of this technique necessitates meticulous planning concerning implant selection, materials, and prosthesis design. The recent introduction of PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) in dentistry, especially in all-on-four prosthetics, prompts questions regarding its clinical efficacy and comparative biomechanical and biological advantages over conventional materials such as titanium and zirconia. While some studies have compared PEEK with other materials, systematic reviews evaluating its efficacy are scarce. This systematic review protocol intends to assess the evidence regarding the viability of PEEK as a potential alternative within the all-on-four approach in dental implantology. Methods This systematic review protocol will adhere to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions and align with the Methodological Expectations of the Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) guidelines. Utilizing a comprehensive search strategy, multiple databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and registries of clinical trials, will be explored. The search aims to identify randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies investigating the application of PEEK in the all-on-four approach for dental procedures. Emphasizing clinically relevant outcomes such as implant survival, prosthesis success, peri-implant complications, and patient satisfaction, this review aims to provide insights into the effectiveness and potential benefits of using PEEK in all-on-four prosthetics. Non-randomized studies will be assessed for bias using ROBINS-I, while randomized controlled trials will undergo evaluation with the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool, ROB II. Discussion The outcomes derived from this systematic review hold great significance for dental practitioners exploring the all-on-four concept. Understanding PEEK’s advantages and limitations compared to titanium and zirconia facilitates tailored treatment plans, enhancing success and satisfaction, ultimately improving dental care quality.

                Background Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become a standard tool in the molecular diagnostics of Mendelian disease, and the precision of such diagnostics is greatly affected by the accuracy of variant calling from sequencing data. Recently, we have comprehensively evaluated the performance of multiple variant calling pipelines. However, no systematic analysis of the effects of read trimming on variant discovery with modern variant calling software has yet been performed. Methods In this work, we systematically evaluated the effects of adapters on the performance of 8 variant calling and filtering methods using 14 standard reference Genome-in-a-Bottle (GIAB) samples. Variant calls were compared to the ground truth variant sets, and the effect of adapter trimming with different tools was assessed using major performance metrics (precision, recall, and F1 score). Results We show that adapter trimming has no effect on the accuracy of the best-performing variant callers (e.g., DeepVariant) on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. For whole-exome sequencing (WES) datasets subtle improvement of accuracy was observed in some of the samples. In high-coverage WES data (~200x mean coverage), adapter removal allowed for discovery of 2-4 additional true positive variants in only two out of seven datasets tested. Moreover, this effect was not dependent on the median insert size and proportion of adapter sequences in reads. Surprisingly, the effect of trimming on variant calling was reversed when moderate coverage (~80-100x) WES data was used. Finally, we show that some of the recently developed machine learning-based variant callers demonstrate greater dependence on the presence of adapters in reads. Conclusions Taken together, our results indicate that adapter removal is unnecessary when calling germline variants, but suggest that preprocessing methods should be carefully chosen when developing and using machine learning-based variant analysis methods.

                Background White spot lesions (WSLs) are frequently linked with low microhardness and mineral content changes. several strategies have been employed to deal with these problems. This investigation aimed to analyze the microhardness and mineral content changes after remineralization with bioactive glass (BAG) and casein phospho-peptide-amorphous calcium phosphate with fluoride (CPP-ACPF). Methods Twenty sound maxillary first premolars extracted were used to obtain a total of one hundred enamel samples. forty enamel slabs were split into four experimental groups (n = 10 each): Group I, BAG; Group II, BAG+CPP-ACPF; Group III, CPP-ACPF varnish; and Group IV, artificial saliva (negative control). To create artificial WSLs, all samples were preserved in a prepared demineralizing agent for 72 h before treatment with remineralizing agents. Vickers microhardness test was performed. Additionally, 60 enamel samples were selected for analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and assigned to six experimental groups; the first four groups were similar to that used in the microhardness test along with Group V: WSLs, and Group VI: baseline. The statistical analyses employed in this study included Tukey’s HSD (p<0.05), one-way ANOVA, and Shapiro-Wilk. Result Regarding surface microhardness, the BAG+CPP-ACPF group showed the most favorable recovery, which was better than the outcomes of the BAG and CPP-ACPF groups. A statistically significant change (p <0.05) was not observed between them. Similarly, for mineral content change, the BAG+CPP-ACPF group demonstrated the greatest result, The BAG group came next, and the CPP-ACPF group came last. Conclusion The BAG+CPP-ACPF group might be regarded as the best course of treatment for enhancing both the surface microhardness and mineral content (Ca, P), while the control group (Artificial saliva) showed the least satisfactory results in comparison. After demineralization, mineral content and microhardness decreased in all samples. Therefore, BAG+CPP-ACPF significantly improved the surface microhardness and mineral content.

                Plastic production is growing, plastic waste is accumulating, and current waste management methods (recycling, incineration, etc.) are not yet able to solve this waste problem. Proposals and projects aimed at solving or facilitating the problem of plastic waste are therefore relevant. This article proposes a deep geological disposal method for plastic waste projects. The prototype for this project was the deep geological disposal of nuclear waste. Although plastic waste and nuclear waste are fundamentally different, the adequacy of this approach is justified by the fact that plastic waste, such as nuclear waste, has a a long degradation period and poses great danger to the environment, animals, and humans. The article is conceptual and examines the aspects necessary for the implementation of the project, such as the establishment of a special international UN agency for plastic waste management, specific sources of funding, giving plastic waste a monetary value, applying free market principles, and using existing potential opportunities for deep geological disposal of plastic waste. This article also discusses the proposed concept for finding more optimal options.

                <p>by Tong Liu, Hao Zhu, Zheng Wang</p>

In the last few years, Micro-C has shown itself as an improved alternative to Hi-C. It replaced the restriction enzymes in Hi-C assays with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), resulting in capturing nucleosome resolution chromatin interactions. The signal-to-noise improvement of Micro-C allows it to detect more chromatin loops than high-resolution Hi-C. However, compared with massive Hi-C datasets available in the literature, there are only a limited number of Micro-C datasets. To take full advantage of these Hi-C datasets, we present HiC2MicroC, a computational method learning and then predicting Micro-C from Hi-C based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). We trained our DDPM and other regression models in human foreskin fibroblast (HFFc6) cell line and evaluated these methods in six different cell types at 5-kb and 1-kb resolution. Our evaluations demonstrate that both HiC2MicroC and regression methods can markedly improve Hi-C towards Micro-C, and our DDPM-based HiC2MicroC outperforms regression in various terms. First, HiC2MicroC successfully recovers most of the Micro-C loops even those not detected in Hi-C maps. Second, a majority of the HiC2MicroC-recovered loops anchor CTCF binding sites in a convergent orientation. Third, HiC2MicroC loops share genomic and epigenetic properties with Micro-C loops, including linking promoters and enhancers, and their anchors are enriched for structural proteins (CTCF and cohesin) and histone modifications. Lastly, we find our recovered loops are also consistent with the loops identified from promoter capture Micro-C (PCMicro-C) and Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET). Overall, HiC2MicroC is an effective tool for further studying Hi-C data with Micro-C as a template. HiC2MicroC is publicly available at https://github.com/zwang-bioinformatics/HiC2MicroC/.

                <p>by Alexander Massey, Corentin Boennec, Claudia Ximena Restrepo-Ortiz, Christophe Blanchet, Samuel Alizon, Mircea T. Sofonea</p>

Projects such as the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub publish forecasts on the national level for new deaths, new cases, and hospital admissions, but not direct measurements of hospital strain like critical care bed occupancy at the sub-national level, which is of particular interest to health professionals for planning purposes. We present a sub-national French framework for forecasting hospital strain based on a non-Markovian compartmental model, its associated online visualisation tool and a retrospective evaluation of the real-time forecasts it provided from January to December 2021 by comparing to three baselines derived from standard statistical forecasting methods (a naive model, auto-regression, and an ensemble of exponential smoothing and ARIMA). In terms of median absolute error for forecasting critical care unit occupancy at the two-week horizon, our model only outperformed the naive baseline for 4 out of 14 geographical units and underperformed compared to the ensemble baseline for 5 of them at the 90% confidence level (<i>n</i> = 38). However, for the same level at the 4 week horizon, our model was never statistically outperformed for any unit despite outperforming the baselines 10 times spanning 7 out of 14 geographical units. This implies modest forecasting utility for longer horizons which may justify the application of non-Markovian compartmental models in the context of hospital-strain surveillance for future pandemics.

                In healthcare, improvement leaders have been inspired by the frameworks from industry which have been adapted into control systems and certifications to improve quality of care for people. To address the challenge to regain trust in healthcare design and delivery, we propose a conceptual framework, i.e. the “House of Trust”. This House brings together the Juran Trilogy, the emerging concept of co-production in quality management and the multidimensional definition of quality, which describes core values as an integral part of the system to deliver person- and kin-centered care. In the “House of Trust” patients, their kin, healthcare providers, executives and managers feel at home, with a sense of belonging. If we want to build a care organization that inspires and radiates confidence to all stakeholders, highlighting the basic interactions between front- and back-office is required. An organization with both well-organized back- and front-offices can enable all to benefit from the trust each of them needs and deserves. A quality system does not depend on government inspection and regulations nor on external accreditation to develop itself into a House of Trust. Success will only be achieved if all involved continuously question themselves about the technical dimensions of quality and their core values during the “moment of truth”.

                The likelihood of being hit by the likelihood of experiencing lightning within a year was approximately 1 in 960,000. Despite this alarming statistic, it is reassuring to know that the chances of surviving a lightning strike are relatively high; around 90% of people who are struck by lightning manage to survive. Lightning-caused ophthalmic injuries are caused by heat that can be generated through the direct or indirect flow of electric current, and by resistance and shock waves caused by heat. Electrical burn injuries rarely cause ocular complications, since the initial burn is typically fatal. We present a case of lightning injury that affected the eyes. and its treatment and a brief overview of the literature on the subject.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The existence of neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus has been under considerable debate within the past three decades due to the diverging conclusions originating mostly from immunohistochemistry studies. While some of these reports conclude that hippocampal neurogenesis in humans occurs throughout physiologic aging, others indicate that this phenomenon ends by early childhood. More recently, some groups have adopted next-generation sequencing technologies to characterize with more acuity the extent of this phenomenon in humans. Here, we review the current state of research on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the human brain with an emphasis on the challenges and limitations of using immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing technologies for its study.

                Background Helicobacter pylori and intestinal parasites are well-known for their high prevalence in children, especially in developing countries. However, their concomitant infections are poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between intestinal parasites and H. pylori among hospitalized children and adolescents with upper gastrointestinal complaints in Northern Lebanon. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 297 hospitalized pediatric patients, aged between 1 and 15 years, who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. The socio-demographic, lifestyle, and gastrointestinal characteristics of all participants were analyzed. Fresh stool samples were collected and screened for the presence of intestinal parasites and H. pylori infections. Results 6.4% of the patients were positive for intestinal parasitic infections, 5.4% were positive for H. pylori infection, and 11.8% were co-infected. The results of the Chi-square test showed that H. pylori infection is significantly associated with parasitic infection but not with a particular species. The most frequent coinfection was H. pylori-Entamoeba histolytica (77.1%). Moreover, H. pylori infection was associated with overcrowding and infrequent washing of vegetables before eating. The prevalence of co-infections increased in patients of mothers with a primary educational level or less. In regards to clinical characteristics, our findings showed a statistically significant relationship between i) gastric reflux and H. pylori, and ii) severe diarrhea and parasitic infection. Conclusion Our data highlighted the association between H. pylori and intestinal parasitic infections. Thus, H. pylori detection could be taken into consideration while screening for parasitic infections in children and adolescents.

                Background Soda lakes are habitats characterized by haloalkaline conditions also known to host unique microbial communities. The water chemistry changes with seasons due to evaporative concentration or floods from the surrounding grounds. However, it is not yet clear if the change in physiochemical changes influences the spatiotemporal diversity and structure of microbial communities in these ecosystems. Methods Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we investigated the diversity and structure of microbial communities in water and brine samples taken from Lake Magadi between June and September 2018. Additionally, physicochemical parameters were also analyzed for every sampling site. Additionally, physicochemical parameters were also analyzed for every sampling site. Results The abundant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrumicrobia, Deinococcus-Thermus, Spirochaetes, and Chloroflexi. The Archaeal diversity was represented by phyla Euryachaeota, Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, and Thaumarchaeota. The dominant bacterial species were: Euhalothece sp. (10.3%), Rhodobaca sp. (9.6%), Idiomarina sp. (5.8%), Rhodothermus sp. (3.0%), Roseinatronobacter sp. (2.4%), Nocardioides sp. (2.3%), Gracilimonas sp. (2.2%), and Halomonas sp. (2%). The dominant archaeal species included Halorubrum sp. (18.3%), Salinarchaeum sp. (5.3%), and Haloterrigena sp. (1.3%). The composition of bacteria was higher than that of archaea, while their richness and diversity varied widely across the sampling seasons. The α-diversity indices showed that high diversity was recorded in August, followed by September, June, and July in that order. The findings demonstrated that temperature, pH, P+, K+, NO3 -, and total dissolved solids (TDS) contributed majorly to the diversity observed in the microbial community. Multivariate analysis revealed significant spatial and temporal effects on β-diversity and salinity and alkalinity were the major drivers of microbial composition in Lake Magadi. Conclusions We provide insights into the relationships between microbial structure and geochemistry across various sampling sites in Lake Magadi.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-499/v1?src=rss">Cultural intelligence and acculturation among non-native Arabic learners: the impact of ‎learning apps [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Learning apps can be helpful to non-native language learners in learning Arabic, which includes speaking, writing, and speaking exercises. When learners become better in the language, they become more confident in interacting with the community, thus affecting their Cultural Intelligence (CQ) and Acculturation (AC). This study aimed to explore the relationship between the CQ and AC among non-native learners of Arabic. Additionally, the study aimed to investigate the potential impacts of learning apps and gender. Methods This study used a correlational approach, involving a sample of 102 non-native Arabic language learners in Jordan. To assess these factors, this study used the Cultural Intelligence Scale and the Acculturation Survey. Results The findings of this study revealed a positive correlation between the CQ and AC. Furthermore, the use of apps can provide CQ and AC levels. In addition, the study determined that gender did not play a significant role in influencing learners. Conclusion the utilization of educational apps has been shown to enhance both CQ and AC. Thus, it is imperative to encourage learners to engage with these apps, as they foster cultural awareness, thereby facilitating the process of learning Arabic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-498/v1?src=rss">Iodine density of lymphoma, metastatic SCCA, and normal cervical lymph nodes: Based on DLSCT [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective To compare iodine density (ID) and contrast-enhanced attenuation value (CEAV) from dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLSCT) scans of lymphomatous, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA), and normal cervical lymph nodes. Methods Data including ID and CEAV were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent DLSCT of the neck between January 2020 and August 2023. Results from each group (lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal) were compared and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic curve. Results 129 cervical lymph nodes were collected from patients who met the inclusion criteria (50, 41, and 38 nodes from the lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal group, respectively). The mean ID of lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal nodes was 1.01±0.27, 1.36±0.28, and 1.45±0.29 mg/mL, respectively. Comparing lymphomatous nodes with metastatic SCCA nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.002) and CEAV (p<0.001). Similarly, when comparing lymphomatous nodes with normal nodes, the lymphomatous nodes had significantly lower values of ID (p<0.001) and CEAV (p<0.001). The optimal ID cut-off value for distinguishing between lymphomatous and metastatic SCCA nodes was 1.175 mg/ml (specificity of 84.2%, sensitivity 77.8%, AUC 0.788, P = 0.003). The optimal CEAV cut-off value was 77.5 HU (specificity 88.9%, sensitivity 78.9%, AUC 0.851, P<0.001). Conclusions The ID and CEAV measurements from DLSCT were significantly different between lymphomatous, metastatic SCCA, and normal lymph nodes. These findings indicate that DLSCT can be used to distinguish between these conditions in the diagnosis of cervical lymph nodes.

                Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most significant respiratory pathogens that causes acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) early in life. Most children have a history of RSV infection within 24 months of age, and recurrent infections are common throughout life. Methods Children under five years of age were identified through a review of medical records with a diagnosis of RSV-LRTI between 2016 and 2020. Severe RSV-LRTI was defined as a prolonged length of stay (> 7 days), admission to the intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, or in-hospital mortality. Factors associated with severe RSV-LRTI were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results During the study period, 620 patients were diagnosed with RSV-LRTI and 249 (40.16%) patients had severe RSV-LRTI. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the factors for severe RSV-LRTI were being under 3 months (aOR 2.18 CI 1.39-3.43, p0.001), cardiovascular disease (aOR 3.55 CI 1.56-8.06, p0.002), gastrointestinal disease (aOR 5.91 CI 1.90-18.46, p0.002), genetic disease (aOR 7.33 CI 1.43-37.54, p0.017), and pulmonary disease (aOR 9.50, CI 4.56-19.80, p<0.001). Additionally, the presence of ≥ 2 co-morbidities (aOR 6.23 CI 2.81-14.81, p<0.016), experiencing illness for more than 5 days (aOR 3.33 CI 2.19-5.06, p<0.001), co-detection of influenza (aOR 8.62 CI 1.49-38.21, p0.015), and nosocomial RSV infection (aOR 9.13 CI 1.98-41.30, p0.012), markedly increased the risk of severe RSV-LTRI. The severe RSV-LRTI group demonstrated higher hospitalization expenses (median, US $720.77 vs $278.00, respectively; p<0.001), and three infants died in-hospital. Conclusion Children at high risk for RSV-LRTI due to underlying genetic and gastrointestinal diseases are at an increased risk for severe RSV-LRTI. Further studies to determine the cost-effectiveness of RSV immunization in these potential co-morbidities should be initiated to prioritize RSV immunization, especially in resource-constrained regions with limited availability of nirsevimab.

                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly affects the respiratory tract, but different organs may be involved including the kidney. Data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and prognostic impact of AKI complicating critical forms of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective descriptive case/control monocentric study conducted in a medical intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital over a period of 18 months. Results We enrolled 144 patients, with a mean age of 58±13 years old and a male predominance (sex-ratio: 1.25). Forty-one (28%) developed AKI within a median of 4 days (Q1: 3, Q3: 8.5) after hospitalization. It was staged KDIGO class 3, in about half of the cases. Thirteen patients underwent renal replacement therapy and renal function improved in seven cases. Diabetes (OR: 6.07; 95% CI: (1,30-28,4); p: 0.022), nephrotoxic antibiotics (OR: 21; 95% CI: (3,2-146); p: 0.002), and shock (OR: 12.21; 95% CI: (2.87-51.85); p: 0.031,) were the three independent risk factors of AKI onset. Mortality was significantly higher in AKI group (OR: 3.94; 95% CI: (1.65-9.43); p<10−3) but AKI didn’t appear to be an independent risk factor of poor outcome. In fact, age (p: 0.004), shock (p: 0.045) and MV (p<10−3) were the three prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions The incidence of AKI was high in this study and associated to an increased mortality. Diabetes, use of nephrotoxic antibiotics and shock contributed significantly to its occurrence. This underlines the importance of rationalizing antibiotic prescription and providing adequate management of patients with hemodynamic instability in order to prevent consequent AKI.

                Background The Indian government is committed to address various manifestations of malnutrition, including overweight and obesity, inorder to improve individual health and well-being. The scoping review aims to map existing national policy instruments (programmes, schemes, regulations and guidelines) addressing overweight and obesity in India and analysing them for Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) strategies. Methods Systematic identification and selection of policy instruments using ‘Arksey and O’Malley’ framework was conducted from central government ministry websites, between March and June 2023. These instruments focused on nutrition and/or physical activity, targeting specific demographic groups like pregnant women, lactating mothers, children (0-5 years and 5-9 years), or adolescents (10-19 years); excluding those focusing on specific diseases like micronutrient deficiencies, wasting, and stunting. Based on search strategy six policy instruments were included and analysed for SBCC strategies. Results While many policy instruments incorporated SBCC plans; the ‘National Programme for Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD)’ stands out as a significant policy initiative specifically targeting the prevention of overweight and obesity within the broader context of Non-Communicable Diseases. It adopts a comprehensive approach addressing key drivers contributing to overweight/obesity across multiple levels of behavioural influence i.e., individual, interpersonal, community and organisation for health promotion. However, there’s need to strengthen SBCC strategies related to prevention and management of obesity, especially screening and counselling, to cover all age groups with a particular focus on adolescents and youth. SBCC strategies can also be incorporated into India’s Integrated Nutrition Support Programme (POSHAN 2.0) and/or Reproductive, Maternal, New-born, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) under the National Health Mission. Conclusion This paper underscores the necessity for comprehensive strategies to address multifaceted origin of overweight and obesity. The NP-NCD stands out as a noteworthy initiative, and there is considerable potential for other programmes to emulate it SBCC strategies to bolster their overall effectiveness. Note : *Policy instrument’s throughout the paper has been used to cover programmes, schemes, regulations and guidelines.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of structures surrounding the teeth. Its etiology is multifactorial. The primary etiological factor is the microbial component; the other factors are systemic, behavioral, environmental, and psychological. Conventional management includes routine periodontal therapy involving prophylactic and surgical management. In developing countries like India, complementary medicine and alternative medicines like yoga are gaining popularity for improving systemic health. Hence this pilot study was designed to assess the psychometric properties of a structured questionnaire that can assess knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding the impact of yoga on oral and periodontal health in Indian population. Methods The KAP questionnaire was developed (Stage One) using a deductive approach, and a psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire was performed to evaluate it’s reliability and validity (Stage Two). Initial content validation and test re-test reliability were assessed using kappa statistics with binary responses. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the questions in the practice and attitude category with categorical variables. Further assessment of psychometric properties of the questionnaire was done using item response theory. The developed questionnaire had four principal sections: demography of participants; knowledge regarding yoga and oral health; attitude towards yoga and oral health; and practice towards implementing yoga for oral health. Results The ICC for all the assessed questions was greater than 0.60 suggesting satisfactory stability. Internal consistency measured using Cronbach’s alpha for knowledge, attitude, and practice items were reported to be 0.632, 0.923, and 0.591 respectively and that of the KAP total was 0.632. Conclusions The findings of this study showed that the questionnaire had an acceptable psychometric property for measuring KAP regarding yoga and it’s role in oral and periodontal health among Indian adults. The analysis of participant responses revealed that they had a medium level of knowledge regarding yoga and periodontal disease.

                Curculigo latifolia Dryand. ex W. T. Aiton, from the genus Curculigo, is a medicinal plant traditionally used to treat numerous illnesses such as fever, stomach aches, jaundice, wounds, and inflammation. C. latifolia is a perennial herb that is widely found in tropical and subtropical regions, such as Southeast Asia, Southern China, Bangladesh, Australia, and the Andaman Islands. This review collates the reported studies on the different aspects of C. latifolia from its plant description, nutritional value, phytochemistry, chemical composition, and pharmacological properties. This review aims to identify gaps in the literature and provide useful references for future work on this plant. Previous studies have shown that C. latifolia contains high mineral contents of calcium, iron, and magnesium, which are essential components of human health. Moreover, the plant is rich in phytochemicals, which play a prominent role in various pharmacological activities. The most common compounds identified included curculigoside, crassifoside I, nyasicoside, and curculigine. C. latifolia demonstrated high antioxidant activity through its ability to scavenge superoxide anions, 1,1–diphenyl–2–picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino–bis(3–ethylbenzthiazoline–6–sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radicals, reducing ferric ions to ferrous complexes, iron chelation, and B-carotene bleaching. It was also shown that the roots, stems, and leaves of C. latifolia were effective in exerting antimicrobial activity against several microbial strains, including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtillis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia sp., Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Candida albicans, Salmonella choleraesuis and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, the root, fruit, leaf, petiole, and rhizome extracts were found to improve glucose uptake and insulin secretion in diabetic rats, suggesting their antidiabetic potential. C. latifolia presents a wide range of medicinal properties that could make it a promising functional food or source of food supplements to prevent nutrition–related or chronic diseases.

                Background Current treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) mainly focused on treating symptoms. Exosome from Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell (Ad-MSC) have been shown to delay degenerative process. This study aimed to investigate the clinical, radiological and histological impact of combined intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) and exosome Ad-MSCs in-vivo using a larger animal model with low-grade OA. Methods Eighteen male Ovies aries sheep underwent total lateral meniscectomy and conventional radiography was performed to confirm low-grade OA after 6 weeks. The sheep were divided into three groups, Group 1 (G1; n=6) received thrice exosome injections, G2 (n=6) received twice HA injection, and G3 (n=6) received both treatments with a 1-week interval after 10 days of meniscectomy. Clinical evaluations were conducted using the Clinical Lameness Score (CLS), radiographic with X-ray using OA score by Innes et al, while macroscopic evaluation by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Results Lameness parameter scored lowest in G3 significantly (2.0±0.0 VS 2.7±0.52 VS 2.7±0.52; p=0.024) at the second month although the overall CLS score did not significantly differ at the 3rd month. The best improvement of conventional total OA radiographic score at the 3rd month compared to all groups (5.2±1.17 vs 6.3±0.82 vs 6.7±1.03; p=0.053). Macroscopic OARSI evaluation showed no difference (p=0.711). Conclusions Combined repeated exosome Ad-MSC and HA IA injection proven to delay OA progression, however longer duration of follow up is required to evaluate its long-term effect.

                Background Patient-related factors and limited medication adherence in patients with chronic diseases, are associated with poor clinical outcomes, long-term complications, and increased overall disease costs. Many methods have been tested with mixed results, and innovative approaches are needed to encourage patients to adhere to their prescribed drug regimens. Methods This randomised controlled trial examined a new multifactorial pharmacist-led intervention protocol (MPIP), including a medication therapy management (MTM) program with face-to-face counselling, patient-specific medication booklets, and a mobile application, from July 2021 to September 2022 in the Oud Al Touba diagnostic and screening ambulatory centre in 192 patients with type 2 diabetes in the United Arab Emirates. Medication adherence was assessed using the fixed medication possession ratio of medication refills and the medication adherence questionnaire. Results At 12 months follow-up, participants in the MPIP showed significant improvement in overall medication adherence with total (composite) medication possession ratio (MPRt) of mean (±SD) 0.95 (±0.09) compared to 0.92 (± 0.09) in the control group with mean difference of 0.03 (95%, CI 0.01–0.06), P =0.02. In addition, improvement trend was evident in the MPIP group for all medication regimens with P value <0.01. Comparable results were noticeable in adherence questionnaire scores at the end of the study, with 66 participants in the intervention group scored zero on the questionnaire, suggesting high adherence to medication compared to the control group (48 participants only). The MTM program performed 41 clinical interventions on drug-related problems, compared to six interventions in the control group, and the use of mobile application and medication booklet have increased to 45.7% compared to 21.4% before study exit. Conclusions The pharmacy intervention protocol effectively improved medication adherence and optimised medication regimens in diabetic patients with chronic medication regimens in an ambulatory healthcare centre.

                Background This study aimed to examine individual- and health service provider-related factors that influence the self-management behavior of patients with stroke. Methods This cross-sectional study investigated a cohort of 110 ischemic stroke patients in the neurology outpatient department of Universitas Airlangga Hospital from February 2023 to May 2023. Data were obtained using the following three distinct questionnaires: the general demographic questionnaire, health care provider questionnaire, and modified stroke self-management behavior questionnaire. Results Chi-square test results indicated a significant correlation between age (p = 0.023) and information availability (p = 0.000) with self-management behavior in patients with stroke. However, no significant correlations were observed between gender (p = 1.107), residence (p = 0.859), availability of access (p = 0.093), availability of health facilities (p = 0.065), and collaboration among health workers (p = 0.641) with self-management behavior in patients with stroke. Ordinal logistic regression analysis results indicated that age significantly influenced self-management behavior in patients with stroke (p = 0.034; OR = 2.49). Discussion The presence of reliable information within the hospital setting is expectedly complemented by a strong level of literacy among patients with stroke, thereby facilitating the enhancement of their self-management practices.

                Background Research and researchers are heavily evaluated, and over the past decade it has become widely acknowledged that the consequences of evaluating the research enterprise and particularly individual researchers are considerable. This has resulted in the publishing of several guidelines and principles to support moving towards more responsible research assessment (RRA). To ensure that research evaluation is meaningful, responsible, and effective the International Network of Research Management Societies (INORMS) Research Evaluation Group created the SCOPE framework enabling evaluators to deliver on existing principles of RRA. SCOPE bridges the gap between principles and their implementation by providing a structured five-stage framework by which evaluations can be designed and implemented, as well as evaluated. Methods SCOPE is a step-by-step process designed to help plan, design, and conduct research evaluations as well as check effectiveness of existing evaluations. In this article, four case studies are presented to show how SCOPE has been used in practice to provide value-based research evaluation. Results This article situates SCOPE within the international work towards more meaningful and robust research evaluation practices and shows through the four case studies how it can be used by different organisations to develop evaluations at different levels of granularity and in different settings. Conclusions The article demonstrates that the SCOPE framework is rooted firmly in the existing literature. In addition, it is argued that it does not simply translate existing principles of RRA into practice, but provides additional considerations not always addressed in existing RRA principles and practices thus playing a specific role in the delivery of RRA. Furthermore, the use cases show the value of SCOPE across a range of settings, including different institutional types, sizes, and missions.

                Background Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have sought to clarify the relationship between greenspace exposure and health outcomes, but the results are inconsistent. We aimed to synthesise all relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses on this association. Methods We searched five databases (PubMed, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and conducted a manual reference search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals that used clearly defined measures of greenspace exposure and reported health outcomes directly attributable to greenspace exposure. A total of 36 systematic reviews published between January 2010 and December 2020 were identified for inclusion in this systematic review of reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42021227422). An updated review is underway, and the protocol is published in PROSPERO (CRD42022383421). The methodological quality and risk of bias of included systematic reviews were evaluated using the AMSTAR-2 and ROBIS tools, respectively. Results Beneficial effects of greenspace exposure were observed for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, and mental health and cognitive function. Ambivalent results were found for cardiovascular and metabolic health, general health and quality of life (QOL), and respiratory health and allergies. Most of the systematic reviews included in the current umbrella review had a low to moderate methodological quality and a high risk of bias. Conclusions This umbrella review highlights the link between greenspaces and a variety of health outcomes, emphasising the importance of preserving existing greenspaces and integrating additional vegetation into urban areas to maintain public health.

                Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled analysis of rare and uncommon variants in large study cohorts. A common strategy to overcome these low frequencies and/or small effect sizes relies on collapsing strategies, i.e. to bin variants within genes/regions. Several tools are now available for advanced statistical analyses; however, tools to perform basic tasks such as obtaining allelic counts within defined gene/region boundaries are unavailable or require complex coding. GARCOM (“Gene And Region Count Of Mutations”) library, an open-source freely available package in R language, returns a matrix with allelic counts within genes/regions per sample. GARCOM accepts input data in PLINK or VCF formats, with additional options to subset data for refined analyses.

                Objectives This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of quadratic polynomials in data modeling and analysis, particularly in representing the curvature of natural phenomena. Methods We begin with a fundamental explanation of quadratic polynomials and describe their general forms and theoretical significance. We then explored the application of these polynomials in regression analysis, detailing the process of fitting quadratic models to the data using Python libraries NumPy and Matplotlib. The methodology also included calculation of the coefficient of determination (R-squared) to evaluate the polynomial model fit. This study utilizes illustratively generated data to demonstrate the application of quadratic polynomials in Python for robust data analysis. Results Using practical examples accompanied by Python scripts, this study demonstrated the application of quadratic polynomials to analyze data patterns. These examples illustrate the utility of quadratic models in applied analytics. Conclusions This study bridges the gap between theoretical mathematical concepts and practical data analysis, thereby enhancing the understanding and interpretation of the data patterns. Furthermore, its implementation in Python, released under MIT’s license, offers an accessible tool for public use.

                Background People who have had a stroke or a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) can experience psychological and/or cognitive difficulties. The body of research for psychological and neuropsychological interventions after stroke is growing, however, published systematic reviews vary in scope and methodology, with different types and severity of strokes included, and at times, diverse conclusions drawn about the effectiveness of the interventions evaluated. In this umbrella review, we aim to systematically summarise the existing systematic reviews evaluating psychological interventions for mood and cognition post-stroke/TIA. Methods We will conduct this umbrella review according to the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The following databases will be searched from inception: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Epistemonikos. Systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis published until the search date will be included. Reviews including psychological interventions addressing mood and/or cognition outcomes for any stroke type or severity will be screened for eligibility. A narrative synthesis, including content analysis, will be used. Each stage of the review will be processed by two independent reviewers and a third reviewer will be considered to resolve disagreements. The methodological quality of the included reviews will be assessed using AMSTAR 2. Discussion Existing systematic reviews provide varied evidence on the effectiveness of psychological interventions post-stroke/TIA. This umbrella review aims to summarise knowledge and evidence on different types of psychological and neuropsychological interventions targeting mood and cognition. Findings will highlight important knowledge gaps and help prioritise future research questions.

                Background The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing overtime, potentially leading to various severe health complications and mortality. Despite therapeutic agents have currently been developed, unexpected adverse effects are inevitable. Hence, safe and effective medications such as those of plant origin are critical to prevent unexpected complication in DM sufferers. Etlingera elatior has been widely used as spice and traditional medicine to treat diabetes in Aceh Province, Indonesia. However, study regarding α-glucosidase inhibitory effect of E. elatior growing in Gayo highlands, Aceh, Indonesia, is completely lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro α-glucosidase inhibitory effect of E. elatior ethanol extracts (EEEE) growing in Gayo highlands, Aceh Province, Indonesia. Methods Antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH procedure, whereas α-glucosidase inhibition assay was carried out using spectrophotometric method. Data analysis was performed using One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), followed by Duncan’s multiple range test at α=0.05. Results Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoid (TFC), and total tannin (TTC) content in all E. elatior plant parts, in which the highest TPC was found in the stem (158.38 GAE/g), whereas the highest TFC and TTC was obtained in the rhizome extracts. The extract of fruit showed the strongest antioxidant activities, followed by the stem and leaf, with IC50 of 2.381 μg/mL, 6.966 μg/mL, and 19.365 μg/mL, respectively. All E. elatior extracts revealed a significant inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase at the concentration of 500 μg/mL, in which the stem extract showed the most effective α-glucosidase inhibitory effect with IC50 value of 5.15 μg/mL, suggesting its promising potential as antidiabetic agent. Conclusions This study highlights E. elatior potency as a novel source of antioxidant and natural antidiabetic compounds that are useful for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.

                Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic affected people’s health behaviours and health outcomes. Political or affective polarization could be associated with health behaviours such as mask-wearing or vaccine uptake and with health outcomes, e.g., infection or mortality rate. Political polarization relates to divergence or spread of ideological beliefs and affective polarization is about dislike between people of different political groups, such as ideologies or parties. The objectives of this study are to investigate and synthesize evidence about associations between both forms of polarization and COVID-19 health behaviours and outcomes. Methods In this systematic review, we will include quantitative studies that assess the relationship between political or affective polarization and COVID-19-related behaviours and outcomes, including adherence to mask mandates, vaccine uptake, infection and mortality rate. We will use a predetermined strategy to search EMBASE, Medline (Ovid), Cochrane Library, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Global Health (Ovid), PsycInfo (Ovid), Web of Science, CINAHL, EconLit (EBSCOhost), WHO COVID-19 Database, iSearch COVID-19 Portfolio (NIH) and Google Scholar from 2019 to September 8 2023. One reviewer will screen unique records according to eligibility criteria. A second reviewer will verify the selection. Data extraction, using pre-piloted electronic forms, will follow a similar process. The risk of bias of the included studies will be assessed using the JBI checklist for analytical cross sectional studies. We will summarise the included studies descriptively and examine the heterogeneity between studies. Quantitative data pooling might not be feasible due to variations in measurement methods used to evaluate exposure, affective and political polarization. If there are enough relevant studies for statistical data synthesis, we will conduct a meta-analysis. Discussion This review will help to better understand the concept of polarization in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and might inform decision making for future pandemics.

                Background Sleep can be defined as a state of reduced attention from where the person can be woken up by any kind of stimuli. Sleep difficulties are a major group of disorders affecting one third of the adult population. The present study was taken up to assess the sleep quality and prevalence of sleep disorders among the adult population in the urban slum area of H Siddaiah Road Urban Primary Health Center (UPHC), which is in the Urban Field Practice Area, BMCRI. Methods Stratified random sampling was used to select 821 adults in the population of 18-60 years of age. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview the adults after obtaining their consent. The data was entered in Microsoft Office Excel and analysed using SPSS ver20.0. Results The study population was 52.81% females and 77.5% in the age group of 18-30 years. Most of the study population were Hindus (78.90%), and only 3.8% of the study population were illiterate. Most of them were employed (86.12%). Substance use was present in 82.9% of the study participants and overcrowding was present in 51.3% of the subjects. Female gender, being unemployed, living with relatives, overcrowding, and substance use such as alcohol and smokeless tobacco were the factors associated with poor sleep quality as measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Among the study participants having poor sleep quality, most of participants needed further clinical assessment for insomnia (86%) followed by assessment for sleep apnoea (50.5%). Conclusions 200 (24.36%) study participants were determined to have poor sleep quality. Gender, marital status and overcrowding were the factors associated with poor sleep quality. A significant number of study participants need further assessment on insomnia, sleep apnoea and psychiatric disorders.

                Glioblastoma (GBM), known for its aggressive behavior and dismal prognosis. Traditional therapeutic methods, including adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in conjunction with maximally safe surgical resection, are designed to prolong survival and alleviate symptoms. This case report investigates the relationship between survival outcomes in glioblastoma patients and gross total resection (GTR). A recurring seizure disorder manifested in a 58-year-old female patient presented with left-sided lower limbs weakness and occurred twice weekly for a maximum duration of 20 seconds; this condition necessitated hospitalisation and subsequent surgical intervention. A gross total resection was executed with success, resulting in the accomplishment of complete tumor excision. The patient received radiotherapy after a six-week regimen of temozolomide chemotherapy that followed the surgical removal of tumor. Notably, following treatment, the patient reported a substantial amelioration of symptoms and has maintained a 24-month survival rate thus far, with continuous follow-up. This case highlights the potential for enhanced survival outcomes in the treatment of glioblastoma when gross total resection (GTR) is followed by adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-486/v1?src=rss">Reliability, validity, and minimal clinically important differences for the Thai-version of the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ-Thai) in patients with chronic venous disease [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are essential for assessing the health of patients with chronic venous disease (CVD). Therefore, we aimed to translate the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire into Thai language (AVVQ-Thai) and evaluate its reliability and validity. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of the AVVQ-Thai also be estimated. Methods International standards for PROM translation were followed including the forward-backwards translation of the AVVQ. Patients with Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) C2-C6 with truncal reflux were prospectively included. Venous interventions were used to treat reflux and varicosities. Patients’ characteristics, venous clinical severity scores (VCSS), EuroQol EQ-5D, and AVVQ-Thai were collected pre- and one-month post-intervention. AVVQ-Thai was also collected one to two weeks after the initial visit by reply-paid postal questionnaire. Results The study included 119 patients (30% C2, 29% C3, 28% C4, 11% C5, and 2% C6). The AVVQ-Thai had good internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.783 and moderate reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.79). The AVVQ-Thai was significantly correlated with VCSS and was able to discriminate patients with different levels of health problems as assessed by EQ-5D at both pre-and post-intervention, demonstrating good construct and discriminative validity. The median AVVQ scores improved significantly after intervention from 15.4 (IQR 8.3, 24.2) to 4.2 (IQR 1.3, 8.4) in C2-C3, and 18.9 (IQR 14.1, 25.5) to 7.3 (IQR 4.6, 16.3) in C4-C6. The MCID of the AVVQ was 6.21 on the 0-100 scale, which equates to the level of difference necessary to be clinically meaningful. Conclusions AVVQ-Thai has satisfactory evidence for internal consistency, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change and is recommended for application in Thailand.

                Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) significantly impacts motor coordination and hand-eye coordination in children, affecting their daily activities and academic performance. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of Physical Rehabilitation utilizing the Sensory Stimulation and Developmental Vestibular (SSDV) protocol in improving motor coordination and hand-eye coordination in children diagnosed with DCD. Children diagnosed with DCD will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the intervention group receiving Physical Rehabilitation using the SSDV protocol or the control group receiving standard care. The intervention will involve a structured program incorporating sensory stimulation and developmental vestibular activities tailored to the individual needs of participants. Motor coordination and hand-eye coordination will be assessed using standardized measures such as the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) and the Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (Beery VMI). Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up time points. This randomized controlled trial seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of Physical Rehabilitation using the SSDV protocol in enhancing motor coordination and hand-eye coordination in children with DCD. By employing standardized measures, this study aims to provide objective insights into the impact of the intervention. Findings from this trial may contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions for children with DCD, potentially improving their motor skills and overall functioning in daily life and academic settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-484/v1?src=rss">Current status of immunodeficient mouse models as substitutes to reduce cat and dog use in heartworm preclinical research [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Chemoprophylactic prevention of veterinary heartworm disease in companion animals, caused by the vector-borne nematode parasite Dirofilaria immitis, is a multi-billion-dollar global market. Experimental use of cats and dogs in preclinical heartworm drug testing is increasing due to evolving drug-resistance to frontline macrocyclic lactones and renewed investment in alternative preventative drug research. We and others recently published data demonstrating proof-of-concept of utilising lymphopenic severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) or Recombination Activating Gene (RAG)2 deficient mice with additional knockout of the IL-2/7 receptor gamma chain (γc) as alternative preventative drug screening research models of dirofilariasis. Here we summarise the current knowledge of candidate immunodeficient mouse models tested, including a comparison of susceptibility using different background strains of mice, different D. immitis isolates, following use of anti-inflammatory treatments to further suppress residual innate immunity, and efficacies achieved against different reference anthelmintics. We supplement this precis with new data on treatment response to the veterinary anthelmintic, oxfendazole, and initial evaluation of D. immitis susceptibility in CB.17 SCID and C57BL/6 RAG2-/-γc-/- mice. We conclude that in addition to NSG and NXG mice, RAG2-/-γc-/- mice on either a BALB/c or C57BL/6 background offer an alternative screening model option, widening access to academic and commercial laboratories wishing to pursue initial rapid in vivo drug screening whilst avoiding potentially unnecessary cat or dog testing.

                Background Ophthalmologists deal with daily pseudoexfoliation (PXF) due to severe secondary glaucoma, which arises after cataract surgery. Cataracts with pseudoexfoliation are age-related and are associated with open-angle glaucoma. Therefore, pseudoexfoliation is expected to occur more frequently. Pseudoexfoliation is occasionally associated with the development of thick nuclear cataracts, which may make surgery challenging. risks of cataract extraction in patients with pseudoexfoliation include zonular weakness and inadequate pupillary dilation. This may cause vitreous loss, and intraoperative or postoperative lens displacement. It could also lead to a rise in postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP), progressing to long-term inflammation, phimosis of the capsular tissue, glaucoma, and surgical corneal decompensation. Recurrent secondary cataracts are typically caused by some remaining cortical tissue and decreased zonular support, which may lead to lens epithelial cell migration. Surgery for glaucoma and cataracts is complicated by the presence of pseudoexfoliative debris. Objectives To determine the prevalence of pseudoexfoliation in cataract patients visiting the ophthalmic OPD, AVBRH hospital, to locate patients with pseudoexfoliative cataracts, to evaluate their likelihood of progressing to open-angle glaucoma, and to examine the various ocular characteristics of these patients. Methodology The study participants will undergo ophthalmological examination after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This examination will include sac syringing on the lacrimal gland, estimation of the highest corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, application tonometer assessment of intraocular pressure (IOP), and fundus examination using an indirect ophthalmoscope. All individuals with cataracts visiting the ophthalmology department of AVBRH will be examined under a slit-lamp to determine the presence of pseudoexfoliation in the operating eye. Expected Results Hospital statistics from India indicated that the percentage of patients with pseudoexfoliation, in addition to cataracts, ranges from 1.87% to 13.5%.

                Abstract* Background Meningitis is an infection of leptomeninges. It is an emergency life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment initiation. Diagnosis is the rate-limiting step because cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis requires experienced personnel. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the utility of urinary reagent strips for the rapid bedside diagnosis of CSF glucose, proteins, and leukocytes. Objective To determine the efficacy of a urinary reagent strip for bedside analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Methods This prospective comparative study will be conducted in the Department of Neonatology and Pediatrics, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Sawangi, Wardha. CSF samples from patients suspected of infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and awaiting diagnosis will be subjected to semi-quantitative analysis using a urinary reagent strip (for glucose, proteins, and leukocytes). The results were compared with the laboratory results of the individual samples. Result After completing the study, we determined the efficacy of the urinary reagent strips in bedside estimation of CSF glucose, protein, and leukocyte levels in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion This study provides insight into the utility of urinary reagent strips for rapid bedside diagnosis of CSF samples from patients suspected of having an infection.

                Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2 (TGM2) is a Ca2+ dependent enzyme that catalyzes transglutaminase cross-linking modifications. TGM2 is involved in various diseases, either in a protective or contributory manner, making it a crucial protein to study and determine its therapeutic potential. Identifying high-performing TGM2 antibodies would facilitate these investigations. Here we have characterized seventeen TGM2 commercial antibodies for western blot and sixteen for immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The implemented standardized experimental protocol is based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines against their isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research.

                <p>Stroke is the chief differential diagnosis in patient presenting to the emergency room with abrupt onset focal neurological deficits. Neuroimaging, including non-contrast computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), vascular and perfusion imaging, is a cornerstone in the diagnosis and treatment decision-making. This review examines the current state of evidence behind the different imaging paradigms for acute ischemic stroke diagnosis and treatment, including current recommendations from the guidelines. Non-contrast CT brain, or in some centers MRI, can help differentiate ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a pivotal juncture in stroke diagnosis and treatment algorithm, especially for early window thrombolytics. Advanced imaging such as MRI or perfusion imaging can also assist making a diagnosis of ischemic stroke versus mimics such as migraine, Todd's paresis, or functional disorders. Identification of medium-large vessel occlusions with CT or MR angiography triggers consideration of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), with additional perfusion imaging help identify salvageable brain tissue in patients who are likely to benefit from reperfusion therapies, particularly in the ≥6 h window. We also review recent advances in neuroimaging and ongoing trials in key therapeutic areas and their imaging selection criteria to inform the readers on potential future transitions into use of neuroimaging for stroke diagnosis and treatment decision making.

                <p>Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) has recently been used to augment organ donation after circulatory death (DCD) to improve the quantity and quality of transplantable organs. In DCD-NRP, after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies and cardiopulmonary arrest, patients are cannulated onto extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to reestablish blood flow to targeted organs including the heart. During this process, aortic arch vessels are ligated to restrict cerebral blood flow. We review ethical challenges including whether the brain is sufficiently reperfused through collateral circulation to allow reemergence of consciousness or pain perception, whether resumption of cardiac activity nullifies the patient's prior death determination, and whether specific authorization for DCD-NRP is required.

One study performed a blood-based alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (SAA) in <i>PRKN</i>-PD, not detecting seed amplification in 17 <i>PRKN</i>-PD patients. By applying a methodologically different SAA focusing on neuron-derived extracellular vesicles, we demonstrated alpha-synuclein seed amplification in 8 of 13 <i>PRKN</i>-PD patients, challenging the view of <i>PRKN</i>-PD as a non-synucleinopathy. Moreover, we performed blinded replication of the neuron-derived extracellular vesicles-dependent SAA in idiopathic PD patients and healthy controls. In conclusion, blood-based neuron-derived extracellular vesicles-dependent SAA represents a promising biomarker to elucidate the underpinnings of (monogenic) PD.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To apply a machine learning analysis to clinical and presynaptic dopaminergic imaging data of patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) to predict the development of Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).</p>
<h2>Method<b>s</b>
</h2>
<p>In this multicenter study of the International RBD study group, 173 patients (mean age 70.5 ± 6.3 years, 70.5% males) with polysomnography-confirmed RBD who eventually phenoconverted to overt alpha-synucleinopathy (RBD due to synucleinopathy) were enrolled, and underwent baseline presynaptic dopaminergic imaging and clinical assessment, including motor, cognitive, olfaction, and constipation evaluation. For comparison, 232 RBD non-phenoconvertor patients (67.6 ± 7.1 years, 78.4% males) and 160 controls (68.2 ± 7.2 years, 53.1% males) were enrolled. Imaging and clinical features were analyzed by machine learning to determine predictors of phenoconversion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Machine learning analysis showed that clinical data alone poorly predicted phenoconversion. Presynaptic dopaminergic imaging significantly improved the prediction, especially in combination with clinical data, with 77% sensitivity and 85% specificity in differentiating RBD due to synucleinopathy from non phenoconverted RBD patients, and 85% sensitivity and 86% specificity in discriminating PD-converters from DLB-converters. Quantification of presynaptic dopaminergic imaging showed that an empirical <i>z</i>-score cutoff of −1.0 at the most affected hemisphere putamen characterized RBD due to synucleinopathy patients, while a cutoff of −1.0 at the most affected hemisphere putamen/caudate ratio characterized PD-converters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Clinical data alone poorly predicted phenoconversion in RBD due to synucleinopathy patients. Conversely, presynaptic dopaminergic imaging allows a good prediction of forthcoming phenoconversion diagnosis. This finding may be used in designing future disease-modifying trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive effects of unilateral directional versus ring subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined 31 participants who underwent unilateral STN DBS (left <i>n</i> = 17; right <i>n</i> = 14) as part of an National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored randomized, double-blind, crossover study contrasting directional versus ring stimulation. All participants received unilateral DBS implants in the hemisphere more severely affected by motor parkinsonism. Measures of cognition included verbal fluency, auditory-verbal memory, and response inhibition. We used mixed linear models to contrast the effects of directional versus ring stimulation and implant hemisphere on longitudinal cognitive function.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Crossover analyses showed no evidence for group-level changes in cognitive performance related to directional versus ring stimulation. Implant hemisphere, however, impacted cognition in several ways. Left STN participants had lower baseline verbal fluency than patients with right implants (<i>t</i> [20.66 = −2.50, <i>p</i> = 0.02]). Verbal fluency declined after left (<i>p</i> = 0.013) but increased after right STN DBS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and response inhibition was faster following right STN DBS (<i>p</i> = 0.031). Regardless of hemisphere, delayed recall declined modestly over time versus baseline (<i>p</i> = 0.001), and immediate recall was unchanged.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Directional versus ring STN DBS did not differentially affect cognition. Similar to prior bilateral DBS studies, unilateral left stimulation worsened verbal fluency performance. In contrast, unilateral right STN surgery increased performance on verbal fluency and response inhibition tasks. Our findings raise the hypothesis that unilateral right STN DBS in selected patients with predominant right brain motor parkinsonism could mitigate declines in verbal fluency associated with the bilateral intervention.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether, compared to pediatric healthy controls (HCs), the glymphatic system is impaired in pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) patients according to their cognitive status, and to assess its association with clinical disability and MRI measures of brain structural damage.</p>
<h2>Method<b>s</b>
</h2>
<p>Sixty-five pediatric MS patients (females = 62%; median age = 15.5 [interquartile range, IQR = 14.5;17.0] years) and 23 age- and sex-matched HCs (females = 44%; median age = 14.1 [IQR = 11.8;16.2] years) underwent neurological, neuropsychological and 3.0 Tesla MRI assessment, including conventional and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We calculated the diffusion along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index, a proxy of glymphatic function. Cognitive impairment (Co-I) was defined as impairment in at least 2 cognitive domains.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No significant differences in DTI-ALPS index were found between HCs and cognitively preserved (Co-P) pediatric MS patients (estimated mean difference [EMD] = −0.002 [95% confidence interval = −0.069; 0.065], FDR-p = 0.956). Compared to HCs and Co-P patients, Co-I pediatric MS patients (n = 20) showed significantly lower DTI-ALPS index (EMD = −0.136 [95% confidence interval = −0.214; −0.058], FDR-p ≤ 0.004). In HCs, no associations were observed between DTI-ALPS index and normalized brain, cortical and thalamic volumes, and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) (FDR-p ≥ 0.348). In pediatric MS patients, higher brain WM lesion volume (LV), higher NAWM MD, lower normalized thalamic volume, and lower NAWM FA were associated with lower DTI-ALPS index (FDR-p ≤ 0.016). Random Forest selected lower DTI-ALPS index (relative importance [RI] = 100%), higher brain WM LV (RI = 59.5%) NAWM MD (RI = 57.1%) and intelligence quotient (RI = 51.3%) as informative predictors of cognitive impairment (out-of-bag area under the curve = 0.762).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system dysfunction occurs in pediatric MS, is associated with brain focal lesions, irreversible tissue loss accumulation and cognitive impairment. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1080–1092</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26881?af=R">Lifetime Stressful Events Associated with Alzheimer's Pathologies, Neuroinflammation and Brain Structure in a Risk Enriched Cohort</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Along with the known effects of stress on brain structure and inflammatory processes, increasing evidence suggest a role of chronic stress in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the association of accumulated stressful life events (SLEs) with AD pathologies, neuroinflammation, and gray matter (GM) volume among cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals at heightened risk of AD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cross-sectional cohort study included 1,290 CU participants (aged 48–77) from the ALFA cohort with SLE, lumbar puncture (n = 393), and/or structural magnetic resonance imaging (n = 1,234) assessments. Using multiple regression analyses, we examined the associations of total SLEs with cerebrospinal fluid (1) phosphorylated (p)-tau<sub>181</sub> and Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>/<sub>1–40</sub> ratio, (2) interleukin 6 (IL-6), and (3) GM volumes voxel-wise. Further, we performed stratified and interaction analyses with sex, history of psychiatric disease, and evaluated SLEs during specific life periods.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Within the whole sample, only childhood and midlife SLEs, but not total SLEs, were associated with AD pathophysiology and neuroinflammation. Among those with a history of psychiatric disease SLEs were associated with higher p-tau<sub>181</sub> and IL-6. Participants with history of psychiatric disease and men, showed lower Aβ<sub>1–42/1–40</sub> with higher SLEs. Participants with history of psychiatric disease and women showed reduced GM volumes in somatic regions and prefrontal and limbic regions, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We did not find evidence supporting the association of total SLEs with AD, neuroinflammation, and atrophy pathways. Instead, the associations appear to be contingent on events occurring during early and midlife, sex and history of psychiatric disease. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1058–1068</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26883?af=R">Is High‐Frequency Activity at Seizure Onset Inhibitory? A Stereoelectroencephalographic Study of Motor Cortex Seizures</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In the era of stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG), many studies have been devoted to understanding the role of interictal high-frequency oscillations. High-frequency activity (HFA) at seizure onset has been identified as a marker of epileptogenic zone. We address the physiological significance of ictal HFAs and their relation to clinical semiology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively identified patients with pure focal primary motor epilepsy. We selected only patients in whom SEEG electrodes were optimally placed in the motor cortex as confirmed by electrical stimulation. Based on these narrow inclusion criteria, we extensively studied 5 patients (3 males and 2 females, mean age = 22.4 years) using time–frequency analysis and time correlation with motor signs onset.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 157 analyzable seizures were recorded in 5 subjects. The first 2 subjects had tonic or clonic semiology with rare secondary generalization. Subject 3 had atonic onset followed by clonic hand/arm flexion. Subject 4 had clusters of tonic and atonic facial movements. Subject 5 had upper extremity tonic movements. The median frequency of the fast activity extracted from the Epileptogenic Zone Fingerprint pipeline in the first 4 subjects was 76 Hz (interquartile range = 21.9Hz). Positive motor signs did not occur concomitantly with high gamma activity developing in the motor cortex. Motor signs began at the end of HFAs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study supports the hypothesis of an inhibitory effect of ictal HFAs. The frequency range in the gamma band was associated with the direction of the clinical output effect. Changes from inhibitory to excitatory effect occurred when discharge frequency dropped to low gamma or beta. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1127–1137</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26900?af=R">Diet, Pace of Biological Aging, and Risk of Dementia in the Framingham Heart Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>People who eat healthier diets are less likely to develop dementia, but the biological mechanism of this protection is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that healthy diet protects against dementia because it slows the pace of biological aging.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed Framingham Offspring Cohort data. We included participants ≥60 years-old, free of dementia and having dietary, epigenetic, and follow-up data. We assessed healthy diet as long-term adherence to the Mediterranean-Dash Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MIND, over 4 visits spanning 1991–2008). We measured the pace of aging from blood DNA methylation data collected in 2005–2008 using the DunedinPACE epigenetic clock. Incident dementia and mortality were defined using study records compiled from 2005 to 2008 visit through 2018.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of n = 1,644 included participants (mean age 69.6, 54% female), n = 140 developed dementia and n = 471 died over 14 years of follow-up. Greater MIND score was associated with slower DunedinPACE and reduced risks for dementia and mortality. Slower DunedinPACE was associated with reduced risks for dementia and mortality. In mediation analysis, slower DunedinPACE accounted for 27% of the diet-dementia association and 57% of the diet-mortality association.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Findings suggest that slower pace of aging mediates part of the relationship of healthy diet with reduced dementia risk. Monitoring pace of aging may inform dementia prevention. However, a large fraction of the diet-dementia association remains unexplained and may reflect direct connections between diet and brain aging that do not overlap other organ systems. Investigation of brain-specific mechanisms in well-designed mediation studies is warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1069–1079</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26906?af=R">Compensated Hypogonadism Identified in Males with Cluster Headache: A Prospective Case‐Controlled Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Androgens have been hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of cluster headache due to the male predominance, but whether androgens are altered in patients with cluster headache remains unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective, case-controlled study in adult males with cluster headache. Sera were measured for hormones including testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and sex hormone-binding globulin in 60 participants with episodic cluster headache (during a bout and in remission), 60 participants with chronic cluster headache, and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Free testosterone (fT) was calculated according to the Vermeulen equation. Shared genetic risk variants were assessed between cluster headache and testosterone concentrations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The mean fT/LH ratio was reduced by 35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21%–47%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) in patients with chronic cluster headache and by 24% (95% CI: 9%–37%, <i>p</i> = 0.004) in patients with episodic cluster headache compared to controls after adjusting for age, sleep duration, and use of acute medication. Androgen concentrations did not differ between bouts and remissions. Furthermore, a shared genetic risk allele, rs112572874 (located in the intron of the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene on chromosome 17), between fT and cluster headache was identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the male endocrine system is altered in patients with cluster headache to a state of compensated hypogonadism, and this is not an epiphenomenon associated with sleep or the use of acute medication. Together with the identified shared genetic risk allele, this may suggest a pathophysiological link between cluster headache and fT. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1149–1161</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although off-label use of rituximab is a common alternative to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) approved for multiple sclerosis (MS) in several countries, the impact of this on treatment cost-effectiveness is not well known.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated the relative cost-effectiveness of rituximab and MS-approved DMTs in a register-based cohort study of Swedish residents with relapsing–remitting MS, aged 18–65 years, starting treatment with rituximab, natalizumab, fingolimod, or dimethyl fumarate between January 2010 and July 2016, and followed through July 2021 (n = 5,924). By linking the population-based Swedish MS register to several Swedish health care and demographic registers, we estimated health care costs in relation to number of relapses, over 5 years from treatment start. Differences between treatments were estimated in inverse probability of treatment-weighted regression models, adjusting for a broad range of potential confounders covering demographics, medical history, and MS-related clinical characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Off-label rituximab was associated with both lower total health care costs (mean cost savings ranged $35,000–$66,000 vs. each approved DMT), and fewer relapses (mean number of prevented relapses ranged 0.12–0.22), per started therapy over 5 years. Results were robust to variations in discounting and pricing of health care visits, with the main driver of cost-savings being the price of the index drug itself.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of rituximab dominated the MS-approved alternatives. Off-label, low-dose rituximab should be considered for persons with MS and could reduce barriers to treatment, especially in resource-limited settings. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1099–1111</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and cerebral microbleeds (CMB) in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy are more common in East Asian populations than in people of white European ancestry. We hypothesized that the ethnic difference is explained by the East Asian-specific <i>NOTCH3</i> p.R75P mutation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This retrospective observational study included 118 patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy in Japanese and Korean cohorts. We investigated whether the p.R75P mutation is associated with symptomatic ICH and multiple CMB (&gt;5) using quasi-Poisson regression models. We predicted the NOTCH3 extracellular domain protein structures in silico and graded NOTCH3 extracellular domain immunostaining in skin vessels of some patients, with subsequent comparisons between p.R75P and other conventional mutations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 63 Japanese patients (median age 55 years; 56% men), 15 had a p.R75P mutation, significantly associated with symptomatic ICH (adjusted relative risk 9.56, 95% CI 2.45–37.31), multiple CMB (3.00, 1.34–6.71), and absence of temporopolar lesions (4.91, 2.29–10.52) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, and antithrombotics. In the Korean cohort (n = 55; median age 55 years; 51% men), the p.R75P mutation (n = 13) was also associated with symptomatic ICH (8.11, 1.83–35.89), multiple CMB (1.90, 1.01–3.56), and absence of temporopolar lesions (2.32, 1.08–4.97). Structural analysis revealed solvent-exposed free cysteine thiols in conventional mutations, directly causing aggregation, whereas a stereochemically incompatible proline residue structure in p.R75P lowers correct disulfide bond formation probability, indirectly causing aggregation. Pathologically, the p.R75P mutation resulted in less vascular NOTCH3 extracellular domain accumulation than the other conventional mutations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>NOTCH3</i> p.R75P mutation is associated with hemorrhagic presentations, milder temporopolar lesions, and distinct mutant protein structure properties. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1040–1054</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7eefc171-af41-48ef-86d0-b8d342394513/ana26921-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="HLA Associations of Intrathecal IgG Production against Specific Viruses in Multiple Sclerosis"/>
<p>Neidhart et al. report that intrathecal production of IgG antibodies against measles-, rubella- and/or varicella zoster virus, called “MRZ reaction”, is highly specific for multiple sclerosis and associated with the human leukocyte antigen HLA-DR15 and female sex. These findings indicate that T-B cell interactions via HLA class II molecules and sex hormones and/or X chromosome-encoded factors shape intrathecal antiviral antibody production in MS patients with MRZ reaction.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Specific human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are not only associated with higher risk to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases, but also with the severity of various viral and bacterial infections. Here, we analyzed the most specific biomarker for MS, that is, the polyspecific intrathecal IgG antibody production against measles, rubella, and varicella zoster virus (MRZ reaction), for possible HLA associations in MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed MRZ reaction from 184 Swiss patients with MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and 89 Swiss non-MS/non-CIS control patients, and performed HLA sequence-based typing, to check for associations of positive MRZ reaction with the most prevalent HLA alleles. We used a cohort of 176 Swedish MS/CIS patients to replicate significant findings.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Whereas positive MRZ reaction showed a prevalence of 38.0% in MS/CIS patients, it was highly specific (97.7%) for MS/CIS. We identified HLA-DRB1*15:01 and other tightly linked alleles of the HLA-DR15 haplotype as the strongest HLA-encoded risk factors for a positive MRZ reaction in Swiss MS/CIS (odds ratio [OR], 3.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.05–7.46, <i>p</i>
<sub>adjusted</sub> = 0.0004) and replicated these findings in Swedish MS/CIS patients (OR 2.18, 95%-CI 1.16–4.02, <i>p</i>
<sub>adjusted</sub> = 0.028). In addition, female MS/CIS patients had a significantly higher probability for a positive MRZ reaction than male patients in both cohorts combined (<i>p</i>
<sub>adjusted</sub> &lt;0.005).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HLA-DRB1*15:01, the strongest genetic risk factor for MS, and female sex, 1 of the most prominent demographic risk factors for developing MS, predispose in MS/CIS patients for a positive MRZ reaction, the most specific CSF biomarker for MS. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:1112–1126</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26922?af=R">Characterizing Frontal Lobe Seizure Semiology in Children</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective was to analyze seizure semiology in pediatric frontal lobe epilepsy patients, considering age, to localize the seizure onset zone for surgical resection in focal epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty patients were identified retrospectively, who achieved seizure freedom after frontal lobe resective surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Video-electroencephalography recordings of preoperative ictal seizure semiology were analyzed, stratifying the data based on resection region (mesial or lateral frontal lobe) and age at surgery (≤4 vs &gt;4).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Pediatric frontal lobe epilepsy is characterized by frequent, short, complex seizures, similar to adult cohorts. Children with mesial onset had higher occurrence of head deviation (either direction: 55.6% vs 17.4%; <i>p</i> = 0.02) and contralateral head deviation (22.2% vs 0.0%; <i>p</i> = 0.03), ictal body-turning (55.6% vs 13.0%; <i>p</i> = 0.006; ipsilateral: 55.6% vs 4.3%; <i>p</i> = 0.0003), and complex motor signs (88.9% vs 56.5%; <i>p</i> = 0.037). Both age groups (≤4 and &gt;4 years) showed hyperkinetic features (21.1% vs 32.1%), contrary to previous reports. The very young group showed more myoclonic (36.8% vs 3.6%; <i>p</i> = 0.005) and hypomotor features (31.6% vs 0.0%; <i>p</i> = 0.003), and fewer behavioral features (36.8% vs 71.4%; <i>p</i> = 0.03) and reduced responsiveness (31.6% vs 78.6%; <i>p</i> = 0.002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study presents the most extensive semiological analysis of children with confirmed frontal lobe epilepsy. It identifies semiological features that aid in differentiating between mesial and lateral onset. Despite age-dependent differences, typical frontal lobe features, including hyperkinetic seizures, are observed even in very young children. A better understanding of pediatric seizure semiology may enhance the accuracy of onset identification, and enable earlier presurgical evaluation, improving postsurgical outcomes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize DNA methylation (DNAm) differences between sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy control (HC) individuals enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using whole blood, we characterized longitudinal differences in DNAm between sporadic PD patients (n = 196) and HCs (n = 86) enrolled in PPMI. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was used to conduct gene expression analyses for genes mapped to differentially methylated cytosine-guanine sites (CpGs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At the time of patient enrollment, 5,178 CpGs were differentially methylated (2,683 hypermethylated and 2,495 hypomethylated) in PD compared to HC. Of these, 579 CpGs underwent significant methylation changes over 3 years. Several differentially methylated CpGs were found near the cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 (<i>CYP2E1</i>) gene. Additionally, multiple hypermethylated CpGs were associated with the N-myc downregulated gene family member 4 (<i>NDRG4</i>) gene. RNA-Seq analyses showed 75 differentially expressed genes in PD patients compared to controls. An integrative analysis of both differentially methylated sites and differentially expressed genes revealed 20 genes that exhibited hypomethylation concomitant with overexpression. Additionally, 1 gene, cathepsin H (<i>CTSH</i>), displayed hypermethylation that was associated with its decreased expression.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We provide initial evidence of alterations in DNAm in blood of PD patients that may serve as potential epigenetic biomarker of disease. To evaluate the significance of these changes throughout the progression of PD, additional profiling at longer intervals and during the prodromal stages of disease will be necessary.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite recent attention to cognitive impairment in essential tremor, few studies examine rates of conversion to diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Development of dementia in essential tremor is associated with loss of functional ability and a doubling of mortality rate. This prospective, longitudinal study comprehensively reports the prevalence and incidence of, and the annual rates of conversion to, mild cognitive impairment and dementia in an essential tremor cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients underwent detailed cognitive assessments and were assigned diagnoses of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia. There were 222 patients at baseline (mean age = 79.3 ± 9.7 years), and 177 patients participated in follow-up evaluations at 18, 36, 54, and 72 months (mean years of observation = 5.1 ± 1.7). Data were compared to those of historical controls and Parkinson disease patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cumulative prevalence of dementia and average annual conversion rate of mild cognitive impairment to dementia were 18.5% and 12.2%, nearly three times higher than rates in the general population, and approximately one half the magnitude of those reported for Parkinson disease patients. The cumulative prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (26.6%) was almost double that of the general population, but less than that in Parkinson disease populations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We present the most complete exposition of the longitudinal trajectory of cognitive impairment in an essential tremor cohort yet presented. The prevalence of and conversion rates to dementia in essential tremor fall between those associated with the natural course of aging and the more pronounced rates observed in Parkinson disease.

                Background Partner violence is a significant issue affecting women’s health, particularly their breastfeeding practices in healthcare settings. Despite a considerable body of research on this topic, there is a need for a systematic overview of the existing literature to explore its thematic and structural developments. Methods This scientometric analysis covers a period of 45 years (1977-2022) and identifies 415 peer-reviewed articles published in English before 2023 from the Scopus database. The articles were included if they engaged with themes related to partner violence, healthcare settings, breastfeeding, and mothers, using predefined search terms and filters. Bibliometric data were decoded and visualized using VOSviewer and RStudio to analyze and visualize the scientific dialogue, trends, patterns, and networks in the literature regarding partner violence and its impact on breastfeeding mothers in healthcare settings. Results The study revealed a concentrated exploration of themes related to violence, healthcare provision, mental health, and women’s reproductive health. The co-occurrence network and thematic mapping illuminated seven pivotal clusters, revealing a complex narrative of interconnected research areas. Niche and emerging themes such as “Depression,” “HIV,” and “Covid-19” were identified, highlighting the evolving landscape of the research domain. Conclusions This analysis provides a panoramic overview of the existing literature, revealing intricate thematic structures and collaboration networks within the research on partner violence and breastfeeding mothers in healthcare settings. The study not only sheds light on the historical and current states of research but also pinpoints potential future directions, thereby assisting scholars and policymakers in navigating and prioritizing subsequent investigative endeavors.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Evidence suggests that individual hippocampal subfields are preferentially involved in various memory-related processes. Here, we demonstrated dissociations in these memory processes in two unique individuals with near-selective bilateral damage within the hippocampus, affecting the dentate gyrus (DG) in case BL and the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) subfield in case BR. BL was impaired in discriminating highly similar objects in memory (i.e., mnemonic discrimination) but exhibited preserved overall recognition of studied objects, regardless of similarity. Conversely, BR demonstrated impaired general recognition. These results provide evidence for the DG in discrimination processes, likely related to underlying pattern separation computations, and the CA1 in retention/retrieval.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Researchers who study the human hippocampus are naturally interested in how its subfields function. However, many researchers are precluded from examining subfields because their manual delineation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (still the gold standard approach) is time consuming and requires significant expertise. To help ameliorate this issue, we present here two protocols, one for 3T MRI and the other for 7T MRI, that permit automated hippocampus segmentation into six subregions, namely dentate gyrus/cornu ammonis (CA)4, CA2/3, CA1, subiculum, pre/parasubiculum, and uncus along the entire length of the hippocampus. These protocols are particularly notable relative to existing resources in that they were trained and tested using large numbers of healthy young adults (n = 140 at 3T, n = 40 at 7T) whose hippocampi were manually segmented by experts from MRI scans. Using inter-rater reliability analyses, we showed that the quality of automated segmentations produced by these protocols was high and comparable to expert manual segmenters. We provide full open access to the automated protocols, and anticipate they will save hippocampus researchers a significant amount of time. They could also help to catalyze subfield research, which is essential for gaining a full understanding of how the hippocampus functions.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Our ability to navigate in a new environment depends on learning new locations. Mental representations of locations are quickly accessible during navigation and allow us to know where we are regardless of our current viewpoint. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research using pattern classification has shown that these location-based representations emerge in the retrosplenial cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, regions theorized to be critically involved in spatial navigation. However, little is currently known about the oscillatory dynamics that support the formation of location-based representations. We used magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings to investigate region-specific oscillatory activity in a task where participants could form location-based representations. Participants viewed videos showing that two perceptually distinct scenes (180° apart) belonged to the same location. This “overlap” video allowed participants to bind the two distinct scenes together into a more coherent location-based representation. Participants also viewed control “non-overlap” videos where two distinct scenes from two different locations were shown, where no location-based representation could be formed. In a post-video behavioral task, participants successfully matched the two viewpoints shown in the overlap videos, but not the non-overlap videos, indicating they successfully learned the locations in the overlap condition. Comparing oscillatory activity between the overlap and non-overlap videos, we found greater theta and alpha/beta power during the overlap relative to non-overlap videos, specifically at time-points when we expected scene integration to occur. These oscillations localized to regions in the medial parietal cortex (precuneus and retrosplenial cortex) and the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus. Therefore, we find that theta and alpha/beta oscillations in the hippocampus and medial parietal cortex are likely involved in the formation of location-based representations.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to delineate 21-year sex-specific trends in recurrence and postrecurrence mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Between 2000 and 2020, first-ever ischemic stroke (IS) patients, ascertained from the population-based BASIC (Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi) project in South Texas, were followed for recurrent stroke and all-cause mortality until December 31, 2020. Multivariable regression models with an interaction between calendar year and sex were used to estimate sex-specific trends and sex differences in recurrence and postrecurrence mortality.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 6,057 IS patients (median age = 69 years, 49.8% women), 654 (10.8%) had a recurrence and 399 (47.7%) had postrecurrence mortality during 5 years of follow-up. In 2000, women had 2.5% higher albeit non-statistically significant 5-year risk of recurrence than men in absolute scale. With the trend declining in women by 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = −10.8 to −4.5%) and in men by 3.6% (95% CI = −6.5% to −0.7%), the risk at the end of the study period was 1.5% (95% CI = −0.3% to 3.6%) lower among women than men. For postrecurrence mortality, the risk was 10.2% lower among women in 2000, but the sex difference was 3.3% by the end of the period, which was due to a larger overall increase in the risk among women than men over the entire time period.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The declines in recurrent stroke suggest successful secondary stroke prevention, especially in women. However, the continued high postrecurrence mortality among both sexes at the end of study period emphasizes the need for ongoing interventions to improve prognosis in those who have had recurrent cerebrovascular events.
