	<p>The Michelangelo effect is a phenomenon that shows a reduction in perceived effort and an improvement in performance among both healthy subjects and patients when completing a motor task related to artistic stimuli, compared to performing the same task with non-artistic stimuli. It could contribute to the efficacy of art therapy in neurorehabilitation. In this study, the possible occurrence of this effect was tested in a cognitive task by asking 15 healthy subjects and 17 patients with a history of stroke to solve a digital version of the classical memory card game. Three different types of images were used in a randomized order: French cards, artistic portraits, and photos of famous people (to compensate for the possible effects of face recognition). Healthy subjects were involved to test the usability and the load demand of the developed system, reporting no statistically significant differences among the three sessions (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conversely, patients had a better performance in terms of time (p = 0.014) and the number of attempts (p = 0.007) needed to complete the task in the presence of artistic stimuli, accompanied by a reduction in the perceived effort (p = 0.033). Furthermore, artistic stimuli, with respect to the other two types of images, seemed more associated with visuospatial control than linguistic functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-972/v2?src=rss">Online food delivery services: cross-sectional study of consumers’ attitude in Malaysia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysian consumers were more likely to purchase food online and have it delivered to their doorstep. To stay afloat, many restaurants were pushed to provide online food delivery services (OFDS), and this sector has grown tremendously. However, will the trend persist after the pandemic? This study aims to look into how consumers’ perceptions of OFDS affect their attitude towards them. It investigates the relationship between convenience motivation, perceived ease of use, time-saving orientation and price-saving orientation in terms of future intent to use OFDS. Method Primary data was collected from 307 respondents in Malaysia using convenience sampling method through an online survey. Respondents’ demographic background was presented statistically in cross tabulation tables to study the ratio comparison implicitly. Consistent Partial Least Square approach and bootstrapping techniques with 5,000 subsamples was employed, with the aid of SmartPLS.V3 software, to identify the significant factors influencing consumers’ continuance intention after the pandemic. Result Perceived ease of use does not contribute significantly to continuance intention as most consumers have prior online purchase experience. Nevertheless, time-saving orientation has a positive correlation with perceived ease of use due to the simplicity of placing an order with just a click. It is also found that price-saving orientation is related to convenience motivation, particularly when prices can be compared on the websites or online ordering platforms. Consumers’ intention to continue using OFDS even after the COVID-19 pandemic is positively influenced by all the parameters studied, except for perceived ease of use. Conclusion Limited work has been done on the continuance intention to use OFDS beyond the pandemic. This study provides insight for food retailers on how to enhance their business and retain their customers with the support of technology, even after the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Introduction HIV affects over 38 million people worldwide, affecting the immune system and leading to symptoms like fever, lymphadenopathy, and sore throat. High viral loads can lead to opportunistic infections and tumors. The life expectancy of HIV patients has increased due to high-efficiency combination anti-retroviral therapy. Urothelial carcinoma, a malignant development, damages the urinary canal lining. The connection between HIV and urinary cancers is unclear, the aims of this study to report a case of urethral urothelial Carcinoma in HIV patient who underwent total urethrectomy and perineal urethrostomy. Case presentation A 34-year-old male patient with a papilliferous lump on the glans penis for over six months was admitted to the hospital. Preoperative screening revealed HIV and a urethral mass was found. A partial urethrectomy was performed, revealing high grade papillary urothelial Carcinoma. Five months after surgery, the patient developed a recurrent lump, requiring a total urethrectomy, TUR (transurethral resection) of the mass in the prostatic urethra, and perineal urethrostomy. Conclusion Primary carcinoma of the urethra in HIV patient is an extremely rare case. To date, there is no consensus on the primary urethral carcinoma therapy. The treatment of primary urethral carcinoma is tailored specifically to the patient based on the location, histology, and stage of the carcinoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-460/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Branch retinal vein occlusion following COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection while taking oral contraceptives [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Oral contraceptive use, vaccination for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) generally develops mid-60s patients. Herein, we present a case of BRVO caused by the above mentioned risk factors in a young woman. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about BRVO associated with oral contraceptives, COVID-19 vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2. A 21-year-old woman presented with loss of visual acuity in her right eye for 10 days. She had been receiving oral contraceptives for 2 years for oligomenorrhea before noticing ophthalmological symptoms. Despite having received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, she contracted COVID-19 and developed fever, sore throat, cough, low back pain, and general malaise about 40 days before the initial visit. However, only cough persisted for more than a month. The right eye showed BRVO with macular edema (ME). She did not smoke nor had diabetes or hypertension. Blood test results, including cardiolipin antibody IgG, were normal. She was treated with an intravitreal aflibercept injection. ME in the fundus showed rapid improvement and resolution. Although more than 20 months have passed since the first injection, there has been no relapse of ME. The combination of oral contraceptive use, COVID-19 vaccination, and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce the development of venous thromboembolism, thereby leading to BRVO. Given that cases of COVID-19 have increased globally, patients with retinal vein occlusion who use oral contraceptives are likely to be encountered more frequently.

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/19/e1019232024?rss=1">Visual Deprivation during Mouse Critical Period Reorganizes Network-Level Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>A classic example of experience-dependent plasticity is ocular dominance (OD) shift, in which the responsiveness of neurons in the visual cortex is profoundly altered following monocular deprivation (MD). It has been postulated that OD shifts also modify global neural networks, but such effects have never been demonstrated. Here, we use wide-field fluorescence optical imaging (WFOI) to characterize calcium-based resting-state functional connectivity during acute (3&nbsp;d) MD in female and male mice with genetically encoded calcium indicators (<I>Thy1</I>-GCaMP6f). We first establish the fundamental performance of WFOI by computing signal to noise properties throughout our data processing pipeline. Following MD, we found that  band (0.4&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) GCaMP6 activity in the deprived visual cortex decreased, suggesting that excitatory activity in this region was reduced by MD. In addition, interhemispheric visual homotopic functional connectivity decreased following MD, which was accompanied by a reduction in parietal and motor homotopic connectivity. Finally, we observed enhanced internetwork connectivity between the visual and parietal cortex that peaked 2&nbsp;d after MD. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that early MD induces dynamic reorganization of disparate functional networks including the association cortices.</p>

                <p>GPR37L1 is an orphan receptor that couples through heterotrimeric G-proteins to regulate physiological functions. Since its role in humans is not fully defined, we used an unbiased computational approach to assess the clinical significance of rare <I>G-protein-coupled receptor 37-like 1</I> (<I>GPR37L1</I>) genetic variants found among 51,289 whole-exome sequences from the DiscovEHR cohort. Rare <I>GPR37L1</I> coding variants were binned according to predicted pathogenicity and analyzed by sequence kernel association testing to reveal significant associations with disease diagnostic codes for epilepsy and migraine, among others. Since associations do not prove causality, rare <I>GPR37L1</I> variants were functionally analyzed in SK-N-MC cells to evaluate potential signaling differences and pathogenicity. Notably, receptor variants exhibited varying abilities to reduce cAMP levels, activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and/or upregulate receptor expression in response to the agonist prosaptide (TX14(A)), as compared with the wild-type receptor. In addition to signaling changes, knock-out (KO) of <I>GPR37L1</I> or expression of certain rare variants altered cellular cholesterol levels, which were also acutely regulated by administration of the agonist TX14(A) via activation of the MAPK pathway. Finally, to simulate the impact of rare nonsense variants found in the large patient cohort, a KO mouse line lacking <I>Gpr37l1</I> was generated. Although KO animals did not recapitulate an acute migraine phenotype, the loss of this receptor produced sex-specific changes in anxiety-related disorders often seen in chronic migraineurs. Collectively, these observations define the existence of rare <I>GPR37L1</I> variants associated with neuropsychiatric conditions in the human population and identify the signaling changes contributing to pathological processes.</p>

                <p>In the study of bodily awareness, the predictive coding theory has revealed that our brain continuously modulates sensory experiences to integrate them into a unitary body representation. Indeed, during multisensory illusions (e.g., the rubber hand illusion, RHI), the synchronous stroking of the participant&rsquo;s concealed hand and a fake visible one creates a visuotactile conflict, generating a prediction error. Within the predictive coding framework, through sensory processing modulation, prediction errors are solved, inducing participants to feel as if touches originated from the fake hand, thus ascribing the fake hand to their own body. Here, we aimed to address sensory processing modulation under multisensory conflict, by disentangling somatosensory and visual stimuli processing that are intrinsically associated during the illusion induction. To this aim, we designed two EEG experiments, in which somatosensory- (SEPs; Experiment 1; <I>N</I> = 18; <I>F</I> = 10) and visual-evoked potentials (VEPs; Experiment 2; <I>N</I> = 18; <I>F</I> = 9) were recorded in human males and females following the RHI. Our results show that, in both experiments, ERP amplitude is significantly modulated in the illusion as compared with both control and baseline conditions, with a modality-dependent diametrical pattern showing decreased SEP amplitude and increased VEP amplitude. Importantly, both somatosensory and visual modulations occur in long-latency time windows previously associated with tactile and visual awareness, thus explaining the illusion of perceiving touch at the sight location. In conclusion, we describe a diametrical modulation of somatosensory and visual processing as the neural mechanism that allows maintaining a stable body representation, by restoring visuotactile congruency under the occurrence of multisensory conflicts.</p>

                <p>How humans transform sensory information into decisions that steer purposeful behavior is a central question in psychology and neuroscience that is traditionally investigated during the sampling of external environmental signals. The decision-making framework of gradual information sampling toward a decision has also been proposed to apply when sampling internal sensory evidence from working memory. However, neural evidence for this proposal remains scarce. Here we show (using scalp EEG in male and female human volunteers) that sampling internal visual representations from working memory elicits a scalp EEG potential associated with gradual evidence accumulation&mdash;the central parietal positivity. Consistent with an evolving decision process, we show how this signal (1) scales with the time participants require to reach a decision about the cued memory content and (2) is amplified when having to decide among multiple contents in working memory. These results bring the electrophysiology of decision-making into the domain of working memory and suggest that variability in memory-guided behavior may be driven (at least in part) by variations in the sampling of our inner mental contents.</p>

                <p>The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B is implicated in recessive intellectual disability disorders, and heterozygous, protein-truncating variants in <I>KDM5B</I> are associated with reduced cognitive function in the population. The KDM5 family of lysine demethylases has developmental and homeostatic functions in the brain, some of which appear to be independent of lysine demethylase activity. To determine the functions of KDM5B in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we first studied male and female mice homozygous for a <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> allele that lacks demethylase activity. <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID/</I><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> mice exhibited hyperactivity and long-term memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks. The expression of immediate early, activity-dependent genes was downregulated in these mice and hyperactivated upon a learning stimulus compared with wild-type (WT) mice. A number of other learning-associated genes were also significantly dysregulated in the <I>Kdm5b</I><sup><I></I><I>ARID/</I><I></I><I>ARID</I></sup> hippocampus. Next, we knocked down <I>Kdm5b</I> specifically in the adult, WT mouse hippocampus with shRNA. <I>Kdm5b</I> knockdown resulted in spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and long-term potentiation deficits. These findings identify KDM5B as a critical regulator of gene expression and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus and suggest that at least some of the cognitive phenotypes associated with <I>KDM5B</I> gene variants are caused by direct effects on memory consolidation mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Glycinergic neurons regulate nociceptive and pruriceptive signaling in the spinal cord, but the identity and role of the glycine-regulated neurons are not fully known. Herein, we have characterized spinal glycine receptor alpha 3 (<I>Glra3</I>) subunit-expressing neurons in <I>Glra3</I>-Cre female and male mice. <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons express <I>Glra3</I>, are located mainly in laminae III&ndash;VI, and respond to glycine. Chemogenetic activation of spinal <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons induced biting/licking, stomping, and guarding behaviors, indicative of both a nociceptive and pruriceptive role for this population. Chemogenetic inhibition did not affect mechanical or thermal responses but reduced behaviors evoked by compound 48/80 and chloroquine, revealing a pruriceptive role for these neurons. Spinal cells activated by compound 48/80 or chloroquine express <I>Glra3</I>, further supporting the phenotype. Retrograde tracing revealed that spinal <I>Glra3</I>-Cre(+) neurons receive input from afferents associated with pain and itch, and dorsal root stimulation validated the monosynaptic input. In conclusion, these results show that spinal <I>Glra3</I>(+) neurons contribute to acute communication of compound 48/80- and chloroquine-induced itch in hairy skin.</p>

                <p>Coordinated neuronal activity has been identified to play an important role in information processing and transmission in the brain. However, current research predominantly focuses on understanding the properties and functions of neuronal coordination in hippocampal and cortical areas, leaving subcortical regions relatively unexplored. In this study, we use single-unit recordings in female Sprague Dawley rats to investigate the properties and functions of groups of neurons exhibiting coordinated activity in the auditory thalamus&mdash;the medial geniculate body (MGB). We reliably identify coordinated neuronal ensembles (cNEs), which are groups of neurons that fire synchronously, in the MGB. cNEs are shown not to be the result of false-positive detections or by-products of slow-state oscillations in anesthetized animals. We demonstrate that cNEs in the MGB have enhanced information-encoding properties over individual neurons. Their neuronal composition is stable between spontaneous and evoked activity, suggesting limited stimulus-induced ensemble dynamics. These MGB cNE properties are similar to what is observed in cNEs in the primary auditory cortex (A1), suggesting that ensembles serve as a ubiquitous mechanism for organizing local networks and play a fundamental role in sensory processing within the brain.</p>

                <p>Excitotoxicity and the concurrent loss of inhibition are well-defined mechanisms driving acute elevation in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and neuronal cell death following an ischemic insult to the brain. Despite the high prevalence of long-term disability in survivors of global cerebral ischemia (GCI) as a consequence of cardiac arrest, it remains unclear whether E/I imbalance persists beyond the acute phase and negatively affects functional recovery. We previously demonstrated sustained impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons correlating with deficits in learning and memory tasks in a murine model of cardiac arrest/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Here, we use CA/CPR and an in vitro ischemia model to elucidate mechanisms by which E/I imbalance contributes to ongoing hippocampal dysfunction in male mice. We reveal increased postsynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) clustering and function in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that reduces the E/I ratio. Importantly, reduced GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R clustering observed in the first 24&nbsp;h rebounds to an elevation of GABAergic clustering by 3&nbsp;d postischemia. This increase in GABAergic inhibition required activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ion channel transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2), previously implicated in persistent LTP and memory deficits following CA/CPR. Furthermore, we find Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling, likely downstream of TRPM2 activation, upregulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity, thereby driving the elevation of postsynaptic inhibitory function. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism by which inhibitory synaptic strength is upregulated in the context of ischemia and identify TRPM2 and CaMKII as potential pharmacological targets to restore perturbed synaptic plasticity and ameliorate cognitive function.</p>

                <p>BMAL2 (ARNTL2) is a paralog of BMAL1 that can form heterodimers with the other circadian factors CLOCK and NPAS2 to activate transcription of clock and clock-controlled genes. To assess a possible role of <I>Bmal2</I> in the circadian regulation of metabolism, we investigated daily variations of energy metabolism, feeding behavior, and locomotor behavior, as well as ability to anticipate restricted food access in male mice knock-out for <I>Bmal2</I> (B2KO). While their amount of food intake and locomotor activity were normal compared with wild-type mice, B2KO mice displayed increased adiposity (1.5-fold higher) and fasted hyperinsulinemia (fourfold higher) and tended to have lower energy expenditure at night. Impairment of the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei was evidenced by the shorter free-running period (&ndash;14&nbsp;min/cycle) of B2KO mice compared with wild-type controls and by a loss of daily rhythmicity in expression of intracellular metabolic regulators (e.g., <I>Lipoprotein lipase</I> and <I>Uncoupling protein 2</I>). The circadian window of eating was longer in B2KO mice. The circadian patterns of food intake and meal numbers were bimodal in control mice but not in B2KO mice. In response to restricted feeding, food-anticipatory activity was almost prevented in B2KO mice, suggesting altered food clock that controls anticipation of food availability. In the mediobasal hypothalamus of B2KO mice, expression of genes coding orexigenic neuropeptides (including <I>Neuropeptide y</I> and <I>Agouti-Related Peptide</I>) was downregulated, while <I>Lipoprotein lipase</I> expression lost its rhythmicity. Together, these data highlight that BMAL2 has major impacts on brain regulation of metabolic rhythms, sleep&ndash;wake cycle, and food anticipation.</p>

                <p>Perception is a probabilistic process dependent on external stimulus properties and one's internal state. However, which internal states influence perception and via what mechanisms remain debated. We studied how spontaneous alpha-band activity (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) and pupil fluctuations impact visual detection and confidence across stimulus contrast levels (i.e., the contrast response function, CRF). In human subjects of both sexes, we found that low prestimulus alpha power induced an "additive" shift in the CRF, whereby stimuli were reported present more frequently at all contrast levels, including contrast of zero (i.e., false alarms). Conversely, prestimulus pupil size had a "multiplicative" effect on detection such that stimuli occurring during large pupil states (putatively corresponding to higher arousal) were perceived more frequently as contrast increased. Signal detection modeling reveals that alpha power changes detection criteria equally across the CRF but not detection sensitivity (<I>d</I>'), whereas pupil-linked arousal modulated sensitivity, particularly for higher contrasts. Interestingly, pupil size and alpha power were positively correlated, meaning that some of the effect of alpha on detection may be mediated by pupil fluctuations. However, pupil-independent alpha still induced an additive shift in the CRF corresponding to a criterion effect. Our data imply that low alpha boosts detection and confidence by an additive factor, rather than by a multiplicative scaling of contrast responses, a profile which captures the effect of pupil-linked arousal. We suggest that alpha power and arousal fluctuations have dissociable effects on behavior. Alpha reflects the baseline level of visual excitability, which can vary independent of arousal.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus receives powerful synaptic inputs from corticotectal neurons in the visual cortex. The function of these corticotectal neurons remains largely unknown due to a limited understanding of their response properties and connectivity. Here, we use antidromic methods to identify corticotectal neurons in awake male and female rabbits, and measure their axonal conduction times, thalamic inputs and receptive field properties. All corticotectal neurons responded to sinusoidal drifting gratings with a nonlinear (nonsinusoidal) increase in mean firing rate but showed pronounced differences in their ON&ndash;OFF receptive field structures that we classified into three groups, Cx, S2, and S1. Cx receptive fields had highly overlapping ON and OFF subfields as classical complex cells, S2 had largely separated ON and OFF subfields as classical simple cells, and S1 had a single ON or OFF subfield. Thus, all corticotectal neurons are homogeneous in their nonlinear spatial summation but very heterogeneous in their spatial integration of ON and OFF inputs. The Cx type had the fastest conducting axons, the highest spontaneous activity, and the strongest and fastest visual responses. The S2 type had the highest orientation selectivity, and the S1 type had the slowest conducting axons. Moreover, our cross-correlation analyses found that a subpopulation of corticotectal neurons with very fast conducting axons and high spontaneous firing rates (largely "Cx" type) receives monosynaptic input from retinotopically aligned thalamic neurons. This previously unrecognized fast-conducting thalamic-mediated corticotectal pathway may provide specialized information to superior colliculus and prime recipient neurons for subsequent corticotectal or retinal synaptic input.</p>

                <p>Elevated iron deposition in the brain has been observed in older adult humans and persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has been associated with lower cognitive performance. We investigated the impact of iron deposition, and its topographical distribution across hippocampal subfields and segments (anterior, posterior) measured along its longitudinal axis, on episodic memory in a sample of cognitively unimpaired older adults at elevated familial risk for AD (<I>N</I> = 172, 120 females, 52 males; mean age = 68.8 &plusmn; 5.4 years). MRI-based quantitative susceptibility maps were acquired to derive estimates of hippocampal iron deposition. The Mnemonic Similarity Task was used to measure pattern separation and pattern completion, two hippocampally mediated episodic memory processes. Greater hippocampal iron load was associated with lower pattern separation and higher pattern completion scores, both indicators of poorer episodic memory. Examination of iron levels within hippocampal subfields across its long axis revealed topographic specificity. Among the subfields and segments investigated here, iron deposition in the posterior hippocampal CA1 was the most robustly and negatively associated with the fidelity memory representations. This association remained after controlling for hippocampal volume and was observed in the context of normal performance on standard neuropsychological memory measures. These findings reveal that the impact of iron load on episodic memory performance is not uniform across the hippocampus. Both iron deposition levels as well as its spatial distribution, must be taken into account when examining the relationship between hippocampal iron and episodic memory in older adults at elevated risk for AD.</p>

                <p>Exercise is known to benefit motor skill learning in health and neurological disease. Evidence from brain stimulation, genotyping, and Parkinson's disease studies converge to suggest that the dopamine D2 receptor, and shifts in the cortical excitation and inhibition (E:I) balance, are prime candidates for the drivers of exercise-enhanced motor learning. However, causal evidence using experimental pharmacological challenge is lacking. We hypothesized that the modulatory effect of the dopamine D2 receptor on exercise-induced changes in the E:I balance would determine the magnitude of motor skill acquisition. To test this, we measured exercise-induced changes in excitation and inhibition using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 22 healthy female and male humans, and then had participants learn a novel motor skill&mdash;the sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT). We examined the effect of D2 receptor blockade (800&nbsp;mg sulpiride) on these measures within a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our key result was that motor skill acquisition was driven by an interaction between the D2 receptor and E:I balance. Specifically, poorer skill learning was related to an attenuated shift in the E:I balance in the sulpiride condition, whereas this interaction was not evident in placebo. Our results demonstrate that exercise-primed motor skill acquisition is causally influenced by D2 receptor activity on motor cortical circuits.</p>

                <p>Animals must distinguish the sensory consequences of self-generated movements (reafference) from those of other-generated movements (exafference). Only self-generated movements entail the production of motor copies (i.e., corollary discharges), which are compared with reafference in the cerebellum to compute predictive or internal models of movement. Internal models emerge gradually over the first three postnatal weeks in rats through a process that is not yet fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated in postnatal day (P) 8 and P12 rats that precerebellar nuclei convey corollary discharge and reafference to the cerebellum during active (REM) sleep when pups produce limb twitches. Here, recording from a deep cerebellar nucleus (interpositus, IP) in P12 rats of both sexes, we compared reafferent and exafferent responses with twitches and limb stimulations, respectively. As expected, most IP units showed robust responses to twitches. However, in contrast with other sensory structures throughout the brain, relatively few IP units showed exafferent responses. Upon finding that exafferent responses occurred in pups under urethane anesthesia, we hypothesized that urethane inhibits cerebellar cortical cells, thereby disinhibiting exafferent responses in IP. In support of this hypothesis, ablating cortical tissue dorsal to IP mimicked the effects of urethane on exafference. Finally, the results suggest that twitch-related corollary discharge and reafference are conveyed simultaneously and in parallel to cerebellar cortex and IP. Based on these results, we propose that twitches provide opportunities for the nascent cerebellum to integrate somatotopically organized corollary discharge and reafference, thereby enabling the development of closed-loop circuits and, subsequently, internal models.</p>

                <p>Forebrain neurons deprived of activity become hyperactive when activity is restored. Rebound activity has been linked to spontaneous seizures in vivo following prolonged activity blockade. Here, we measured the time course of rebound activity and the contributing circuit mechanisms using calcium imaging, synaptic staining, and whole-cell patch clamp in organotypic slice cultures of mouse neocortex. Calcium imaging revealed hypersynchronous activity increasing in intensity with longer periods of deprivation. While activity partially recovered 3&nbsp;d after slices were released from 5&nbsp;d of deprivation, they were less able to recover after 10&nbsp;d of deprivation. However, even after the longer period of deprivation, activity patterns eventually returned to baseline levels. The degree of deprivation-induced rebound was age-dependent, with the greatest effects occurring when silencing began in the second week. Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors indicated that hypersynchronous rebound activity did not require activation of Hebbian plasticity. In single-neuron recordings, input resistance roughly doubled with a concomitant increase in intrinsic excitability. Synaptic imaging of pre- and postsynaptic proteins revealed dramatic reductions in the number of presumptive synapses with a larger effect on inhibitory than excitatory synapses. Putative excitatory synapses colocalizing PSD-95 and Bassoon declined by 39 and 56% following 5 and 10&nbsp;d of deprivation, but presumptive inhibitory synapses colocalizing gephyrin and VGAT declined by 55 and 73%, respectively. The results suggest that with prolonged deprivation, a progressive reduction in synapse number is accompanied by a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition and increased cellular excitability.</p>

                Background Relationship age, hemoglobin, and physical frailty have all been investigated in older people with more than one chronic disease. There has been little analysis of the relationship between hemoglobin, age, physical frailty, plasma levels of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), and the gene polymorphism (SNP) rs7895833 A>G. The goal of this study was to find out how SIRT1 level, SNP rs7895833, hemoglobin, age, and physical frailty (frail score) are related in older Indonesian adults with comorbid chronic diseases. Methods This was an observational study. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from the electronic health records of Universitas Sumatera Utara Hospital, Medan, Indonesia. Physical frailty, SIRT1 level, and SNP rs7895833 were measured using an appropriate and valid method. Purposive sampling was used to determine the eligibility of 132 elderly adults from November 2022 to February 2023. Results The indirect effect of hemoglobin on the frail score (FS) through age was negative and significant, according to a conditional mediation analysis (β=-0.0731; p=0.023). Meanwhile, the direct effect of hemoglobin on the FS was negative and not significant (β=0.1632; p=0.052). According to the conditional moderated mediation analysis, the size of the direct effect of age on FS was increased by genotype AG-GG and SIRT1 level (βlow=0.2647; p=0.002, βmiddle=0.2956; p<0.001, and βhigh=0.319; p<0.001). The size of the conditional indirect effect of Hemoglobin on FS through age was negative and significantly increased by SNP genotype AG-GG and SIRT1 level (βlow=-0.0647; p=0.032, βmiddle=-0.0723; p=0.024, and βhigh=-0.078; p=0.02). Conclusions Higher plasma levels of SIRT1 and the SNP genotype AG-GG may both contribute to physical frailty in the elderly population. Hemoglobin levels in the blood fall with age, which can negatively impact older persons who already have chronic diseases. However, the interactions between these factors are intricate, requiring more study to completely understand the processes underlying development.

                The study reported in this paper investigates the impact of the interaction between brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments and its impact on the development of informational concepts among cybersecurity students. The quantitative data were collected by means of Information Concept Test to determine the levels of information concepts according to the Frayer model (1969). The research sample consists of 80 male and female undergraduate students in Qassim University, who were classified into four quasi-experimental groups according to their preferred patterns in the infographic. Quantitative analysis of findings from this study shows an effect for the interaction between the variables of brain-based learning strategies (spaced repetition and distributed practice - mental models) and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments in the test scores of information concepts in the post-administration, where the significance level (.011) is less than the significance level (0.05). Findings also revealed that the repetition of information at increasing intervals of time using the infographics is effective to learning concepts in an organized manner and to improving short memory. Furthermore, the mental model’s strategy also helped to retain information. The study recommends encouraging the use of brain-based learning strategies and patterns of infographics (static/animated) in e-learning environments to explore the relationships between different scientific concepts, to expand students’ knowledge, and to discover inter-relationships between different subject elements. The study provides a platform for further research to employ different brain-based learning strategies within e-learning environments to acquire higher-order thinking skills and improve students’ memory and mental capacity with the use of modern technological techniques that achieve learning quality.

The activation levels of biologically significant gene sets are emerging tumor molecular markers and play an irreplaceable role in the tumor research field; however, web-based tools for prognostic analyses using it as a tumor molecular marker remain scarce. We developed a web-based tool PESSA for survival analysis using gene set activation levels. All data analyses were implemented via R. Activation levels of The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets were assessed using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method based on data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and supplementary tables of articles. PESSA was used to perform median and optimal cut-off dichotomous grouping of ssGSEA scores for each dataset, relying on the survival and survminer packages for survival analysis and visualisation. PESSA is an open-access web tool for visualizing the results of tumor prognostic analyses using gene set activation levels. A total of 238 datasets from the GEO, TCGA, EGA, and supplementary tables of articles; covering 51 cancer types and 13 survival outcome types; and 13,434 tumor-related gene sets are obtained from MSigDB for pre-grouping. Users can obtain the results, including Kaplan–Meier analyses based on the median and optimal cut-off values and accompanying visualization plots and the Cox regression analyses of dichotomous and continuous variables, by selecting the gene set markers of interest. PESSA (https://smuonco.shinyapps.io/PESSA/ OR http://robinl-lab.com/PESSA) is a large-scale web-based tumor survival analysis tool covering a large amount of data that creatively uses predefined gene set activation levels as molecular markers of tumors.

                <p>by Ryeonghwa Kang, Kyungdeok Kim, Yewon Jung, Sang-Han Choi, Chanhee Lee, Geun Ho Im, Miram Shin, Kwangmin Ryu, Subin Choi, Esther Yang, Wangyong Shin, Seungjoon Lee, Suho Lee, Zachary Papadopoulos, Ji Hoon Ahn, Gou-Young Koh, Jonathan Kipnis, Hyojin Kang, Hyun Kim, Won-Ki Cho, Soochul Park, Seong-Gi Kim, Eunjoon Kim</p>

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently accompany macrocephaly, which often involves hydrocephalic enlargement of brain ventricles. Katnal2 is a microtubule-regulatory protein strongly linked to ASD, but it remains unclear whether Katnal2 knockout (KO) in mice leads to microtubule- and ASD-related molecular, synaptic, brain, and behavioral phenotypes. We found that Katnal2-KO mice display ASD-like social communication deficits and age-dependent progressive ventricular enlargements. The latter involves increased length and beating frequency of motile cilia on ependymal cells lining ventricles. Katnal2-KO hippocampal neurons surrounded by enlarged lateral ventricles show progressive synaptic deficits that correlate with ASD-like transcriptomic changes involving synaptic gene down-regulation. Importantly, early postnatal Katnal2 re-expression prevents ciliary, ventricular, and behavioral phenotypes in Katnal2-KO adults, suggesting a causal relationship and a potential treatment. Therefore, Katnal2 negatively regulates ependymal ciliary function and its deletion in mice leads to ependymal ciliary hyperfunction and hydrocephalus accompanying ASD-related behavioral, synaptic, and transcriptomic changes.

                In statistical analyses, a common practice for enhancing the validity of variance analysis is the application of data transformation to convert measurements into a different mathematical scale. This technique was first employed in 1898 by Edgeworth and remains relevant in current scientific publications despite the proliferation of more modern and advanced techniques that obviate the need for certain assumptions. Data transformations, when appropriately used, can make the model error terms approximate a normal distribution. It is also possible to use the technique to correct the heterogeneity of variances or to render an additive model, ensuring the validity of the analysis of variances. Given that this technique can be hastily applied, potentially leading to erroneous or invalid results, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies in the field of agrarian sciences that utilized data transformations for the validation of analysis of variances. The aim was to check the transformations employed by the scientific community, the motivation behind their use, and to identify possible errors and inconsistencies in applying the technique in publications. In this study, we identified shortcomings and misconceptions associated with using this method, and we observed incomplete and inadequate utilization of the technique in 94.28% of the analysed sample, resulting in misguided and erroneous conclusions in scientific research outcomes.

                Rajan et al. demonstrate the significance of a single rRNA modification for the structure and the function of ribosomes, thus affecting the translation of a subset of mRNAs. The changes in ribosome structure affect tRNA selectivity, resulting in codon bias.

                Juárez Tello et al. show that dopamine-sensitive neurons in the mesencephalic locomotor region control movement. D1 receptor-positive neurons in the cuneiform and pedunculopontine nuclei promote locomotion. D2 receptor-positive neurons in the cuneiform nucleus stop locomotion, while D2 receptor-positive neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus induce ipsilateral turning.

                Dossi et al. investigate the mechanisms underlying neuronal network activity modulation by gap-junction-mediated astroglial networks. Combining modeling and experimental approaches, they show that astroglial networks strengthen hippocampal bursting patterns by sustaining neuronal afterhyperpolarization via extracellular potassium modulation of KCNQ potassium channels. This pathway controls in vivo physiological oscillatory activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95718">The role of RNA in the maintenance of chromatin domains as revealed by antibody mediated proximity labelling coupled to mass spectrometry</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic chromatin is organized into functional domains, that are characterized by distinct proteomic compositions and specific nuclear positions. In contrast to cellular organelles surrounded by lipid membranes, the composition of distinct chromatin domains is rather ill described and highly dynamic. To gain molecular insight into these domains and explore their composition, we developed an antibody-based proximity-biotinylation method targeting the RNA and proteins constituents. The method that we termed Antibody-Mediated-Proximity-Labelling-coupled to Mass Spectrometry (AMPL-MS) does not require the expression of fusion proteins and therefore constitutes a versatile and very sensitive method to characterize the composition of chromatin domains based on specific signature proteins or histone modifications. To demonstrate the utility of our approach we used AMPL-MS to characterize the molecular features of the chromocenter as well as the chromosome territory containing the hyperactive X-chromosome in <i>Drosophila</i>. This analysis identified a number of known RNA binding proteins in proximity of the hyperactive X and the centromere, supporting the accuracy of our method. In addition, it enabled us to characterize the role of RNA in the formation of these nuclear bodies. Furthermore, our method identified a new set of RNA molecules associated with the Drosophila centromere. Characterization of these novel molecules suggested the formation of R-loops in centromeres, which we validated using a novel probe for R-loops in Drosophila. Taken together, AMPL-MS improves the selectivity and specificity of proximity ligation allowing for novel discoveries of weak protein-RNA interactions in biologically diverse domains.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92093">Heritable epigenetic changes are constrained by the dynamics of regulatory architectures</a></h4>

              
                Interacting molecules create regulatory architectures that can persist despite turnover of molecules. Although epigenetic changes occur within the context of such architectures, there is limited understanding of how they can influence the heritability of changes. Here, I develop criteria for the heritability of regulatory architectures and use quantitative simulations of interacting regulators parsed as entities, their sensors, and the sensed properties to analyze how architectures influence heritable epigenetic changes. Information contained in regulatory architectures grows rapidly with the number of interacting molecules and its transmission requires positive feedback loops. While these architectures can recover after many epigenetic perturbations, some resulting changes can become permanently heritable. Architectures that are otherwise unstable can become heritable through periodic interactions with external regulators, which suggests that mortal somatic lineages with cells that reproducibly interact with the immortal germ lineage could make a wider variety of architectures heritable. Differential inhibition of the positive feedback loops that transmit regulatory architectures across generations can explain the gene-specific differences in heritable RNA silencing observed in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. More broadly, these results provide a foundation for analyzing the inheritance of epigenetic changes within the context of the regulatory architectures implemented using diverse molecules in different living systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89999">Early acquisition of S-specific Tfh clonotypes after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is associated with the longevity of anti-S antibodies</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been used worldwide to combat COVID-19 pandemic. To elucidate the factors that determine the longevity of spike (S)-specific antibodies, we traced the characteristics of S-specific T cell clonotypes together with their epitopes and anti-S antibody titers before and after BNT162b2 vaccination over time. T cell receptor (TCR) αβ sequences and mRNA expression of the S-responded T cells were investigated using single-cell TCR- and RNA-sequencing. Highly expanded 199 TCR clonotypes upon stimulation with S peptide pools were reconstituted into a reporter T cell line for the determination of epitopes and restricting HLAs. Among them, we could determine 78 S epitopes, most of which were conserved in variants of concern (VOCs). After the 2nd vaccination, T cell clonotypes highly responsive to recall S stimulation were polarized to follicular helper T (Tfh)-like cells in donors exhibiting sustained anti-S antibody titers (designated as ‘sustainers’), but not in ‘decliners’. Even before vaccination, S-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clonotypes did exist, most of which cross-reacted with environmental or symbiotic microbes. However, these clonotypes contracted after vaccination. Conversely, S-reactive clonotypes dominated after vaccination were undetectable in pre-vaccinated T cell pool, suggesting that highly responding S-reactive T cells were established by vaccination from rare clonotypes. These results suggest that de novo acquisition of memory Tfh-like cells upon vaccination may contribute to the longevity of anti-S antibody titers.

">autoMEA: Machine learning-based burst detection for multi-electrode array datasets</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal activity in the highly organized networks of the central nervous system is the vital basis for various functional processes, such as perception, motor control, and cognition. Understanding interneuronal connectivity and how activity is regulated in the neuronal circuits is crucial for interpreting how the brain works. Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) are particularly useful for studying the dynamics of neuronal network activity and their development as they allow for real-time, high-throughput measurements of neural activity. At present, the key challenge in the utilization of MEA data is the sheer complexity of the measured datasets. Available software offers semi-automated analysis for a fixed set of parameters that allow for the definition of spikes and bursts. However, this analysis remains time-consuming, user-biased, and limited by pre-defined parameters. Here, we present autoMEA, software for machine learning-based automated burst detection in MEA datasets. We exemplify autoMEA efficacy on neuronal network activity of primary hippocampal neurons from wild-type mice monitored using 24-well multi-well MEA plates. To validate and benchmark the software, we showcase its application using wild-type neuronal networks and two different neuronal networks modeling neurodevelopmental disorders to assess network phenotype detection. Detection of network characteristics typically reported in literature, such as synchronicity and rhythmicity, could be accurately detected compared to manual analysis using the autoMEA software. Additionally, autoMEA could detect reverberations, a more complex burst dynamic present in hippocampal cultures. Furthermore, autoMEA burst detection was sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in the synchronicity and rhythmicity of networks modeling neurodevelopmental disorders as well as detecting changes in their burst dynamics. Thus, we show that autoMEA reliably analyses neural networks measured with the multi-well MEA setup with the precision and accuracy compared to that of a human expert.

">Adaptation of pain-related projection neurons in acute but not chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain hypersensitivity is associated with increased activity of peripheral and central neurons along the pain neuroaxis. On the other hand, in other neuronal systems, increased activity leads to adaptive reduction of neuronal excitability to maintain homeostasis. Projection neurons (PNs) of spinal and medullary dorsal horns summate the activity of primary nociceptive and local central interneurons and convey it to higher centers. We show that at the peak of acute inflammatory pain, PNs reduce their intrinsic excitability and, consequently, action potential firing. When pain resolves, the excitability of PNs returns to baseline. Using electrophysiological and computational approaches, we found that an increase in potassium A-current (IA) underlies the decrease in the excitability of PNs in acute pain conditions. We hypothesized that an IA-induced decrease in PNs firing may restrain the output from the dorsal horn to prevent sensitization and pain chronification. Indeed, no changes of IA in PNs were observed in chronic pain conditions, and PNs exhibit increased intrinsic excitability and firing. Our results reveal an adaptive mechanism in acute pain conditions for regulating the output from the dorsal horn network, which, if interrupted, could trigger pain chronification.

">Mapping the spatial proteomic signature of dorsal and ventral hippocampus in a mouse model of early Alzheimer's disease: changes in synaptic plasticity-related proteins associated with sexual dimorphism</a></h4>

              
                Background: An initial neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the hippocampal dysfunction caused by amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides accumulation. Soluble oligomeric forms of A{beta} shift synaptic plasticity induction threshold leading to memory deficits in male and female mice in early amyloidosis models. Some protein changes underlying those deficits have been previously studied, but the spatial distribution within the hippocampus, as well as the potential sex differences, remain unknown. Since each hippocampal region (dorsal vs. ventral) has clearly distinct functionality and connectivity, we postulated that some protein changes may be unique to each and might also be sex dependent. Methods: An innovative spatial proteomics study was performed to map whole hippocampal proteome distribution using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry, which allows protein detection with spatial resolution directly on tissue sections. Brains from sixteen adult male and female mice intracerebroventricularly injected with A{beta}1-42 oligomers or vehicle were sectioned. MALDI imaging was performed using a RapifleXTM MALDI TissuetyperTM TOF/TOF mass spectrometer followed by protein identification by traditional tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) directly on the tissue. To precisely delineate both dorsal and ventral hippocampus, a Nissl staining was performed on succeeding tissue sections. Results: Of the 234 detected peptides, significant differences in expression levels were found in 34 proteins, due to treatment, sex, or hippocampal location. Moreover, a significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) was observed, showing a relationship to long-term potentiation (LTP), the functional basis of memory. Accordingly, 14 proteins related to synaptic plasticity and/or AD were selected to further study. Results showed many of the altered protein to modulate glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta}), a protein widely involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity induction threshold. In fact, hippocampal GSK-3{beta} was found overactivated suggesting a facilitated long-term depression (LTD) instead of LTP in AD models. Conclusions: This study offers for the first time the specific protein changes in dorsal/ventral hippocampus in both male and female mice, that modulate GSK-3 {beta} activity, providing new insight in the pathogenesis of early AD and valuable potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets.

">Skin Collagen Actively Regulates the Aging of Cutaneous Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Despite significant progress in understanding the molecular processes of aging-associated neurodegeneration, the upstream mechanisms driving neuronal aging remain elusive. Here, we investigate the potential regulatory roles of non-neural tissues in neuronal aging, using Caenorhabditis elegans PVD polymodal neuron as a model. We find that cutaneous PVD neurons develop progressive excessive dendritic branching during normal aging, functionally correlated with age-related deficits in proprioception. Our study reveals that age-related reduction in skin collagens, a common change across species, triggers the aging process of PVD. Specifically, loss-of-function mutations or adulthood-specific RNAi knockdown of skin collagen genes, dpy-5 or col-120, which are downregulated with age, induce an early onset of PVD excessive dendritic branching and proprioception deficits. Overexpressing dpy-5 or col-120 mitigates the development of excessive branching without affecting lifespan, suggesting a skin collagens' role in promoting healthspan rather than longevity. Notably, neither dpy-5 or col-120 is not involved in aging-associated dendritic beading, another degenerative phenotype in PVD associated with harsh touch response deficits. Moreover, dpy-5 mutation induces ectopic branching in ALM, but does not affect PLM, two other cutaneous sensory neurons. Finally, we identify rig-3, a neuronal Immunoglobulin Superfamily member not expressed in PVD or the skin, functioning in the same pathway as skin collagen genes to preserve PVD neuron integrity during aging. Our findings reveal the causative role of age-related reduction in skin collagens in neuronal aging, selectively impacting distinct neuron subtypes and structures. This study underscores the importance of exploring multi-tissue strategies to comprehensively address the complexities of neuronal aging.

">Benchmarking methods for mapping functional connectivity in the brain</a></h4>

              
                The networked architecture of the brain promotes synchrony among neuronal populations and the emergence of coherent dynamics. These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearson's correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow. In summary, our report highlights the importance of tailoring a pairwise statistic to a specific neurophysiological mechanism and research question, providing a blueprint for future studies to optimize their choice of FC method.

">Comparing MEG and EEG measurement set-ups for a brain--computer interface based on selective auditory attention</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Auditory attention modulates auditory evoked responses to target vs. non-target sounds in electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) recordings. Employing whole-scalp MEG recordings and offline classification algorithms has been shown to enable high accuracy in tracking the target of auditory attention. Here, we investigated the decrease in accuracy when moving from the whole scalp MEG to lower channel count EEG recordings and when training the classifier only from the initial part of the recording instead of extracting training samples throughout the recording. Approach. To this end, we recorded simultaneous MEG (306 channels) and EEG (64 channels) in 18 healthy volunteers while they were presented with concurrent streams of spoken 'Yes'/ 'No' words and instructed to attend to one of them. We then trained support vector machine classifiers for predicting the target of attention from unaveraged trials of MEG/EEG. Classifiers were trained either on 204 MEG gradiometers or on EEG with 64, 30, 9 or 3 channels and with samples extracted randomly across or only from the beginning of the recording. Main results. The highest classification accuracy, 73% on average across the subjects for 1.0-s trials, was obtained with MEG when the training samples were randomly extracted throughout the recording. With EEG, the accuracies were 69%, 69%, 67%, and 63% when using 64, 30, 9, and 3 channels, respectively. When training the classifiers with the same amount of data but extracted only from the beginning of the recording, the accuracy dropped by 12 %-units on average, causing the result from the 3-channel EEG to fall below the chance level. Combining five consecutive trials partially compensated for this drop such that it was 1--8 %-units. Significance. While moving from whole-scalp MEG to EEG reduces classification accuracy, a usable auditory-attention-based brain-computer interfaces can be implemented with a small set of optimally-placed EEG channels.

">THE NEURONAL ARCHITECTURE OF AUTONOMIC DYSREFLEXIA</a></h4>

              
                Autonomic dysreflexia is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by episodes of uncontrolled hypertension that occur in response to sensory stimuli after spinal cord injury (SCI). The fragmented understanding of the mechanisms underlying autonomic dysreflexia hampers the development of therapeutic strategies to manage this condition, leaving people with SCI at daily risk of heart attack and stroke. Here, we expose the complete de novo neuronal architecture that develops after SCI and causes autonomic dysreflexia. In parallel, we uncover a competing, yet overlapping neuronal architecture activated by epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord that safely regulates blood pressure after SCI. The discovery that these adversarial neuronal architectures converge onto a single neuronal subpopulation provided a blueprint for the design of a mechanism-based intervention that reversed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, rats, and humans with SCI. These results establish a path for the effective treatment of autonomic dysreflexia in people with SCI.

">Non-Invasive Brain Mapping Localizes Essential Language Function in Surgical Glioma Patients</a></h4>

              
                The essential neuroanatomical structure of language processing remains unclear. Here we show in a cohort of 79 consecutive glioma patients undergoing surgery in the dominant hemisphere that postoperative language deficits result from subcortical damage to individualized ROIs within normative white matter tracts. We integrate these findings into a data-driven, non-invasive brain mapping approach capable of using cortical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) mappings and diffusion imaging to localize language-essential regions and predict the long-term functional outcome of personalized surgical strategies with an accuracy of 94%. We use this technique to create a group-level probabilistic atlas of functional white matter in glioma patients, revealing evidence for a novel, disease-specific pattern of subcortical connectivity deep to the temporo-parietal-occipital (TPO) junction that anatomically correlates with regional vulnerability to aphasic damage. This study provides novel insight into the functional anatomy of language processing while defining a reproducible approach for non-invasively mapping essential language function.

">Viral mimicry and memory deficits upon microglial deletion of ATRX</a></h4>

              
                The importance of chromatin-mediated processes in neurodevelopmental and intellectual disability disorders is well recognised. However, how chromatin dysregulation in glial cells impacts cognitive abilities is less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that targeted loss of the ATRX chromatin remodeler in microglia alters chromatin accessibility profiles, leading to the de-repression of endogenous retroelements, triggering viral mimicry. Functionally, we find that ATRX microglial deficiency alters the electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons and causes deficits in object recognition and spatial memory. Overall, these findings demonstrate that ATRX is required in microglia to preserve chromatin structure and maintain microglial homeostasis. Disruption of these functions elicit neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits and potentially contribute to the pathology of human neurological disorders caused by ATRX mutations.

">Development of Retinotopic Feedback: Layer 6 Pyramids to Lateral Geniculate Principal Cells</a></h4>

              
                The development of many feedforward pathways in the brain, from sensory inputs to neocortex, have been studied and modeled extensively, but the development of feedback connections, which tend to occur after the development of feedforward pathways, have received less attention. The abundance of feedback connections within neocortex and between neocortex and thalamus suggests that understanding feedback connections is crucial to understanding connectivity and signal processing in the brain. It is well known that many neural layers are arranged topologically with respect to sensory input, and many neural models impose a symmetry of connections between layers, commonly referred to as reciprocal connectivity. Here, we are concerned with how such reciprocal, feedback connections develop so that the topology of the sensory input is preserved. We focus on feedback connections from layer 6 of visual area V1 to primary neurons in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). The proposed model is based on the hypothesis that feedback connections from V1-L6 to LGN use voltage-activated T-channels to appropriately establish and modify synapses in spite of unavoidable temporal delays. We also hypothesize that developmental spindling relates to synaptogenesis and memory consolidation.

">Closed-loop modulation of remote hippocampal representations with neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                Humans can remember specific events without acting on them and can influence which memories are retrieved based on internal goals. However, current animal models of memory typically present sensory cues to trigger retrieval and assess retrieval based on action. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether measured patterns of neural activity relate to the cue(s), the retrieved memory, or the behavior. We therefore asked whether we could develop a paradigm to isolate retrieval-related neural activity in animals without retrieval cues or the requirement of a behavioral report. To do this, we focused on hippocampal "place cells." These cells primarily emit spiking patterns that represent the animal's current location (local representations), but they can also generate representations of previously visited locations distant from the animal's current location (remote representations). It is not known whether animals can deliberately engage specific remote representations, and if so, whether this engagement would occur during specific brain states. So, we used a closed-loop neurofeedback system to reward expression of remote representations that corresponded to uncued, experimenter-selected locations, and found that rats could increase the prevalence of these specific remote representations over time; thus, demonstrating memory retrieval modulated by internal goals in an animal model. These representations occurred predominately during periods of immobility but outside of hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events. This paradigm enables future direct studies of memory retrieval mechanisms in the healthy brain and in models of neurological disorders.

">Stochastic growth and selective stabilization generate stereotyped dendritic arbors</a></h4>

              
                Stereotyped dendritic arbors are shaped by dynamic and stochastic growth during neuronal development. It remains unclear how guidance receptors and ligands coordinate branch dynamic growth, retraction, and stabilization to specify dendritic arbors. We previously showed that extracellular ligand SAX-7/LICAM dictates the shape of the PVD sensory neuron via binding to the dendritic guidance receptor DMA-1, a single transmembrane adhesion molecule. Here, we perform structure-function analyses of DMA-1 and unexpectedly find that robust, stochastic dendritic growth does not require ligand-binding. Instead, ligand-binding inhibits growth, prevents retraction, and specifies arbor shape. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dendritic growth requires a pool of ligand-free DMA-1, which is maintained by receptor endocytosis and reinsertion to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Mutants defective of DMA-1 endocytosis show severely truncated dendritic arbors. We present a model in which ligand-free guidance receptor mediates intrinsic, stochastic dendritic growth, while extracellular ligands instruct dendrite shape by inhibiting growth.

">Altered markers of brain metabolism and excitability are associated with executive functioning in young children exposed to alcohol in utero</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading known cause of birth defects and cognitive disabilities, with impacts on brain development and executive functioning. Abnormalities in structural and functional brain features are well-documented in children with PAE, but the effects of PAE on brain metabolism in children have received less attention. Levels of brain metabolites can be measured non-invasively using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Here, we present the first study of PAE-related brain metabolite differences in early childhood (ages 3-8 years) and their associations with cognitive performance, including executive functioning (EF) and pre-reading skills. We measured metabolites in two cohorts of children with PAE and unexposed children using MRS in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; cohort 1) and left temporo-parietal cortex (LTP; cohort 2). Total choline (tCho), a marker of membrane/myelin metabolism, was elevated in both regions in children with PAE compared to UC, and glutamate+glutamine (Glx), a marker of excitability, was elevated in the ACC. The PAE group exhibited more difficulties with EF, and higher tCho was associated with better EF in both PAE and unexposed groups. In addition, elevated Glx in the ACC was associated with poorer inhibitory control within the PAE group only. LTP metabolites were not significantly associated with pre-reading skills in PAE or unexposed groups. Together, these findings point to altered membrane metabolism and excitability in young children with PAE. These findings provide new insight to potential mechanisms by which PAE disrupts brain development and cognitive functioning in early childhood.

">A common computational and neural anomaly across mouse models of autism</a></h4>

              
                Computational psychiatry has suggested that humans within the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) inflexibly update their expectations (i.e., Bayesian priors). Here, we leveraged high-yield rodent psychophysics (n = 75 mice), extensive behavioral modeling (including principled and heuristics), and (near) brain-wide single cell extracellular recordings (over 53k units in 150 brain areas) to ask (1) whether mice with different genetic perturbations associated with ASD show this same computational anomaly, and if so, (2) what neurophysiological features are shared across genotypes in subserving this deficit. We demonstrate that mice harboring mutations in Fmr1, Cntnap2, and Shank3B show a blunted update of priors during decision-making. Neurally, the differentiating factor between animals flexibly and inflexibly updating their priors was a shift in the weighting of prior encoding from sensory to frontal cortices. Further, in mouse models of ASD frontal areas showed a preponderance of units coding for deviations from the animals long-run prior, and sensory responses did not differentiate between expected and unexpected observations. These findings demonstrate that distinct genetic instantiations of ASD may yield common neurophysiological and behavioral phenotypes.

                We have developed a new method for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) by targeting the LRP1 receptor at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) using a nanoscopic multivalent scaffold decorated with LRP1 targeting peptides. Our experiments on AD model mice have demonstrated that this treatment significantly reduces amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposits and improves cognitive function. This study introduces a new approach to drug design that combines multivalent targeting with controlling membrane trafficking using the same tools for nanocarrier design, creating a novel therapeutic intervention. In doing so, we emphasize the crucial role that the BBB plays in AD pathogenesis, highlighting the vital importance of LRP1-mediated A{beta} clearance.

">Daily Acute Intermittent Hypoxia Elicits Age & Sex-Dependent Changes in Molecules Regulating Phrenic Motor Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) elicits a form of respiratory motor plasticity known as phrenic long-term facilitation (LTF). Repetitive daily AIH (dAIH) exposure enhances phrenic LTF, demonstrating a form of metaplasticity. Two additional factors impacting phrenic LTF are age and sex. For example, moderate AIH-induced phrenic LTF decreases with age in males, but increases in middle-aged females. However, little is known concerning cellular mechanisms of dAIH effects or age-dependent sexual dimorphism in phrenic LTF. Moderate AIH elicits distinct signaling cascades within phrenic motor neurons initiated by 5HT2 receptors (Q pathway) versus adenosine 2A or 5HT7 receptors (S pathway), respectively. The Q and S pathways interact via mutual crosstalk inhibition, a powerful regulator of phrenic LTF. To test the hypothesis that dAIH, age and sex effects on phrenic LTF are associated with differential expression of molecules known to regulate the Q and S pathways, we assessed mRNA of key regulatory molecules in ventral cervical homogenates from spinal segments containing the phrenic motor nucleus from young (3 month) and middle-aged (12 month) male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Since CNS estrogen levels impact molecules regulating the Q and/or S pathways, mRNA was correlated with serum estradiol. Rats (n=8/group) were exposed to sham (21% O2) or dAIH (15, 1 min episodes of 10.5% inspired O2 per day) for 14 days, and sacrificed 24 hours post-dAIH. mRNA for molecules known to regulate phrenic LTF were assessed via RT PCR, including: brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf); serotonin 2A (Htr2a); 2B (Htr2b); and (Htr7) receptors; adenosine 2a (Adora2a) receptors; exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac1); p38 MAP kinase [Mapk14 () & Mapk11 ({beta})]; PKA catalytic subunit (Prkaa1); PKA regulatory subunit (Prkar1a); fractalkine (Cx3cl1); phosphodiesterase type 4 (Pde4b); NAPDH-gp91 (Cybb) and p47 (ncf1); and the PKC{delta} isoform (Prkcd). Significantly higher Pde4b, Adora2a, and Prkcd mRNA were found in young and middle-aged females versus age-matched males; Epac1 was elevated, but only in young females (p<0.001). Ncf1 was increased in middle-aged versus young adult rats of both sexes (p<0.01). Ncf1, Cx3cl1, Adora2a and Prkcd mRNA were reduced by dAIH in middle-aged females (p<0.01), but not other groups. Serum estradiol levels positively correlated with Epac1 (r2=0.29, p=0.002), Mapk14 (r2=0.31, p=0.001), Mapk11 (r2=0.20, p=0.014), and Prkar1a (r2=0.20 p=0.013) mRNA. With higher serum estradiol levels, dAIH decreased Mapk14 mRNA (slope difference p=0.001). Thus, age, sex and dAIH preconditioning influence molecules known to regulate the Q and S pathways to phrenic motor facilitation. These novel findings advance our understanding of phrenic LTF, and inform translational research concerning the therapeutic potential of dAIH to treat breathing deficits in individuals of different ages or sex.

">TRIM9 controls growth cone responses to netrin through DCC and UNC5C</a></h4>

              
                The guidance cue netrin-1 promotes both growth cone attraction and growth cone repulsion. How netrin-1 elicits these diverse axonal responses, beyond engaging the attractive receptor DCC and repulsive receptors of the UNC5 family, remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that murine netrin-1 induces biphasic axonal responses in cortical neurons: attraction at lower concentrations and repulsion at higher concentrations using both a microfluidic-based netrin-1 gradient and bath application of netrin-1. TRIM9 is a brain-enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase previously shown to bind and cluster the attractive receptor DCC at the plasma membrane and regulate netrin-dependent attractive responses. However, whether TRIM9 also regulated repulsive responses to netrin-1 remained to be seen. In this study, we show that TRIM9 localizes and interacts with both the attractive netrin receptor DCC and the repulsive netrin receptor, UNC5C, and that deletion of murine Trim9 alters both attractive and repulsive responses to murine netrin-1. TRIM9 was required for netrin-1-dependent changes in surface levels of DCC and total levels of UNC5C in the growth cone during morphogenesis. We demonstrate that DCC at the membrane regulates growth cone area and show that TRIM9 negatively regulates FAK activity in the absence of netrin-1. We investigate membrane dynamics of the UNC5C receptor using pH-mScarlet fused to the extracellular domain of UNC5C. Minutes after netrin addition, levels of UNC5C at the plasma membrane drop in a TRIM9-independent fashion, however TRIM9 regulated the mobility of UNC5C in the plasma membrane in the absence of netrin-1. Together this work demonstrates that TRIM9 interacts with and regulates both DCC and UNC5C during attractive and repulsive axonal responses to netrin-1.

">Exercising with virtual reality is potentially better for the working memory and positive mood than cycling alone</a></h4>

              
                Although virtual reality (VR) exercise has attracted attention as a factor in exercise habituation due to its mood-enhancing effects, its impact on brain function remains unclear. This study, involving 23 healthy university students, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how VR exercise affects working memory, a key executive function, and its underlying neural mechanisms. Our findings indicate that a 10-min VR exercise session improved mood (arousal and vitality level) and working memory task performance (3-back task) more effectively than exercise or rest alone. Furthermore, the results confirmed that increased vitality from exercise and VR exercise interventions was associated with improved 3-back task performance. However, specific brain regions contributing to this enhancement remain unidentified. These results highlight VR exercise as the optimal exercise program for enhancing working memory function by increasing vitality level. These insights underscore VR's potential as a novel exercise modality with benefits extending beyond exercise adherence to potentially preventing dementia and depression.

                Shape features are crucial for reading. Here we investigate the effect of expertise in reading visual Braille, a script developed for touch that does not share the typical explicit shape information of other alphabets. We compared visual Braille readers and a naive control group and found that individually localized visual word form area VWFA) was selectively activated for visual Braille when compared to scrambled Braille, but only in expert Braille readers. Multivariate analyses showed that linguistic properties can be decoded from Latin in both groups and from Braille in expert readers. Yet, cross-script generalization failed to reveal common representations across Latin and Braille scripts in experts, suggesting script-specific orthographic representations. Primary visual cortex, shape-selective areas (LO), and linguistic areas (l-PosTemp) showed similar multivariate profiles to VWFA, but with cross-script generalization in left Posterior Temporal area only. We conclude that the linguistic properties of a visual script, rather than low-level line-junctions properties, play a major role in how the visual system, and VWFA in particular, processes scripts.

">The Brain Computes Dynamic Facial Movements for Emotion Categorization Using a Third Pathway</a></h4>

              
                Recent theories suggest a new brain pathway dedicated to processing social movement is involved in understanding emotions from biological motion, beyond the well-known ventral and dorsal pathways. However, how this social pathway functions as a network that computes dynamic biological motion signals for perceptual behavior is unchartered. Here, we used a generative model of important facial movements that participants (N = 10) categorized as "happy," "surprise," "fear," "anger," "disgust," "sad" while we recorded their MEG brain responses. Using new representational interaction measures (between facial features, MEGt source, and behavioral responses), we reveal per participant a functional social pathway extending from occipital cortex to superior temporal gyrus. Its MEG sources selectively represent, communicate and compose facial movements to disambiguate emotion categorization behavior, while occipital cortex swiftly filters out task-irrelevant identity-defining face shape features. Our findings reveal how social pathway selectively computes complex dynamic social signals to categorize emotions in individual participants.

">Cadherin 4 assembles a family of color-selective retinal circuits that respond to light offset.</a></h4>

              
                Retinal interneurons and projection neurons (retinal ganglion cells, RGCs) connect in specific combinations in a specialized neuropil called the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The IPL is divided into multiple sublaminae, with neurites of each neuronal type confined to one or a few layers. This laminar specificity is a major determinant of circuit specificity and circuit function. Using a combination of approaches we show that RGCs targeting IPL sublamina 1 and 3a express the adhesion molecule cadherin 4 (Cdh4). Using calcium imaging and iterative immunostaining, we classified Cdh4-RGCs into 9 types that each encode unique aspects of dark visual stimuli. Cdh4 loss selectively disrupted the layer-targeting of these RGCs, reduced their synaptic inputs from interneurons, and severely altered their visual responses. Overexpression of Cdh4 in other retinal neurons directed their neurites to s1-3a through homophilic interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Cdh4 is a novel layer targeting system for nearly a third of all RGC.

">Resting state brain network segregation is associated with walking speed and working memory in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Older adults exhibit larger individual differences in walking ability and cognitive function than young adults. Characterizing intrinsic brain connectivity differences in older adults across a wide walking performance spectrum may provide insight into the mechanisms of functional decline in some older adults and resilience in others. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: (1) determine whether young adults and high- and low-functioning older adults show group differences in brain network segregation, and (2) determine whether network segregation is associated with working memory and walking function in these groups. The analysis included 21 young adults and 81 older adults. Older adults were further categorized according to their physical function using a standardized assessment; 54 older adults had low physical function while 27 were considered high functioning. Structural and functional resting state magnetic resonance images were collected using a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. Working memory was assessed with the NIH Toolbox list sorting test. Walking speed was assessed with a 400 m-walk test at participants' self-selected speed. We found that network segregation in mobility-related networks (sensorimotor, vestibular, and visual networks) was higher in younger adults compared to older adults. There were no group differences in laterality effects on network segregation. We found multivariate associations between working memory and walking speed with network segregation scores. Higher right anterior cingulate cortex network segregation was associated with higher working memory function. Higher right sensorimotor, right vestibular, right anterior cingulate cortex, and lower left anterior cingulate cortex network segregation was associated with faster walking speed. These results are unique and significant because they demonstrate higher network segregation is largely related to higher physical function and not age alone.

">Hierarchical model of human brain oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Whole-brain computational modelling of emergent brain dynamics has become an increasingly important tool for understanding the systems-level mechanisms that govern large-scale brain activity in health and disease. Neuronal synchronization and brain criticality are key candidates of such mechanisms both for healthy cognitive functions and in constituting mechanistic biomarkers for several brain disorders. Despite significant advances, there is not an abundance of modeling approaches that yield both in-vivo-like critical synchronization dynamics and observables that directly match those obtainable with multi-modal neuroimaging. Here, we advance a framework for hierarchical Kuramoto models where the simplest two-layer model comprises a network of pairwise coupled nodes which each contain a large number of oscillators. Already at two levels of hierarchy, this enables explicit representation of local and inter-areal coupling and observations of emergent multi-scale synchronization dynamics. We show here that the model produces observables of meso- and macro-scale synchronization dynamics that are physiologically plausible when compared to, e.g., magneto- and electroencephalographic (M/EEG) data. We also present here a novel approach for fitting this model with individual experimental data that uses not only functional connectivity but also critical dynamics to converge model parameters that are personalized with individual M/EEG and structural-connectivity data. We posit that brain-dynamics matched personalized models yield a basis for 'digital twins' that may support both clinical applications and basic research on the systems-level mechanisms of cognitive functions. The model and model fitting approach advanced here support both new mechanistic understanding of experimental observations and derivation of predictions for future research.

">Reorganisation of circadian activity and the pacemaker circuit under novel light regimes</a></h4>

              
                Many environmental features are cyclic, with predictable daily and yearly changes which vary across latitudes. Organisms cope with such change using internal timekeepers or circadian clocks which have evolved remarkable flexibility. This flexibility is evident in the waveforms of behavioural and underlying molecular rhythms. In today's world, many ecosystems experience artificial light at night, leading to unusual photoperiodic conditions. Additionally, occupational demands expose many humans to unconventional light cycles. Yet, practical means of manipulating activity waveforms for beneficial purposes are lacking. This requires an understanding of principles and factors governing waveform plasticity of activity rhythms. Even though waveform plasticity remains underexplored, few recent studies have used novel light regimes, inspired by shift work schedules, with alternating bright light and dim light (LDimLDim) to manipulate the activity waveform of nocturnal rodents. We undertook this study to understand what aspects of light regimes contribute to waveform flexibility and how the underlying neuronal circuitry regulates the behaviour by subjecting Drosophila melanogaster to novel light regimes. Using a range of LDimLDim regimes, we found that dim scotopic illumination of specific durations induces activity bifurcation in fruit flies, similar to mammals. Thus, we suggest evolutionarily conserved effects of features of the light regime on waveform plasticity. Further, we demonstrate that the circadian photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME is necessary for activity bifurcation. We also find evidence for circadian reorganisation of the pacemaker circuit wherein the evening neurons regulate the timing of both bouts of activity under novel light regimes. Thus, such light regimes can be explored further to understand the dynamics and coupling within the circadian circuit. The conserved effects of specific features of the light regime open up the possibility of designing other regimes to test their physiological impact and leverage them for waveform manipulation to minimise the ill effects of unusual light regimes.

">Two-brain microstates: A novel method for quantifying task-driven inter-brain asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                Joint action and interpersonal coordination between individuals are integral parts of daily life, and various behavioral tasks have been designed to study their emergence and maintenance. One example is the mirror-game paradigm, which examines the dynamics of two people improvising motion together. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood, and inter-brain methods underdeveloped. Previously, we reported unique individual behavioral and neural signatures of performing actions when observed by others using a mirror-game paradigm. Here, we explored inter-brain synchronization during the mirror-game paradigm using a novel approach employing two-brain EEG microstates. Microstates are quasi-stable configurations of brain activity that have been reliably replicated across studies, and proposed to be basic buildings blocks for mental processing. Expanding the microstate methodology to dyads of interacting participants (two-brain microstates) enables us to investigate quasi-stable moments of inter-brain synchronous and asymmetric activity. Interestingly, we found that conventional microstates fitted to individuals were not related to the different task conditions; however, the dynamics of the two-brain microstates were changed for the observed actor-observer condition, compared to all other conditions where participants had more symmetric task demands (rest, individual, joint). These results suggest that two-brain microstates might serve as a method for identifying inter-brain states during asymmetric real-time social interaction.

">Experience-dependent, sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity defined by sex-specific cadherin expression</a></h4>

              
                We describe here the molecular mechanisms by which juvenile experience defines patterns of sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity in the adult nervous system of the nematode C. elegans. We show that starvation of juvenile males disrupts serotonin dependent activation of the CREB transcription factor in a nociceptive sensory neuron, PHB. CREB acts through a cascade of transcription factors to control expression of an atypical cadherin protein, FMI-1/Flamingo. During postembryonic development, FMI-1/Flamingo has the capacity to promote and maintain synaptic connectivity of the PHB nociceptive sensory to a command interneuron, AVA, in both sexes, but the serotonin transcriptional regulatory cassette antagonizes FMI-1/Flamingo expression in males, thereby establishing sexually dimorphic connectivity between PHB and AVA. A critical regulatory node in this process is the CREB-target LIN-29, a Zn finger transcription factor which integrates four different layers of information: sexual specificity, past feeding status, time and cell-type specificity. Our findings provide the mechanistic details of how an early juvenile experience defines sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity.

">Chronic fluoxetine treatment desensitizes serotoninergic inhibition of GABA inputs and the intrinsic excitability of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dorsal raphe serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurons are spontaneously active and release 5-HT that is critical to normal brain function such mood and emotion. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase the synaptic and extracellular 5-HT level and are effective in treating depression. Treatment of two weeks or longer is often required for SSRIs to exert clinical benefits. The cellular mechanism underlying this delay was not fully understood. Here we show that the GABAergic inputs inhibit the spike firing of raphe 5-HT neurons; this GABAergic regulation was reduced by 5-HT, which was prevented by G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (Girk) channel inhibitor tertiapin-Q, indicating a contribution of 5-HT activation of Girk channels in GABAergic presynaptic axon terminals. Equally important, after 14 days of treatment of fluoxetine, a widely used SSRI type antidepressant, this 5-HT inhibition of GABAergic inputs was substantially downregulated. Furthermore, the chronic fluoxetine treatment substantially downregulated the 5-HT activation of the inhibitory Girk current in 5-HT neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that chronic fluoxetine administration, by blocking 5-HT reuptake and hence increasing the extracellular 5-HT level, can downregulate the function of 5-HT1B receptors on the GABAergic afferent axon terminals synapsing onto 5-HT neurons, allowing extrinsic, behaviorally important GABA neurons to more effectively influence 5-HT neurons; simultaneously, chronic fluoxetine treatment also downregulate somatic 5-HT autoreceptor-activated Girk channel-mediated hyperpolarization and decrease in input resistance and intrinsic excitability, rendering 5-HT neurons resistant to autoinhibition and leading to increased 5-HT neuron activity, potentially contributing to the antidepressant effect of SSRIs.

">Reinforcement learning when your life depends on it: a neuro-economic theory of learning</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity enables animals to adapt to their environment, but memory formation can consume a substantial amount of metabolic energy, potentially impairing survival. Hence, a neuro-economic dilemma arises whether learning is a profitable investment or not, and the brain must therefore judiciously regulate learning. Indeed, in experiments it was observed that during starvation, Drosophila suppress formation of energy-intensive aversive memories. Here we include energy considerations in a reinforcement learning framework. Simulated flies learned to avoid noxious stimuli through synaptic plasticity in either the energy expensive long-term memory (LTM) pathway, or the decaying anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) pathway. The objective of the flies is to maximize their lifespan, which is calculated with a hazard function. We find that strategies that switch between the LTM and ARM pathways based on energy reserve and reward prediction error, prolong lifespan. Our study highlights the significance of energy-regulation of memory pathways and dopaminergic control for adaptive learning and survival. It might also benefit engineering applications of reinforcement learning under resources constraints.

">Impact Of Learned Helplessness On Cognitive Performance And Resting-State Connectivity: An fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Learned helplessness (LH) is the phenomenon of resignation in the face of a problematic situation and is caused by the feeling of lacking control in a situation due to internal or external factors. This means that an individual does not seek to resolve the situation they are confronted with and consciously or unconsciously chooses to be passive. The Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) core could be at the root of the persistent action of the LH phenomenon and influences regions such as the striatum and amygdala. It is thought that the LH phenomenon could affect self-perception and it has been shown that the default mode network (DMN) is often associated with self-reflection during the resting state (RS) phase. It is therefore possible that LH influences both self-perception and the DMN. Based on previous studies, we investigated how LH affects participants. We used functional MRI (fMRI) to test this hypothesis. Participants were divided into two groups, subjected to solvable (control group), and solvable plus unsolvable (LH group) cognitive tasks. We also measured electrodermal signals, OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) personality scores, variables related to the anagram resolution, and related these to LH. The study revealed significant differences in the RS contrast between the two groups, with the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) (an area of the DMN) being more connected to the DRN in the LH group than in the control group, and a portion of the Superior Temporal Gyrus being more connected to the PCC in the control group than in the LH group. These results suggest that LH may have a direct impact on the DMN and could lead to the start of long-term changes.

">Unraveling the complexity of rat object vision requires a full convolutional network - and beyond</a></h4>

              
                Despite their prominence as model systems to dissect visual cortical circuitry, it remains unclear whether rodents are capable of truly advanced processing of visual information. Here, we considered several psychophysical studies of rat object vision, and we used a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to measure the computational complexity required to account for the patterns of rat performances reported in these studies, as well as for the animals' perceptual strategies. We found that at least half of the CNN depth was required to match the modulation of rat classification accuracy in tasks where objects underwent variations of size, position and orientation. However, the full network was needed to equal the tolerance of rat perception to more severe image manipulations, such as partial occlusion and reduction of objects to their outlines. Finally, rats displayed a perceptual strategy that was way more invariant than that of the CNN, as they more consistently relied on the same set of diagnostic features across object transformations. Overall, these results reveal an unexpected level of sophistication of rat object vision, while reinforcing the intuition that, despite their proficiency in solving challenging image classification tasks, CNNs learn solutions that only marginally match those of biological visual systems.

	<p>The generation of images from electroencephalography (EEG) signals has become a popular research topic in recent research because it can bridge the gap between brain signals and visual stimuli and has wide application prospects in neuroscience and computer vision. However, due to the high complexity of EEG signals, the reconstruction of visual stimuli through EEG signals continues to pose a challenge. In this work, we propose an EEG-ConDiffusion framework that involves three stages: feature extraction, fine-tuning of the pretrained model, and image generation. In the EEG-ConDiffusion framework, classification features of EEG signals are first obtained through the feature extraction block. Then, the classification features are taken as conditions to fine-tune the stable diffusion model in the image generation block to generate images with corresponding semantics. This framework combines EEG classification and image generation means to enhance the quality of generated images. Our proposed framework was tested on an EEG-based visual classification dataset. The performance of our framework is measured by classification accuracy, 50-way top-k accuracy, and inception score. The results indicate that the proposed EEG-Condiffusion framework can extract effective classification features and generate high-quality images from EEG signals to realize EEG-to-image conversion.</p>

	<p>The psychological refractory period (PRP) effect occurs when two stimuli that require separate responses are presented sequentially, particularly with a short and variable time interval between them. Fatigue is a suboptimal psycho-physiological state that leads to changes in strategies. In recent years, numerous studies have investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on motor control. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of two tDCS methods, anodal and cathodal, on PRP in ten different conditions of stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs) under non-fatigue and mental fatigue conditions. The participants involved 39 male university students aged 19 to 25 years. In the pre-test, they were assessed using the PRP measurement tool under both non-fatigue and mental fatigue conditions. The mental fatigue was induced by a 30-min Stroop task. The test consisted of two stimuli with different SOAs (50, 75, 100, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 ms). The first was a visual stimulus with three choices (letters A, B, and C). After a random SOA, the second stimulus, a visual stimulus with three choices (colors red, yellow, and blue), was presented. Subsequently, participants were randomly assigned to the anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation groups and underwent four consecutive sessions of tDCS stimulation. In the anodal and cathodal stimulation groups, 20 min of tDCS stimulation were applied to the PLPFC area in each session, while in the sham group, the stimulation was artificially applied. All participants were assessed using the same measurement tools as in the pre-test phase, in a post-test phase one day after the last stimulation session, and in a follow-up phase four days after that. Inferential statistics include mixed ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, independent, and dependent t-tests. The findings indicated that the response time to the second stimulus was longer at lower SOAs. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in this regard. Additionally, there was no significant difference in response time to the second stimulus between the fatigue and non-fatigue conditions, or between the groups. Therefore, tDCS had no significant effect. There was a significant difference between mental fatigue and non-fatigue conditions in the psychological refractory period. Moreover, at lower SOAs, the PRP was longer than at higher SOAs. In conditions of fatigue, the active stimulation groups (anodal and cathodal) performed better than the sham stimulation group at higher SOAs. Considering the difference in response to both stimuli at different SOAs, some central aspects of the response can be simultaneously parallel. Fatigue also affects parallel processing. This study supports the response integration phenomenon in PRP, which predicts that there will be an increase in response time to the first stimulus as the interval between the presentation of the two stimuli increases. This finding contradicts the bottleneck model. In this study, the effectiveness of cathodal and anodal tDCS on response time to the second stimulus and PRP was found to be very small.</p>

	<p>Rotenone is a pesticide used in research for its ability to induce changes similar, in vivo and in vitro, to those observed in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). This includes a selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism through which rotenone modifies structure and function of neurons remains unclear. The PC12 cells closely resemble dopamine terminal neurons. This makes it a preferred model for studying the morphology of central dopamine neurons and predicting neurotoxicity. In this paper, we investigated the effects of 0.5 &amp;amp;micro;M rotenone for 24&amp;amp;ndash;48 h on PC12 cell viability and ultrastructure (TEM), trying to identify primary and more evident alterations that can be related to neuronal damages similar to that seen in animal PD models. Cell viability decreased after 24 h rotenone treatment, with a further decrease after 48 h. Ultrastructural changes included vacuolar degeneration, mitochondrial mild swelling, decrease in the number of neuropeptide granules, and the loss of cell-to-cell adhesion. These findings are in agreement with previous research suggesting that rotenone, by inhibiting energy production and increasing ROS generation, is responsible for significant alterations of the ultrastructure and cell death of PC12 cells. Our data confirm the link between rotenone exposure, neuronal damage, and changes in dopamine metabolism, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>

	<p>Infant attention is a cognitive function that underlines sensory&amp;amp;ndash;motor integration processes at the interface between the baby and the surrounding physical and socio-relational environment, mainly with the caregivers. The investigation of the role of non-visual inputs (i.e., vocal and tactile) provided by the caregivers in shaping infants&amp;amp;rsquo; attention in the context of visual impairment is relevant from both a theoretical and clinical point of view. This study investigated the social attention (i.e., gaze orientation) skills in a group of visually impaired (VI) and age-matched sighted controls (SCs) between 9 and 12 months of age. Moreover, the role of VI severity and maternal vocalizations and touch in shaping the social attention were investigated. Overall, 45 infants and their mothers participated in a video-recorded 4 min interaction procedure, including a play and a still-face episode. The infants&amp;amp;rsquo; gaze orientation (i.e., mother-directed, object-directed, or unfocused) and the types of maternal vocalizations and touch (i.e., socio-cognitive, affective) were micro-analytically coded. Maternal vocalizations and touch were found to influence gaze orientation differently in VI infants compared SCs. Moreover, the group comparisons during the play episode showed that controls were predominantly oriented to the mothers, while VI infants were less socially oriented. Visual impairment severity did not emerge as linked with social attention. These findings contribute to our understanding of socio-cognitive developmental trajectories in VI infants and highlight the need for tailored interventions to promote optimal outcomes for VI populations.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases. Epileptic seizures very often result in head injuries that may lead to many adverse consequences, both acute and chronic. They contribute to the need for hospitalization, modification of treatment, and a general decline in social productivity. The objective of our review is to characterize and assess management aspects of seizure-related head injuries (SRHIs) as an important and frequent clinical problem present in emergency department settings. PubMed and other relevant databases and websites were systematically searched for articles on traumatic brain injuries connected with the occurrence of seizures published from inception to 9 April 2024; then, we reviewed the available literature. Our review showed that SRHIs can lead to various acute complications, in some cases requiring hospitalization and neurosurgical intervention. Long-term complications and cognitive decline after injury might be present, eventually implying a negative impact on a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s quality of life. Despite being frequent and clinically important, there are still no widely accepted, uniform recommendations for the management of patients with SRHIs. As such, a concise and standardized protocol for the management of seizure-related head injuries in emergency departments is worth consideration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1351/v2?src=rss">Intention for internal whistleblowing to report sexual violence in higher education institutions: a Nigerian national study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sexual violence is prevalent in higher education institutions in Nigeria and stakeholders have encouraged staff and students to blow the whistle whenever they fall victim to or are aware of any sexual violence case. However, there is lack of data about whether the staff and students of these institutions have the intention to blow the whistle internally (within the institution) or not. There is also a lack of data on the existing reporting mechanisms or preferred whistleblowing mechanisms in these institutions. These have hindered the analysis of stakeholders’ opinions on this topic. Methods This data note presents a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data set collected from staff and students of three categories of government owned higher education institutions (Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges of Education) in Nigeria. Data collection was between February and December, 2021, during which quantitative data were collected from 21,937 students and 3,108 staff. Qualitatively, 138 students and 111 staff participated in a total of 35 focus group discussion sessions. The study provides unique information on respondents’ attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norm to sexual violence whistleblowing. It also provides information on self-reported sexual violence experiences, whistleblowing intention, reporting systems in higher institutions and the preferred sexual violence whistleblowing mechanisms. Conclusions In this data note, we provide a detailed account of the variables in the dataset and then highlight the potential of this study to contribute to improved sexual violence reporting in higher education institutions, thereby reducing the occurrence of the social menace.

                Background Smartphone use has grown in providing healthcare for patients with low back pain (LBP), but the literature lacks an analysis of the use of smartphone apps. This scoping review aimed to identify current areas of smartphone apps use for managing LBP. We also aimed to evaluate the current status of the effectiveness or scientific validity of such use and determine perspectives for their potential development. Methods We searched PubMed, PEDro and Embase for articles published in English up to May 3rd, 2021 that investigated smartphone use for LBP healthcare and their purpose. All types of study design were accepted. Studies concerning telemedicine or telerehabilitation but without use of a smartphone were not included. The same search strategy was performed by two researchers independently and a third researcher validated the synthesis of the included studies. Results We included 43 articles: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n=12), study protocols (n=6), reliability/validity studies (n=6), systematic reviews (n=7), cohort studies (n=4), qualitative studies (n=6), and case series (n=1). The purposes of the smartphone app were for 1) evaluation, 2) telerehabilitation, 3) self-management, and 4) data collection. Self-management was the most-studied use, showing promising results derived from moderate- to good-quality RCTs for patients with chronic LBP and patients after spinal surgery. Promising results exist regarding evaluation and data collection use and contradictory results regarding measurement use. Conclusions This scoping review revealed a notable interest in the scientific literatures regarding the use of smartphone apps for LBP patients. The identified purposes point to current scientific status and perspectives for further studies including RCTs and systematic reviews targeting specific usage.

                Background There are insufficient in vitro bone models that accommodate long-term culture of osteoblasts and support their differentiation to osteocytes. The increased demand for effective therapies for bone diseases, and the ethical requirement to replace animals in research, warrants the development of such models. Here we present an in-depth protocol to prepare, create and maintain three-dimensional, in vitro, self-structuring bone models that support osteocytogenesis and long-term osteoblast survival (>1 year). Methods Osteoblastic cells are seeded on a fibrin hydrogel, cast between two beta-tricalcium phosphate anchors. Analytical methods optimised for these self-structuring bone model (SSBM) constructs, including RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining and XRF, are described in detail. Results Over time, the cells restructure and replace the initial matrix with a collagen-rich, mineralising one; and demonstrate differentiation towards osteocytes within 12 weeks of culture. Conclusions Whilst optimised using a secondary human cell line (hFOB 1.19), this protocol readily accommodates osteoblasts from other species (rat and mouse) and origins (primary and secondary). This simple, straightforward method creates reproducible in vitro bone models that are responsive to exogenous stimuli, offering a versatile platform for conducting preclinical translatable research studies.

                Background This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) and casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride varnish (CPP-ACPFV) in preventing caries development, enamel breakdown, and sensitivity on molars affected by molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) in children. Methods A total of 100 children aged 6 to 9 years were enrolled in the study with two contralateral permanent molars mildly affected by MIH. Affected molars were randomly and equally assigned to receive either SDF or CPP-ACPFV treatment. The interventions were applied at four different time points (baseline, 3, 6, 9 months), and the incidence of caries, caries progression, enamel breakdown, and sensitivity were assessed. Results The findings of this study revealed significant differences in the incidence of caries between the groups treated with SDF and CPP-ACPFV (P-value < 0.05). Similarly, there was a significant difference in caries progression between the two groups (P-value < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in enamel breakdown scores between the treatment groups, as the majority of teeth in both groups exhibited a score of 0. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in sensitivity between the treatment groups throughout the study period. Conclusions In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that molars treated with SDF demonstrated a lower incidence of caries and a higher rate of caries arrest compared to those treated with CPP-ACPFV. Both interventions showed promise in preventing enamel breakdown and improving sensitivity. These findings highlight the potential of SDF and CPP-ACPFV as effective treatments for caries prevention and management, emphasizing the importance of early intervention and appropriate dental care strategies in maintaining oral health.

                Introduction Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis, though rare, harbingers a high risk of mortality as well as permanent and disabling neurological deficits. They invariably become socially aloof and marginalized in most parts of our subcontinent owing to the lack of dedicated rehabilitation units amid their poor economic status. There is a paucity of studies pertaining to such rare epiphenomenon within our region. Materials ad Methods A retrospective study of 16 patients presenting with spinal spondyloptosis in a tertiary care center in Nepal was undertaken. The clinical records of the patients were retrieved from the hospital record section to study the demographic variables, modes of injury, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grades, salient radiological characteristics, management strategies, and the resultant clinical outcomes. Result The mean age of the cohorts in our study was 40 years with an age range of 25-80 years. Most of the patients presented in ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade (75%). The cervical spine was involved in the majority (68.75%) of cases. 8 (50%) patients left against medical advice, 2 (12.5%) were managed conservatively, and 6 (37.5%) were operated. The posterior-only approach was undertaken in 4(66.67%) cases. Tracheo-oesophageal fistula occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. And cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred in 2 (33.33%) patients. The overall hospital mortality was 3(37.5%). Conclusion Traumatic spinal spondyloptosis on our center mostly involved cervical spine (68.75%). 75% of the patients presented with ASIA ‘A’ neurological grade. 50% of them left against medical advice. 37.5% were operated. The overall hospital mortality was 37.5%. This study emphasizes the implementation of a national spinal trauma data bank and the systematic implementation of dedicated neuro-rehabilitation units. This will thereby help improve the clinical outcome among these ‘socially aloof’ and marginalized subsets of neurosurgical patients.

                Background By conducting an in-depth study of the publications, a review was conducted with the goal of evaluating the sample size in educational research. The sample size, represented by the letter “n,” is a key factor in this research because it specifies the number of participants who represent the target population. Although various studies have been published in the literature defining the processes for calculating sample sizes, there is still much uncertainty. It is vital to understand that there is no single all-encompassing method for determining sample sizes for different study designs. Instead, different study designs call for different approaches to determine sample numbers. Methods Information was retrieved from the databases in accordance with updated PRISMA recommendations. The keywords used for the retrieval of the relevant articles from two databases (Google Scholar and PubMed). The articles were selected by thorough scrutiny and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results Seven articles were selected and the comparison was made among the studies in the relation to methods, objective, and outcome from the enrolled studies. Conclusions The evaluation of the seven studies as a whole concluded that the sample size for testing any novel approach essentially required 24.24 participants in each group. The median sample size for the simulation-based educational research was 30. Further research is required to determine the proper sample size based on a single universal formula for all types of designs.

                Background Machine learning and AI promise to revolutionize the way we leverage medical imaging data for improving care but require large datasets to train computational models that can be implemented in clinical practice. However, processing large and complex medical imaging datasets remains an open challenge. Methods To address this issue, we developed Med-ImageTools, a new Python open-source software package to automate data curation and processing while allowing researchers to share their data processing configurations more easily, lowering the barrier for other researchers to reproduce published works. Use cases We have demonstrated the efficiency of Med-ImageTools across three different datasets, resulting in significantly reduced processing times. Conclusions The AutoPipeline feature will improve the accessibility of raw clinical datasets on public archives, such as the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), the largest public repository of cancer imaging, allowing machine learning researchers to process analysis-ready formats without requiring deep domain knowledge.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic affected stakeholder engagement in sustainability research projects in many ways. But which effects appear permanent today, after the pandemic ended? Methods To address this, we interviewed researchers and stakeholders and carried out a survey among European sustainability research projects in 2022. Results We find that the pandemic years disrupted stakeholder-based research, also with lasting effects. The forced shift to online modes showed how digital engagement can bring benefits in terms of easier and more efficient stakeholder engagement, but also that important aspects are lost, particularly regarding intensity of collaboration and depth of insights. Whether to go online or stay offline depends largely on the research objective, which stakeholders to involve, and how well researchers and stakeholders already know each other. Most researchers and stakeholders want to continue online collaboration in the long term, especially those with positive online collaboration experiences from the pandemic years. Conclusions The pandemic has a long-term impact on stakeholder engagement in research; online engagement cannot replace all benefit of previous in-person interactions with stakeholders, but it has led to digital innovations and expanded the engagement portfolio. Our research has provided qualitative insights into the impact of the pandemic on stakeholder engagement in various sustainability research projects and the implications for the long-term future that are relevant to researchers and funding agencies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-104/v2?src=rss">Hepatocellular carcinoma: Advances in systemic therapies [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is traditionally associated with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Sorafenib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was introduced in 2007 as a first-in-class systemic agent for advanced HCC. After sorafenib, a range of targeted therapies and immunotherapies have demonstrated survival benefits in the past 5 years, revolutionizing the treatment landscape of advanced HCC. More recently, evidence of novel combinations of systemic agents with distinct mechanisms has emerged. In particular, combination trials on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab have shown encouraging efficacy. Hence, international societies have revamped their guidelines to incorporate new recommendations for these novel systemic agents. Aside from treatment in advanced HCC, the indications for systemic therapy are expanding. For example, the combination of systemic therapeutics with locoregional therapy (trans-arterial chemoembolization or stereotactic body radiation therapy) has demonstrated promising early results in downstaging HCC. Recent trials have also explored the role of systemic therapy as neoadjuvant treatment for borderline-resectable HCC or as adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence risk after curative resection. Despite encouraging results from clinical trials, the real-world efficacy of systemic agents in specific patient subgroups (such as patients with advanced cirrhosis, high bleeding risk, renal impairment, or cardiometabolic diseases) remains uncertain. The effect of liver disease etiology on systemic treatment efficacy warrants further research. With an increased understanding of the pathophysiological pathways and accumulation of clinical data, personalized treatment decisions will be possible, and the field of systemic treatment for HCC will continue to evolve.

                Prediabetes has attracted considerable attention because it increases the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Prediabetes is also associated with obesity and dyslipidemia. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a crucial element in the clinical course of metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation that tends to increase in patients with diabetes and prediabetes. Most serological markers of diabetes are detected using invasive techniques that cause anxiety and pain. Therefore, the use of noninvasive techniques for frequent biomarker monitoring is necessary. Salivary diagnostics is an upcoming field for sensitive biomarker detection, such as hs-CRP. HbA1C is a valuable glycemic risk marker and has proven to be a reliable test of time. Both HbA1C and CRP play pivotal roles in diabetes and prediabetes. hs-CRP is a measure of CRP level with greater accuracy. The lower limit of its measurement is 0.01 mg/L and the measurement is more than100 times as sensitive than the CRP measurement (lower limit 5 mg/L). Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate and establish a relationship between these factors in prediabetics. Since metabolic syndrome and prediabetes are the cause and effect of each other, correlating anthropometric measurements and lipid profile with HbA1C and hs-CRP will be our focus.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and arrhythmias significantly surge during laryngoscopy and intubation. Anesthesiologists constantly look for ways to minimize these unwanted reactions. Several medicinal interventions have been suggested to mitigate these side effects; intravenous magnesium sulphate injection is one such intervention. Magnesium sulphate is a divalent salt widely recognized for its capacity to lower sympathetic nervous system muscle cell excitability, which lowers blood pressure and causes vasodilation. It is approved as a medicine to treat preeclampsia and control blood pressure. Moreover, there is growing recognition of its benefits on hemodynamic parameters in patients suffering from ischemic infective endocarditis and heart disease. Magnesium is an asset for reducing negative cardiovascular reactions occurring at the time of laryngoscopy and intubation because of its capacity to reduce catecholamine synthesis from adrenergic nerve ends and the adrenal medulla. Intravenous magnesium sulphate will be used in this trial to assess its effect on reducing adverse hemodynamic responses in candidates for elective laryngoscopy and intubation for ENT surgeries.

                Background Many males encounter the condition of erectile dysfunction (ED), particularly individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Stem cell therapy is a burgeoning treatment modality being explored for individuals with erectile dysfunction in the context of type 2 DM. Nevertheless, the available body of clinical evidence supporting its efficacy remains limited. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in managing erectile dysfunction (ED) resulting from type 2 DM. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Indonesia from October 2020 to January 2023. A total of 26 eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving intracavernosal injections of MSC and the other receiving a placebo. Follow-up assessments were conducted at baseline, month one, and month three. The primary outcomes were measured using the IIEF-5 questionnaire and dorsal artery peak systolic velocity (PSV). Metabolic markers were used as secondary outcomes. Results The IIEF-5 scores for both groups showed a significant increase (p < 0.001) from baseline to month three. There was no significant difference observed between the MSC and placebo groups. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the PSV of the dorsal artery between the two groups (p>0.05). There were no significant differences in metabolic markers between the groups. The incidence of mild post-injection pain was reported by only 11% of individuals, indicating a low occurrence of adverse events. Conclusions Intracavernous administration of MSC did not demonstrate superior efficacy compared to a placebo in improving metabolic or erectile function in diabetic males with erectile dysfunction. Additional research utilizing larger sample sizes and more extended follow-up periods is necessary.

                Background Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the skin, joints, and nails (2-3% worldwide), significantly affects quality of life. Genetic and environmental factors also play key roles. Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral corticosteroids help to manage plaque psoriasis symptoms, but combination therapies might offer greater effectiveness and improved safety profiles. These combinations could potentially reduce medication dosages and side effects in patients. Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of various drug combinations over conventional monotherapies in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, which incorporates palmoplantar psoriasis and psoriasis vulgaris, by discovering and utilizing research articles comprising the same or similar variables as PASI 75 and evaluating the information using RevMan v5.4.1. Method We reviewed the efficacy and safety of combination therapy vs. monotherapy/placebo for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (palmoplantar and vulgaris) using PASI 75 via RevMan v5.4.1. Risk of bias assessment and funnel plots were employed to assess the heterogeneity of each paper. Inclusion criteria – Publications < 20yrs, RCTs, plaque/palmoplantar/psoriasis vulgaris; exclusion criteria – Guttate/arthritic psoriasis, pediatric and pregnant individuals, publications > 20 yrs. Results Seventeen studies were analyzed, comprising a total of 2291 patients (n=1147 with combination regimens and n=1144 with control regimen in the analysis). A significant PASI 75- response was observed in the pioglitazone combination subgroup as compared to placebo (OR=4.92,95% CI 2.19-11.05, P = 0.0001); methotrexate combination subgroup as compared to placebo (OR=2.56, 95% CI 1.67-3.94, P< 0.0001) test of subgroup differences showed P= 0.14, I2= 34%. Incidence rate of abnormality in levels of liver enzymes (OR=1.89,9.5% CI 6.69-5.22, P=0.22), nausea (OR=1.28,95% CI 0.77-2.14, P=0.34), headache (OR=1.28,95% CI 0.77-2.14, P=0.58), fatigue (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.41-1.90, P=0.45).] Conclusion This study showed that combination therapy is very effective for plaque psoriasis, with promising combinations of pioglitazone. While safety seems similar between the groups, larger studies are needed to determine the long-term effects. These findings suggest that personalized treatment plans could improve outcomes; however, confirmation through larger trials is crucial before wider use. This opens doors to research on optimal combinations for individual patients.

                Cell-to-cell gene expression variability is an inherent feature of complex biological systems, such as immunity and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool to quantify this heterogeneity, but it is prone to strong technical noise. In this article, we describe a step-by-step computational workflow that uses the BASiCS Bioconductor package to robustly quantify expression variability within and between known groups of cells (such as experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS uses an integrated framework for data normalisation, technical noise quantification and downstream analyses, propagating statistical uncertainty across these steps. Within a single seemingly homogeneous cell population, BASiCS can identify highly variable genes that exhibit strong heterogeneity as well as lowly variable genes with stable expression. BASiCS also uses a probabilistic decision rule to identify changes in expression variability between cell populations, whilst avoiding confounding effects related to differences in technical noise or in overall abundance. Using a publicly available dataset, we guide users through a complete pipeline that includes preliminary steps for quality control, as well as data exploration using the scater and scran Bioconductor packages. The workflow is accompanied by a Docker image that ensures the reproducibility of our results.

                <p>by István Oszoli, István Zachar</p>

The emergence of multicellularity is one of the major transitions in evolution that happened multiple times independently. During aggregative multicellularity, genetically potentially unrelated lineages cooperate to form transient multicellular groups. Unlike clonal multicellularity, aggregative multicellular organisms do not rely on kin selection instead other mechanisms maintain cooperation against cheater phenotypes that benefit from cooperators but do not contribute to groups. Spatiality with limited diffusion can facilitate group selection, as interactions among individuals are restricted to local neighbourhoods only. Selection for larger size (e.g. avoiding predation) may facilitate the emergence of aggregation, though it is unknown, whether and how much role such selection played during the evolution of aggregative multicellularity. We have investigated the effect of spatiality and the necessity of predation on the stability of aggregative multicellularity via individual-based modelling on the ecological timescale. We have examined whether aggregation facilitates the survival of cooperators in a temporally heterogeneous environment against cheaters, where only a subset of the population is allowed to periodically colonize a new, resource-rich habitat. Cooperators constitutively produce adhesive molecules to promote aggregation and propagule-formation while cheaters spare this expense to grow faster but cannot aggregate on their own, hence depending on cooperators for long-term survival. We have compared different population-level reproduction modes with and without individual selection (predation) to evaluate the different hypotheses. In a temporally homogeneous environment without propagule-based colonization, cheaters always win. Predation can benefit cooperators, but it is not enough to maintain the necessary cooperator amount in successive dispersals, either randomly or by fragmentation. Aggregation-based propagation however can ensure the adequate ratio of cooperators-to-cheaters in the propagule and is sufficient to do so even without predation. Spatiality combined with temporal heterogeneity helps cooperators via group selection, thus facilitating aggregative multicellularity. External stress selecting for larger size (e.g. predation) may facilitate aggregation, however, according to our results, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for aggregative multicellularity to be maintained when there is effective group-selection.

                <p>by Luke Trinity, Ulrike Stege, Hosna Jabbari</p>

Understanding and targeting functional RNA structures towards treatment of coronavirus infection can help us to prepare for novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19), and any other coronaviruses that could emerge via human-to-human transmission or potential zoonotic (inter-species) events. Leveraging the fact that all coronaviruses use a mechanism known as −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to replicate, we apply algorithms to predict the most energetically favourable secondary structures (each nucleotide involved in at most one pairing) that may be involved in regulating the −1 PRF event in coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. We compute previously unknown most stable structure predictions for the frameshift site of coronaviruses via hierarchical folding, a biologically motivated framework where initial non-crossing structure folds first, followed by subsequent, possibly crossing (pseudoknotted), structures. Using mutual information from 181 coronavirus sequences, in conjunction with the algorithm KnotAli, we compute secondary structure predictions for the frameshift site of different coronaviruses. We then utilize the Shapify algorithm to obtain most stable SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure predictions guided by frameshift sequence-specific and genome-wide experimental data. We build on our previous secondary structure investigation of the singular SARS-CoV-2 68 nt frameshift element sequence, by using Shapify to obtain predictions for 132 extended sequences and including covariation information. Previous investigations have not applied hierarchical folding to extended length SARS-CoV-2 frameshift sequences. By doing so, we simulate the effects of ribosome interaction with the frameshift site, providing insight to biological function. We contribute in-depth discussion to contextualize secondary structure dual-graph motifs for SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the energetic stability of the previously identified 3_8 motif alongside the known dominant 3_3 and 3_6 (native-type) −1 PRF structures. Using a combination of thermodynamic methods and sequence covariation, our novel predictions suggest function of the attenuator hairpin via previously unknown pseudoknotted base pairing. While certain initial RNA folding is consistent, other pseudoknotted base pairs form which indicate potential conformational switching between the two structures.

                <p>by Justin J. Quan, Lachezar A. Nikolov, Jihui Sha, James A. Wohlschlegel, Isabelle Coppens, Peter J. Bradley</p>

<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> resides in its intracellular niche by employing a series of specialized secretory organelles that play roles in invasion, host cell manipulation, and parasite replication. Rab GTPases are major regulators of the parasite’s secretory traffic that function as nucleotide-dependent molecular switches to control vesicle trafficking. While many of the Rab proteins have been characterized in <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>, precisely how these Rabs are regulated remains poorly understood. To better understand the parasite’s secretory traffic, we investigated the entire family of Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing proteins, which are known to be involved in vesicle fusion and secretory protein trafficking. We first determined the localization of all 18 TBC domain-containing proteins to discrete regions of the secretory pathway or other vesicles in the parasite. Second, we use an auxin-inducible degron approach to demonstrate that the protozoan-specific TgTBC9 protein, which localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is essential for parasite survival. Knockdown of TgTBC9 results in parasite growth arrest and affects the organization of the ER and mitochondrial morphology. TgTBC9 knockdown also results in the formation of large lipid droplets (LDs) and multi-membranous structures surrounded by ER membranes, further indicating a disruption of ER functions. We show that the conserved dual-finger active site in the TBC domain of the protein is critical for its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) function and that the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> orthologue of TgTBC9 can rescue the lethal knockdown. We additionally show by immunoprecipitation and yeast 2 hybrid analyses that TgTBC9 preferentially binds Rab2, indicating that the TBC9-Rab2 pair controls ER morphology and vesicular trafficking in the parasite. Together, these studies identify the first essential TBC protein described in any protozoan and provide new insight into intracellular vesicle trafficking in <i>T</i>. <i>gondii</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002609">Protracted development of stick tool use skills extends into adulthood in wild western chimpanzees</a></h4>

Tool use is considered a driving force behind the evolution of brain expansion and prolonged juvenile dependency in the hominin lineage. However, it remains rare across animals, possibly due to inherent constraints related to manual dexterity and cognitive abilities. In our study, we investigated the ontogeny of tool use in chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>), a species known for its extensive and flexible tool use behavior. We observed 70 wild chimpanzees across all ages and analyzed 1,460 stick use events filmed in the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire during the chimpanzee attempts to retrieve high-nutrient, but difficult-to-access, foods. We found that chimpanzees increasingly utilized hand grips employing more than 1 independent digit as they matured. Such hand grips emerged at the age of 2, became predominant and fully functional at the age of 6, and ubiquitous at the age of 15, enhancing task accuracy. Adults adjusted their hand grip based on the specific task at hand, favoring power grips for pounding actions and intermediate grips that combine power and precision, for others. Highly protracted development of suitable actions to acquire hidden (i.e., larvae) compared to non-hidden (i.e., nut kernel) food was evident, with adult skill levels achieved only after 15 years, suggesting a pronounced cognitive learning component to task success. The prolonged time required for cognitive assimilation compared to neuromotor control points to selection pressure favoring the retention of learning capacities into adulthood.

                <p>by Parth K. Raval, Alexander I. MacLeod, Sven B. Gould</p>

Algae and plants carry 2 organelles of endosymbiotic origin that have been co-evolving in their host cells for more than a billion years. The biology of plastids and mitochondria can differ significantly across major lineages and organelle changes likely accompanied the adaptation to new ecological niches such as the terrestrial habitat. Based on organelle proteome data and the genomes of 168 phototrophic (Archaeplastida) versus a broad range of 518 non-phototrophic eukaryotes, we screened for changes in plastid and mitochondrial biology across 1 billion years of evolution. Taking into account 331,571 protein families (or orthogroups), we identify 31,625 protein families that are unique to primary plastid-bearing eukaryotes. The 1,906 and 825 protein families are predicted to operate in plastids and mitochondria, respectively. Tracing the evolutionary history of these protein families through evolutionary time uncovers the significant remodeling the organelles experienced from algae to land plants. The analyses of gained orthogroups identifies molecular changes of organelle biology that connect to the diversification of major lineages and facilitated major transitions from chlorophytes en route to the global greening and origin of angiosperms.

Synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) are evolutionarily conserved proteins that play an important role in the form and function of neuronal synapses. Teneurins (Tenms) and latrophilins (Lphns) are well-known cell adhesion molecules that form a transsynaptic complex. Recent studies suggest that <i>Tenm3</i> and Lphn2 (gene symbol <i>Adgrl2</i>) are involved in hippocampal circuit assembly via their topographical expression. However, it is not known whether other teneurins and latrophilins display similar topographically restricted expression patterns during embryonic and postnatal development. Here, we reveal the cartography of all teneurin (<i>Tenm1-4</i>) and latrophilin (Lphn1-3 [<i>Adgrl1-3</i>]) paralog expression in the mouse hippocampus across prenatal and postnatal development as monitored by large-scale single-molecule RNA in situ hybridization mapping. Our results identify a striking heterogeneity in teneurin and latrophilin expression along the spatiotemporal axis of the hippocampus. Tenm2 and Tenm4 expression levels peak at the neonatal stage when compared to Tenm1 and Tenm3, while Tenm1 expression is restricted to the postnatal pyramidal cell layer. Tenm4 expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits an opposing topographical expression pattern in the embryonic and neonatal hippocampus. Our findings were validated by analyses of multiple RNA-seq datasets at bulk, single-cell, and spatial levels. Thus, our study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of Tenm and Lphn expression in the hippocampus, showcasing their diverse expression patterns across developmental stages in distinct spatial axes.

                <p>by Md. Hassan uz-Zaman, Simon D’Alton, Jeffrey E. Barrick, Howard Ochman</p>

The phenomenon of de novo gene birth—the emergence of genes from non-genic sequences—has received considerable attention due to the widespread occurrence of genes that are unique to particular species or genomes. Most instances of de novo gene birth have been recognized through comparative analyses of genome sequences in eukaryotes, despite the abundance of novel, lineage-specific genes in bacteria and the relative ease with which bacteria can be studied in an experimental context. Here, we explore the genetic record of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) for changes indicative of “proto-genic” phases of new gene birth in which non-genic sequences evolve stable transcription and/or translation. Over the time span of the LTEE, non-genic regions are frequently transcribed, translated and differentially expressed, with levels of transcription across low-expressed regions increasing in later generations of the experiment. Proto-genes formed downstream of new mutations result either from insertion element activity or chromosomal translocations that fused preexisting regulatory sequences to regions that were not expressed in the LTEE ancestor. Additionally, we identified instances of proto-gene emergence in which a previously unexpressed sequence was transcribed after formation of an upstream promoter, although such cases were rare compared to those caused by recruitment of preexisting promoters. Tracing the origin of the causative mutations, we discovered that most occurred early in the history of the LTEE, often within the first 20,000 generations, and became fixed soon after emergence. Our findings show that proto-genes emerge frequently within evolving populations, can persist stably, and can serve as potential substrates for new gene formation.

We report a new visualization tool for analysis of whole-genome assembly-assembly alignments, the Comparative Genome Viewer (CGV) (https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cgv/). CGV visualizes pairwise same-species and cross-species alignments provided by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using assembly alignment algorithms developed by us and others. Researchers can examine large structural differences spanning chromosomes, such as inversions or translocations. Users can also navigate to regions of interest, where they can detect and analyze smaller-scale deletions and rearrangements within specific chromosome or gene regions. RefSeq or user-provided gene annotation is displayed where available. CGV currently provides approximately 800 alignments from over 350 animal, plant, and fungal species. CGV and related NCBI viewers are undergoing active development to further meet needs of the research community in comparative genome visualization.

                <p>by Michalina Kazek, Lenka Chodáková, Katharina Lehr, Lukáš Strych, Pavla Nedbalová, Ellen McMullen, Adam Bajgar, Stanislav Opekar, Petr Šimek, Martin Moos, Tomáš Doležal</p>

Activation of immune cells requires the remodeling of cell metabolism in order to support immune function. We study these metabolic changes through the infection of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae by parasitoid wasp. The parasitoid egg is neutralized by differentiating lamellocytes, which encapsulate the egg. A melanization cascade is initiated, producing toxic molecules to destroy the egg while the capsule also protects the host from the toxic reaction. We combined transcriptomics and metabolomics, including <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose and trehalose tracing, as well as genetic manipulation of sugar metabolism to study changes in metabolism, specifically in <i>Drosophila</i> hemocytes. We found that hemocytes increase the expression of several carbohydrate transporters and accordingly uptake more sugar during infection. These carbohydrates are metabolized by increased glycolysis, associated with lactate production, and cyclic pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), in which glucose-6-phosphate is re-oxidized to maximize NADPH yield. Oxidative PPP is required for lamellocyte differentiation and resistance, as is systemic trehalose metabolism. In addition, fully differentiated lamellocytes use a cytoplasmic form of trehalase to cleave trehalose to glucose and fuel cyclic PPP. Intracellular trehalose metabolism is not required for lamellocyte differentiation, but its down-regulation elevates levels of reactive oxygen species, associated with increased resistance and reduced fitness. Our results suggest that sugar metabolism, and specifically cyclic PPP, within immune cells is important not only to fight infection but also to protect the host from its own immune response and for ensuring fitness of the survivor.

The molecular mechanisms underlying ASD have not yet been elucidated completely. Evidence has emerged to support a link between microglial dysfunction and the etiology of ASD. This review summarizes current research on microglial dysfunction in neuroinflammation and synaptic pruning, which are associated with altered transcriptomes and autophagy in ASD. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota in ASD and its correlation with microglial dysfunction are also addressed.

                Introduction Carriers of variant alleles of genes that encode liver CYP450 and UGT enzymes may experience abnormal plasma levels of antipsychotics and, consequently, worse efficacy or tolerability. Although pharmacogenomics is a rapidly developing field, current guidelines often rely on limited, underpowered evidence. We have previously demonstrated that meta-analysis is a viable strategy for overcoming this problem. Here, we propose a project that will expand our previous work and create a living systematic review and meta-analysis of drug plasma level differences between carriers and non-carriers of variant genotype-predicted phenotypes for every pharmacokinetic drug-gene interaction relevant to commonly used antipsychotic drugs. Protocol First, a baseline systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted by searching for observational pharmacogenomics-pharmacokinetic studies. Data on dose-adjusted drug plasma levels will be extracted, and participants will be grouped based on their genotype for each drug-gene pair separately. Differences in plasma drug levels between different phenotypes will be compared using a random-effect ratio-of-means meta-analysis. The risk of bias will be assessed using ROBINS-I, and the certainty of evidence will be assessed using GRADE. Following the establishment of baseline results, the literature search will be re-run at least once every six months, and the baseline data will be updated and re-evaluated as new evidence is published. A freely available website will be designated to present up-to-date results and conclusions. Discussion This systematic review will provide evidence-based results that are continuously updated with evidence as it emerges in the rapidly developing field of pharmacogenomics. These results may help psychiatrists in their decision-making, as clinicians are becoming increasingly aware of the patients’ genetic data as testing becomes more widespread and cheaper. In addition, the results may serve as a scientific basis for the development of evidence-based pharmacogenomics algorithms for personalized dosing of antipsychotics to mitigate potentially harmful drug-gene interactions.

                Background Bibliometric analysis plays an essential role in scientific research. However, some research areas still have several gaps. This is also the case in the animal sciences. Therefore, the status of current studies can be analyzed to provide guidance for future research through scientific studies that will be conducted. The aim of this study was to perform a bibliometric analysis of goat breeding to evaluate current trends, gaps in knowledge, and future perspectives. Methods A large dataset was extracted from the Web of Science (WoS), a popular database for scientific studies. According to the WoS, we used 1000 scientific papers (1991–2023) that contained articles, book chapters, data papers, proceedings papers, meeting abstracts, and notes. All bibliometric analyses were performed using the bibliometrix package. Results and Conclusions In 2023, there were 34 studies available. Average citations per year showed that the highest average citation count occurred in 2006 (31.35). In total, 265 scientific journals in the WoS database have published goat breeding studies. Small Ruminant Research led to the remaining 145 articles. In conclusion, scientific studies on goat breeding have become popular in recent years. The authors may gravitate towards popular journals in the future.

                Background This study investigated the association between weather, air pollution, and suicide risk in Sousse. Methods A two-time series analysis examined suicide cases recorded in the forensic service of Farhat Hached University Hospital of Sousse, confirmed by autopsy, over seven years (2010-2016). Climate data were retrieved from the Monastir-Airport weather station, and air pollution data were obtained from the National Agency for Environmental Protection’s modelling platform. Results During the study period, 118 suicides were recorded, with the highest number (19.5%) occurring in 2012. Multiple binary logistic regression analysis revealed that autumn and a decline in NH3 were independently associated with a decreased risk of suicide (p=0.045; ORa: 0.57 CI95% [0.33-0.98], p= 0.009; ORa: 0.24 CI95% [0.08-0.71], respectively). Conversely, a 1 ppm increase in PM10 was associated with a 2.5% increase in suicide risk (p<10-3; ORa: 1.02 CI95% [1.01-1.03]). Conclusions Environmental factors, including seasonality and air quality, may provide valuable insights into suicide risks. Understanding the influence of these factors may have implications in preventive strategies.

                Background Postoperative pain management is a crucial part of patient care for surgeries involving the upper limbs. A popular technique for providing both postoperative analgesia and regional anaesthesia is a supraclavicular plexus block guided by a peripheral nerve stimulator. Recent research has demonstrated that the analgesic effect of ropivacaine, a common local anaesthetic, can be enhanced by the addition of magnesium sulphate. The study aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of utilising magnesium sulphate in addition to ropivacaine alone for postoperative analgesia in patients having upper limb surgeries under peripheral nerve stimulator-guided supraclavicular plexus block. Methods This protocol outlines a prospective, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial that assesses the efficacy of ropivacaine versus ropivacaine plus magnesium sulphate for analgesia post surgery in patients undergoing upper limb surgeries under the guidance of a peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS). 50 Patients will be included in the study in total, and they will be split into two groups at random. PNS-guided supraclavicular plexus block with ropivacaine alone will be administered to one group, while ropivacaine combined with magnesium sulphate will be administered to the other. Regular monitoring will be done during the postoperative phase to determine pain levels, use of analgesics, motor and sensory blockade, and adverse events. Results The study aims to determine if ropivacaine with magnesium sulphate postoperative analgesia is superior to ropivacaine alone in supraclavicular plexus blocks. The motor and sensory blockade duration, opioid use, and any negative results will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine the significance of the differences between the two groups. Conclusion This study protocol compares the effectiveness of ropivacaine alone against ropivacaine with magnesium sulphate in peripheral nerve stimulator-guided supraclavicular plexus block, with the goal of adding to the repository of information on postoperative analgesia in upper limb procedures. The study’s findings could be very helpful in enhancing pain management strategies and enhancing patient outcomes in this context.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor (H<sub>1</sub>R) in the central nervous system plays an important role in various functions, including learning and memory, aggression, feeding behaviors, and wakefulness, as evidenced by studies utilizing H<sub>1</sub>R knockout mice and pharmacological interventions. Although previous studies have reported the widespread distribution of H<sub>1</sub>R in the brains of rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, and humans, the detailed distribution in the mouse brain remains unclear. This study provides a comprehensive description of the distribution of H<sub>1</sub>R mRNA in the mouse brain using two recently developed techniques: RNAscope and in situ hybridization chain reaction, both of which offer enhanced sensitivity and resolution compared to traditional methodologies such as radioisotope labeling, which were used in previous studies. The H<sub>1</sub>R mRNA expression was observed throughout the entire brain, including key regions implicated in sleep–wake regulatory functions, such as the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and dorsal raphe. Additionally, strong H<sub>1</sub>R mRNA signals were identified in the paraventricular hypothalamus and ventromedial hypothalamus, which may explain the potential mechanisms underlying histamine-mediated feeding regulation. Notably, we identified strong H<sub>1</sub>R mRNA expression in previously unreported cerebral regions, such as the dorsal endopiriform nucleus, bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, and postsubiculum. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of the multifaceted roles of H<sub>1</sub>R in diverse brain functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92178">Uncharacterized yeast gene YBR238C, an effector of TORC1 signaling in a mitochondrial feedback loop, accelerates cellular aging via HAP4- and RMD9-dependent mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Uncovering the regulators of cellular aging will unravel the complexity of aging biology and identify potential therapeutic interventions to delay the onset and progress of chronic, aging-related diseases. In this work, we systematically compared genesets involved in regulating the lifespan of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (a powerful model organism to study the cellular aging of humans) and those with expression changes under rapamycin treatment. Among the functionally uncharacterized genes in the overlap set, <i>YBR238C</i> stood out as the only one downregulated by rapamycin and with an increased chronological and replicative lifespan upon deletion. We show that <i>YBR238C</i> and its paralog <i>RMD9</i> oppositely affect mitochondria and aging. <i>YBR238C</i> deletion increases the cellular lifespan by enhancing mitochondrial function. Its overexpression accelerates cellular aging via mitochondrial dysfunction. We find that the phenotypic effect of <i>YBR238C</i> is largely explained by <i>HAP4</i>- and <i>RMD9</i>-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that genetic- or chemical-based induction of mitochondrial dysfunction increases TORC1 (Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) activity that, subsequently, accelerates cellular aging. Notably, TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin (or deletion of <i>YBR238C</i>) improves the shortened lifespan under these mitochondrial dysfunction conditions in yeast and human cells. The growth of mutant cells (a proxy of TORC1 activity) with enhanced mitochondrial function is sensitive to rapamycin whereas the growth of defective mitochondrial mutants is largely resistant to rapamycin compared to wild type. Our findings demonstrate a feedback loop between TORC1 and mitochondria (the <span class="underline">TO</span>RC1–<span class="underline">MI</span>tochondria–<span class="underline">TO</span>RC1 (TOMITO) signaling process) that regulates cellular aging processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92063">Some mechanistic underpinnings of molecular adaptations of SARS-COV-2 spike protein by integrating candidate adaptive polymorphisms with protein dynamics</a></h4>

              
                We integrate evolutionary predictions based on the neutral theory of molecular evolution with protein dynamics to generate mechanistic insight into the molecular adaptations of the SARS-COV-2 spike (S) protein. With this approach, we first identified candidate adaptive polymorphisms (CAPs) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and assessed the impact of these CAPs through dynamics analysis. Not only have we found that CAPs frequently overlap with well-known functional sites, but also, using several different dynamics-based metrics, we reveal the critical allosteric interplay between SARS-CoV-2 CAPs and the S protein binding sites with the human ACE2 (hACE2) protein. CAPs interact far differently with the hACE2 binding site residues in the open conformation of the S protein compared to the closed form. In particular, the CAP sites control the dynamics of binding residues in the open state, suggesting an allosteric control of hACE2 binding. We also explored the characteristic mutations of different SARS-CoV-2 strains to find dynamic hallmarks and potential effects of future mutations. Our analyses reveal that Delta strain-specific variants have non-additive (i.e., epistatic) interactions with CAP sites, whereas the less pathogenic Omicron strains have mostly additive mutations. Finally, our dynamics-based analysis suggests that the novel mutations observed in the Omicron strain epistatically interact with the CAP sites to help escape antibody binding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83712">CYRI-B mediated macropinocytosis drives metastasis via lysophosphatidic acid receptor uptake</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis, with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options. Hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours drives RAC1 activation, conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is well understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signaling receptors. We find that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of <i>Cyrib</i> (the gene encoding CYRI-B protein) accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions, indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor-1. Overall, we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88953">A stochastic world model on gravity for stability inference</a></h4>

              
                The fact that objects without proper support will fall to the ground is not only a natural phenomenon, but also common sense in mind. Previous studies suggest that humans may infer objects’ stability through a world model that performs mental simulations with a priori knowledge of gravity acting upon the objects. Here we measured participants’ sensitivity to gravity to investigate how the world model works. We found that the world model on gravity was not a faithful replica of the physical laws, but instead encoded gravity’s vertical direction as a Gaussian distribution. The world model with this stochastic feature fit nicely with participants’ subjective sense of objects’ stability and explained the illusion that taller objects are perceived as more likely to fall. Furthermore, a computational model with reinforcement learning revealed that the stochastic characteristic likely originated from experience-dependent comparisons between predictions formed by internal simulations and the realities observed in the external world, which illustrated the ecological advantage of stochastic representation in balancing accuracy and speed for efficient stability inference. The stochastic world model on gravity provides an example of how a priori knowledge of the physical world is implemented in mind that helps humans operate flexibly in open-ended environments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85694">Collaborative hunting in artificial agents with deep reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Collaborative hunting, in which predators play different and complementary roles to capture prey, has been traditionally believed to be an advanced hunting strategy requiring large brains that involve high-level cognition. However, recent findings that collaborative hunting has also been documented in smaller-brained vertebrates have placed this previous belief under strain. Here, using computational multi-agent simulations based on deep reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that decisions underlying collaborative hunts do not necessarily rely on sophisticated cognitive processes. We found that apparently elaborate coordination can be achieved through a relatively simple decision process of mapping between states and actions related to distance-dependent internal representations formed by prior experience. Furthermore, we confirmed that this decision rule of predators is robust against unknown prey controlled by humans. Our computational ecological results emphasize that collaborative hunting can emerge in various intra- and inter-specific interactions in nature, and provide insights into the evolution of sociality.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89423">Nanobody repertoire generated against the spike protein of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 remains efficacious against the rapidly evolving virus</a></h4>

              
                To date, all major modes of monoclonal antibody therapy targeting SARS-CoV-2 have lost significant efficacy against the latest circulating variants. As SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineages account for over 90% of COVID-19 infections, evasion of immune responses generated by vaccination or exposure to previous variants poses a significant challenge. A compelling new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 is that of single-domain antibodies, termed nanobodies, which address certain limitations of monoclonal antibodies. Here, we demonstrate that our high-affinity nanobody repertoire, generated against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Mast et al., 2021), remains effective against variants of concern, including omicron BA.4/BA.5; a subset is predicted to counter resistance in emerging XBB and BQ.1.1 sublineages. Furthermore, we reveal the synergistic potential of nanobody cocktails in neutralizing emerging variants. Our study highlights the power of nanobody technology as a versatile therapeutic and diagnostic tool to combat rapidly evolving infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88053">Drift of neural ensembles driven by slow fluctuations of intrinsic excitability</a></h4>

              
                Representational drift refers to the dynamic nature of neural representations in the brain despite the behavior being seemingly stable. Although drift has been observed in many different brain regions, the mechanisms underlying it are not known. Since intrinsic neural excitability is suggested to play a key role in regulating memory allocation, fluctuations of excitability could bias the reactivation of previously stored memory ensembles and therefore act as a motor for drift. Here, we propose a rate-based plastic recurrent neural network with slow fluctuations of intrinsic excitability. We first show that subsequent reactivations of a neural ensemble can lead to drift of this ensemble. The model predicts that drift is induced by co-activation of previously active neurons along with neurons with high excitability which leads to remodeling of the recurrent weights. Consistent with previous experimental works, the drifting ensemble is informative about its temporal history. Crucially, we show that the gradual nature of the drift is necessary for decoding temporal information from the activity of the ensemble. Finally, we show that the memory is preserved and can be decoded by an output neuron having plastic synapses with the main region.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88991">Molecular dissection of PI3Kβ synergistic activation by receptor tyrosine kinases, GβGγ, and Rho-family GTPases</a></h4>

              
                Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) beta (PI3Kβ) is functionally unique in the ability to integrate signals derived from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors, and Rho-family GTPases. The mechanism by which PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions with various membrane-tethered signaling inputs, however, remains unclear. Previous experiments did not determine whether interactions with membrane-tethered proteins primarily control PI3Kβ localization versus directly modulate lipid kinase activity. To address this gap in our knowledge, we established an assay to directly visualize how three distinct protein interactions regulate PI3Kβ when presented to the kinase in a biologically relevant configuration on supported lipid bilayers. Using single molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy, we determined the mechanism controlling PI3Kβ membrane localization, prioritization of signaling inputs, and lipid kinase activation. We find that auto-inhibited PI3Kβ prioritizes interactions with RTK-derived tyrosine phosphorylated (pY) peptides before engaging either GβGγ or Rac1(GTP). Although pY peptides strongly localize PI3Kβ to membranes, stimulation of lipid kinase activity is modest. In the presence of either pY/GβGγ or pY/Rac1(GTP), PI3Kβ activity is dramatically enhanced beyond what can be explained by simply increasing membrane localization. Instead, PI3Kβ is synergistically activated by pY/GβGγ and pY/Rac1 (GTP) through a mechanism consistent with allosteric regulation.

                The cytosolic proteins synucleins and synapsins are thought to play cooperative roles in regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling, but mechanistic insight is lacking. Here, we identify the synapsin E-domain as an essential functional binding-partner of α-synuclein (α-syn). Synapsin E-domain allows α-syn functionality, binds to α-syn, and is necessary and sufficient for enabling effects of α-syn at synapses of cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Together with previous studies implicating the E-domain in clustering SVs, our experiments advocate a cooperative role for these two proteins in maintaining physiologic SV clusters.

	<p>Differences in sensorimotor integration mechanisms have been observed between people who stutter (PWS) and controls who do not. Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) introduces timing discrepancies between perception and action, disrupting sequence production in verbal and non-verbal domains. While DAF consistently enhances speech fluency in PWS, its impact on non-verbal sensorimotor synchronization abilities remains unexplored. A total of 11 PWS and 13 matched controls completed five tasks: (1) unpaced tapping; (2) synchronization-continuation task (SCT) without auditory feedback; (3) SCT with DAF, with instruction either to align the sound in time with the metronome; or (4) to ignore the sound and align their physical tap to the metronome. Additionally, we measured participants&amp;amp;rsquo; sensitivity to detecting delayed feedback using a (5) delay discrimination task. Results showed that DAF significantly affected performance in controls as a function of delay duration, despite being irrelevant to the task. Conversely, PWS performance remained stable across delays. When auditory feedback was absent, no differences were found between PWS and controls. Moreover, PWS were less able to detect delays in speech and tapping tasks. These findings show subtle differences in non-verbal sensorimotor performance between PWS and controls, specifically when action&amp;amp;ndash;perception loops are disrupted by delays, contributing to models of sensorimotor integration in stuttering.</p>

	<p>Plastic production, which exceeds one million tons per year, is of global concern. The constituent low-density polymers enable spread over large distances and micro/nano particles (MNPLs) induce organ toxicity via digestion, inhalation, and skin contact. Particles have been documented in all human tissues including breast milk. MNPLs, especially weathered particles, can breach the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier, inducing neurotoxicity. This has been documented in non-human species, and in human-induced pluripotent stem cell lines. Within the brain, MNPLs initiate an inflammatory response with pro-inflammatory cytokine production, oxidative stress with generation of reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter dysfunction also ensues with alteration of excitatory/inhibitory balance in favor of reduced inhibition and resultant neuro-excitation. Inflammation and cortical hyperexcitability are key abnormalities involved in the pathogenic cascade of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and are intricately related to the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43, a hallmark of ALS. Water and many foods contain MNPLs and in humans, ingestion is the main form of exposure. Digestion of plastics within the gut can alter their properties, rendering them more toxic, and they cause gut microbiome dysbiosis and a dysfunctional gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. This is recognized as a trigger and/or aggravating factor for ALS. ALS is associated with a long (years or decades) preclinical period and neonates and infants are exposed to MNPLs through breast milk, milk substitutes, and toys. This endangers a time of intense neurogenesis and establishment of neuronal circuitry, setting the stage for development of neurodegeneration in later life. MNPL neurotoxicity should be considered as a yet unrecognized risk factor for ALS and related diseases.</p>

	<p>Virtual reality (VR) enables the development of virtual training frameworks suitable for various domains, especially when real-world conditions may be hazardous or impossible to replicate because of unique additional resources (e.g., equipment, infrastructure, people, locations). Although VR technology has significantly advanced in recent years, methods for evaluating immersion (i.e., the extent to which the user is engaged with the sensory information from the virtual environment or is invested in the intended task) continue to rely on self-reported questionnaires, which are often administered after using the virtual scenario. Having an objective method to measure immersion is particularly important when using VR for training, education, and applications that promote the development, fine-tuning, or maintenance of skills. The level of immersion may impact performance and the translation of knowledge and skills to the real-world. This is particularly important in tasks where motor skills are combined with complex decision making, such as surgical procedures. Efforts to better measure immersion have included the use of physiological measurements including heart rate and skin response, but so far they do not offer robust metrics that provide the sensitivity to discriminate different states (idle, easy, and hard), which is critical when using VR for training to determine how successful the training is in engaging the user&amp;amp;rsquo;s senses and challenging their cognitive capabilities. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected from 14 participants who completed VR jigsaw puzzles with two different levels of task difficulty. Machine learning was able to accurately classify the EEG data collected during three different states, obtaining accuracy rates of 86% and 97% for differentiating easy versus hard difficulty states and baseline vs. VR states. Building on these results may enable the identification of robust biomarkers of immersion in VR, enabling real-time recognition of the level of immersion that can be used to design more effective and translative VR-based training. This method has the potential to adjust aspects of VR related to task difficulty to ensure that participants are immersed in VR.</p>

	<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuro-developmental disorder that affects approximately 5&amp;amp;ndash;10% of school-aged children worldwide. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential to improve the quality of life of patients and their families. In this study, we propose ConvMixer-ECA, a novel deep learning architecture that combines ConvMixer with efficient channel attention (ECA) blocks for the accurate diagnosis of ADHD using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The model was trained and evaluated using EEG recordings from 60 healthy children and 61 children with ADHD. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the ConvMixer-ECA. The results showed that the ConvMixer-ECA performed well in ADHD recognition with 94.52% accuracy. The incorporation of attentional mechanisms, in particular ECA, improved the performance of ConvMixer; it outperformed other attention-based variants. In addition, ConvMixer-ECA outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning models including EEGNet, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. t-SNE visualization of the output of this model layer validated the effectiveness of ConvMixer-ECA in capturing the underlying patterns and features that separate ADHD from typically developing individuals through hierarchical feature learning. These outcomes demonstrate the potential of ConvMixer-ECA as a valuable tool to assist clinicians in the early diagnosis and intervention of ADHD in children.</p>

	<p>We present a novel set of quantitative measures for &amp;amp;ldquo;likeness&amp;amp;rdquo; (error function) designed to alleviate the time-consuming and subjective nature of manually comparing biological recordings from electrophysiological experiments with the outcomes of their mathematical models. Our innovative &amp;amp;ldquo;blended&amp;amp;rdquo; system approach offers an objective, high-throughput, and computationally efficient method for comparing biological and mathematical models. This approach involves using voltage recordings of biological neurons to drive and train mathematical models, facilitating the derivation of the error function for further parameter optimization. Our calibration process incorporates measurements such as action potential (AP) frequency, voltage moving average, voltage envelopes, and the probability of post-synaptic channels. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we utilized the sea slug Melibe leonina swim central pattern generator (CPG) as our model circuit and conducted electrophysiological experiments with TTX to isolate CPG interneurons. During the comparison of biological recordings and mathematically simulated neurons, we performed a grid search of inhibitory and excitatory synapse conductance. Our findings indicate that a weighted sum of simple functions is essential for comprehensively capturing a neuron&amp;amp;rsquo;s rhythmic activity. Overall, our study suggests that our blended system approach holds promise for enabling objective and high-throughput comparisons between biological and mathematical models, offering significant potential for advancing research in neural circuitry and related fields.</p>

	<p>B355252 is a small molecular compound known for potentiating neural growth factor and protecting against neuronal cell death induced by glutamate in vitro and cerebral ischemia in vivo. However, its other biological functions remain unclear. This study aims to investigate whether B355252 suppresses neuroinflammatory responses and cell death in the brain. C57BL/6j mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single dosage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg) to induce inflammation. B355252 (1 mg/kg) intervention was started two days prior to the LPS injection. The animal behavioral changes were assessed pre- and post-LPS injections. The animal brains were harvested at 4 and 24 h post-LPS injection, and histological, biochemical, and cytokine array outcomes were examined. Results showed that B355252 improved LPS-induced behavioral deterioration, mitigated brain tissue damage, and suppressed the activation of microglial and astrocytes. Furthermore, B355252 reduced the protein levels of key pyroptotic markers TLR4, NLRP3, and caspase-1 and inhibited the LPS-induced increases in IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-18, and cytokines. In conclusion, B355252 demonstrates a potent anti-neuroinflammatory effect in vivo, suggesting that its potential therapeutic value warrants further investigation.</p>

	<p>The examination of connected speech may serve as a valuable tool for exploring speech output in both healthy speakers and individuals with language disorders. Numerous studies incorporate various fluency and silence measures into their analyses to investigate speech output patterns in different populations, along with the underlying cognitive processes that occur while speaking. However, methodological inconsistencies across existing studies pose challenges in comparing their results. In the current study, we introduce CSAP (Connected Speech Analysis Protocol), which is a specific methodological approach to investigate fluency metrics, such as articulation rate and speech rate, as well as silence measures, including silent pauses&amp;amp;rsquo; frequency and duration. We emphasize the importance of employing a comprehensive set of measures within a specific methodological framework to better understand speech output patterns. Additionally, we advocate for the use of distinct narrative tasks for a thorough investigation of speech output in different conditions. We provide an example of data on which we implement CSAP to showcase the proposed pipeline. In conclusion, CSAP offers a comprehensive framework for investigating speech output patterns, incorporating fluency metrics and silence measures in distinct narrative tasks, thus allowing a detailed quantification of connected speech in both healthy and clinical populations. We emphasize the significance of adopting a unified methodological approach in connected speech studies, enabling the integration of results for more robust and generalizable conclusions.</p>

	<p>Testing of ChatGPT has recently been performed over a diverse range of topics. However, most of these assessments have been based on broad domains of knowledge. Here, we test ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s knowledge of tinnitus, an important but specialized aspect of audiology and otolaryngology. Testing involved evaluating ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s answers to a defined set of 10 questions on tinnitus. Furthermore, given the technology is advancing quickly, we re-evaluated the responses to the same 10 questions 3 and 6 months later. The accuracy of the responses was rated by 6 experts (the authors) using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. Most of ChatGPT&amp;amp;rsquo;s responses were rated as satisfactory or better. However, we did detect a few instances where the responses were not accurate and might be considered somewhat misleading. Over the first 3 months, the ratings generally improved, but there was no more significant improvement at 6 months. In our judgment, ChatGPT provided unexpectedly good responses, given that the questions were quite specific. Although no potentially harmful errors were identified, some mistakes could be seen as somewhat misleading. ChatGPT shows great potential if further developed by experts in specific areas, but for now, it is not yet ready for serious application.</p>

	<p>Orexin/hypocretin terminals innervate the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which projects to motor control areas important for spontaneous physical activity (SPA) and energy expenditure (EE). Orexin receptors are expressed in the DRN, and obesity-resistant (OR) rats show higher expression of these receptors in the DRN and elevated SPA/EE. We hypothesized that orexin-A in the DRN enhances SPA/EE and that DRN-GABA modulates the effect of orexin-A on SPA/EE. We manipulated orexin tone in the DRN either through direct injection of orexin-A or through the chemogenetic activation of lateral-hypothalamic (LH) orexin neurons. In the orexin neuron activation experiment, fifteen minutes prior to the chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons, the mice received either the GABA-agonist muscimol or antagonist bicuculline injected into the DRN, and SPA/EE was monitored for 24 h. In a separate experiment, orexin-A was injected into the DRN to study the direct effect of DRN orexin on SPA/EE. We found that the activation of orexin neurons elevates SPA/EE, and manipulation of GABA in the DRN does not alter the SPA response to orexin neuron activation. Similarly, intra-DRN orexin-A enhanced SPA and EE in the mice. These results suggest that orexin-A in the DRN facilitates negative energy balance by increasing physical activity-induced EE, and that modulation of DRN orexin-A is a potential strategy to promote SPA and EE.</p>

                <p>Sleep spindles appear to play an important role in learning new motor skills. Motor skill learning engages several brain regions with two important areas being the motor cortex (M1) and the cerebellum (CB). However, the neurophysiological processes in these areas during sleep, especially how spindle oscillations affect local and cross-region spiking, are not fully understood. We recorded an activity from the M1 and cerebellar cortex in eight rats during spontaneous activity to investigate how sleep spindles in these regions are related to local spiking as well as cross-region spiking. We found that M1 firing was significantly changed during both M1 and CB spindles, and this spiking occurred at a preferred phase of the spindle. On average, M1 and CB neurons showed most spiking at the M1 or CB spindle peaks. These neurons also developed a preferential phase locking to local or cross-area spindles with the greatest phase-locking value at spindle peaks; however, this preferential phase locking was not significant for cerebellar neurons when compared with CB spindles. Additionally, we found that the percentage of task-modulated cells in the M1 and CB that fired with nonuniform spike phase distribution during M1/CB spindle peaks were greater in the rats that learned a reach-to-grasp motor task robustly. Finally, we found that spindle band LFP coherence (for M1 and CB LFPs) showed a positive correlation with success rate in the motor task. These findings support the idea that sleep spindles in both the M1 and CB recruit neurons that participate in the awake task to support motor memory consolidation.</p>

                <p>Resting-state networks (RSNs) are increasingly forwarded as candidate biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. Such biomarkers may provide objective measures for evaluating novel therapeutic interventions in nonhuman primates often used in translational neuroimaging research.

Twenty-seven squirrel monkeys [<I>n </I>= 12 adolescents (6 male/6 female) ~2.5&nbsp;years and <I>n </I>= 15 adults (7 male/8 female) ~9.5&nbsp;years] were gradually acclimated to awake scanning procedures; whole-brain fMRI images were acquired with a 9.4&nbsp;T scanner. Group-level independent component analysis (ICA; 30 ICs) with dual regression was used to detect and compare RSNs. Twenty ICs corresponding to physiologically meaningful networks representing a range of neural functions, including motor, sensory, reward, and cognitive processes, were identified in both adolescent and adult monkeys. The reproducibility of these RSNs was evaluated across several ICA model orders. Adults showed a trend for greater connectivity compared with adolescent subjects in two of the networks of interest: (1) in the right occipital region with the OFC network and (2) in the left temporal cortex, bilateral occipital cortex, and cerebellum with the posterior cingulate network. However, when age was entered into the above model, this trend for significance was lost. These results demonstrate that squirrel monkey RSNs are stable and consistent with RSNs previously identified in humans, rodents, and other nonhuman primate species. These data also identify several networks in adolescence that are conserved and others that may change into adulthood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26945?af=R">Illusions of Self‐Motion during Magnetic Resonance‐Guided Focused Ultrasound Thalamotomy for Tremor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Brain networks mediating vestibular perception of self-motion overlap with those mediating balance. A systematic mapping of vestibular perceptual pathways in the thalamus may reveal new brain modulation targets for improving balance in neurological conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we systematically report how magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery of the nucleus ventralis intermedius of the thalamus commonly evokes transient patient-reported illusions of self-motion. In 46 consecutive patients, we linked the descriptions of self-motion to sonication power and 3-dimensional (3D) coordinates of sonication targets. Target coordinates were normalized using a standard atlas, and a 3D model of the nucleus ventralis intermedius and adjacent structures was created to link sonication target to the illusion.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 63% of patients reported illusions of self-motion, which were more likely with increased sonication power and with targets located more inferiorly along the rostrocaudal axis. Higher power and more inferiorly targeted sonications increased the likelihood of experiencing illusions of self-motion by 4 and 2 times, respectively (odds ratios = 4.03 for power, 2.098 for location).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of magnetic vestibular stimulation is the most plausible explanation for these illusions of self-motion. Temporary unilateral modulation of vestibular pathways (via magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound) unveils the central adaptation to the magnetic field-induced peripheral vestibular bias, leading to an explicable illusion of motion. Consequently, systematic mapping of vestibular perceptual pathways via magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound may reveal new intracerebral targets for improving balance in neurological conditions.

                <p>by Udaysankar Chockanathan, Krishnan Padmanabhan</p>

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by a range of behavioral alterations, including memory loss and psychiatric symptoms. While there is evidence that molecular pathologies, such as amyloid beta (Aβ), contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology gives rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis is that Aβ exerts differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the neurophysiology and connectivity of different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), two hippocampal areas known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in the APP/PS1 mouse model of amyloidosis. Despite similar levels of Aβ pathology, dCA1 and vCA1 showed distinct disruptions in neuronal population activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dCA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in APP/PS1 mice relative to age-matched C57BL/6 controls. However, in vCA1, APP/PS1 mice had increased pair-wise correlations and entropy as compared to age matched controls. Finally, using maximum entropy models, we connected the microscopic features of population activity (correlations) to the macroscopic features of the population code (entropy). We found that the models’ performance increased in predicting dCA1 activity, but decreased in predicting vCA1 activity, in APP/PS1 mice relative to the controls. Taken together, we found that Aβ exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions, suggesting that the various behavioral deficits of AD may reflect underlying heterogeneities in neuronal circuits and the different disruptions that Aβ pathology causes in those circuits.

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies reveal the incredible complexity of genome organization. Maps of increasing size, depth, and resolution are now used to probe genome architecture across cell states, types, and organisms. Larger datasets add challenges at each step of computational analysis, from storage and memory constraints to researchers’ time; however, analysis tools that meet these increased resource demands have not kept pace. Furthermore, existing tools offer limited support for customizing analysis for specific use cases or new biology. Here we introduce <i>cooltools</i> (https://github.com/open2c/cooltools), a suite of computational tools that enables flexible, scalable, and reproducible analysis of high-resolution contact frequency data. <i>Cooltools</i> leverages the widely-adopted cooler format which handles storage and access for high-resolution datasets. <i>Cooltools</i> provides a paired command line interface (CLI) and Python application programming interface (API), which respectively facilitate workflows on high-performance computing clusters and in interactive analysis environments. In short, <i>cooltools</i> enables the effective use of the latest and largest genome folding datasets.

A challenging goal of neural coding is to characterize the neural representations underlying visual perception. To this end, multi-unit activity (MUA) of macaque visual cortex was recorded in a passive fixation task upon presentation of faces and natural images. We analyzed the relationship between MUA and latent representations of state-of-the-art deep generative models, including the conventional and feature-disentangled representations of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i.e., <i>z</i>- and <i>w</i>-latents of StyleGAN, respectively) and language-contrastive representations of latent diffusion networks (i.e., CLIP-latents of Stable Diffusion). A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled <i>w</i> representations outperform both <i>z</i> and CLIP representations in explaining neural responses. Further, <i>w</i>-latent features were found to be positioned at the higher end of the complexity gradient which indicates that they capture visual information relevant to high-level neural activity. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding.

                <p>by Benjamin Antin, Masato Sadahiro, Marta Gajowa, Marcus A. Triplett, Hillel Adesnik, Liam Paninski</p>

Monosynaptic connectivity mapping is crucial for building circuit-level models of neural computation. Two-photon optogenetic stimulation, when combined with whole-cell recording, enables large-scale mapping of physiological circuit parameters. In this experimental setup, recorded postsynaptic currents are used to infer the presence and strength of connections. For many cell types, nearby connections are those we expect to be strongest. However, when the postsynaptic cell expresses opsin, optical excitation of nearby cells can induce direct photocurrents in the postsynaptic cell. These photocurrent artifacts contaminate synaptic currents, making it difficult or impossible to probe connectivity for nearby cells. To overcome this problem, we developed a computational tool, Photocurrent Removal with Constraints (PhoRC). Our method is based on a constrained matrix factorization model which leverages the fact that photocurrent kinetics are less variable than those of synaptic currents. We demonstrate on real and simulated data that PhoRC consistently removes photocurrents while preserving synaptic currents, despite variations in photocurrent kinetics across datasets. Our method allows the discovery of synaptic connections which would have been otherwise obscured by photocurrent artifacts, and may thus reveal a more complete picture of synaptic connectivity. PhoRC runs faster than real time and is available as open source software.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012052">On the impact of re-mating and residual fertility on the Sterile Insect Technique efficacy: Case study with the medfly, Ceratitis capitata</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yves Dumont, Clélia F. Oliva</p>

The sterile insect technique (SIT) can be an efficient solution for reducing or eliminating certain insect pest populations. It is widely used in agriculture against fruit flies, including the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), <i>Ceratitis capitata</i>. The re-mating tendency of medfly females and the fact that the released sterile males may have some residual fertility could be a challenge for the successful implementation of the SIT. Obtaining the right balance between sterility level and sterile male quality (competitiveness, longevity, etc) is the key to a cost-efficient program. Since field experimental approaches can be impacted by many environmental variables, it is difficult to get a clear understanding on how specific parameters, alone or in combination, may affect the SIT efficiency. The use of models not only helps to gather knowledge, but it allows the simulation of a wide range of scenarios and can be easily adapted to local populations and sterile male production.
In this study, we consider single- and double-mated females. We first show that SIT can be successful only if the residual fertility is less than a threshold value that depends on the basic offspring number of the targeted pest population, the re-mating rates, and the parameters of double-mated females. Then, we show how the sterile male release rate is affected by the parameters of double-mated females and the male residual fertility. Different scenarios are explored with continuous and periodic sterile male releases, with and without ginger aromatherapy, which is known to enhance sterile male competitiveness, and also taking into account some biological parameters related to females that have been mated twice, either first by a wild (sterile) male and then a sterile (wild) male, or by two wild males only. Parameter values were chosen for peach as host fruit to reflect what could be expected in the Corsican context, where SIT against the medfly is under consideration.
Our results suggest that ginger aromatherapy can be a decisive factor determining the success of SIT against medfly. We also emphasize the importance of estimating the duration of the refractory period between matings depending on whether a wild female has mated with a wild or sterile male. Further, we show the importance of parameters, like the (hatched) eggs deposit rate and the death-rate related to all fertile double-mated females. In general, re-mating is considered to be detrimental to SIT programs. However, our results show that, depending on the parameter values of double-mated females, re-mating may also be beneficial for SIT.
Our model can be easily adapted to different contexts and species, for a broader understanding of release strategies and management options.

                <p>by Héctor M. Sánchez C., David L. Smith, John M. Marshall</p>

Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects, the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver. For these projects, monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites, and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes, within intervention sites. This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Additionally, insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE): a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for, namely: i) resources required by mosquitoes (e.g., food sources and aquatic breeding sites) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape, ii) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex, the current state of their gonotrophic cycle (if female) and resource attractiveness, and iii) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile. Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i) an <i>Aedes aegypti</i> population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and ii) an <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting COVID-19 trends to support planning and response was a priority for scientists and decision makers alike. In the United States, COVID-19 forecasting was coordinated by a large group of universities, companies, and government entities led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org). We evaluated approximately 9.7 million forecasts of weekly state-level COVID-19 cases for predictions 1–4 weeks into the future submitted by 24 teams from August 2020 to December 2021. We assessed coverage of central prediction intervals and weighted interval scores (WIS), adjusting for missing forecasts relative to a baseline forecast, and used a Gaussian generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to evaluate differences in skill across epidemic phases that were defined by the effective reproduction number. Overall, we found high variation in skill across individual models, with ensemble-based forecasts outperforming other approaches. Forecast skill relative to the baseline was generally higher for larger jurisdictions (e.g., states compared to counties). Over time, forecasts generally performed worst in periods of rapid changes in reported cases (either in increasing or decreasing epidemic phases) with 95% prediction interval coverage dropping below 50% during the growth phases of the winter 2020, Delta, and Omicron waves. Ideally, case forecasts could serve as a leading indicator of changes in transmission dynamics. However, while most COVID-19 case forecasts outperformed a naïve baseline model, even the most accurate case forecasts were unreliable in key phases. Further research could improve forecasts of leading indicators, like COVID-19 cases, by leveraging additional real-time data, addressing performance across phases, improving the characterization of forecast confidence, and ensuring that forecasts were coherent across spatial scales. In the meantime, it is critical for forecast users to appreciate current limitations and use a broad set of indicators to inform pandemic-related decision making.

<p>Pharmacological IDO1 inhibition was administered following the fluid percussion injury model of traumatic brain injury in young adult male rats. IDO1 inhibition prevented the increase in kynurenine pathway activity that was seen in the brain of the vehicle-treated group at 3 days postinjury, as demonstrated by the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan (A). IDO1 inhibition also resulted in improved outcomes in spatial memory tasks, with treated rats spending more time in the target quadrant of the Barnes maze compared to vehicle controls at 28 days postinjury (B). In addition, IDO1 inhibition resulted in less anxiety-like behaviors, with rats spending a larger percentage of time in the inner field of the open field test compared to vehicle controls at 25 days postinjury (C). These results suggest increased KP activity after FPI may mediate neurological dysfunction, and IDO1 inhibition should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target to improve recovery.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the kynurenine pathway (KP) which produces both neuroprotective and neurotoxic metabolites. Neuroinflammatory signals produced as a result of pathological conditions can increase production of IDO1 and boost its enzymatic capacity. IDO1 and the KP have been implicated in behavioral recovery after human traumatic brain injury (TBI), but their roles in experimental models of TBI are for the most part unknown. We hypothesized there is an increase in KP activity in the fluid percussion injury (FPI) model of TBI, and that administration of an IDO1 inhibitor will improve neurological recovery. In this study, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to FPI or sham injury and received twice-daily oral administration of the IDO1 inhibitor PF-06840003 (100 mg/kg) or vehicle control. FPI resulted in a significant increase in KP activity, as demonstrated by an increased ratio of kynurenine: tryptophan, in the perilesional neocortex and ipsilateral hippocampus 3 days postinjury (DPI), which normalized by 7 DPI. The increase in KP activity was prevented by PF-06840003. IDO1 inhibition also improved memory performance as assessed in the Barnes maze and anxiety behaviors as assessed in open field testing in the first 28 DPI. These results suggest increased KP activity after FPI may mediate neurological dysfunction, and IDO1 inhibition should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target to improve recovery.</p>

	<p>This study assessed suicidal risk in patients suffering from non-psychotic depressive disorders within various clinical and nosological forms (F31&amp;amp;ndash;F34 mood disorders and F60.31&amp;amp;mdash;emotionally unstable personality disorder). Clinical and psychological features were presented, as well as predictors of suicidal risk in patients of these groups. We performed a comparative analysis of the anxiety and depression level, the level of mental pain, fear of death and the severity of anti-suicidal motives in patients with affective disorders and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Based on the results, 100% of patients in these clinical nosological groups were found to have a high level of suicidal risk. Patients with affective disorders have weak anti-suicidal motives and are not fully aware of the consequences of their own death. Patients with BPD have a higher suicidal risk than patients with affective disorders; they are characterized by less pronounced social orientation, demonstrativeness, self-centeredness, less pronounced levels of anxiety and fear of death.</p>

                <p>Elicited upon violation of regularity in stimulus presentation, mismatch negativity (MMN) reflects the brain's ability to perform automatic comparisons between consecutive stimuli and provides an electrophysiological index of sensory error detection whereas P300 is associated with cognitive processes such as updating of the working memory. To date, there has been extensive research on the roles of MMN and P300 individually, because of their potential to be used as clinical markers of consciousness and attention, respectively. Here, we intend to explore with an unsupervised and rigorous source estimation approach, the underlying cortical generators of MMN and P300, in the context of prediction error propagation along the hierarchies of brain information processing in healthy human participants. The existing methods of characterizing the two ERPs involve only approximate estimations of their amplitudes and latencies based on specific sensors of interest. Our objective is twofold: first, we introduce a novel data-driven unsupervised approach to compute latencies and amplitude of ERP components accurately on an individual-subject basis and reconfirm earlier findings. Second, we demonstrate that in multisensory environments, MMN generators seem to reflect a significant overlap of "modality-specific" and "modality-independent" information processing while P300 generators mark a shift toward completely "modality-independent" processing. Advancing earlier understanding that multisensory contexts speed up early sensory processing, our study reveals that temporal facilitation extends to even the later components of prediction error processing, using EEG experiments. Such knowledge can be of value to clinical research for characterizing the key developmental stages of lifespan aging, schizophrenia, and depression.</p>

                <p>Canonically, action potentials of most mammalian neurons initiate at the axon initial segment (AIS) and propagate bidirectionally: orthodromically along the distal axon and retrogradely into the soma and dendrites. Under some circumstances, action potentials may initiate ectopically, at sites distal to the AIS, and propagate antidromically along the axon. These "ectopic action potentials" (EAPs) have been observed in experimental models of seizures and chronic pain, and more rarely in nonpathological forebrain neurons. Here we report that a large majority of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons in the upper layers of mouse neocortex, from both orbitofrontal and primary somatosensory areas, fire EAPs after sufficient activation of their somata. Somatostatin-expressing interneurons also fire EAPs, though less robustly. Ectopic firing in PV+ cells occurs in varying temporal patterns and can persist for several seconds. PV+ cells evoke strong synaptic inhibition in pyramidal neurons and interneurons and play critical roles in cortical function. Our results suggest that ectopic spiking of PV+ interneurons is common and may contribute to both normal and pathological network functions of the neocortex.</p>

                Background In this cross-sectional study conducted in Wakiso, Uganda, from May to July 2023, we investigated the interactions among age, sex, education, and heart rate in relation to dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) among individuals aged 65 years and older. Methods We purposively sampled 106 participants, focusing on those with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, leveraging collaborations with local health teams. Data collection involved comprehensive questionnaires covering sociodemographic details and health parameters, and employed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool for dementia screening. Results Our findings highlight a nuanced landscape of risk factors; each additional year of age was associated with a 1.19- and 1.22-times increased risk of MCI and dementia, respectively. Gender analysis revealed a protective effect against MCI in males, but no significant impact on dementia risk. Education emerged as a protective factor, with each additional year associated with a 28% reduction in MCI risk, although its effect on dementia risk remains ambiguous. Significantly, an elevated heart rate was strongly linked to an increased risk of both MCI and dementia, underscoring the potential cardiovascular dimension in cognitive health. Conclusions This study contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay of risk factors for dementia, emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and interventions for healthy cognitive aging in the older adult population.

                A 56-year-old female with a medical history of unspecified hyperthyroidism and a recent thyroid storm presented to the ED with tachycardia, hypertension, and bilateral enlarged parotid glands. During a previous hospitalization, she was diagnosed with unspecified hyperthyroidism and started on methimazole. During hospitalization, laboratory findings suggested Graves’ disease with an acute thyroid storm. The patient also complained of enlarged parotid glands bilaterally. CT tomography of the neck revealed no calculi of the parotid glands but showed extensive fatty replacement, possibly related to methimazole use. Treatment with propranolol and IV hydrocortisone improved thyroid function. Due to the suspicion of methimazole-induced parotitis, she was transitioned to a reduced methimazole dosage for treatment of Graves’ disease, which subsequently improved her parotitis. Methimazole, the standard initial treatment for Graves’ disease, is generally well-tolerated. It can cause adverse reactions; however, parotitis is very rare and has been documented in only a few case reports. Owing to the limited number of reports, its incidence is currently unknown. Here, we present a case of methimazole-induced parotitis as an unusual presentation of thyroid storm. Drug-induced reactions can only be considered once common causes of parotitis such as viral infection, obstruction, and autoimmune diseases are ruled out. Treatment involves dosage adjustments and supportive care. Methimazole-induced parotitis is often misdiagnosed and overlooked because of the lack of reported cases. This necessitates future research into the reaction mechanisms and optimal treatment.

                Background This study investigated the utility of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with COVID-19 with respect to age, early (a week) vs. delayed recovery (> a week) and mortality. Methods This was a retrospective study including 1,016 COVID-19 patients. The discriminatory power and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. Results The mean age of patients was 45 (± 13.9), and 75.7% were males. Older patients had elevated NLR, PLR, D-dimer, CRP, and Interleukin-6 levels and longer hospital stay than the younger group (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in older adults (26.9% vs. 6.6%, p =0.001). On-admission NLR (5.8 vs. 3.2; P= 0.001) and PLR (253.9±221.1 vs. 192.2±158.5; p = 0.004) were higher in the non-survivors than survivors. Both PLR and NLR displayed significant discriminatory ability for mortality. NLR had a higher AUC and specificity, while PLR exhibited slightly higher sensitivity. In individuals aged ≤55, NLR showed superior discrimination (AUC=0.717) compared to PLR (AUC=0.620). Conversely, for older adults, PLR displayed enhanced discrimination (AUC=0.710), while NLR showed AUC=0.693. Conclusion Higher admission NLR and PLR levels were associated with delayed recovery, whereas an enhanced NLR was associated with considerably higher mortality in older COVID-19 patients.

                Background Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a group of structural abnormalities affecting these vital organs, frequently leading to chronic kidney disease in children. This study aims to comprehensively understand the clinical profile of CAKUT in children in Central India, an area with unique socio-demographic characteristics and limited prior research on this topic. Methods A prospective observational study will be conducted over three years in the pediatric department of AVBRH, a tertiary healthcare center in Central India. Data were collected through interviews with parents or guardians of children up to 18 admitted to the hospital. Clinical symptoms, prenatal history, physical examinations, and diagnostic investigations were meticulously documented. Expected outcome The study is expected to reveal the prevalence and clinical profile of CAKUT in Central Indian children. Anticipated outcomes include insights into anomalies, clinical symptoms, and potential correlations with factors like prenatal care and consanguineous marriages. Diagnostic investigations will help assess the severity of renal impairment. The results may also uncover regional variations and have implications for public health initiatives aimed at early intervention and improved patient care. However, these are preliminary expectations that are subject to confirmation through the completion of the study.

                <p>by Phoebe Asplin, Matt J. Keeling, Rebecca Mancy, Edward M. Hill</p>
Background <p>Respiratory pathogens inflict a substantial burden on public health and the economy. Although the severity of symptoms caused by these pathogens can vary from asymptomatic to fatal, the factors that determine symptom severity are not fully understood. Correlations in symptoms between infector-infectee pairs, for which evidence is accumulating, can generate large-scale clusters of severe infections that could be devastating to those most at risk, whilst also conceivably leading to chains of mild or asymptomatic infections that generate widespread immunity with minimal cost to public health. Although this effect could be harnessed to amplify the impact of interventions that reduce symptom severity, the mechanistic representation of symptom propagation within mathematical and health economic modelling of respiratory diseases is understudied.</p> Methods and findings <p>We propose a novel framework for incorporating different levels of symptom propagation into models of infectious disease transmission via a single parameter, <i>α</i>. Varying <i>α</i> tunes the model from having no symptom propagation (<i>α</i> = 0, as typically assumed) to one where symptoms always propagate (<i>α</i> = 1). For parameters corresponding to three respiratory pathogens—seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2—we explored how symptom propagation impacted the relative epidemiological and health-economic performance of three interventions, conceptualised as vaccines with different actions: symptom-attenuating (labelled SA), infection-blocking (IB) and infection-blocking admitting only mild breakthrough infections (IB_MB).In the absence of interventions, with fixed underlying epidemiological parameters, stronger symptom propagation increased the proportion of cases that were severe. For SA and IB_MB, interventions were more effective at reducing prevalence (all infections and severe cases) for higher strengths of symptom propagation. For IB, symptom propagation had no impact on effectiveness, and for seasonal influenza this intervention type was more effective than SA at reducing severe infections for all strengths of symptom propagation. For pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2, at low intervention uptake, SA was more effective than IB for all levels of symptom propagation; for high uptake, SA only became more effective under strong symptom propagation. Health economic assessments found that, for SA-type interventions, the amount one could spend on control whilst maintaining a cost-effective intervention (termed threshold unit intervention cost) was very sensitive to the strength of symptom propagation.</p> Conclusions <p>Overall, the preferred intervention type depended on the combination of the strength of symptom propagation and uptake. Given the importance of determining robust public health responses, we highlight the need to gather further data on symptom propagation, with our modelling framework acting as a template for future analysis.</p>

                <p>by Sebastien Benzekry, Michalis Mastri, Chiara Nicolò, John M. L. Ebos</p>

Clinical trials involving systemic neoadjuvant treatments in breast cancer aim to shrink tumors before surgery while simultaneously allowing for controlled evaluation of biomarkers, toxicity, and suppression of distant (occult) metastatic disease. Yet neoadjuvant clinical trials are rarely preceded by preclinical testing involving neoadjuvant treatment, surgery, and post-surgery monitoring of the disease. Here we used a mouse model of spontaneous metastasis occurring after surgical removal of orthotopically implanted primary tumors to develop a predictive mathematical model of neoadjuvant treatment response to sunitinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI). Treatment outcomes were used to validate a novel mathematical kinetics-pharmacodynamics model predictive of perioperative disease progression. Longitudinal measurements of presurgical primary tumor size and postsurgical metastatic burden were compiled using 128 mice receiving variable neoadjuvant treatment doses and schedules (released publicly at https://zenodo.org/records/10607753). A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach quantified inter-animal variabilities in metastatic dynamics and survival, and machine-learning algorithms were applied to investigate the significance of several biomarkers at resection as predictors of individual kinetics. Biomarkers included circulating tumor- and immune-based cells (i.e., circulating tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells) as well as immunohistochemical tumor proteins (i.e., CD31 and Ki67). Our computational simulations show that neoadjuvant RTKI treatment inhibits primary tumor growth but has little efficacy in preventing (micro)-metastatic disease progression after surgery and treatment cessation. Machine learning algorithms that included support vector machines, random forests, and artificial neural networks, confirmed a lack of definitive biomarkers, which shows the value of preclinical modeling studies to identify potential failures that should be avoided clinically.

                <p>by David Mezey, Dominik Deffner, Ralf H. J. M. Kurvers, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

Collective dynamics emerge from individual-level decisions, yet we still poorly understand the link between individual-level decision-making processes and collective outcomes in realistic physical systems. Using collective foraging to study the key trade-off between personal and social information use, we present a mechanistic, spatially-explicit agent-based model that combines individual-level evidence accumulation of personal and (visual) social cues with particle-based movement. Under idealized conditions without physical constraints, our mechanistic framework reproduces findings from established probabilistic models, but explains how individual-level decision processes generate collective outcomes in a bottom-up way. In clustered environments, groups performed best if agents reacted strongly to social information, while in uniform environments, individualistic search was most beneficial. Incorporating different real-world physical and perceptual constraints profoundly shaped collective performance, and could even buffer maladaptive herding by facilitating self-organized exploration. Our study uncovers the mechanisms linking individual cognition to collective outcomes in human and animal foraging and paves the way for decentralized robotic applications.

                <p>by An Qi Zhang, Martin R. Ralph, Adam R. Stinchcombe</p>

Many self-motivated and goal-directed behaviours display highly flexible, approximately 4 hour ultradian (shorter than a day) oscillations. Despite lacking direct correspondence to physical cycles in the environment, these ultradian rhythms may be involved in optimizing functional interactions with the environment and reflect intrinsic neural dynamics. Current evidence supports a role of mesostriatal dopamine (DA) in the expression and propagation of ultradian rhythmicity, however, the biochemical processes underpinning these oscillations remain to be identified. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate D2 autoreceptor-dependent DA self-regulation as the source of ultradian behavioural rhythms. DA concentration at the midbrain-striatal synapses is governed through a dual-negative feedback-loop structure, which naturally gives rise to rhythmicity. This model shows the propensity of striatal DA to produce an ultradian oscillation characterized by a flexible period that is highly sensitive to parameter variations. Circadian (approximately 24 hour) regulation consolidates the ultradian oscillations and alters their response to the phase-dependent, rapid-resetting effect of a transient excitatory stimulus. Within a circadian framework, the ultradian rhythm orchestrates behavioural activity and enhances responsiveness to an external stimulus. This suggests a role for the circadian-ultradian timekeeping hierarchy in governing organized behaviour and shaping daily experience through coordinating the motivation to engage in recurring, albeit not highly predictable events, such as social interactions.

To optimize proteins for particular traits holds great promise for industrial and pharmaceutical purposes. Machine Learning is increasingly applied in this field to <i>predict</i> properties of proteins, thereby guiding the experimental optimization process. A natural question is: How much progress are we making with such predictions, and how important is the choice of regressor and representation? In this paper, we demonstrate that different assessment criteria for regressor performance can lead to dramatically different conclusions, depending on the choice of metric, and how one defines generalization. We highlight the fundamental issues of sample bias in typical regression scenarios and how this can lead to misleading conclusions about regressor performance. Finally, we make the case for the importance of calibrated uncertainty in this domain.

A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is accurately defining brain states and predicting how and where to perturb the brain to force a transition. Here, we investigated resting-state fMRI data of patients suffering from disorders of consciousness (DoC) after coma (minimally conscious and unresponsive wakefulness states) and healthy controls. We applied model-free and model-based approaches to help elucidate the underlying brain mechanisms of patients with DoC. The model-free approach allowed us to characterize brain states in DoC and healthy controls as a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space. The PMS of each group was defined by a repertoire of unique patterns (i.e., metastable substates) with different probabilities of occurrence. In the model-based approach, we adjusted the PMS of each DoC group to a causal whole-brain model. This allowed us to explore optimal strategies for promoting transitions by applying off-line <i>in silico</i> probing. Furthermore, this approach enabled us to evaluate the impact of local perturbations in terms of their global effects and sensitivity to stimulation, which is a model-based biomarker providing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying DoC. Our results show that transitions were obtained in a synchronous protocol, in which the somatomotor network, thalamus, precuneus and insula were the most sensitive areas to perturbation. This motivates further work to continue understanding brain function and treatments of disorders of consciousness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-443/v1?src=rss">Effect of non-contact induction heating on HA coatings and bone cement, an ex vivo study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Prosthetic joint infection is a serious complication that can arise after total joint replacement surgery. When bacteria colonise an orthopaedic implant, they form biofilms that protect them from their environment, making them difficult to remove. Treatment is further complicated by a global rise of antimicrobial resistance. These protective mechanisms make treatment of prosthetic joint infection increasingly complex. Non-contact induction heating is an upcoming technology that uses heat to eradicate bacteria that are present on the surface of metallic implants. This study aims to provide insight into the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating on metallic implants that are in direct contact with other biomaterials, such as coatings composed of hydroxyapatite and bone cement composed of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Methods Characterisation of hydroxyapatite coatings and adhesion strength tests were conducted according to standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 13779-2). The fixation strength of acrylic bone cement was tested according to an adapted method from ISO. Results It was found that non-contact induction heating did not significantly affect the adhesion strength of hydroxyapatite coatings (p=0.697). In contrast to hydroxyapatite coatings, acrylic bone cement softened temporarily as the temperature exceeded the glass transition temperature (83.38 ± 10.88°C). However, the induction heating temperature had no significant effect on the fixation strength after the cement was allowed to cool down (p=0.535). Conclusion This study shows the feasibility of using non-contact induction heating up to 80°C when bone cement or ceramic coatings are present in contact with infected metallic implants.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23608?af=R">In vivo structural connectivity of the reward system along the hippocampal long axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent work has identified a critical role for the hippocampus in reward-sensitive behaviors, including motivated memory, reinforcement learning, and decision-making. Animal histology and human functional neuroimaging have shown that brain regions involved in reward processing and motivation are more interconnected with the ventral/anterior hippocampus. However, direct evidence examining gradients of structural connectivity between reward regions and the hippocampus in humans is lacking. The present study used diffusion MRI (dMRI) and probabilistic tractography to quantify the structural connectivity of the hippocampus with key reward processing regions in vivo. Using a large sample of subjects (<i>N</i> = 628) from the human connectome dMRI data release, we found that connectivity profiles with the hippocampus varied widely between different regions of the reward circuit. While the dopaminergic midbrain (ventral tegmental area) showed stronger connectivity with the anterior versus posterior hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed stronger connectivity with the posterior hippocampus. The limbic (ventral) striatum demonstrated a more homogeneous connectivity profile along the hippocampal long axis. This is the first study to generate a probabilistic atlas of the hippocampal structural connectivity with reward-related networks, which is essential to investigating how these circuits contribute to normative adaptive behavior and maladaptive behaviors in psychiatric illness. These findings describe nuanced structural connectivity that sets the foundation to better understand how the hippocampus influences reward-guided behavior in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-442/v1?src=rss">Cognitive dysfunction and its relationship with psychopathology and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia: a protocol for a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background One central characteristic of schizophrenia is cognitive dysfunction, which typically has modest to severe effects on a variety of cognitive areas. Evidence suggests that cognitive impairment may occur far sooner than the clinical symptoms. The connection between cognitive deficiencies and functional outcome indicators has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Cognitive deficits are widely known to affect overall functioning, In India, few studies have been conducted to determine the profile of cognitive abnormalities in individuals in the chronic phase of schizophrenia as well as those in remission. Research from developing nations is crucial because schizophrenia prevalence in these nations is thought to be lower than that in industrialized nations. The aim of this study will be to assess the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia and examine the relationship between cognitive dysfunction with psychopathology and quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia. Protocol This will be a cross sectional hospital-based study. After ethical clearance, all patients in the Psychiatry Department meeting the criteria of Schizophrenia, according to the ICD-10, will be part of the study. The expected number of participants is 228. All participants within the age group of 18 to 65 years who are clinically diagnosed to have schizophrenia using ICD-10 and who are able to give written informed consent will be included in the study. The patient’s sociodemographic data will be collected in Outpatient or inpatient basis and then the following questionnaires will be applied to them: i) Socio-demographic Proforma; ii) The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); iii) The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF scale (WHOQOL-BREF); and iv) Addenbrooke’s cognitive examination III (ACE). Once the aforementioned questionnaires are completed, the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia will be assessed, and its relationship with psychopathology and quality of life will be studied.
