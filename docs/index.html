              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients' quality of life and its related factors: A cross-sectional study of the Jordanian population [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death globally, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. It is estimated that 6.5% of Jordanians under 50 and 37.5% of those over 70 years of age are affected. The country's air pollution levels surpass recommended levels, increasing the disease incidence and burden on individuals and the health system. COPD is a long-term, severe, and exhausting condition. In Jordan, patients are highly dependent and frequent users of the healthcare services; therefore, their Quality of Life (QoL) is highly influenced by the health care they receive. The QoL of COPD patients must be studied to devise interventions that can help patients cope with this disease and for healthcare systems to improve their service.  Method: A cross-sectional correlational study of 200 COPD patients. The Arabic WHO Quality of Life Questionnaire Short Form was used to collect data.   Results: The mean COPD patient QoL score was 10.66 (SD=1.58), showing poor QoL perception. The physical domain had the lowest perceived QoL (10.232, SD=1.912), while the environmental domain had the highest (10.948, SD=1.636). Unmarried, non-smokers, and employed had better QoL (M=11.04, M=10.92, M=12.04). Age categories 50-61 exhibited greater mean QoL than age category 61 or higher (M=11.44, M=10.84, M=10.08). Private health services are characterized by short waiting times, availability of different diagnostic and treatment services, and skilled staff was related to better QoL.  Conclusions: QoL for COPD patients seems to be an area requiring urgent attention from Health service providers and planners. Patients should be adequately supported and cared for to have a good QoL. In Jordan, COPD patients' QoL is highly influenced by lack of physical activity, emotional distress, and anxiety. Therefore, better health care services is needed to address all these areas adequately.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A re-analysis of data from Sullins, Rosik, and Santero (2021): are sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) helpful for those who don't change? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background.  Sullins, Rosik, and Santero (2021) evaluated a convenience sample of 125 men who had undergone sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) and they made their data available for independent analysis.     Methods:  Data from Sullins et al. (2021) were reanalyzed in ten new ways.  Several new typologies and variables were created.  Paired sample t-tests, correlations, regression analyses, repeated measures analyses with time x group interactions, and chi-square tests were used to evaluate ten novel hypotheses. Results:  Using parametric statistics, we found similar results to Sullins et al. (2021) where they had used nonparametric statistics.  Regression analyses found that lower initial SSI and higher SSB predicted more change.  Using a new typology for marital status, it was found that those who became engaged/got married during SOCE had the largest gains in OSB compared to other categories of marital status.   Using the typology of change, it was found that some men who became stronger for SSA, SSI, and SSB nevertheless reported high levels of helpfulness for SOCE.  Harms from SOCE seem to be minimal compared to the positives reported for young adults.  SOCE effectiveness did not appear to change with time since therapy, lending less support to a recall bias argument.  Congruence between SSA and SSI, may, in some cases, reduce the apparent effectiveness of SOCE  Conclusion:  While the sample’s results cannot be generalized outside of highly religious men with initially higher levels of SSA and SSB than SSI, these results differ from many contemporary assertions that SOCE cannot ever be effective and is inherently harmful, or that SSA is inherently immutable.  Therefore, calls to ban SOCE legally appear to be founded upon incomplete or inaccurate data and thus premature, while more higher quality research is yet needed regarding SOCE.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Usefulness of vaccine boosters for Covid-19 in Italy and in UK and comparison between in intensive care admissions and deaths of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Surprises and implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is insufficient clarity about the different outcomes between unvaccinated and vaccinated people hospitalized with Covid-19, with reference to the variables “Intensive Care Unit” and “Deaths”. Moreover, it is unclear the real effectiveness of the vaccine boosters on the risks of infection and Covid-19 deaths, beyond the first few months after the booster. To verify the hypotheses that repeated vaccinations might expose to a progressively greater risk of severe Covid-19, and of a growing weakening of the immune response, primarily against infection, as the distance from the booster dose increases. Methods: Through an analysis of the official Italian data we calculated significant differences, percentage variations and trends in the variables “Intensive Care Units” and “Deaths” in hospitalized patients among four groups with different vaccination status, and between the Unvaccinated and Vaccinated groups. Through analyses of the UK Security Agency data in the weekly COVID-19 vaccine surveillance reports we explored the vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and against COVID-19 deaths in relation to the time elapsed from the booster doses. Results: Repeated vaccinations seem to expose the recipients to a growing risk of severe Covid-19, and fewer vaccinations might be enough to protect persons at greater risk. The vaccine effectiveness against infection vanished and reversed in the medium term, and vaccinated persons with three doses become increasingly more infected versus unvaccinated persons. Conclusions: The starting hypotheses have been supported, together with the need to combine carefully rethought vaccination campaigns with the implementation of other strategies, with the achievement of a healthy living and working environment, healthy lifestyles, and effective, safe and sustainable care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) Opportunities in Health Education (HE) in a mandatory social isolation context [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Routine care for prevention and health promotion has reduced significantly due to the Covid-19 pandemic and mandatory social isolation measures. In this context, it is necessary to identify and describe Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that provide opportunities for health education, promotion, and prevention aimed at the general population. The study is a systematic review of MOOCs on health education, health promotion, and prevention for the general population in a pandemic context. Methods: We developed a search for MOOC courses aimed at the general population on health education, health promotion, and prevention in different available MOOC platforms. We executed a descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs. Terms such as healthy living, physical activity, healthy eating, mental health, and variants aimed at the general population were explored. We did not include advanced or specialized studies aimed only at professionals that required prior knowledge. A descriptive analysis of the main characteristics of the selected MOOCs was performed. Results: There were 117 MOOCs chosen on health education, promotion, and prevention for the general population. Coursera (40.3%) was the platform that offered the highest quantity of MOOCs; more than half of the MOOCs were in English (52.9%). The median (interquartile range) duration of the selected MOOCs was 11 (6–15) hours. The predominant themes were "Health promotion" (43%) and "Food and nutrition" (31%), and the origin was mainly from Europe (37.8%). Conclusions: Potentially MOOCs could improve access to massive open online public health courses. Adaptation to different languages and topics needed for each context could increase access to important health promotion messages, even outside of "times of pandemic and enforced social isolation".

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Investigating the structural changes due to adenosine methylation of the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus ORF50 transcript</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Konstantin Röder, Amy M. Barker, Adrian Whitehouse, Samuela Pasquali</p>

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is a human oncovirus. KSHV relies on manipulating the host cell N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) RNA modification pathway to enhance virus replication. Methylation within a RNA stem loop of the open reading frame 50 (ORF50) increases transcript stability via the recruitment of the m6A reader, SND1. In this contribution we explore the energy landscapes of the unmethylated and methylated RNA stem loops of ORF50 to investigate the effect of methylation on the structure of the stem loop. We observe a significant shift upon methylation between an open and closed configuration of the top of the stem loop. In the unmethylated stem loop the closed configuration is much lower in energy, and, as a result, exhibits higher occupancy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Analysing and meta-analysing time-series data of microbial growth and gene expression from plate readers</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luis Fernando Montaño-Gutierrez, Nahuel Manzanaro Moreno, Iseabail L. Farquhar, Yu Huo, Lucia Bandiera, Peter S. Swain</p>

Responding to change is a fundamental property of life, making time-series data invaluable in biology. For microbes, plate readers are a popular, convenient means to measure growth and also gene expression using fluorescent reporters. Nevertheless, the difficulties of analysing the resulting data can be a bottleneck, particularly when combining measurements from different wells and plates. Here we present omniplate, a Python module that corrects and normalises plate-reader data, estimates growth rates and fluorescence per cell as functions of time, calculates errors, exports in different formats, and enables meta-analysis of multiple plates. The software corrects for autofluorescence, the optical density’s non-linear dependence on the number of cells, and the effects of the media. We use omniplate to measure the Monod relationship for growth of budding yeast in raffinose, showing that raffinose is a convenient carbon source for controlling growth rates. Using fluorescent tagging, we study yeast’s glucose transport. Our results are consistent with the regulation of the hexose transporter (HXT) genes being approximately bipartite: the medium and high affinity transporters are predominately regulated by both the high affinity glucose sensor Snf3 and the kinase complex SNF1 via the repressors Mth1, Mig1, and Mig2; the low affinity transporters are predominately regulated by the low affinity sensor Rgt2 via the co-repressor Std1. We thus demonstrate that omniplate is a powerful tool for exploiting the advantages offered by time-series data in revealing biological regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sequence dependence of transient Hoogsteen base pairing in DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alberto Pérez de Alba Ortíz, Jocelyne Vreede, Bernd Ensing</p>

Hoogsteen (HG) base pairing is characterized by a 180° rotation of the purine base with respect to the Watson-Crick-Franklin (WCF) motif. Recently, it has been found that both conformations coexist in a dynamical equilibrium and that several biological functions require HG pairs. This relevance has motivated experimental and computational investigations of the base-pairing transition. However, a systematic simulation of sequence variations has remained out of reach. Here, we employ advanced path-based methods to perform unprecedented free-energy calculations. Our methodology enables us to study the different mechanisms of purine rotation, either remaining inside or after flipping outside of the double helix. We study seven different sequences, which are neighbor variations of a well-studied A⋅T pair in A<sub>6</sub>-DNA. We observe the known effect of A⋅T steps favoring HG stability, and find evidence of triple-hydrogen-bonded neighbors hindering the inside transition. More importantly, we identify a dominant factor: the direction of the A rotation, with the 6-ring pointing either towards the longer or shorter segment of the chain, respectively relating to a lower or higher barrier. This highlights the role of DNA’s relative flexibility as a modulator of the WCF/HG dynamic equilibrium. Additionally, we provide a robust methodology for future HG proclivity studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Performance-gated deliberation: A context-adapted strategy in which urgency is opportunity cost</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maximilian Puelma Touzel, Paul Cisek, Guillaume Lajoie</p>

Finding the right amount of deliberation, between insufficient and excessive, is a hard decision making problem that depends on the value we place on our time. Average-reward, putatively encoded by tonic dopamine, serves in existing reinforcement learning theory as the opportunity cost of time, including deliberation time. Importantly, this cost can itself vary with the environmental context and is not trivial to estimate. Here, we propose how the opportunity cost of deliberation can be estimated adaptively on multiple timescales to account for non-stationary contextual factors. We use it in a simple decision-making heuristic based on average-reward reinforcement learning (AR-RL) that we call <i>Performance-Gated Deliberation</i> (PGD). We propose PGD as a strategy used by animals wherein deliberation cost is implemented directly as urgency, a previously characterized neural signal effectively controlling the speed of the decision-making process. We show PGD outperforms AR-RL solutions in explaining behaviour and urgency of non-human primates in a context-varying random walk prediction task and is consistent with relative performance and urgency in a context-varying random dot motion task. We make readily testable predictions for both neural activity and behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Covariations between pupil diameter and supplementary eye field activity suggest a role in cognitive effort implementation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julien Claron, Julie Royo, Fabrice Arcizet, Thomas Deffieux, Mickael Tanter, Pierre Pouget</p>

In both human and nonhuman primates (NHP), the medial prefrontal region, defined as the supplementary eye field (SEF), can indirectly influence behavior selection through modulation of the primary selection process in the oculomotor structures. To perform this oculomotor control, SEF integrates multiple cognitive signals such as attention, memory, reward, and error. As changes in pupil responses can assess these cognitive efforts, a better understanding of the precise dynamics by which pupil diameter and medial prefrontal cortex activity interact requires thorough investigations before, during, and after changes in pupil diameter. We tested whether SEF activity is related to pupil dynamics during a mixed pro/antisaccade oculomotor task in 2 macaque monkeys. We used functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging to examine temporal changes in brain activity at the 0.1-s time scale and 0.1-mm spatial resolution concerning behavioral performance and pupil dynamics. By combining the pupil signals and real-time imaging of NHP during cognitive tasks, we were able to infer localized cerebral blood volume (CBV) responses within a restricted part of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, referred to as the SEF, an area in which antisaccade preparation activity is also recorded. Inversely, SEF neurovascular activity measured by fUS imaging was found to be a robust predictor of specific variations in pupil diameter over short and long-time scales. Furthermore, we directly manipulated pupil diameter and CBV in the SEF using reward modulations. These results bring a novel understanding of the physiological links between pupil and SEF, but it also raises questions about the role of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as CBV variations in the ACC seems to be negligible compared to CBV variations in the SEF.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A microfluidic system that replicates pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles in vitro improves prediction of in vivo efficacy in preclinical models</a></h4>

Test compounds used on in vitro model systems are conventionally delivered to cell culture wells as fixed concentration bolus doses; however, this poorly replicates the pharmacokinetic (PK) concentration changes seen in vivo and reduces the predictive value of the data. Herein, proof-of-concept experiments were performed using a novel microfluidic device, the Microformulator, which allows in vivo like PK profiles to be applied to cells cultured in microtiter plates and facilitates the investigation of the impact of PK on biological responses. We demonstrate the utility of the device in its ability to reproduce in vivo PK profiles of different oncology compounds over multiweek experiments, both as monotherapy and drug combinations, comparing the effects on tumour cell efficacy in vitro with efficacy seen in in vivo xenograft models. In the first example, an ERK1/2 inhibitor was tested using fixed bolus dosing and Microformulator-replicated PK profiles, in 2 cell lines with different in vivo sensitivities. The Microformulator-replicated PK profiles were able to discriminate between cell line sensitivities, unlike the conventional fixed bolus dosing. In a second study, murine in vivo PK profiles of multiple Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1/2 (PARP) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor combinations were replicated in a FaDu cell line resulting in a reduction in cell growth in vitro with similar rank ordering to the in vivo xenograft model. Additional PK/efficacy insight into theoretical changes to drug exposure profiles was gained by using the Microformulator to expose FaDu cells to the DNA-PK inhibitor for different target coverage levels and periods of time. We demonstrate that the Microformulator enables incorporating PK exposures into cellular assays to improve in vitro–in vivo translation understanding for early therapeutic insight.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Automated assessment reveals that the extinction risk of reptiles is widely underestimated across space and phylogeny</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gabriel Henrique de Oliveira Caetano, David G. Chapple, Richard Grenyer, Tal Raz, Jonathan Rosenblatt, Reid Tingley, Monika Böhm, Shai Meiri, Uri Roll</p>

The Red List of Threatened Species, published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is a crucial tool for conservation decision-making. However, despite substantial effort, numerous species remain unassessed or have insufficient data available to be assigned a Red List extinction risk category. Moreover, the Red Listing process is subject to various sources of uncertainty and bias. The development of robust automated assessment methods could serve as an efficient and highly useful tool to accelerate the assessment process and offer provisional assessments. Here, we aimed to (1) present a machine learning–based automated extinction risk assessment method that can be used on less known species; (2) offer provisional assessments for all reptiles—the only major tetrapod group without a comprehensive Red List assessment; and (3) evaluate potential effects of human decision biases on the outcome of assessments. We use the method presented here to assess 4,369 reptile species that are currently unassessed or classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN. The models used in our predictions were 90% accurate in classifying species as threatened/nonthreatened, and 84% accurate in predicting specific extinction risk categories. Unassessed and Data Deficient reptiles were considerably more likely to be threatened than assessed species, adding to mounting evidence that these species warrant more conservation attention. The overall proportion of threatened species greatly increased when we included our provisional assessments. Assessor identities strongly affected prediction outcomes, suggesting that assessor effects need to be carefully considered in extinction risk assessments. Regions and taxa we identified as likely to be more threatened should be given increased attention in new assessments and conservation planning. Lastly, the method we present here can be easily implemented to help bridge the assessment gap for other less known taxa.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae require multiple culture temperatures for detection in Cannabis sativa L. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis safety testing requires adequate detection of a broad class of bacteria known as Enterobacteria, from the family of Enterobacteriaceae. These organisms are responsible for many food-borne illnesses including gastroenteritis, and are common targets in the food testing industry. While all these organisms contain 16S DNA, not all of them grow on commercial culture-based platforms at a single culture temperature. Methods: We assessed four Enterobacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Pantoea agglomerans, Yersinia enterocolitica, Rahnella aquatilis) that vary in their preferred culture temperature, human pathogenicity and prevalence in cannabis. We cultured them on two different plating media and compared these results to two different qPCR assays. Results: All four bacteria grew on one plating medium at 30°C. 75% of them failed to grow at 36°C. Using a different plating medium, 75% grew at 30°C and zero grew at 36°C. Two different commercialy available quantitative PCR assays detected 100% of the organisms. Conclusions: Several Enterobacteria are highly medium- and temperature-sensitive, and can easily evade culture-based detection. Some of these bacteria are known to infect cannabis and may pose a clinical risk to cannabis trimmers or consumers. Quantitative PCR detected all of these species. Quantitative PCR is often criticized for failing to discern live versus dead DNA, but the definition of “live” is dependent on the culture medium and temperature used.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Establishment of diagnostic reference level and radiation dose variation in head & neck and pelvis treatment planning in radiation therapy computed tomography [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This observational study aims to establish a discrepancy in the radiation dose distributed for head & neck and pelvis localization in Computed Tomography (CT) imaging in radiation therapy. The objective and need of the current study are to establish Diagnostic Reference Level (DRL) for head & neck and pelvic CT protocols in Radiation Therapy planning and compare them with other regional, national and international DRL. The established DRL will be used to find further optimized DRL for Radiation Therapy Computed Tomography (RTCT). Methods: A total of 120 patients with Head & Neck cancers and 90 patients with pelvic cancers to be treated with radiotherapy prescribed for the RTCT with ages above 18 years old and above were included in the current study. The advanced Philips 16 slice big bore CT acquired all the CT simulation images. Results: Third quartile standards of Dose Length Product and effective dose for Head & Neck, and pelvis were 790.65mGy.cm, 2.45179 mSv, and 999.7 mGy.cm, 15.48mSv respectively. The third quartile CTDIvol value for the same order of procedure is 17.6 mGy. Tube voltage of 120kVp and 300mAs and used for radiotherapy planning. Conclusion: The first regional Radiation therapy Computed tomography simulation Diagnostic reference levels have been projected and deliver a platform for dose evaluation and optimization due to the limited number of papers on radiation therapy, computed tomography, and diagnostic reference levels. Comparison with previously available RT CT diagnostic reference levels indicated some radiation dose variation, so exposure parameters should be revised and improved.

The myocardia and microvessels of the left atrium are the most affected by inflammation storm. These results could provide guidance in improvement of clinical treatments for cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19.

                Becerra-Artiles et al. study two partially overlapping CD4 T cell epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are highly conserved across human and animal coronaviruses and are recognized by cross-reactive T cells present in most individuals. The molecular basis for the observed T cell cross-reactivity is discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-sensitive aggregation triggers NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is an autoinflammatory syndrome caused by mutations of NLRP3 gene encoding cryopyrin. Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), the mildest form of CAPS, is characterized by cold-induced inflammation induced by the overproduction of IL-1β. However, the molecular mechanism of how mutated NLRP3 causes inflammasome activation in CAPS remains unclear. Here, we found that CAPS-associated NLRP3 mutants form cryo-sensitive aggregates that function as a scaffold for inflammasome activation. Cold exposure promoted inflammasome assembly and subsequent IL-1β release triggered by mutated NLRP3. While K<sup>+</sup> efflux was dispensable, Ca<sup>2+</sup> was necessary for mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Notably, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was induced during mutated NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly. Furthermore, caspase-1 inhibition prevented Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and inflammasome assembly induced by the mutated NLRP3, suggesting a feed-forward Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx loop triggered by mutated NLRP3. Thus, the mutated NLRP3 forms cryo-sensitive aggregates to promote inflammasome assembly distinct from canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Toward the cellular-scale simulation of motor-driven cytoskeletal assemblies</a></h4>

              
                The cytoskeleton – a collection of polymeric filaments, molecular motors, and crosslinkers – is a foundational example of active matter, and in the cell assembles into organelles that guide basic biological functions. Simulation of cytoskeletal assemblies is an important tool for modeling cellular processes and understanding their surprising material properties. Here, we present <i>aLENS</i> (a Living Ensemble Simulator), a novel computational framework designed to surmount the limits of conventional simulation methods. We model molecular motors with crosslinking kinetics that adhere to a thermodynamic energy landscape, and integrate the system dynamics while efficiently and stably enforcing hard-body repulsion between filaments. Molecular potentials are entirely avoided in imposing steric constraints. Utilizing parallel computing, we simulate tens to hundreds of thousands of cytoskeletal filaments and crosslinking motors, recapitulating emergent phenomena such as bundle formation and buckling. This simulation framework can help elucidate how motor type, thermal fluctuations, internal stresses, and confinement determine the evolution of cytoskeletal active matter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural differences in adolescent brains can predict alcohol misuse</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol misuse during adolescence (AAM) has been associated with disruptive development of adolescent brains. In this longitudinal machine learning (ML) study, we could predict AAM significantly from brain structure (T1-weighted imaging and DTI) with accuracies of 73 - 78% in the IMAGEN dataset (n ~1182). Our results not only show that structural differences in brain can predict AAM, but also suggests that such differences might precede AAM behavior in the data. We predicted ten phenotypes of AAM at age 22 using brain MRI features at ages 14, 19, and 22. Binge drinking was found to be the most predictable phenotype. The most informative brain features were located in the ventricular CSF, and in white matter tracts of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and brain stem. In the cortex, they were spread across the occipital, frontal, and temporal lobes and in the cingulate cortex. We also experimented with four different ML models and several confound control techniques. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with rbf kernel and Gradient Boosting consistently performed better than the linear models, linear SVM and Logistic Regression. Our study also demonstrates how the choice of the predicted phenotype, ML model, and confound correction technique are all crucial decisions in an explorative ML study analyzing psychiatric disorders with small effect sizes such as AAM.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Partial response electromyography as a marker of action stopping</a></h4>

              
                Response inhibition is among the core constructs of cognitive control. It is notoriously difficult to quantify from overt behavior, since the outcome of successful inhibition is the lack of a behavioral response. Currently, the most common measure of action stopping, and by proxy response inhibition, is the model-based stop signal reaction time (SSRT) derived from the stop signal task. Recently, partial response electromyography (prEMG) has been introduced as a complementary physiological measure to capture individual stopping latencies. PrEMG refers to muscle activity initiated by the go signal that plummets after the stop signal before its accumulation to a full response. Whereas neither the SSRT nor the prEMG is an unambiguous marker for neural processes underlying response inhibition, our analysis indicates that the prEMG peak latency is better suited to investigate brain mechanisms of action stopping. This study is a methodological resource with a comprehensive overview of the psychometric properties of the prEMG in a stop signal task, and further provides practical tips for data collection and analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nanchangmycin regulates FYN, PTK2, and MAPK1/3 to control the fibrotic activity of human hepatic stellate cells</a></h4>

              
                Chronic liver injury causes fibrosis, characterized by the formation of scar tissue resulting from excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) myofibroblasts are the primary cell type responsible for liver fibrosis, yet there are currently no therapies directed at inhibiting the activity of HSC myofibroblasts. To search for potential anti-fibrotic compounds, we performed a high-throughput compound screen in primary human HSC myofibroblasts and identified 19 small molecules that induce HSC inactivation, including the polyether ionophore nanchangmycin (NCMC). NCMC induces lipid re-accumulation while reducing collagen expression, deposition of collagen in the extracellular matrix, cell proliferation, and migration. We find that NCMC increases cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reduces the phosphorylated protein levels of FYN, PTK2 (FAK), MAPK1/3 (ERK2/1), HSPB1 (HSP27), and STAT5B. Further, depletion of each of these kinases suppress <i>COL1A1</i> expression. These studies reveal a signaling network triggered by NCMC to inactivate HSC myofibroblasts and reduce expression of proteins that compose the fibrotic scar. Identification of the antifibrotic effects of NCMC and the elucidation of pathways by which NCMC inhibits fibrosis provide new tools and therapeutic targets that could potentially be utilized to combat the development and progression of liver fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perception of a conserved family of plant signalling peptides by the receptor kinase HSL3</a></h4>

              
                Plant genomes encode hundreds of secreted peptides; however, relatively few have been characterised. We report here an uncharacterised, stress-induced family of plant signalling peptides, which we call CTNIPs. Based on the role of the common co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1) in CTNIP-induced responses, we identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> the orphan receptor kinase HAESA-LIKE 3 (HSL3) as the CTNIP receptor via a proteomics approach. CTNIP binding, ligand-triggered complex formation with BAK1, and induced downstream responses all involve HSL3. Notably, the HSL3-CTNIP signalling module is evolutionarily conserved amongst most extant angiosperms. The identification of this novel signalling module will further shed light on the diverse functions played by plant signalling peptides and will provide insights into receptor-ligand co-evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deciphering a hexameric protein complex with Angstrom optical resolution</a></h4>

              
                Cryogenic optical localization in three dimensions (COLD) was recently shown to resolve up to four binding sites on a single protein. However, because COLD relies on intensity fluctuations that result from the blinking behavior of fluorophores, it is limited to cases where individual emitters show different brightness. This significantly lowers the measurement yield. To extend the number of resolved sites as well as the measurement yield, we employ partial labeling and combine it with polarization encoding in order to identify single fluorophores during their stochastic blinking. We then use a particle classification scheme to identify and resolve heterogenous subsets and combine them to reconstruct the three-dimensional arrangement of large molecular complexes. We showcase this method (polarCOLD) by resolving the trimer arrangement of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and six different sites of the hexamer protein Caseinolytic Peptidase B (ClpB) of <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> in its quaternary structure, both with Angstrom resolution. The combination of polarCOLD and single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) promises to provide crucial insight into intrinsic heterogeneities of biomolecular structures. Furthermore, our approach is fully compatible with fluorescent protein labeling and can, thus, be used in a wide range of studies in cell and membrane biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conditional and unconditional components of aversively motivated freezing, flight and darting in mice</a></h4>

              
                Fear conditioning is one of the most frequently used laboratory procedures for modeling learning and memory generally, and anxiety disorders in particular. The conditional response (CR) used in the majority of fear conditioning studies in rodents is freezing. Recently, it has been reported that under certain conditions, running, jumping or darting replaces freezing as the dominant CR. These findings raise both a critical methodological problem and an important theoretical issue. If only freezing is measured but rodents express their learning with a different response, then significant instances of learning, memory, or fear may be missed. In terms of theory, whatever conditions lead to these different behaviors may be a key to how animals transition between different defensive responses and different emotional states. In mice, we replicated these past results but along with several novel control conditions. Contrary to the prior conclusions, running and darting were primarily a result of nonassociative processes and were actually suppressed by associative learning. Darting and flight were taken to be analogous to nonassociative startle or alpha responses that are potentiated by fear. Additionally, associative processes had some impact on the topography of flight behavior. On the other hand, freezing was the purest reflection of associative learning. We also uncovered a rule that describes when these movements replace freezing: When afraid, freeze until there is a sudden novel change in stimulation, then burst into vigorous flight attempts. This rule may also govern the change from fear to panic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The LOTUS initiative for open knowledge management in natural products research</a></h4>

              
                Contemporary bioinformatic and chemoinformatic capabilities hold promise to reshape knowledge management, analysis and interpretation of data in natural products research. Currently, reliance on a disparate set of non-standardized, insular, and specialized databases presents a series of challenges for data access, both within the discipline and for integration and interoperability between related fields. The fundamental elements of exchange are referenced structure-organism pairs that establish relationships between distinct molecular structures and the living organisms from which they were identified. Consolidating and sharing such information via an open platform has strong transformative potential for natural products research and beyond. This is the ultimate goal of the newly established LOTUS initiative, which has now completed the first steps toward the harmonization, curation, validation and open dissemination of 750,000+ referenced structure-organism pairs. LOTUS data is hosted on Wikidata and regularly mirrored on <a href="https://lotus.naturalproducts.net">https://lotus.naturalproducts.net</a>. Data sharing within the Wikidata framework broadens data access and interoperability, opening new possibilities for community curation and evolving publication models. Furthermore, embedding LOTUS data into the vast Wikidata knowledge graph will facilitate new biological and chemical insights. The LOTUS initiative represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a comprehensive and collaborative natural products knowledge base.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortical adaptation to sound reverberation</a></h4>

              
                In almost every natural environment, sounds are reflected by nearby objects, producing many delayed and distorted copies of the original sound, known as reverberation. Our brains usually cope well with reverberation, allowing us to recognize sound sources regardless of their environments. In contrast, reverberation can cause severe difficulties for speech recognition algorithms and hearing-impaired people. The present study examines how the auditory system copes with reverberation. We trained a linear model to recover a rich set of natural, anechoic sounds from their simulated reverberant counterparts. The model neurons achieved this by extending the inhibitory component of their receptive filters for more reverberant spaces, and did so in a frequency-dependent manner. These predicted effects were observed in the responses of auditory cortical neurons of ferrets in the same simulated reverberant environments. Together, these results suggest that auditory cortical neurons adapt to reverberation by adjusting their filtering properties in a manner consistent with dereverberation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Binary outcomes of enhancer activity underlie stable random monoallelic expression</a></h4>

              
                Mitotically stable random monoallelic gene expression (RME) is documented for a small percentage of autosomal genes. We developed an in vivo genetic model to study the role of enhancers in RME using high-resolution single-cell analysis of natural killer (NK) cell receptor gene expression and enhancer deletions in the mouse germline. Enhancers of the RME NK receptor genes were accessible and enriched in H3K27ac on silent and active alleles alike in cells sorted according to allelic expression status, suggesting enhancer activation and gene expression status can be decoupled. In genes with multiple enhancers, enhancer deletion reduced gene expression frequency, in one instance converting the universally expressed gene encoding NKG2D into an RME gene, recapitulating all aspects of natural RME including mitotic stability of both the active and silent states. The results support the binary model of enhancer action, and suggest that RME is a consequence of general properties of gene regulation by enhancers rather than an RME-specific epigenetic program. Therefore, many and perhaps all genes may be subject to some degree of RME. Surprisingly, this was borne out by analysis of several genes that define different major hematopoietic lineages, that were previously thought to be universally expressed within those lineages: the genes encoding NKG2D, CD45, CD8α, and Thy-1. We propose that intrinsically probabilistic gene allele regulation is a general property of enhancer-controlled gene expression, with previously documented RME representing an extreme on a broad continuum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of HIV-reservoir cells with reduced susceptibility to antibody-dependent immune response</a></h4>

              
                HIV establishes a persistent infection in heterogeneous cell reservoirs, which can be maintained by different mechanisms including cellular proliferation, and represent the main obstacle to curing the infection. The expression of the Fcγ receptor CD32 has been identified as a marker of the active cell reservoirs in people on antiretroviral therapy, but if its expression has any role in conferring advantage for viral persistence is unknown. Here, we report that HIV-infected cells expressing CD32 have reduced susceptibility to natural killer (NK) antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) by a mechanism compatible with the suboptimal binding of HIV-specific antibodies. Infected CD32 cells have increased proliferative capacity in the presence of immune complexes, and are more resistant to strategies directed to potentiate NK function. Remarkably, reactivation of the latent reservoir from antiretroviral-treated people living with HIV increases the pool of infected CD32 cells, which are largely resistant to the ADCC immune mechanism. Thus, we report the existence of reservoir cells that evade part of the NK immune response through the expression of CD32.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial transcriptomics reveals metabolic changes underly age-dependent declines in digit regeneration</a></h4>

              
                De novo limb regeneration after amputation is restricted in mammals to the distal digit tip. Central to this regenerative process is the blastema, a heterogeneous population of lineage-restricted, dedifferentiated cells that ultimately orchestrates regeneration of the amputated bone and surrounding soft tissue. To investigate skeletal regeneration, we made use of spatial transcriptomics to characterize the transcriptional profile specifically within the blastema. Using this technique, we generated a gene signature with high specificity for the blastema in both our spatial data, as well as other previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing transcriptomic studies. To elucidate potential mechanisms distinguishing regenerative from non-regenerative healing, we applied spatial transcriptomics to an aging model. Consistent with other forms of repair, our digit amputation mouse model showed a significant impairment in regeneration in aged mice. Contrasting young and aged mice, spatial analysis revealed a metabolic shift in aged blastema associated with an increased bioenergetic requirement. This enhanced metabolic turnover was associated with increased hypoxia and angiogenic signaling, leading to excessive vascularization and altered regenerated bone architecture in aged mice. Administration of the metabolite oxaloacetate decreased the oxygen consumption rate of the aged blastema and increased WNT signaling, leading to enhanced in vivo bone regeneration. Thus, targeting cell metabolism may be a promising strategy to mitigate aging-induced declines in tissue regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hybridization alters the shape of the genotypic fitness landscape, increasing access to novel fitness peaks during adaptive radiation</a></h4>

              
                Estimating the complex relationship between fitness and genotype or phenotype (i.e. the adaptive landscape) is one of the central goals of evolutionary biology. However, adaptive walks connecting genotypes to organismal fitness, speciation, and novel ecological niches are still poorly understood and processes for surmounting fitness valleys remain controversial. One outstanding system for addressing these connections is a recent adaptive radiation of ecologically and morphologically novel pupfishes (a generalist, molluscivore, and scale-eater) endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We leveraged whole-genome sequencing of 139 hybrids from two independent field fitness experiments to identify the genomic basis of fitness, estimate genotypic fitness networks, and measure the accessibility of adaptive walks on the fitness landscape. We identified 132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with fitness in field enclosures. Six out of the 13 regions most strongly associated with fitness contained differentially expressed genes and fixed SNPs between trophic specialists; one gene (<i>mettl21e</i>) was also misexpressed in lab-reared hybrids, suggesting a potential intrinsic genetic incompatibility. We then constructed genotypic fitness networks from adaptive alleles and show that scale-eating specialists are the most isolated of the three species on these networks. Intriguingly, introgressed and de novo variants reduced fitness landscape ruggedness as compared to standing variation, increasing the accessibility of genotypic fitness paths from generalist to specialists. Our results suggest that adaptive introgression and de novo mutations alter the shape of the fitness landscape, providing key connections in adaptive walks circumventing fitness valleys and triggering the evolution of novelty during adaptive radiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spontaneous neuronal oscillations in the human insula are hierarchically organized traveling waves</a></h4>

              
                The insula plays a fundamental role in a wide range of adaptive human behaviors, but its electrophysiological dynamics are poorly understood. Here we used human intracranial electroencephalographic recordings to investigate the electrophysiological properties and hierarchical organization of spontaneous neuronal oscillations within the insula. We analyzed the neuronal oscillations of the insula directly and found that rhythms in the theta and beta frequency oscillations are widespread and spontaneously present. These oscillations are largely organized along the anterior–posterior axis of the insula. Both the left and right insula showed anterior-­to-posterior decreasing gradients for the power of oscillations in the beta frequency band. The left insula also showed a posterior-to-anterior decreasing frequency gradient and an anterior-to-posterior decreasing power gradient in the theta frequency band. In addition to measuring the power of these oscillations, we also examined the phase of these signals across simultaneous recording channels and found that the insula oscillations in the theta and beta bands are traveling waves. The strength of the traveling waves in each frequency was positively correlated with the amplitude of each oscillation. However, the theta and beta traveling waves were uncoupled to each other in terms of phase and amplitude, which suggested that insular traveling waves in the theta and beta bands operate independently. Our findings provide new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics and hierarchical organization of neuronal oscillations within the insula, which, given its rich connectivity with widespread cortical regions, indicates that oscillations and traveling waves have an important role in intra- and inter-insular communication.

                Animals possess a remarkable ability to quickly and accurately respond to challenges to their balance and posture. Postural corrections are the implementation of a motor act by the nervous system that counteracts a perturbation and returns the body to a stable state. These corrections must respect both the current position of the limbs and trunk, as well as the external environment. However, how motor circuits integrate multiple streams of information regarding both these internal and external factors, and adjust motor actions accordingly, are poorly understood. Here we show that the lateral vestibular nucleus in the brainstem generates motor corrections following perturbation, and that this reflex can be altered by manipulating the surrounding environment. The strength of the motor correction is influenced by noradrenergic signalling from the locus coeruleus, suggesting a potential link between forebrain structures which convey sensory information about the environment, and brainstem circuits that generate motor corrections.

                Linguistic communication is often regarded as an action conveying the speaker's communicative goal to the addressee. With both correlational (an fMRI study) and causal (a lesion study) evidence, we demonstrated that communicative goals are represented in human premotor cortex. Participants read scripts each containing a sentence said by the speaker with a goal of either a promise, a request, or a reply. The fMRI results showed that the premotor cortex represented more information on communicative goals than the perisylvian language regions. The lesion study results showed that, relative to healthy controls, the understanding of communicative goals was impaired in patients with lesions in the premotor cortex, whereas no reliable difference between the healthy controls and lesion controls. These findings convergently suggest that the premotor cortex is crucial for representing the goals conveyed by language, supporting the theoretical view that linguistic communication can be seen as a goal-directed action.

                Twelve-hour (12 h) ultradian rhythms are a well-known phenomenon in coastal marine organisms. While 12 h cycles are observed in human behavior and physiology, no study has measured 12 h rhythms in the human brain. Here we identify 12 h rhythms in transcripts which either peak at sleep/wake transitions (~9 AM/PM) or static times (~3 PM/AM) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region involved in cognition. Subjects with schizophrenia lose 12 h rhythms in genes associated with the unfolded protein response and neuronal structural maintenance. Moreover, genes involved in mitochondrial function and protein translation, which normally peak at sleep/wake transitions, peak instead at static times in schizophrenia, suggesting suboptimal timing of these essential processes that may contribute to cognitive deficits commonly found in schizophrenia.

                We explored how weightlessness during space flight altered the astronauts gaze behavior with respect to flight day and target eccentricity. Thirty-four astronauts of 20 Space Shuttle missions had to acquire visual targets with angular offsets of 20, 30, and 49 deg. Measurements of eye, head, and gaze positions collected before and during flight days 1 to 15 indicated changes during target acquisition that varied as a function of flight days and target eccentricity. The in-flight changes in gaze behavior were presumably the result of a combination of several factors, including a transfer from allocentric to egocentric reference for spatial orientation in absence of a gravitational reference, the generation of slower head movements to prevent space motion sickness, and a decrease in smooth pursuit and vestibulo-ocular reflex performance. These results confirm that humans have several strategies for gaze behavior, between which they switch depending on the environmental conditions.

                Extracting brain tissue is usually a vital first step in processing brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in neuroimaging studies. While several conventional tools have been optimized to handle human brain data, there have been no generalizable methods to extract brain tissues for multimodal MRI data from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. In the present study, we propose a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network, named the Brain Extraction Net (BEN), to extract brain tissues across species, MRI modalities and platforms while requiring minimal or even no annotations. We have evaluated BEN on 18 independent datasets including 1,029 rodent and nonhuman primate MRI scans as well as 4,601 human MRI scans, covering five species, four modalities, and six platforms with various magnetic field strengths. Compared to conventional toolboxes, the superiority of BEN is illustrated by its accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. BEN provides uncertainty maps to quantify the confidence of the network's decisions and to model interrater variability. We design BEN as an open-source software that provides interfaces compatible with several popular neuroimaging toolboxes. Our results demonstrate that BEN has great promise to enhance neuroimaging studies at high throughput for both preclinical and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Saccadic modulation of neural excitability in auditory areas of the neocortex</a></h4>

              
                In natural "active" vision, humans and other primates use eye movements (saccades) to sample bits of information from visual scenes. In this process, nonretinal signals linked to saccades shift visual cortical neurons to a high excitability state as each saccade ends. The extent of this saccadic modulation outside of the visual system is unknown. Here, we show that during natural viewing, saccades modulate excitability in numerous auditory cortical areas, with a pattern complementary to that seen in visual areas. Bi-directional functional connectivity patterns suggest that these effects may arise from regions involved in saccade generation. By using saccadic signals to yoke excitability states in auditory areas to those in visual areas, the brain can improve information processing in complex natural settings.

                Background and Objectives: Time orientation is a fundamental cognitive process in which one's personal sense of time is matched with a universal reference. Assessment of time orientation is a ubiquitous component of neurological mental status examinations and neuropsychological assessments, yet its neural correlates remain unclear. Large bilateral lesions have been associated with deficits in time orientation, but more specific regions of the brain implicated in time disorientation following focal unilateral damage are relatively unknown. The current study investigates the anatomy of time disorientation and its network correlates in patients with focal brain lesions. Methods: 550 patients with acquired, focal brain lesions participated in this study, identified retrospectively from the Iowa Neurological Patient Registry. Time orientation was assessed 3 months or more after lesion onset using the Benton Temporal Orientation Test (BTOT) was performed 3 months or more after lesion onset, and 39 patients were identified as having chronic impairment in time orientation defined as a score of 3 or worse on the BTOT. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and lesion network mapping were used to evaluate the anatomy and networks associated with time disorientation. Performance on a variety of neuropsychological tests was compared between the time oriented and time disoriented group. Results: 39 patients were identified as having chronic impairment in time orientation. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping showed that lesions of the posterior cortices were associated with impaired time orientation, including medial temporal lobes, occipitotemporal cortex, and precuneus (r=0.21, p<.001). Individuals with time disorientation tended to have concomitant impairments in memory, visuospatial ability, and naming. Follow-up analyses of individuals with unilateral lesions and those with relatively unimpaired cognition in other domains implicated the precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus in time orientation. Lesion network mapping demonstrated that these regional findings occurred at nodes of the default mode and visual networks. Individuals with time disorientation tended to have concomitant impairments in memory, visuospatial ability, and naming. Discussion: We interpret these findings as novel evidence for the role of posteromedial cortices extending from the precuneus to the medial temporal lobe in supporting time orientation.

                Pericytes are multifunctional cells of the vasculature that are vital to brain homeostasis, yet many of their fundamental physiological properties remain unexplored. Ca2+ is a ubiquitous second messenger across cell-types, where it mediates diverse functions such as contractility and gene transcription. It is therefore important to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying Ca2+ signalling in capillary pericytes. Here, we performed pharmacological and ion substitution experiments to investigate the mechanisms underlying pericyte Ca2+ signaling in acute cortical brain slices of PDGFR{beta}-GCaMP6f mice. We report that in mid-capillary bed pericytes ([&ge;] 4th branch order), spontaneous microdomain Ca2+ signals are dependent on extracellular Ca2+, but largely independent of depolarization, L- and T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), and TRPC3/6 channels. In contrast, these microdomain signals were inhibited by multiple Orai channel blockers, including the specific antagonist GSK-7975A. Furthermore, capillary pericytes exhibited classical store operated calcium entry (SOCE) following store depletion that was sensitive to GSK-7975A and required for amplification of intracellular Ca2+ increases evoked by the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1. These results suggest that Orai SOCE mediates microdomain Ca2+ signals at rest and amplifies Gq-GPCR coupled Ca2+ elevations in capillary pericytes. Thus, SOCE is a major regulator of pericyte Ca2+ and a target for manipulating their function in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Low alcohol preferring mice have reduced task engagement during a waiting task for alcohol, which is enhanced by intermittent alcohol drinking</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is related to excessive binge alcohol consumption, and there is considerable interest in associated factors that promote intake. AUD has many behavioral facets that enhance inflexibility toward alcohol consumption, including impulsivity, motivation, and attention. Thus, it is important to understand how these factors might promote responding for alcohol and can change after protracted alcohol intake. Previous studies have explored such behavioral factors using responding for sugar in the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT), which allows careful separation of impulsivity, attention, and motivation. Importantly, our studies uniquely focus on using alcohol as the reward throughout training and testing sessions, which is critical for beginning to answer central questions relating to behavioral engagement for alcohol. Alcohol preference and consumption in C57BL/6 mice were determined from the first 9 sessions of 2-hour alcohol drinking which were interspersed among 5-CSRTT training. Interestingly, alcohol preference but not consumption level significantly predicted 5-CSRTT responding for alcohol. In contrast, responding for strawberry milk was not related to alcohol preference. Moreover, high-preference (HP) mice made more correct alcohol-directed responses than low-preference (LP) during the first half of each session and had more longer reward latencies in the second half, with no differences when performing for strawberry milk, suggesting that HP motivation for alcohol may reflect front-loading. Mice were then exposed to an Intermittent Access to alcohol paradigm and retested in 5-CSRTT. While both HP and LP mice increased 5-CSRTT responding for alcohol, but not strawberry milk, LP performance rose to HP levels, with a greater change in correct and premature responding in LP versus HP. Overall, this study provides three significant findings: 1) alcohol was a suitable reward in the 5-CSRTT, allowing dissection of impulsivity, attention, and motivation in relation to alcohol drinking, 2) alcohol preference was a more sensitive indicator of mouse 5-CSRTT performance than consumption, and 3) chronic alcohol drinking promoted behavioral engagement with alcohol, especially for individuals with less initial engagement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The central autonomic system revisited - convergent evidence for a regulatory role of the insular and midcingulate cortex from neuroimaging meta-analyses</a></h4>

              
                The autonomic nervous system regulates dynamic body adaptations to internal and external environment changes. Capitalizing on two different algorithms (Analysis of Brain Coordinates and GingerALE) that differ in empirical assumptions, we scrutinized the meta-analytic convergence of human neuroimaging studies investigating the neural basis of peripheral autonomic signal processing. Among the selected studies, we identified 42 records reporting 44 different experiments and testing 792 healthy individuals. The results of the two different algorithms converge in identifying the bilateral dorsal anterior insula and midcingulate cortex as the critical areas of the central autonomic system (CAN). However, whereas the bilateral dorsal anterior insula appears to be involved in processing autonomic nervous system signals regardless of task type, activity in the midcingulate cortex appears to be primarily engaged in processing autonomic signals during cognitive tasks and task-free conditions. Applying an unbiased approach, we were able to identify a single functionally condition-independent circuit that supports CAN activity. Although partially overlapping with the salience network, this functional circuit includes, in addition to the bilateral insular cortex and midcingulate cortex, the bilateral inferior parietal lobules and small clusters in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus. Our results do not support the hypothesis of divergent pathways for the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems or a robust involvement of the default mode network, particularly during parasympathetic activity. However, these results may be due to the relatively low number of studies investigating the parasympathetic system (12%), making our results more consistent with the central processing network of sympathetic activity. Remarkably, the critical regions of the CAN observed in this meta-analysis are among the most reported co-activated areas in neuroimaging studies and have been repeatedly shown as being dysregulated across different mental and neurological disorders. This suggests that the central dynamic interaction maintaining bodily homeostasis reported in several brain imaging studies may be associated with increased autonomic nervous system engagement and that disruptions in this interplay may underpin unspecific pathological symptoms across mental and neurological disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in oscillations in anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex are associated with altered signatures of Bayesian predictive coding in trait anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in the computational understanding of decision-making processes have led to proposals that anxiety biases how individuals form beliefs and estimate uncertainty. The anxiety and decision-making circuitry broadly overlap in regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Changes in activity across these brain areas could help explain how misestimation of uncertainty and altered belief updating can lead to impaired learning in anxiety. To test this prediction, this study built on recent progress in rhythm-based formulations of Bayesian predictive coding to identify sources of oscillatory modulations across the ACC, mPFC, and OFC that are associated with altered learning in subclinical trait anxiety. In a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment, two groups of human participants pre-screened with high and low trait anxiety (HTA, LTA: 39) performed a volatile probabilistic reward-based learning task. We modelled behaviour using a hierarchical Bayesian learning model. Furthermore, we quantified the parametric effects of trial-wise estimates of unsigned precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) and, separately, precision weights and surprise on source-reconstructed MEG time-frequency responses using convolution modelling. We showed that HTA interferes with overall reward-based learning performance associated with more stochastic decisions and more pronounced lose-shift tendencies. These behavioural effects were explained by an overestimation of volatility and faster belief updating in HTA when compared to LTA. On a neural level, we observed enhanced gamma responses and decreased alpha/beta activity in HTA during the encoding of unsigned pwPEs about about stimulus outcomes relative to LTA. These effects emerged primarily in the ACC and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC), and they were accompanied by additional ACC alpha/beta modulations representing differential encoding of precision weights in each anxiety group. Our study supports the association between subclinical trait anxiety and faster updating of beliefs in a volatile environment through gamma and alpha/beta activity changes in the ACC and dmPFC.

                The spiking activity of basal ganglia neurons can be characterized by summary statistics such as the average firing rate, or by measures of firing patterns, such as burst discharges, or oscillatory fluctuations of firing rates. Many of these features are altered by the presence of parkinsonism. This study examined another distinct attribute of firing activity, i.e., the occurrence of repeating sequences of inter-spike intervals. We studied this feature in extracellular electrophysiologic recordings that were made in the basal ganglia of Rhesus monkeys, before and after they had been rendered parkinsonian by treatment with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Neurons in both pallidal segments and in the subthalamic nucleus tended to fire in repeating sequences, typically 2 ISIs long (i.e., involving three spikes). In recordings that were 5000 inter-spike intervals long, 20-40% of spikes participated in one of many sequences with each ISI replicating the sequence pattern with a timing error of [&le;]1%. Compared to similar analyses in shuffled representations of the same data, sequences were more common in the original representation of ISIs in the subthalamic nucleus and the external pallidal segment. Induction of parkinsonism reduced the proportion of sequence spikes in the external pallidum but increased it in the subthalamic nucleus. We found no relation between the sequence generation and the firing rate of neurons, and, at most, a weak correlation between sequence generation and the incidence of bursts. We conclude that basal ganglia neurons fire in recognizable sequences of ISIs, whose incidence is influenced by the induction of parkinsonism.

                Non-coding variation in complex human disease has been well established by genome-wide association studies, and it is thought to involve regulatory elements, such as enhancers, whose variation affects the expression of the gene responsible for the disease. The regulatory elements often lie far from the gene they regulate, or within introns of genes differing from the regulated gene, making it difficult to identify the gene whose function is affected by a given enhancer variation. Enhancers are connected to their target gene promoters via long-range physical interactions (loops). In our study, we re-mapped, onto the human genome, more than 10,000 enhancers connected to promoters via long-range interactions, that we had previously identified in mouse brain-derived neural stem cells by RNApolII-ChIA-PET analysis, coupled to ChIP-seq mapping of DNA/chromatin regions carrying epigenetic enhancer marks. These interactions are thought to be functionally relevant. We discovered, in the human genome, thousands of DNA regions syntenic with the interacting mouse DNA regions (enhancers+connected promoters). We further annotated these human regions regarding their overlap with sequence variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs; copy number variants, CNVs), that were previously associated with neurodevelopmental disease in human. We document various cases in which the genetic variant, associated in human to neurodevelopmental disease, affects an enhancer involved in long-range interactions: SNPs, previously identified by genome-wide association studies to be associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and intelligence, are located within our human syntenic enhancers, and alter transcription factors recognition sites. Similarly, CNVs associated to autism spectrum disease and other neurodevelopmental disorders overlap with our human syntenic enhancers. Some of these enhancers are connected (in mouse) to homologs of genes already associated to the human disease, strengthening the hypothesis that the gene is indeed involved in the disease. Other enhancers are connected to genes not previously associated with the disease, pointing to their possible pathogenetic involvement. Our observations provide a resource for further exploration of neural disease, in parallel with the now widespread genome-wide identification of DNA variants in patients with neural disease.

                Imaging modalities capable of visualizing the human brain have led to major advances in neurology and brain research. Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) has gained importance for studying cerebral function in rodent models due to its unique capability to map changes in multiple hemodynamic parameters and to directly visualize neural activity within the brain. The technique further provides molecular imaging capabilities that can facilitate early disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring. However, transcranial imaging of the human brain is hampered by acoustic attenuation and other distortions introduced by the skull. Here, we demonstrate noninvasive transcranial MSOT angiography through the temporal bone of an adult healthy volunteer. Time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and T1-weighted structural MRI were further acquired to facilitate anatomical registration and interpretation. The superior middle cerebral vein in the temporal cortex was identified in the MSOT images, matching its location observed in the TOF-MRA images. These initial results pave the way toward the application of MSOT in clinical brain imaging.

                The ventral visual pathway is well known to be involved in recognizing and categorizing objects (Kanwisher and Dilks, 2013). Three color-biased areas have also been found between face and place selective areas in the ventral visual pathway (Lafer-Sousa et al., 2016). To understand the function of these color-biased areas in a region known for object recognition, we analyzed the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD; Allen et al., 2022), a large 7T fMRI dataset from 8 participants who viewed up to 30,000 trials of images of colored natural scenes. In a whole-brain analysis, we correlated the average color saturation of the images and the voxel responses, revealing color-biased areas that diverge into two streams in the ventral visual pathway, beginning in V4 and extending medially and laterally of the Fusiform Face Area in both hemispheres. We drew regions of interest (ROIs) for the two streams and found that the images for each ROI that evoked the largest responses had certain characteristics: They contained food, contained circular objects, had higher color saturation, contained warmer hues, and had more luminance entropy. A multiple linear regression showed that the presence of food in images was the strongest predictor of voxel responses in the medial and lateral color-biased regions for all eight participants, but that color saturation also contributed independently to voxel responses. Our results show that these areas are food-selective and color biased. We suggest that these streams might be involved in using color to recognize and judge the properties of food.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">One engram two readouts: stimulus dynamics switch a learned behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Memory guides the choices an animal makes across widely varying conditions in dynamic environments. Consequently, the most adaptive choice depends on the options available. How can a single memory support optimal behavior across different sets of choice options? We address this using olfactory learning in Drosophila. Even when we restrict an odor-punishment association to a single set of synapses using optogenetics, we find that flies still show choice behavior that depends on the options it encounters. Here we show that how the odor choices are presented to the animal influences memory recall itself. Presenting two similar odors in sequence enabled flies to not only discriminate them behaviorally but also at the level of neural activity. However, when the same odors were encountered as solitary stimuli, no such differences were detectable. These results show that memory recall is not simply a comparison to a static learned template, but can be adaptively modulated by stimulus dynamics.

	<p>Introduction: Dementia is a very common disorder that affects people over 65 years old all over the world. Apart from the cognitive decline, Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are a crucial matter in dementia, because they affect up to 90% of the patients during the course of their illness. Irritability has been found to be a common BPSD and one of the most distressing behaviors for the caregivers. The aim of the current study was to explore the efficacy of a combination of non-pharmacological interventions to treat irritability. Methods: Sixty patients with different types and stages of dementia with irritability were participated in a cross-over RCT. Three non-pharmacological interventions were used; (a) Validation Therapy (VT)/ Psycho-educational program, (b) Aromatherapy/ massage and (c) Music Therapy (MT). The study assessed the three non-pharmacological interventions in order to find the most effective combination of the interventions. This study did not compare pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The interventions lasted for five days. There was no drop-out rate. All patients were assessed at baseline using Mini Mental State of Examination (MMSE), Addenbrooke&amp;amp;rsquo;s Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Rating Scale for symptoms in dementia (FRSSD), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (sub questions for irritability). Only NPI used for the assessment after each intervention. The analyses used categorical variables, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Chi-square test and z value score. Results: The most effective combination of non-pharmacological interventions was Aromatherapy/ massage (p = 0.003)-VT plus Psycho-educational program (p = 0.014) plus MT (p = 0.018). The same combination was the most effective for the caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden, too (p = 0.026). Conclusions: The above combination of non-pharmacological interventions can reduce irritability in patients with dementia and caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cone-Driven Retinal Responses Are Shaped by Rod But Not Cone HCN1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Signal integration of converging neural circuits is poorly understood. One example is in the retina where the integration of rod and cone signaling is responsible for the large dynamic range of vision. The relative contribution of rods versus cones is dictated by a complex function involving background light intensity and stimulus temporal frequency. One understudied mechanism involved in coordinating rod and cone signaling onto the shared retinal circuit is the hyperpolarization activated current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>) mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels expressed in rods and cones. <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> opposes membrane hyperpolarization driven by activation of the phototransduction cascade and modulates the strength and kinetics of the photoreceptor voltage response. We examined conditional knock-out (KO) of HCN1 from mouse rods using electroretinography (ERG). In the absence of HCN1, rod responses are prolonged in dim light which altered the response to slow modulation of light intensity both at the level of retinal signaling and behavior. Under brighter intensities, cone-driven signaling was suppressed. To our surprise, conditional KO of HCN1 from mouse cones had no effect on cone-mediated signaling. We propose that <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> is dispensable in cones because of the high level of temporal control of cone phototransduction. Thus, HCN1 is required for cone-driven retinal signaling only indirectly by modulating the voltage response of rods to limit their output.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hyperpolarization gated hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels carry a feedback current that helps to reset light-activated photoreceptors. Using conditional HCN1 knock-out (KO) mice we show that ablating HCN1 from rods allows rods to signal in bright light when they are normally shut down. Instead of enhancing vision this results in suppressing cone signaling. Conversely, ablating HCN1 from cones was of no consequence. This work provides novel insights into the integration of rod and cone signaling in the retina and challenges our assumptions about the role of HCN1 in cones.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">ASD/OCD-Linked Protocadherin-10 Regulates Synapse, But Not Axon, Development in the Amygdala and Contributes to Fear- and Anxiety-Related Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>The <I>Protocadherin-10</I> (<I>PCDH10</I>) gene is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depression (MD). The PCDH10 protein is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that belongs to the 2-protocadherin family. PCDH10 is highly expressed in the developing brain, especially in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, the role of PCDH10 <I>in vivo</I> has been debatable: one paper reported that a <I>Pcdh10</I> mutant mouse line showed changes in axonal projections; however, another <I>Pcdh10</I> mutant mouse line was reported to have failed to detect axonal phenotypes. Therefore, the actual roles of PCDH10 in the brain remain to be elucidated. We established a new <I>Pcdh10</I> KO mouse line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, without inserting gene cassettes to avoid nonspecific effects, examined the roles of PCDH10 in the brain, and studied the behavioral consequences of <I>Pcdh10</I> inactivation. Here, we show that <I>Pcdh10</I> KO mice do not show defects in axonal development. Instead, we find that <I>Pcdh10</I> KO mice exhibit impaired development of excitatory synapses in the dorsal BLA. We further demonstrate that male <I>Pcdh10</I> KO mice exhibit reduced anxiety-related behaviors, impaired fear conditioning, decreased stress-coping responses, and mildly impaired social recognition and communication. These results indicate that PCDH10 plays a critical role in excitatory synapse development, but not axon development, in the dorsal BLA and that PCDH10 regulates anxiety-related, fear-related, and stress-related behaviors. Our results reveal the roles of PCDH10 in the brain and its relationship to relevant psychiatric disorders such as ASD, OCD, and MD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>Protocadherin-10</I> (<I>PCDH10</I>) encodes a cell adhesion molecule and is implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depression (MD). PCDH10 is highly expressed in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA). However, the phenotypes of previously published <I>Pcdh10</I> mutant mice are debatable, and some are possibly because of the nonspecific effects of the <I>LacZ/Neo</I> cassette inserted in the mice. We have generated a new <I>Pcdh10</I> mutant mouse line without the <I>LacZ/Neo</I> cassette. Using our new mouse line, we reveal the roles of PCDH10 for excitatory synapse development in the BLA. The mutant mice exhibit anxiety-related, fear-related, and stress-related behaviors, which are relevant to ASD, OCD, and MD, suggesting a possible treatment strategy for such psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurons in the Dorsomedial Hypothalamus Promote, Prolong, and Deepen Torpor in the Mouse</a></h4>

              
                <p>Torpor is a naturally occurring, hypometabolic, hypothermic state engaged by a wide range of animals in response to imbalance between the supply and demand for nutrients. Recent work has identified some of the key neuronal populations involved in daily torpor induction in mice, in particular, projections from the preoptic area of the hypothalamus to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). The DMH plays a role in thermoregulation, control of energy expenditure, and circadian rhythms, making it well positioned to contribute to the expression of torpor. We used activity-dependent genetic TRAPing techniques to target DMH neurons that were active during natural torpor bouts in female mice. Chemogenetic reactivation of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons in calorie-restricted mice promoted torpor, resulting in longer and deeper torpor bouts. Chemogenetic inhibition of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons did not block torpor entry, suggesting a modulatory role for the DMH in the control of torpor. This work adds to the evidence that the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and the DMH form part of a circuit within the mouse hypothalamus that controls entry into daily torpor.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Daily heterotherms, such as mice, use torpor to cope with environments in which the supply of metabolic fuel is not sufficient for the maintenance of normothermia. Daily torpor involves reductions in body temperature, as well as active suppression of heart rate and metabolism. How the CNS controls this profound deviation from normal homeostasis is not known, but a projection from the preoptic area to the dorsomedial hypothalamus has recently been implicated. We demonstrate that the dorsomedial hypothalamus contains neurons that are active during torpor. Activity in these neurons promotes torpor entry and maintenance, but their activation alone does not appear to be sufficient for torpor entry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Coupling of Mouse Olfactory Bulb Projection Neurons to Fluctuating Odor Pulses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Odors are transported by turbulent air currents, creating complex temporal fluctuations in odor concentration that provide a potentially informative stimulus dimension. We have shown that mice are able to discriminate odor stimuli based on their temporal structure, indicating that information contained in the temporal structure of odor plumes can be extracted by the mouse olfactory system. Here, using <I>in vivo</I> extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological recordings, we show that mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) of the male C57BL/6 mouse olfactory bulb can encode the dominant temporal frequencies present in odor stimuli up to at least 20 Hz. A substantial population of cell-odor pairs showed significant coupling of their subthreshold membrane potential with the odor stimulus at both 2 Hz (29/70) and the suprasniff frequency 20 Hz (24/70). Furthermore, mitral/tufted cells (M/TCs) show differential coupling of their membrane potential to odor concentration fluctuations with tufted cells coupling more strongly for the 20 Hz stimulation. Frequency coupling was always observed to be invariant to odor identity, and M/TCs that coupled well to a mixture also coupled to at least one of the components of the mixture. Interestingly, pharmacological blocking of the inhibitory circuitry strongly modulated frequency coupling of cell-odor pairs at both 2 Hz (10/15) and 20 Hz (9/15). These results provide insight into how both cellular and circuit properties contribute to the encoding of temporal odor features in the mouse olfactory bulb.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Odors in the natural environment have a strong temporal structure that can be extracted and used by mice in their behavior. Here, using <I>in vivo</I> extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological techniques, we show that the projection neurons in the olfactory bulb can encode and couple to the dominant frequency present in an odor stimulus. Furthermore, frequency coupling was observed to be differential between mitral and tufted cells and was odor invariant but strongly modulated by local inhibitory circuits. In summary, this study provides insight into how both cellular and circuit properties modulate encoding of odor temporal features in the mouse olfactory bulb.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pairing-Dependent Plasticity in a Dissected Fly Brain Is Input-Specific and Requires Synaptic CaMKII Enrichment and Nighttime Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>In <I>Drosophila</I>, <I>in vivo</I> functional imaging studies revealed that associative memory formation is coupled to a cascade of neural plasticity events in distinct compartments of the mushroom body (MB). In-depth investigation of the circuit dynamics, however, will require an <I>ex vivo</I> model that faithfully mirrors these events to allow direct manipulations of circuit elements that are inaccessible in the intact fly. The current <I>ex vivo</I> models have been able to reproduce the fundamental plasticity of aversive short-term memory, a potentiation of the MB intrinsic neuron (Kenyon cells [KCs]) responses after artificial learning <I>ex vivo</I>. However, this potentiation showed different localization and encoding properties from those reported <I>in vivo</I> and failed to generate the previously reported suppression plasticity in the MB output neurons (MBONs). Here, we develop an <I>ex vivo</I> model using the female <I>Drosophila</I> brain that recapitulates behaviorally evoked plasticity in the KCs and MBONs. We demonstrate that this plasticity accurately localizes to the MB &alpha;'3 compartment and is encoded by a coincidence between KC activation and dopaminergic input. The formed plasticity is input-specific, requiring pairing of the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus pathways; hence, we name it pairing-dependent plasticity. Pairing-dependent plasticity formation requires an intact <I>CaMKII</I> gene and is blocked by previous-night sleep deprivation but is rescued by rebound sleep. In conclusion, we show that our <I>ex vivo</I> preparation recapitulates behavioral and imaging results from intact animals and can provide new insights into mechanisms of memory formation at the level of molecules, circuits, and brain state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian <I>ex vivo</I> LTP model enabled in-depth investigation of the hippocampal memory circuit. We develop a parallel model to study the <I>Drosophila</I> mushroom body (MB) memory circuit. Pairing activation of the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus pathways in dissected brains induces a potentiation pairing-dependent plasticity (PDP) in the axons of &alpha;'&beta;' Kenyon cells and a suppression PDP in the dendrites of their postsynaptic MB output neurons, localized in the MB &alpha;'3 compartment. This PDP is input-specific and requires the 3' untranslated region of <I>CaMKII</I>. Interestingly, <I>ex vivo</I> PDP carries information about the animal's experience before dissection; brains from sleep-deprived animals fail to form PDP, whereas those from animals who recovered 2 h of their lost sleep form PDP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Distortion of Orientation Representation after Learning in the Mouse Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learning is an essential cognitive mechanism allowing behavioral adaptation through adjustments in neuronal processing. It is associated with changes in the activity of sensory cortical neurons evoked by task-relevant stimuli. However, the exact nature of those modifications and the computational advantages they may confer are still debated. Here, we investigated how learning an orientation discrimination task alters the neuronal representations of the cues orientations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of male and female mice. When comparing the activity evoked by the task stimuli in naive mice and the mice performing the task, we found that the representations of the orientation of the rewarded and nonrewarded cues were more accurate and stable in trained mice. This better cue representation in trained mice was associated with a distortion of the orientation representation space such that stimuli flanking the task-relevant orientations were represented as the task stimuli themselves, suggesting that those stimuli were generalized as the task cues. This distortion was context dependent as it was absent in trained mice passively viewing the task cues and enhanced in the behavioral sessions where mice performed best. Those modifications of the V1 population orientation representation in performing mice were supported by a suppression of the activity of neurons tuned for orientations neighboring the orientations of the task cues. Thus, visual processing in V1 is dynamically adapted to enhance the reliability of the representation of the learned cues and favor generalization in the task-relevant computational space.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Performance improvement in a task often requires facilitating the extraction of the information necessary to its execution. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a suppression mechanism that improves the representation of the orientations of the task stimuli in the V1 of mice performing an orientation discrimination task. We also show that this mechanism distorts the V1 orientation representation space, leading stimuli flanking the task stimuli orientations to be generalized as the task stimuli themselves.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Direct Comparison of Theta Power and Frequency to Speed and Acceleration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Decades of hippocampal neurophysiology research have linked the hippocampal theta rhythm to voluntary movement. A consistent observation has been a robust correlation between the amplitude (or power) and frequency of hippocampal theta and running speed. Recently, however, it has been suggested that acceleration, not running speed, is the dominating influence on theta frequency. There is an inherent interdependence among these two variables, as acceleration is the rate of change in velocity. Therefore, we investigated theta frequency and amplitude of the local-field potential recorded from the stratum pyramidale, stratum radiatum, and stratum lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 subregion, considering both speed and acceleration in tandem as animals traversed a circular task or performed continuous alternation. In male and female rats volitionally controlling their own running characteristics, we found that running speed carries nearly all of the variability in theta frequency and power, with a minute contribution from acceleration. These results contradicted a recent publication using a speed-clamping task, where acceleration and movement are compelled through the use of a bottomless car (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B26">Kropff et al., 2021a</cross-ref>). Therefore, we reanalyzed the speed-clamping data replicating a transient increase in theta frequency during acceleration. Compared with track running rats, the speed-clamped animals exhibited lower velocities and acceleration values but still showed a stronger influence of speed on theta frequency relative to acceleration. As navigation is the integration of many sensory inputs that are not necessarily linearly related, we offer caution in making absolute claims regarding hippocampal physiology from correlates garnered from a single behavioral repertoire.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A long-standing, replicable observation has been the increase of hippocampal theta power and frequency with increasing running speed. Recently, however, an experimental approach that clamps the running speed of an animal has suggested that acceleration is the dominant influence. Therefore, we analyzed data from freely behaving rats as well as data from the speed-clamping experiment. In unrestrained behavior, speed remains the dominant behavioral correlate to theta amplitude and frequency. Positive acceleration in the speed-clamp experiment induced a transient increase in theta frequency and power. However, speed retained the dominant influence over theta frequency, changing with velocity in both acceleration and deceleration conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anterior Cingulate Cortex Signals the Need to Control Intrusive Thoughts during Motivated Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                <p>How do people limit awareness of unwanted memories? When such memories intrude, a control process engages the right DLPFC (rDLPFC) to inhibit hippocampal activity and stop retrieval. It remains unknown how the need for control is detected, and whether control operates proactively to prevent unwelcome memories from being retrieved, or responds reactively, to counteract intrusions. We hypothesized that dorsal ACC (dACC) detects the emergence of an unwanted trace in awareness and transmits the need for inhibitory control to rDLPFC. During a memory suppression task, we measured in humans (both sexes) trial-by-trial variations in the theta power and N2 amplitude of dACC, two EEG markers that are thought to reflect the need for control. With simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings, we tracked interactions among dACC, rDLPFC, and hippocampus during suppression. We found a clear role of dACC in detecting the need for memory control and upregulating prefrontal inhibition. Importantly, we identified distinct early (300&ndash;450 ms) and late (500&ndash;700 ms) dACC contributions, suggesting both proactive control before recollection and reactive control in response to intrusions. Stronger early activity was associated with reduced hippocampal activity and diminished BOLD signal in dACC and rDLPFC, suggesting that preempting retrieval reduced overall control demands. In the later window, dACC activity was larger, and effective connectivity analyses revealed robust communication from dACC to rDLPFC and from rDLPFC to hippocampus, which are tied to successful forgetting. Together, our findings support a model in which dACC detects the emergence of unwanted content, triggering top-down inhibitory control, and in which rDLPFC countermands intruding thoughts that penetrate awareness.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Preventing unwanted memories from coming to mind is an adaptive ability of humans. This ability relies on inhibitory control processes in the prefrontal cortex to modulate hippocampal retrieval processes. How and when reminders to unwelcome memories come to trigger prefrontal control mechanisms remains unknown. Here we acquired neuroimaging data with both high spatial and temporal resolution as participants suppressed specific memories. We found that the anterior cingulate cortex detects the need for memory control, responding both proactively to early warning signals about unwelcome content and reactively to intrusive thoughts themselves. When unwanted traces emerge in awareness, anterior cingulate communicates with prefrontal cortex and triggers top-down inhibitory control over the hippocampus through specific neural oscillatory networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Prediction Error Determines Whether NMDA Receptors in the Basolateral Amygdala Complex Are Involved in Pavlovian Fear Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is widely accepted that activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) is necessary for the formation of fear memories in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). This acceptance is based on findings that blockade of NMDAR in the BLA disrupts Pavlovian fear conditioning in rodents when initially innocuous stimuli are paired with aversive and unexpected events (surprising foot shock). The present study challenges this acceptance by showing that the involvement of NMDAR in Pavlovian fear conditioning is determined by prediction errors in relation to aversive events. In the initial experiments, male rats received a BLA infusion of the NMDAR antagonist, D-AP5 and were then exposed to pairings of a novel target stimulus and foot shock. This infusion disrupted acquisition of fear to the target when the shock was surprising (experiments 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b) but spared fear to the target when the shock was expected based on the context, time and other stimuli that were present (experiments 1a and 1b). Under the latter circumstances, fear to the target required activation of calcium-permeable AMPAR (CP-AMPA; experiments 4a, 4b, and 4c), which, using electrophysiology, were shown to regulate the activity of interneurons in the BLA (experiment 5). Thus, NMDAR activation is not required for fear conditioning when danger occurs as expected given the context, time and stimuli present, but is required for fear conditioning when danger occurs unexpectedly. These findings are related to current theories of NMDAR function and ways that prediction errors might influence the substrates of fear memory formation in the BLA.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is widely accepted that NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) are activated by pairings of a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an aversive unconditioned (US) stimulus, leading to the synaptic changes that underlie formation of a CS-US association. The present findings are significant in showing that this theory is incomplete. When the aversive US is unexpected, animals encode all features of the situation (context, time and stimuli present) as a new fear/threat memory, which is regulated by NMDAR in the BLA. However, when the US is expected based on the context, time and stimuli present, the new fear memory is assimilated into networks that represent those features, which occurs independently of NMDAR activation in the BLA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Signals from Single-Opponent Cortical Cells in the Human cVEP</a></h4>

              
                <p>We used the chromatic visual evoked potential (cVEP) to study responses in human visual cortex evoked by equiluminant color stimuli for 6 male and 11 female observers. Large-area, colored squares were used to stimulate Single-Opponent cells preferentially, and fine color-checkerboard stimuli were used to activate Double-Opponent responses preferentially. Stimuli were modulated along the following two directions in color space: (1) the cardinal direction, L-M or M-L of DKL (Derrington, Krauskopf, and Lennie) space; and (2) the line from the white point to the color of the Red LED in the display screen, which was approximately intermediate between the L-M and -S directions in DKL space in cone-contrast coordinates. The amplitudes of cVEPs to large squares were smaller than those to checkerboards, and the latency of the cVEP response to squares was significantly less than the checkerboard latency. The latency of cVEP responses to the squares varied little with cone-contrast unlike the steep reduction of latency with cone-contrast observed in responses to color checkerboard patterns. The dynamic differences between cVEPs to squares and checkerboards support the hypothesis that a distinct neuronal mechanism responded to squares: Single-Opponent cells. Response amplitude, latency, and transientness&mdash;and their dependence on cone-contrast&mdash;were similar in the responses in the L-M and Red color directions. The similarity supports the hypothesis that the Single-Opponent signals in the cVEP come from a distinct population of cells that receives subtractive inputs from L and M cones, either L-M or M-L.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This article is about characterizing the visual behavior of a distinct population of neurons in the human visual cortex, the Single-Opponent color cells. Based on single-cell results in the visual cortex of macaque monkeys, we used large uniformly colored stimuli to isolate the responses of Single-Opponent cells in the chromatic visual evoked potential (cVEP) recorded on the scalp of human observers. VEP signals recorded under conditions believed to reveal Single-Opponent responses are small and transient. Their time course is relatively unaffected by cone-contrast, and they are relatively insensitive to stimulus modulation of short wavelength-sensitive S cones. Because Single-Opponent cells convey signals that can be used to judge the color of scene illumination, knowing their visual properties is important for understanding color vision.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dopaminergic Modulation of Dynamic Emotion Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emotion recognition abilities are fundamental to our everyday social interaction. A large number of clinical populations show impairments in this domain, with emotion recognition atypicalities being particularly prevalent among disorders exhibiting a dopamine system disruption (e.g., Parkinson's disease). Although this suggests a role for dopamine in emotion recognition, studies employing dopamine manipulation in healthy volunteers have exhibited mixed neural findings and no behavioral modulation. Interestingly, while a dependence of dopaminergic drug effects on individual baseline dopamine function has been well established in other cognitive domains, the emotion recognition literature so far has failed to account for these possible interindividual differences. The present within-subjects study therefore tested the effects of the dopamine D2 antagonist haloperidol on emotion recognition from dynamic, whole-body stimuli while accounting for interindividual differences in baseline dopamine. A total of 33 healthy male and female adults rated emotional point-light walkers (PLWs) once after ingestion of 2.5 mg haloperidol and once after placebo. To evaluate potential mechanistic pathways of the dopaminergic modulation of emotion recognition, participants also performed motoric and counting-based indices of temporal processing. Confirming our hypotheses, effects of haloperidol on emotion recognition depended on baseline dopamine function, where individuals with low baseline dopamine showed enhanced, and those with high baseline dopamine decreased emotion recognition. Drug effects on emotion recognition were related to drug effects on movement-based and explicit timing mechanisms, indicating possible mediating effects of temporal processing. Results highlight the need for future studies to account for baseline dopamine and suggest putative mechanisms underlying the dopaminergic modulation of emotion recognition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A high prevalence of emotion recognition difficulties among clinical conditions where the dopamine system is affected suggests an involvement of dopamine in emotion recognition processes. However, previous psychopharmacological studies seeking to confirm this role in healthy volunteers thus far have failed to establish whether dopamine affects emotion recognition and lack mechanistic insights. The present study uncovered effects of dopamine on emotion recognition in healthy individuals by controlling for interindividual differences in baseline dopamine function and investigated potential mechanistic pathways via which dopamine may modulate emotion recognition. Our findings suggest that dopamine may influence emotion recognition via its effects on temporal processing, providing new directions for future research on typical and atypical emotion recognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brain Network Allostasis after Chronic Alcohol Drinking Is Characterized by Functional Dedifferentiation and Narrowing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) causes complex alterations in the brain that are poorly understood. The heterogeneity of drinking patterns and the high incidence of comorbid factors compromise mechanistic investigations in AUD patients. Here we used male Marchigian Sardinian alcohol-preferring (msP) rats, a well established animal model of chronic alcohol drinking, and a combination of longitudinal resting-state fMRI and manganese-enhanced MRI to provide objective measurements of brain connectivity and activity, respectively. We found that 1 month of chronic alcohol drinking changed the correlation between resting-state networks. The change was not homogeneous, resulting in the reorganization of pairwise interactions and a shift in the equilibrium of functional connections. We identified two fundamentally different forms of network reorganization. First is functional dedifferentiation, which is defined as a regional increase in neuronal activity and overall correlation, with a concomitant decrease in preferential connectivity between specific networks. Through this mechanism, occipital cortical areas lost their specific interaction with sensory-insular cortex, striatal, and sensorimotor networks. Second is functional narrowing, which is defined as an increase in neuronal activity and preferential connectivity between specific brain networks. Functional narrowing strengthened the interaction between striatal and prefrontocortical networks, involving the anterior insular, cingulate, orbitofrontal, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices. Importantly, these two types of alterations persisted after alcohol discontinuation, suggesting that dedifferentiation and functional narrowing rendered persistent network states. Our results support the idea that chronic alcohol drinking, albeit at moderate intoxicating levels, induces an allostatic change in the brain functional connectivity that propagates into early abstinence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excessive consumption of alcohol is positioned among the top five risk factors for disease and disability. Despite this priority, the transformations that the nervous system undergoes from an alcohol-naive state to a pathologic alcohol drinking are not well understood. In our study, we use an animal model with proven translational validity to study this transformation longitudinally. The results show that shortly after chronic alcohol consumption there is an increase in redundant activity shared by brain structures, and the specific communication shrinks to a set of pathways. This functional dedifferentiation and narrowing are not reversed immediately after alcohol withdrawal but persist during early abstinence. We causally link chronic alcohol drinking with an early and abstinence-persistent retuning of the functional equilibrium of the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors contributing to under-reporting of patient safety incidents in Indonesia: leaders’ perspectives [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Understanding the causes of patient safety incidents is essential for improving patient safety; therefore, reporting and analysis of these incidents is a key imperative. Despite its implemention more than 15 years ago, the institutionalization of incident reporting in Indonesian hospitals is far from satisfactory. The aim of this study was to analyze the factors responsible for under-reporting of patient safety incidents in Indonesian public hospitals from the perspectives of leaders of hospitals, government departments, and independent institutions. Methods: A qualitative research methodology was adopted for this study using semi-structured interviews of key informants. 25 participants working at nine organizations (government departments, independent institutions, and public hospitals) were interviewed. The interview transcripts were analyzed using a deductive analytic approach. Nvivo 10 was used to for data processing prior to thematic analysis. Results: The key factors contributing to the under-reporting of patient safety incidents were categorized as hospital related and nonhospital related (government or independent agency). The hospital-related factors were: lack of understanding, knowledge, and responsibility for reporting; lack of leadership and institutional culture of reporting incidents; perception of reporting as an additional burden. The nonhospital-related factors were: lack of feedback and training; lack of confidentiality mechanisms in the system; absence of policy safeguards to prevent any punitive measures against the reporting hospital; lack of leadership. Conclusion: Our study identified factors contributing to the under-reporting of patient safety incidents in Indonesia. The lack of government support and absence of political will to improve patient safety incident reporting appear to be the root causes of under-reporting. Our findings call for concerted efforts involving government, independent agencies, hospitals, and other stakeholders for instituting reforms in the patient safety incident reporting system.

                Background: Young people in their teens and twenties don’t seek treatment immediately for mental health issues. This is due to the perceived stigma linked to mental health, pragmatic inconveniences to reach clinical settings, and the tediousness to seek help or engage with adults in traditional ways. Alternative approaches aside from drugs administration are needed. Method: We conducted an internet-delivered pilot randomized controlled trial directed to Hikikomori and Futōkō experienced subjects. This study aimed to understand the difference in efficacy for an intervention using a fictional story vs factual scientific information (self-aid texts), as well as the feasibility of an internet delivered program .. Evaluation of emotional transportation and mental health related measures were administered at base line before the program and at one week after the completion of the program. Results: 40 participants were enrolled. A post-intervention (T2) Independent T-student showed that Emotional Transportation was significantly lower for the intervention group than for the control group at T2. Relaxation was significantly higher for the intervention group than for the control group at T2. For the other outcome variables, the difference was not statistically significant.  An ANCOVA showed that there was a significant effect of groups on emotional transportation (lower in the intervention group). There was a significant effect of groups on empathy (lower in the intervention group); for the other variables the effects of groups were not detected. Conclusions: The results showed a significant diminishment in emotional transportation and empathy for the interventional group contradicting the hypothesis that an enhancement of emotional transportation mediates the positive mental health effects. A marginal improvement in relaxation in the intervention group (T-test) was found. In the posthoc analysis, the positive effects on the relaxation of pre-intervention (habitual) high emotional status of participants were confirmed. This trial is registered with UMIN, ID UMIN000044204.

                Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an uncommon microangiopathic disease and sometimes is associated with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). However, this probable causal relationship has not been completely proven. The diagnostic differentiation of both diseases is difficult in the first instance because they share similar characteristics that may overlap. We present a case of a 32-year-old woman with antecedents of epileptic seizures since she was 12 years old. The patient was admitted to the emergency room with a clinical picture of headaches, fever, paleness in the skin and mucosa, confused state, paresthesia, and transient spasticity of the extremities. The laboratory results revealed direct Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, significant elevation of lactate dehydrogenase, and presence of schistocytes ++ in the peripheral film. In addition, positive antinuclear antibodies and positive anti-native DNA in titers of 1/320 and 1/160, respectively, were found. Urinalysis showed that serum creatinine was in normal range. Because of limited hospital resources, ADAMTS13 was not evaluated. However, based on clinical, hematological, and biochemical findings, we concluded that it was a case of TTP associated with SLE and indicated treatment with plasmapheresis and methylprednisolone pulses, obtaining a satisfactory response (normalization of biomarker levels, health condition) after the second session of plasmapheresis. Diagnosis of both SLE and TTP is often difficult to achieve; however, adequate correlation of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests, along with the help of partial therapeutic interventions, may lead to good clinical response.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Study of bypassing Microsoft Windows Security using the MITRE CALDERA Framework [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microsoft Windows Security is a recently implemented safeguard for the Windows operating systems, including the latest versions of Windows10 and 11. However, there is a major shortcoming in this system to stop Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). These are government-financed groups that are funded to attack other government entities. Following the initial security breach, the hacked Windows device is used to access the rest of the network devices in order to transfer data to external storage (Exfiltration). Methods: In this work, we have tested the Microsoft Windows Security system using MITRE CALDERA and ATT&CK frameworks and explain how APT groups are able to bypass Windows Security. Results: In this study we used "54ndc47" agent through GoLang feature in MITRE CALDERA platform to test and bypass Microsoft Windows Security systems (MS Windows 10). Through it, we were able to bypass the Windows Security system and display entire files in the victim's device. Conclusions: In this paper, we have provided recommendations to Microsoft to improve their Windows Security tool through the use of Artificial intelligence (AI).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Anatomy of the first six months of COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolò Gozzi, Matteo Chinazzi, Jessica T. Davis, Kunpeng Mu, Ana Pastore y Piontti, Marco Ajelli, Nicola Perra, Alessandro Vespignani</p>

We analyze the effectiveness of the first six months of vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 in Italy by using a computational epidemic model which takes into account demographic, mobility, vaccines data, as well as estimates of the introduction and spreading of the more transmissible Alpha variant. We consider six sub-national regions and study the effect of vaccines in terms of number of averted deaths, infections, and reduction in the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) with respect to counterfactual scenarios with the actual non-pharmaceuticals interventions but no vaccine administration. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness in counterfactual scenarios with different vaccines allocation strategies and vaccination rates. Our results show that, as of 2021/07/05, vaccines averted 29, 350 (<i>IQR</i>: [16, 454–42, 826]) deaths and 4, 256, 332 (<i>IQR</i>: [1, 675, 564–6, 980, 070]) infections and a new pandemic wave in the country. During the same period, they achieved a −22.2% (<i>IQR</i>: [−31.4%; −13.9%]) IFR reduction. We show that a campaign that would have strictly prioritized age groups at higher risk of dying from COVID-19, besides frontline workers and the fragile population, would have implied additional benefits both in terms of avoided fatalities and reduction in the IFR. Strategies targeting the most active age groups would have prevented a higher number of infections but would have been associated with more deaths. Finally, we study the effects of different vaccination intake scenarios by rescaling the number of available doses in the time period under study to those administered in other countries of reference. The modeling framework can be applied to other countries to provide a mechanistic characterization of vaccination campaigns worldwide.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The catalytic mechanism of the mitochondrial methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (MTHFD2)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Li Na Zhao, Philipp Kaldis</p>

Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (MTHFD2) is a new drug target that is expressed in cancer cells but not in normal adult cells, which provides an Achilles heel to selectively kill cancer cells. Despite the availability of crystal structures of MTHFD2 in the inhibitor- and cofactor-bound forms, key information is missing due to technical limitations, including (a) the location of absolutely required Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, and (b) the substrate-bound form of MTHFD2. Using computational modeling and simulations, we propose that two magnesium ions are present at the active site whereby (i) Arg233, Asp225, and two water molecules coordinate MgA2+, while MgA2+ together with Arg233 stabilize the inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>); (ii) Asp168 and three water molecules coordinate MgB2+, and MgB2+ further stabilizes P<sub>i</sub> by forming a hydrogen bond with two oxygens of P<sub>i</sub>; (iii) Arg201 directly coordinates the P<sub>i</sub>; and (iv) through three water-mediated interactions, Asp168 contributes to the positioning and stabilization of MgA2+, MgB2+ and P<sub>i</sub>. Our computational study at the empirical valence bond level allowed us also to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanisms. We found that the dehydrogenase activity features a proton-coupled electron transfer with charge redistribution connected to the reorganization of the surrounding water molecules which further facilitates the subsequent cyclohydrolase activity. The cyclohydrolase activity then drives the hydration of the imidazoline ring and the ring opening in a concerted way. Furthermore, we have uncovered that two key residues, Ser197/Arg233, are important factors in determining the cofactor (NADP<sup>+</sup>/NAD<sup>+</sup>) preference of the dehydrogenase activity. Our work sheds new light on the structural and kinetic framework of MTHFD2, which will be helpful to design small molecule inhibitors that can be used for cancer treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Brain stimulation competes with ongoing oscillations for control of spike timing in the primate brain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew R. Krause, Pedro G. Vieira, Jean-Philippe Thivierge, Christopher C. Pack</p>

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a popular method for modulating brain activity noninvasively. In particular, tACS is often used as a targeted intervention that enhances a neural oscillation at a specific frequency to affect a particular behavior. However, these interventions often yield highly variable results. Here, we provide a potential explanation for this variability: tACS competes with the brain’s ongoing oscillations. Using neural recordings from alert nonhuman primates, we find that when neural firing is independent of ongoing brain oscillations, tACS readily entrains spiking activity, but when neurons are strongly entrained to ongoing oscillations, tACS often causes a decrease in entrainment instead. Consequently, tACS can yield categorically different results on neural activity, even when the stimulation protocol is fixed. Mathematical analysis suggests that this competition is likely to occur under many experimental conditions. Attempting to impose an external rhythm on the brain may therefore often yield precisely the opposite effect.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Distinct neuronal types contribute to hybrid temporal encoding strategies in primate auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiao-Ping Liu, Xiaoqin Wang</p>

Studies of the encoding of sensory stimuli by the brain often consider recorded neurons as a pool of identical units. Here, we report divergence in stimulus-encoding properties between subpopulations of cortical neurons that are classified based on spike timing and waveform features. Neurons in auditory cortex of the awake marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) encode temporal information with either stimulus-synchronized or nonsynchronized responses. When we classified single-unit recordings using either a criteria-based or an unsupervised classification method into regular-spiking, fast-spiking, and bursting units, a subset of intrinsically bursting neurons formed the most highly synchronized group, with strong phase-locking to sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) that extended well above 20 Hz. In contrast with other unit types, these bursting neurons fired primarily on the rising phase of SAM or the onset of unmodulated stimuli, and preferred rapid stimulus onset rates. Such differentiating behavior has been previously reported in bursting neuron models and may reflect specializations for detection of acoustic edges. These units responded to natural stimuli (vocalizations) with brief and precise spiking at particular time points that could be decoded with high temporal stringency. Regular-spiking units better reflected the shape of slow modulations and responded more selectively to vocalizations with overall firing rate increases. Population decoding using time-binned neural activity found that decoding behavior differed substantially between regular-spiking and bursting units. A relatively small pool of bursting units was sufficient to identify the stimulus with high accuracy in a manner that relied on the temporal pattern of responses. These unit type differences may contribute to parallel and complementary neural codes.

                Unsupervised learning, and more specifically clustering, suffers from the need for expertise in the field to be of use. Researchers must make careful and informed decisions on which algorithm to use with which set of hyperparameters for a given dataset. Additionally, researchers may need to determine the number of clusters in the dataset, which is unfortunately itself an input to most clustering algorithms; all of this before embarking on their actual subject matter work. After quantifying the impact of algorithm and hyperparameter selection, we propose an ensemble clustering framework which can be leveraged with minimal input. It can be used to determine both the number of clusters in the dataset and a suitable choice of algorithm to use for a given dataset. A code library is included in the Conclusions for ease of integration.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison between the effects of older versus newer generations of antiepileptic drugs on bone metabolism in adult Iraqi patients: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabolic bone disorder is a significant endocrine system disorder that encompasses any disorder that alters the natural skeleton's mineralization process. Epilepsy is a prevalent central nervous system disorder that can cause biochemical abnormalities involving bone metabolism in the epileptic patients. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic use of older compared to the newer generations of antiepileptic drugs on bone metabolism-related biomarkers. Methods: The study included fifty-one epileptic outpatients who attended the Consultation Clinic of Baghdad Teaching Hospital at the Medical City Complex from October/2021 to December/2021. The selected patients were on antiepileptic drugs for more than 2 years, hence were grouped according to their antiepileptic therapy into: Group-1: 24 epileptic patients on old antiepileptic drugs (Carbamazepine or Valproate). Group-2: 27 epileptic patients on new antiepileptic drugs (Levetiracetam), compared with Group-3: 28 healthy control subjects. Serum was obtained from their blood specimens to measure: calcium and inorganic phosphate by colorimetric assays, parathyroid hormone, and level of bone alkaline phosphatase activity. Results: Data analysis revealed that the median value of serum parathyroid hormone levels was significantly elevated in the epileptic patients' groups compared to the healthy control group. However, group-2 (new generation antiepileptic drugs) presented higher values. Whereas serum calcium and inorganic phosphate levels showed non-significant variation for all the studied groups. Furthermore, serum bone alkaline phosphatase activity exhibited significantly higher values in the patients compared to the healthy subjects group, with more significant elevation among those on old generation antiepileptic drugs (Carbamazepine or Valproate). Conclusion: Epileptic individuals who had been on AEDs for more than two years had increased parathyroid hormone levels, which were boosted by the newer antiepileptic drug Levetiracetam. Furthermore, BAP serum levels were considerably greater in epileptic patients than in healthy control participants, with larger values generated by older antiepileptic medications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does the autism phenotype differ when selecting groups by neurodevelopmental versus genetic diagnosis? An observational study comparing autism and sex chromosome trisomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism is diagnosed on the basis of social and non-social behavioural features that are assumed to cluster together, and assumed to be distinct from other aspects of development, such as language ability. It is unclear, however, if these assumptions are valid. This study presents a novel approach to answering this question by investigating whether correlations between autism features are similar for groups selected on behavioural versus genetic diagnosis. Methods: The autism phenotype was assessed by diagnostic interview in young people aged 7 to 14 diagnosed with autism (N=61) or sex chromosome trisomy (SCT; N=49). Data were analysed by confirmatory factor analysis and MANOVA. Results: Autism features showed a similar factor structure and were distinct from language ability in both groups. However, the SCT group was more likely to show clinically-significant difficulties in just some aspects of autism and a lower level of non-social autism features for their social-communication disabilities. Conclusions: We suggest the group differences emerged because autism diagnostic criteria do not map exactly on the autism phenotype as it manifests “naturally”. Conventional diagnostic criteria for autism miss those with uneven profiles of difficulty and those with relatively low levels of restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">ZSCAN1 Autoantibodies Are Associated with Pediatric Paraneoplastic ROHHAD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), is a severe pediatric disorder of uncertain etiology resulting in hypothalamic dysfunction and frequent sudden death. Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Background: Some firms with good growth opportunities and additional funds could have difficulties accessing external finance. One possible way to enhance their financial inclusion could be an exciting approach to planning the money reserve collected on a firm’s account. Methods: This article aims to disclose the introduction of financial logistics as the new theoretical field of management science. The authors present, in this paper, the key findings on the development of logistical models of an optimum money reserve calculation taking into account digital transformation and industry 4.0 technologies and optimization methods. Results: The monetary reserve models are analogies of models of storekeeping in supply chains. The specific area of the theoretical research of logistics is shown in this paper, which could be disclosed as the subject of financial logistics as a science. The authors consider the term “Financial Logistics” based on logistics theory and money demand. Conclusions: Authors suggest the methodology of studying the nature of both financial and material flows of resources by comparing the relevant formulas. From the researchers’ points of view, financial logistics could be defined as the theory of managing the cash flows based on the logistical models for calculating a corporation’s cash reserve. The authors find it interesting to expand the conditions for calculating financial flows since the uncertainty of external market conditions always influences actual commercial activity.

                Background: Amiodarone and beta-blockers are widely used as prophylaxis for postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). The current recommendations from society guidelines are inconclusive, leading to differing practices among physicians. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of both agents in preventing postoperative AF after cardiac surgery. Methods: We explored online medical databases, such as CINAHL, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amiodarone and beta-blocker for prevention of AF after cardiac surgery. Outcomes analysed in this study were AF number of events and duration, hospital stay, and mean ventricular rate. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test, and publication bias was analysed using Egger’s test.  Results: In total, eight RCTs comprising 1370 patients met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed that patients in both groups had no significant difference in both AF episodes (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.04, p=0.10) and AF duration (SMD 0.46, 95% CI -1.14 to 2.05, p=0.57). Furthermore, secondary outcome analysis on mean ventricular rate and mean hospital length of stay in both groups showed no significant difference (MD -4.48, 95% CI -14.36 to 5.39, p=0.37 and MD 0.29, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.63, p=0.11, respectively).  Conclusions: Amiodarone and beta-blockers are equally effective in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, with no difference in AF episode and duration, mean ventricular rate, and hospital length of stay.

                Background: The closure of universities due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may alter the behaviour of students. This study aimed to determine the effect of the pandemic on physical activity and sitting time in French students prior to confinement and during confinement. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on data collected via an online questionnaire for university students during the second confinement in France (between October and December 2020). Participants (N= 2873) completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, which assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and contained questions about modes of transport, and perception of uninterrupted sitting time and screen time prior to confinement and during confinement. Multiple regression models assessed how active transportation, uninterrupted sitting time, and screen time studying increased or reduced confinement effects on physical activity and sitting time. Results: The regression models showed that physical activity decreased during confinement for students who engaged in more prolonged periods of active transportation prior to confinement. Moreover, the perception of long, uninterrupted sitting time and high screen time prior to confinement significantly increased sitting time during confinement. Students who adopted the most active transport time prior to confinement were the least likely to increase their screen time during confinement. Conclusions: Confinement reduced physical activity levels and increased sitting time, mainly among students who adopted active transport and accumulated longer uninterrupted sitting time. Students who combined-long periods of uninterrupted sitting time with high screen use could be a riskier profile for health. Analysis of physical activity time and sitting position should include its accumulation patterns.

                As of 2022, myocardial injury associated with COVID-19 has been one of the most discussed topics in literature. Though variety of cardiac manifestations have been reported and described in scientific literature, case of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has not been well reported and described. We present a case of DCM post-COVID-19 without any co-morbidities who was admitted several times for cardiac symptoms post-COVID-19. As it was a new finding associated with COVID-19, it has been worth understanding the variations in which cardiac conditions manifest in COVID-19.

                Background: To determine the prevalence and associated factors of adolescent pregnancy in Peru, 2015-2019. Methods: A population-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted using pooled data from the Demographic and Family Health Surveys of Peru 2015-2019. A total weighted sample of 6892 adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 years with a history of sexual intercourse were included. Finally, the adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported to determine the factors that were significantly associated with adolescent pregnancy. Results: The prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in Peru was 30.1% (95%CI: 28.4–31.8%). In the multivariable analysis; being 17-19 years (aPR: 1.38; 95%CI :1.22–1.56), having a partner (aPR: 4.08; 95%CI: 3.46–4.81) and belonging to the Quechua ethnicity group (aPR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.09–1.32), were associated with a higher prevalence. Whereas, having an occupation (aPR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.75–0.88), currently studying (aPR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.36–0.49), belonging to the second (aPR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.84–0.98), third (aPR: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.72–0.89), fourth (aPR: 0.76; 95%CI: 0.64–0.89) and fifth (aPR: 0.55; 95%CI: 0.41–0.73) wealth quintile, initiating sexual relations between 17-19 years (aPR: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.46–0.59), perceiving a future pregnancy as a problem (aPR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.70–0.83) and knowledge of the moment in the cycle when she could become pregnant (aPR: 0.84; 95%CI: 0.76–0.93), were associated with a lower prevalence of pregnancy. Conclusions: About three in 10 adolescents who initiated their sexual life presented with at least one pregnancy. Age, marital status, employment, education, wealth, ethnicity, age at first intercourse, knowledge of when in the cycle she may become pregnant, and perception of future pregnancy were associated with adolescent pregnancy. It is necessary to increase national policies on family planning and sex education among adolescents to reduce the prevalence of adolescent pregnancy in Peru.

                Dobosh et al. recapitulate infection by SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent inflammation by blood monocytes entering the lung in a human small airway model. Lung-recruited monocytes acquire SARS-CoV-2 from the infected epithelium, but are unable to propagate virus. The immunomodulatory drug baricitinib promotes antiviral signaling in monocytes, which enhances clearance of SARS-CoV-2.
