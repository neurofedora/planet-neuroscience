              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The critical role of the ventral temporal lobe in word retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in word retrieval are a hallmark of a variety of neurological illnesses spanning from dementia to traumatic injuries. The role of the dominant temporal lobe in fluent naming has been characterized by lesional analyses, functional imaging, and intracranial recordings, but limitations of each of these measures preclude a clear assessment of which specific constituent of the temporal lobe is critical for naming. We studied a large cohort of patients undergoing surgical resections or laser ablations of the dominant temporal lobe for medically intractable epilepsy (n=95). These techniques are exceedingly effective for seizure control but often result in language declines, particularly in confrontation naming, which can be socio-economically disabling. We used a multivariate voxel-based lesion symptom mapping analysis to localize brain regions significantly associated with visual object naming deficits. We observed that posterior inferior temporal regions, centered around the middle fusiform gyrus, were significantly associated with a decline in confrontation naming. Furthermore, we found that the posterior margin of anterior temporal lobectomies was linearly correlated to a decline in visual naming with a clinically significant decline occurring once the resection extended 6 cm from the anterior tip of the temporal lobe. We integrated these findings with electrocorticography during naming in a subset of this population and found that the majority of cortical regions whose resection was associated with a significant decline overlapped with regions that were functionally most active prior to articulation. Importantly, these loci coincide with the sites of susceptibility artifacts during echo-planar imaging, which explains why this region has not previously been implicated. Taken together, these data highlight the crucial contribution of the posterior ventral temporal cortex in lexical access and its important role in the pathophysiology of anomia following temporal lobe resections. Surgical strategies, including the use of laser ablation to target the medial temporal lobe as well as microsurgical approaches, should attempt to preserve this region to mitigate postoperative language deficits.

	<p>Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a neuromodulation procedure that is currently studied for the purpose of improving cognitive function in various diseases. A few studies have shown positive effects of tACS in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying tACS has not been established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of tACS in five familial AD mutation (5xFAD) mouse models. We prepared twenty 4-month-old mice and divided them into four groups: wild-type mice without stimulation (WT-NT group), wild-type mice with tACS (WT-T group), 5xFAD mice without stimulation (AD-NT group), and 5xFAD mice with tACS (AD-T group). The protocol implemented was as follows: gamma frequency 200 μA over the bilateral frontal lobe for 20 min over 2 weeks. The following tests were conducted: excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) recording, Western blot analysis (cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) proteins, phosphorylated CREB proteins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and parvalbumin) to examine the synaptic plasticity. The EPSP was remarkably increased in the AD-T group compared with in the AD-NT group. In the Western blot analysis, the differences among the groups were not significant. Hence, tACS can affect the long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission in mice models of AD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>For proper execution of goal-directed behaviors, individuals require both a general representation of the goal and an ability to monitor their own progress toward that goal. Here, we examine how dorsomedial striatum (DMS), a region pivotal for forming associations among stimuli, actions, and outcomes, encodes the execution of goal-directed action sequences that require self-monitoring of behavior. We trained rats to complete a sequence of at least five consecutive lever presses (without visiting the reward port) to obtain a reward and recorded the activity of individual cells in DMS while rats performed the task. We found that the pattern of DMS activity gradually changed during the execution of the sequence, permitting accurate decoding of sequence progress from neural activity at a population level. Moreover, this sequence-related activity was blunted on trials where rats did not complete a sufficient number of presses. Overall, these data suggest a link between DMS activity and the execution of behavioral sequences that require monitoring of ongoing behavior.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) that is localized within neurons and plays crucial roles in RNA metabolism. Its importance in neuronal functioning is underscored from the study of its pathogenic features in many neurodegenerative diseases where neuronal hnRNP A1 is mislocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm resulting in loss of hnRNP A1 function. Here, we model hnRNP A1 loss-of-function by siRNA-mediated knock-down in differentiated Neuro-2a cells. Through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by gene ontology (GO) analyses, we show that hnRNP A1 is involved in important biological processes, including RNA metabolism, neuronal function, neuronal morphology, neuronal viability, and stress granule (SG) formation. We further confirmed several of these roles by showing that hnRNP A1 knock-down results in a reduction of neurite outgrowth, increase in cell cytotoxicity and changes in SG formation. In summary, these findings indicate that hnRNP A1 loss-of-function contributes to neuronal dysfunction and cell death and implicates hnRNP A1 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smokeless tobacco use and reproductive outcomes among women: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Both smoked and smokeless tobacco use have deleterious effects on most major organ systems including the reproductive system. We conducted a systematic review on smokeless tobacco (SLT) use and reproductive outcomes among women. Methods: We searched Pubmed, ProQuest, Cochrane, Wiley and Emerald databases for studies involving smokeless tobacco use in women with any or a combination of three conditions: infertility, menstrual disorders and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Eligibility criteria included English language publications from 1st January 1990 - 31st October 2020. CADIMA software used for filtering the studies and modified SIGN checklist for the quality assessment. The findings are reported as per the PRISMA guidelines. The AXIS and ROBIN E tool were used for assessment of risk of bias. Results: In total, three studies addressed our research question. Two studies addressed infertility (prospective cohort: n=501, cross sectional: n=192) of which, the cross-sectional study compared the mean cotinine levels between those with infertility, menstrual disorders and PID. This study also explored the association between SLT and PID. PID was the most common gynecological complaint. Women with PID had significantly higher urinary cotinine levels = 24.95±12.259) ng/ ml (p=0.0144). Mean urinary cotinine in women with menstrual complaints was 19.32±10.29 ng/ml.  The other study used population-based sampling of 501 couples who attempted pregnancy (enrolled in the LIFE Study).  Results showed that only 2% (n=28) of men and none of the women used smokeless tobacco.  Compared with never users of tobacco, smoking by females was individually associated with longer time-to-pregnancy;  smoking among males remained significant when modeling partners together. Conclusions: Available studies exploring associations between SLT and reproductive outcomes are inconclusive due to limitations in the study methodologies. More studies with robust study designs are required from low- and middle-income countries with high prevalence of SLT use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferred expression regulator activities suggest genes mediating cardiometabolic genetic signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jason W. Hoskins, Charles C. Chung, Aidan O’Brien, Jun Zhong, Katelyn Connelly, Irene Collins, Jianxin Shi, Laufey T. Amundadottir</p>

Expression QTL (eQTL) analyses have suggested many genes mediating genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals but most GWAS signals still lack compelling explanatory genes. We have leveraged an adipose-specific gene regulatory network to infer expression regulator activities and phenotypic master regulators (MRs), which were used to detect activity QTLs (aQTLs) at cardiometabolic trait GWAS loci. Regulator activities were inferred with the VIPER algorithm that integrates enrichment of expected expression changes among a regulator’s target genes with confidence in their regulator-target network interactions and target overlap between different regulators (i.e., pleiotropy). Phenotypic MRs were identified as those regulators whose activities were most important in predicting their respective phenotypes using random forest modeling. While eQTLs were typically more significant than aQTLs in <i>cis</i>, the opposite was true among candidate MRs in <i>trans</i>. Several GWAS loci colocalized with MR <i>trans</i>-eQTLs/aQTLs in the absence of colocalized <i>cis</i>-QTLs. Intriguingly, at the 1p36.1 BMI GWAS locus the <i>EPHB2 cis</i>-aQTL was stronger than its <i>cis</i>-eQTL and colocalized with the GWAS signal and 35 BMI MR <i>trans</i>-aQTLs, suggesting the GWAS signal may be mediated by effects on <i>EPHB2</i> activity and its downstream effects on a network of BMI MRs. These MR and aQTL analyses represent systems genetic methods that may be broadly applied to supplement standard eQTL analyses for suggesting molecular effects mediating GWAS signals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparative genomic analysis reveals varying levels of mammalian adaptation to coronavirus infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sean B. King, Mona Singh</p>

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, is of zoonotic origin. Evolutionary analyses assessing whether coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 infected ancestral species of modern-day animal hosts could be useful in identifying additional reservoirs of potentially dangerous coronaviruses. We reasoned that if a clade of species has been repeatedly exposed to a virus, then their proteins relevant for viral entry may exhibit adaptations that affect host susceptibility or response. We perform comparative analyses across the mammalian phylogeny of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in order to uncover evidence for selection acting at its binding interface with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We uncover that in rodents there is evidence for adaptive amino acid substitutions at positions comprising the ACE2-spike interaction interface, whereas the variation within ACE2 proteins in primates and some other mammalian clades is not consistent with evolutionary adaptations. We also analyze aminopeptidase N (APN), the receptor for the human coronavirus 229E, a virus that causes the common cold, and find evidence for adaptation in primates. Altogether, our results suggest that the rodent and primate lineages may have had ancient exposures to viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Perspectives for the reconstruction of 3D chromatin conformation using single cell Hi-C data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pavel I. Kos, Aleksandra A. Galitsyna, Sergey V. Ulianov, Mikhail S. Gelfand, Sergey V. Razin, Alexander V. Chertovich</p>

Construction of chromosomes 3D models based on single cell Hi-C data constitute an important challenge. We present a reconstruction approach, DPDchrom, that incorporates basic knowledge whether the reconstructed conformation should be coil-like or globular and spring relaxation at contact sites. In contrast to previously published protocols, DPDchrom can naturally form globular conformation due to the presence of explicit solvent. Benchmarking of this and several other methods on artificial polymer models reveals similar reconstruction accuracy at high contact density and DPDchrom advantage at low contact density. To compare 3D structures insensitively to spatial orientation and scale, we propose the Modified Jaccard Index. We analyzed two sources of the contact dropout: contact radius change and random contact sampling. We found that the reconstruction accuracy exponentially depends on the number of contacts per genomic bin allowing to estimate the reconstruction accuracy in advance. We applied DPDchrom to model chromosome configurations based on single-cell Hi-C data of mouse oocytes and found that these configurations differ significantly from a random one, that is consistent with other studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The meaning of significant mean group differences for biomarker discovery</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eva Loth, Jumana Ahmad, Chris Chatham, Beatriz López, Ben Carter, Daisy Crawley, Bethany Oakley, Hannah Hayward, Jennifer Cooke, Antonia San José Cáceres, Danilo Bzdok, Emily Jones, Tony Charman, Christian Beckmann, Thomas Bourgeron, Roberto Toro, Jan Buitelaar, Declan Murphy, Guillaume Dumas</p>

Over the past decade, biomarker discovery has become a key goal in psychiatry to aid in the more reliable diagnosis and prognosis of heterogeneous psychiatric conditions and the development of tailored therapies. Nevertheless, the prevailing statistical approach is still the mean group comparison between “cases” and “controls,” which tends to ignore within-group variability. In this educational article, we used empirical data simulations to investigate how effect size, sample size, and the shape of distributions impact the interpretation of mean group differences for biomarker discovery. We then applied these statistical criteria to evaluate biomarker discovery in one area of psychiatric research—autism research. Across the most influential areas of autism research, effect size estimates ranged from small (<i>d</i> = 0.21, anatomical structure) to medium (<i>d</i> = 0.36 electrophysiology, <i>d</i> = 0.5, eye-tracking) to large (<i>d</i> = 1.1 theory of mind). We show that in normal distributions, this translates to approximately 45% to 63% of cases performing within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the typical range, i.e., they do not have a deficit/atypicality in a statistical sense. For a measure to have diagnostic utility as defined by 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity, Cohen’s <i>d</i> of 1.66 is required, with still 40% of cases falling within 1 SD. However, in both normal and nonnormal distributions, 1 (skewness) or 2 (platykurtic, bimodal) biologically plausible subgroups may exist despite small or even nonsignificant mean group differences. This conclusion drastically contrasts the way mean group differences are frequently reported. Over 95% of studies omitted the “on average” when summarising their findings in their abstracts (“autistic people have deficits in X”), which can be misleading as it implies that the group-level difference applies to all individuals in that group. We outline practical approaches and steps for researchers to explore mean group comparisons for the discovery of stratification biomarkers.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Attention controls multisensory perception via 2 distinct mechanisms at different levels of the cortical hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ambra Ferrari, Uta Noppeney</p>

To form a percept of the multisensory world, the brain needs to integrate signals from common sources weighted by their reliabilities and segregate those from independent sources. Previously, we have shown that anterior parietal cortices combine sensory signals into representations that take into account the signals’ causal structure (i.e., common versus independent sources) and their sensory reliabilities as predicted by Bayesian causal inference. The current study asks to what extent and how attentional mechanisms can actively control how sensory signals are combined for perceptual inference. In a pre- and postcueing paradigm, we presented observers with audiovisual signals at variable spatial disparities. Observers were precued to attend to auditory or visual modalities prior to stimulus presentation and postcued to report their perceived auditory or visual location. Combining psychophysics, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and Bayesian modelling, we demonstrate that the brain moulds multisensory inference via 2 distinct mechanisms. Prestimulus attention to vision enhances the reliability and influence of visual inputs on spatial representations in visual and posterior parietal cortices. Poststimulus report determines how parietal cortices flexibly combine sensory estimates into spatial representations consistent with Bayesian causal inference. Our results show that distinct neural mechanisms control how signals are combined for perceptual inference at different levels of the cortical hierarchy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of astroglia-like cardiac nexus glia that are critical regulators of cardiac development and function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nina L. Kikel-Coury, Jacob P. Brandt, Isabel A. Correia, Michael R. O’Dea, Dana F. DeSantis, Felicity Sterling, Kevin Vaughan, Gulberk Ozcebe, Pinar Zorlutuna, Cody J. Smith</p>

Glial cells are essential for functionality of the nervous system. Growing evidence underscores the importance of astrocytes; however, analogous astroglia in peripheral organs are poorly understood. Using confocal time-lapse imaging, fate mapping, and mutant genesis in a zebrafish model, we identify a neural crest–derived glial cell, termed nexus glia, which utilizes Meteorin signaling via Jak/Stat3 to drive differentiation and regulate heart rate and rhythm. Nexus glia are labeled with <i>gfap</i>, <i>glast</i>, and <i>glutamine synthetase</i>, markers that typically denote astroglia cells. Further, analysis of single-cell sequencing datasets of human and murine hearts across ages reveals astrocyte-like cells, which we confirm through a multispecies approach. We show that cardiac nexus glia at the outflow tract are critical regulators of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system. These data establish the crucial role of glia on cardiac homeostasis and provide a description of nexus glia in the PNS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mobile banking adoption and usage among Generation Y Malaysians [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: By 2018, Malaysian mobile banking services made the third-largest amount of banking transactions, following credit card and Internet banking. In addition, it significantly contributes to the banking industry by providing easier transactions to banking consumers. This study examined factors affecting the intention to use, and the actual use of mobile banking services in Malaysia. Methods: Two main theories of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (extended version, UTAUT2), and the model of perceived risk, were used to propose a modified framework. Based on the non-probability sampling method, the data were collected from 504 respondents. The data vas analyzed using SPSS and PLS-SEM to derive the findings. Results: The study's findings revealed that the independent variables could explain 55.3% of the variance in mobile banking use and 60.3% of variance in intention to use variables. Moreover, it demonstrated that common factors that have significantly affected the actual use and intention to use mobile banking were habit, facilitating condition, and interface design quality. In contrast, perceived risk and intention to use were found to only have significant impacts on the use of mobile banking, while effort expectancy was found to only have a significant impact on the intention to use. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide significant new knowledge on mobile banking, from which mobile banking providers and interface designers can develop potential solutions to increase the usage of mobile banking services in Malaysia. However, using a qualitative method, the proposed model could only explain 55% of actual use and 60% of intentional use. Thus, additional variables and qualitative techniques may help increase the understanding on the actual use and intention to use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lateral versus posterior surgical approach for the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Supracondylar humeral fracture (SHF) is the most common type of fracture in children. Moreover, lateral and posterior surgical approaches are the most frequently chosen approaches for open reduction surgery in displaced SHF when C-arm is unavailable. However, previous literature showed mixed findings regarding functional and cosmetic outcomes. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has compared these two procedures.  Methods: Our protocol was registered at PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021213763). We conducted a comprehensive electronic database search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Two independent reviewers screened the title and abstract, followed by full-text reading and study selection based on eligibility criteria. The quality of the selected studies was analyzed with the ROBINS-I tool. Meta-analysis was carried out to compare the range of motion (functional outcome) and cosmetic outcome according to Flynn’s criteria. This systematic review was conducted based on PRISMA and Cochrane handbook guidelines.  Results: Our initial search yielded 163 studies, from which we included five comparative studies comprising 231 children in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.69, 95% CI [0.97-2.93]) and good (OR 1.12, 95% CI [0.61-2.04]) functional outcomes and less likely to result in fair (OR 0.84, 95% CI [0.34-2.13]) and poor (OR 0.42, 95% CI [0.1-1.73]) functional outcomes compared to the posterior approach. In terms of cosmetic results, both approaches showed mixed findings. The lateral approach was more likely to result in excellent (OR 1.11, 95% CI [0.61-2.02]) and fair (OR 1.18, 95% CI [0.49-2.80]) but less likely to result in good (OR 0.79, 95% CI [0.40-1.55]) cosmetic outcomes. However, none of these analyses were statistically significant (p> 0.05).  Conclusion: Lateral and posterior surgical approaches resulted in satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcomes. The two approaches are comparable for treating SHF in children when evaluated with Flynn’s criteria.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of disease modifying therapies on immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Four hundred seventy-three people with MS provided one or more dried blood spot samples. Information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccine history, medical, and drug history were extracted from questionnaires and medical records. Dried blood spots were eluted and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody titers were partitioned into tertiles with people on no disease modifying therapy as a reference. We calculated the odds ratio of seroconversion (univariate logistic regression) and compared quantitative vaccine response (Kruskal Wallis) following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine according to disease modifying therapy. We used regression modeling to explore the effect of vaccine timing, treatment duration, age, vaccine type, and lymphocyte count on vaccine response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio = 0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01–0.06, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01–0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. All other drugs did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Both time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly associated with the response to the vaccination. The vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. Preliminary data on cellular T-cell immunity showed 40% of seronegative subjects had measurable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some disease modifying therapies convey risk of attenuated serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neural circuit for flexible control of persistent behavioral states</a></h4>

              
                To adapt to their environments, animals must generate behaviors that are closely aligned to a rapidly changing sensory world. However, behavioral states such as foraging or courtship typically persist over long time scales to ensure proper execution. It remains unclear how neural circuits generate persistent behavioral states while maintaining the flexibility to select among alternative states when the sensory context changes. Here, we elucidate the functional architecture of a neural circuit controlling the choice between roaming and dwelling states, which underlie exploration and exploitation during foraging in <i>C. elegans</i>. By imaging ensemble-level neural activity in freely-moving animals, we identify stereotyped changes in circuit activity corresponding to each behavioral state. Combining circuit-wide imaging with genetic analysis, we find that mutual inhibition between two antagonistic neuromodulatory systems underlies the persistence and mutual exclusivity of the neural activity patterns observed in each state. Through machine learning analysis and circuit perturbations, we identify a sensory processing neuron that can transmit information about food odors to both the roaming and dwelling circuits and bias the animal towards different states in different sensory contexts, giving rise to context-appropriate state transitions. Our findings reveal a potentially general circuit architecture that enables flexible, sensory-driven control of persistent behavioral states.

                Agricultural soil harbors a diverse microbiome that can form beneficial relationships with plants, including the inhibition of plant pathogens. <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. are one of the most abundant bacterial genera in the soil and rhizosphere and play important roles in promoting plant health. However, the genetic determinants of this beneficial activity are only partially understood. Here, we genetically and phenotypically characterize the <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> population in a commercial potato field, where we identify strong correlations between specialized metabolite biosynthesis and antagonism of the potato pathogens <i>Streptomyces scabies</i> and <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Genetic and chemical analyses identified hydrogen cyanide and cyclic lipopeptides as key specialized metabolites associated with <i>S. scabies</i> inhibition, which was supported by <i>in planta</i> biocontrol experiments. We show that a single potato field contains a hugely diverse and dynamic population of <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria, whose capacity to produce specialized metabolites is shaped both by plant colonization and defined environmental inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct higher-order representations of natural sounds in human and ferret auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Little is known about how neural representations of natural sounds differ across species. For example, speech and music play a unique role in human hearing, yet it is unclear how auditory representations of speech and music differ between humans and other animals. Using functional ultrasound imaging, we measured responses in ferrets to a set of natural and spectrotemporally matched synthetic sounds previously tested in humans. Ferrets showed similar lower-level frequency and modulation tuning to that observed in humans. But while humans showed substantially larger responses to natural vs. synthetic speech and music in non-primary regions, ferret responses to natural and synthetic sounds were closely matched throughout primary and non-primary auditory cortex, even when tested with ferret vocalizations. This finding reveals that auditory representations in humans and ferrets diverge sharply at late stages of cortical processing, potentially driven by higher-order processing demands in speech and music.

                The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and median raphe nucleus (MR) contain populations of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons that regulate diverse behavioral functions. However, their whole-brain input-output circuits remain incompletely elucidated. We used viral tracing combined with fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography to generate a comprehensive whole-brain atlas of inputs and outputs of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the DR and MR. We found that these neurons received inputs from similar upstream brain regions. The glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus had divergent projection patterns with differences in critical brain regions. Specifically, MR glutamatergic neurons projected to the lateral habenula through multiple pathways. Correlation and cluster analysis revealed that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the same raphe nucleus received heterogeneous inputs and sent different collateral projections. This connectivity atlas further elucidates the anatomical architecture of the raphe nuclei, which could facilitate better understanding of their behavioral functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hydrogen sulfide blocks HIV rebound by maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental challenge in HIV eradication is to understand how the virus establishes latency, maintains stable cellular reservoirs, and promotes rebound upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in HIV latency and reactivation. We show that reactivation of HIV-1 is associated with down-regulation of the key H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzyme cystathionine-g-lyase (CTH) and reduction in endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S. Genetic silencing of CTH disrupts redox homeostasis, impairs mitochondrial function, and remodels the transcriptome of latent cells to trigger HIV reactivation. Chemical complementation of CTH activity using a slow-releasing H<sub>2</sub>S donor, GYY4137, suppressed HIV reactivation and diminished virus replication. Mechanistically, GYY4137 blocked HIV reactivation by inducing the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting NF-kB, and recruiting the epigenetic silencer, YY1, to the HIV promoter. In latently infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from ART-suppressed human subjects, GYY4137 in combination with ART prevented viral rebound and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, prolonged exposure to GYY4137 exhibited no adverse influence on proviral content or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, indicating that diminished viral rebound is due to a loss of transcription rather than a selective loss of infected cells. In summary, this work provides mechanistic insight into H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated suppression of viral rebound and suggests exploration of H<sub>2</sub>S donors to maintain HIV in a latent form.

                Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. Even though great advances in the last decades have allowed better delineation of its pathogenetic mechanisms, its cellular and molecular bases are still poorly understood. To evaluate the consequences of chromosome aneuploidy on the hippocampus, we analyzed single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of the DS mouse model Ts65Dn. Our data revealed abnormal cell composition specifically of the Ts65Dn dentate gyrus and of specific subtypes of interneurons, without major changes in CA1 or CA3. We found that trisomy results in a highly cell-type specific global alteration of the transcriptome and detected previously undefined differentially expressed genes in specific neuronal populations. We identified the long-non-coding gene Snhg11 to be specifically downregulated in the trisomic dentate gyrus and provide evidence for its involvement in hippocampal-dependent cognitive phenotypes, possibly contributed by impaired adult neurogenesis.

                Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging flavivirus of global concern. ZIKV infection of the central nervous system has been linked to a variety of clinical syndromes, including microcephaly in fetuses and rare but serious neurologic disease in adults. However, the potential for ZIKV to influence brain physiology and host behavior following recovery from apparently mild or subclinical infection is less well understood. Furthermore, though deficits in cognitive function are well-documented following recovery from neuroinvasive viral infection, the potential impact of ZIKV on other host behavioral domains has not been thoroughly explored. In our study, we performed transcriptomic profiling of primary neuron cultures following ZIKV infection, which revealed altered expression of key genes associated with major psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Gene ontology enrichment analysis also revealed significant changes in gene expression associated with fundamental neurobiological processes, including neuronal development, neurotransmission, and others. These alterations to neurologic gene expression were also observed in the brain in vivo using an immunocompetent mouse model of ZIKV infection. Mechanistic studies identified TNF- signaling via TNFR1 as a major regulatory mechanism controlling ZIKV-induced changes to neurologic gene expression. Our studies reveal that cell-intrinsic innate immune responses to ZIKV infection profoundly shape neuronal transcriptional profiles, highlighting the need to further explore associations between ZIKV infection and disordered host behavioral states.

                Identical stimuli can be perceived or go unnoticed across successive presentations, producing divergent behavioral readouts despite similarities in sensory input. We hypothesized that fluctuations in neurophysiological states in the sensory neocortex, which could alter cortical processing at the level of neural subpopulations, underlies this perceptual variability. We analyzed cortical layer-specific electrophysiological activity in visual area V4 during a cued attention task. We find that hit trials are characterized by a larger pupil diameter and lower incidence of microsaccades, indicative of a behavioral state with increased arousal and perceptual stability. Target stimuli presented at perceptual threshold evoke elevated multi-unit activity in V4 neurons in hit trials compared to miss trials, across all cortical layers. Putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons are strongly positively modulated in the input (IV) and deep (V & VI) layers of the cortex during hit trials. Excitatory neurons in the superficial cortical layers exhibit lower variability in hit trials. Deep layer neurons are less phase-locked to low frequency rhythms in hits. Hits are also characterized by greater interlaminar coherence between the superficial and deep layers in the pre-stimulus period, and a complementary pattern between the input layer and both the superficial and deep layers in the stimulus-evoked period. Taken together, these results indicate that a state of elevated levels of arousal and perceptual stability allow enhanced processing of sensory stimuli, which contributes to hits at perceptual threshold.

                Memories are multifaceted and layered, incorporating external stimuli and internal states, and at multiple levels of resolution. Although the hippocampus is essential for memory, it remains unclear if distinct aspects of experience are encoded within different hippocampal subnetworks during learning. By tracking the same dCA1 or vCA1 neurons across cue-outcome learning, we find detailed and externally based (stimulus identity) representations in dCA1, and broad and internally based (stimulus relevance) signals in vCA1 that emerge with learning. These dorsoventral differences were observed regardless of cue modality or outcome valence, and representations within each region were largely stable for days after learning. These results identify how the hippocampus encodes associative memories, and show that hippocampal ensembles not only link experiences, but also imbue relationships with meaning and highlight behaviorally relevant information. Together, these complementary dynamics across hippocampal subnetworks allow for rich, diverse representation of experiences.

                Brain oscillations are considered to play a pivotal role in neural communication. However, detailed information regarding the typical oscillatory patterns of individual brain regions is surprisingly scarce. In this study we applied a multivariate data-driven approach to create an atlas of the natural frequencies of the resting human brain on a voxel-by-voxel basis. We analysed resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 128 healthy adult volunteers obtained from the Open MEG Archive (OMEGA). Spectral power was computed in source space in 500 ms steps for 82 frequency bins logarithmically spaced from 1.7 to 99.5 Hz. We then applied k-means clustering to detect characteristic spectral profiles and to eventually identify the natural frequency of each voxel. Our results revealed a region-specific organisation of intrinsic oscillatory activity, following both a medial-to-lateral and a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasing frequency. In particular, medial fronto-temporal regions were characterised by slow rhythms (delta/theta). Posterior regions presented natural frequencies in the alpha band, although with differentiated generators in the precuneus and in sensory-specific cortices (i.e., visual and auditory). Somatomotor regions were distinguished by the mu rhythm, while the lateral prefrontal cortex was characterised by oscillations in the high beta range (>20 Hz). Importantly, the brain map of natural frequencies was highly replicable in two independent subsamples of individuals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive atlas of ongoing oscillatory activity performed to date. Furthermore, the identification of natural frequencies is a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the functional architecture of the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anticipatory dynamics in the human brain guide foraging for primary rewards</a></h4>

              
                Foraging is a fundamental food-seeking behavior in a wide range of species that enables survival in an uncertain world. During foraging, behavioral agents constantly face a trade-off between staying in their current location or exploring another. Despite ethological generality and importance of foraging, it remains unclear how the human brain guides continuous decision in such situations. Here we show that anticipatory activity dynamics in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) and hippocampus underpin foraging for primary rewards. While functional MRI was performed, humans foraged for real liquid rewards available after tens of seconds, and continuous decision during foraging was tracked by a dynamic pattern of brain activity that reflected anticipation of a future reward. When the dynamic anticipatory activity in the aPFC was enhanced, humans remained in their current environment, but when this activity diminished, they explored a new environment. Moreover, the anticipatory activity in the aPFC and hippocampus was associated with distinct decision strategies: aPFC activity was enhanced in humans adopting an exploratory strategy, whereas those remaining stationary showed enhanced activity in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that anticipatory dynamics in the fronto-hippocampal mechanisms underlie continuous decision-making during human foraging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Mechanisms of Learning are Critically Dependent on Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep supports memory consolidation as well as next-day learning. The Active Systems account of offline consolidation suggests that sleep-associated memory processing paves the way for new learning, but empirical evidence in support of this idea is scarce. Using a within-subjects, crossover design, we assessed behavioural and electrophysiological indices of episodic encoding after a night of sleep or total sleep deprivation in healthy adult humans (aged 18-25 years), and investigated whether the behavioural measures were predicted by the overnight consolidation of episodic associations formed the previous day. Sleep supported memory consolidation and next-day learning, as compared to sleep deprivation. However, the magnitude of this sleep-associated consolidation benefit did not significantly predict the ability to form novel memories after sleep. Interestingly, sleep deprivation prompted a qualitative change in the neural signature of encoding: whereas 12-20 Hz beta desynchronization - an established EEG marker of successful encoding - was observed after sleep, sleep deprivation disrupted beta desynchrony during successful learning. Taken together, our findings suggest that effective learning mechanisms are critically dependent on sleep, but not necessarily sleep-associated consolidation.

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to record the brain’s evoked and induced electrical activity from the scalp. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, are increasingly being applied to EEG data for pattern analysis, group membership classification, and brain-computer interface purposes. This study aimed to systematically review recent advances in ML and DL supervised models for decoding and classifying EEG signals. Moreover, this article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques used for EEG signal preprocessing and feature extraction. To this end, several academic databases were searched to explore relevant studies from the year 2000 to the present. Our results showed that the application of ML and DL in both mental workload and motor imagery tasks has received substantial attention in recent years. A total of 75% of DL studies applied convolutional neural networks with various learning algorithms, and 36% of ML studies achieved competitive accuracy by using a support vector machine algorithm. Wavelet transform was found to be the most common feature extraction method used for all types of tasks. We further examined the specific feature extraction methods and end classifier recommendations discovered in this systematic review.</p>

	<p>In the present study, we investigated if individuals with neurogenic speech sound impairments of three types, Parkinson’s dysarthria, apraxia of speech, and aphasic phonological impairment, accommodate their speech to the natural speech rhythm of an auditory model, and if so, whether the effect is more significant after hearing metrically regular sentences as compared to those with an irregular pattern. This question builds on theories of rhythmic entrainment, assuming that sensorimotor predictions of upcoming events allow humans to synchronize their actions with an external rhythm. To investigate entrainment effects, we conducted a sentence completion task relating participants’ response latencies to the spoken rhythm of the prime heard immediately before. A further research question was if the perceived rhythm interacts with the rhythm of the participants’ own productions, i.e., the trochaic or iambic stress pattern of disyllabic target words. For a control group of healthy speakers, our study revealed evidence for entrainment when trochaic target words were preceded by regularly stressed prime sentences. Persons with Parkinson’s dysarthria showed a pattern similar to that of the healthy individuals. For the patient groups with apraxia of speech and with phonological impairment, considerably longer response latencies with differing patterns were observed. Trochaic target words were initiated with significantly shorter latencies, whereas the metrical regularity of prime sentences had no consistent impact on response latencies and did not interact with the stress pattern of the target words to be produced. The absence of an entrainment in these patients may be explained by the more severe difficulties in initiating speech at all. We discuss the results in terms of clinical implications for diagnostics and therapy in neurogenic speech disorders.</p>

	<p>We aim to investigate whether EEG dynamics differ in adults with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) and ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) compared with healthy subjects during the performance of an innovative cognitive task, Aristotle’s valid and invalid syllogisms, and how these differences correlate with brain regions and behavioral data for each subject. We recorded EEGs from 14 scalp electrodes (channels) in 21 adults with ADHD, 21 with ASD, and 21 healthy, normal subjects. The subjects were exposed in a set of innovative cognitive tasks (inducing varying cognitive loads), Aristotle’s two types of syllogism mentioned above. A set of 39 questions were given to participants related to valid–invalid syllogisms as well as a separate set of questionnaires, in order to collect a number of demographic and behavioral data, with the aim of detecting shared information with values of a feature extracted from EEG, the multiscale entropy (MSE), in the 14 channels (‘brain regions’). MSE, a nonlinear information-theoretic measure of complexity, was computed to extract a feature that quantifies the complexity of the EEG. Behavior-Partial Least Squares Correlation, PLSC, is the method to detect the correlation between two sets of data, brain, and behavioral measures. -PLSC, a variant of PLSC, was applied to build a functional connectivity of the brain regions involved in the reasoning tasks. Graph-theoretic measures were used to quantify the complexity of the functional networks. Based on the results of the analysis described in this work, a mixed 14 × 2 × 3 ANOVA showed significant main effects of&amp;amp;nbsp;group factor and brain region* syllogism&amp;amp;nbsp;factor, as well as a significant brain region* group interaction. There are significant differences between the means of MSE (complexity) values at the 14 channels of the members of the ‘pathological’ groups of participants, i.e., between ASD and ADHD, while the difference in means of MSE between both ASD and ADHD and that of the control group is not significant. In conclusion, the valid–invalid type of syllogism generates significantly different complexity values, MSE, between ASD and ADHD. The complexity of activated brain regions of ASD participants increased significantly when switching from a valid to an invalid syllogism, indicating the need for more resources to ‘face’ the task escalating difficulty in ASD subjects. This increase is not so evident in both ADHD and control. Statistically significant differences were found also in the behavioral response of ASD and ADHD, compared with those of control subjects, based on the principal brain and behavior saliences extracted by PLSC. Specifically, two behavioral measures, the emotional state and the degree of confidence of participants in answering questions in Aristotle’s valid–invalid syllogisms, and one demographic variable, age, statistically and significantly discriminate the three groups’ ASD. The seed-PLC generated functional connectivity networks for ASD, ADHD, and control, were ‘projected’ on the regions of the Default Mode Network (DMN), the ‘reference’ connectivity, of which the structural changes were found significant in distinguishing the three groups. The contribution of this work lies in the examination of the relationship between brain activity and behavioral responses of healthy and ‘pathological’ participants in the case of cognitive reasoning of the type of Aristotle’s valid and invalid syllogisms, using PLSC, a machine learning approach combined with MSE, a nonlinear method of extracting a feature based on EEGs that captures a broad spectrum of EEGs linear and nonlinear characteristics. The results seem promising in adopting this type of reasoning, in the future, after further enhancements and experimental tests, as a supplementary instrument towards examining the differences in brain activity and behavioral responses of ASD and ADHD patients. The application of the combination of these two methods, after further elaboration and testing as new and complementary to the existing ones, may be considered as a tool of analysis in helping detecting more effectively such types of disorders.</p>

	<p>System-specific brain responses—time-locked to rapid eye movements (REMs) in sleep—are characteristically widespread, with robust and clear activation in the primary visual cortex and other structures involved in multisensory integration. This pattern suggests that REMs underwrite hierarchical processing of visual information in a time-locked manner, where REMs index the generation and scanning of virtual-world models, through multisensory integration in dreaming—as in awake states. Default mode network (DMN) activity increases during rest and reduces during various tasks including visual perception. The implicit anticorrelation between the DMN and task-positive network (TPN)—that persists in REM sleep—prompted us to focus on DMN responses to temporally-precise REM events. We timed REMs during sleep from the video recordings and quantified the neural correlates of REMs—using functional MRI (fMRI)—in 24 independent studies of 11 healthy participants. A reanalysis of these data revealed that the cortical areas exempt from widespread REM-locked brain activation were restricted to the DMN. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a modest temporally-precise REM-locked decrease—phasic deactivation—in key DMN nodes, in a subset of independent studies. These results are consistent with hierarchical predictive coding; namely, permissive deactivation of DMN at the top of the hierarchy (leading to the widespread cortical activation at lower levels; especially the primary visual cortex). Additional findings indicate REM-locked cerebral vasodilation and suggest putative mechanisms for dream forgetting.</p>

	<p>Background: as the most common malignancy of the central nervous system, low-grade glioma (LGG) patients suffered a poor prognosis. Tumor microenvironment, especially immune components, plays an important role in the progression of tumors. Thus, it is critical to explore the key immune-related genes, a comprehensive understanding of the TME in LGG helps us find novel cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: the GPSM3 expression level and the correlations between clinical characteristics and GPSM3 levels were analyzed with the data from CGGA and TCGA dataset. Univariate and multivariate cox regression model were built to predict the prognosis of LGG patients with multiple factors. Then the correlation between GPSM3 with immune cell infiltration was explored by ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and TIMER2.0. At last, the correlation analyzed between GPSM3 expression and immune checkpoint related genes were also analyzed. Results: GPSM3 expression was overexpressed in LGG and negatively correlated to the GPSM3 DNA methylation. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that GPSM3 expression was an independent prognostic factor in LGG patients. Functional characterization of GPSM3 revealed that it was associated with many immune processes to tumor cells. GPSM3 expression was positive related to the immune score, Stromal scores and ESTIMATE scores, but negative related to the Tumor purity. Immune features in the TME of GPSM3-high LGG group is characterized by a higher infiltrating of regulatory T cells, neutrophils, macrophages M2, and a lower proportion of monocytes than to the GPSM3-low group. Furthermore, GPSM3 expression exhibited significant correlations with the immune checkpoint-related genes, especially PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4 and TIM3. Conclusions: these findings proved that GPSM3 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential immunotherapy target for LGG.</p>

	<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are used in clinical and cognitive neuroscience to induce a mild magnetic or electric field in the brain to modulate behavior and cortical activation. Despite the great body of literature demonstrating promising results, unexpected or even paradoxical outcomes are sometimes observed. This might be due either to technical and methodological issues (e.g., stimulation parameters, stimulated brain area), or to participants’ expectations and beliefs before and during the stimulation sessions. In this narrative review, we present some studies showing that placebo and nocebo effects, associated with positive and negative expectations, respectively, could be present in NIBS trials, both in experimental and in clinical settings. The lack of systematic evaluation of subjective expectations and beliefs before and after stimulation could represent a caveat that overshadows the potential contribution of placebo and nocebo effects in the outcome of NIBS trials.</p>

	<p>An increasing number of people around the world communicate in more than one language, resulting in them having to make decisions in a foreign language on a daily basis. Interestingly, a burgeoning body of literature suggests that people’s decision-making is affected by whether they are reasoning in their native language (NL) or their foreign language (FL). According to the foreign language effect (FLe), people are less susceptible to bias in many decision-making tasks and more likely to display utilitarian cost-benefit analysis in moral decision-making when reasoning in a FL. While these differences have often been attributed to a reduced emotionality in the FL, an emerging body of literature has started to test the extent to which these could be attributable to increased deliberation in the FL. The present study tests whether increased deliberation leads to a FLe on cognitive reflection in a population of older adults (Mage = 65.1), from the successful aging project in Umeå, Sweden. We explored whether performance on a 6-item version of the cognitive reflection test (CRT) adapted to Swedish would differ between participants for whom Swedish was their NL and those for whom Swedish was their FL. The CRT is a task designed to elicit an incorrect, intuitive answer. In order to override the intuitive answer, one requires engaging in deliberative, analytical thinking to determine the correct answer. Therefore, we hypothesized that if thinking in a FL increases deliberation, then those performing the task in their FL would exhibit higher accuracy rates than those performing in their NL. Our results showed that age and level of education predicted performance on the task but performance on the CRT did not differ between the NL and the FL groups. In addition, in the FL group, proficiency in the FL was not related to performance in the CRT. Our results, therefore, do not provide evidence that thinking in a FL increases deliberation in a group of older adults performing a logical reasoning task that is not typically associated with an emotional connotation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">From Progenitors to Progeny: Shaping Striatal Circuit Development and Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding how neurons of the striatum are formed and integrate into complex synaptic circuits is essential to provide insight into striatal function in health and disease. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the development of striatal neurons and associated circuits with a focus on their embryonic origin. Specifically, we address the role of distinct types of embryonic progenitors, found in the proliferative zones of the ganglionic eminences in the ventral telencephalon, in the generation of diverse striatal interneurons and projection neurons. Indeed, recent evidence would suggest that embryonic progenitor origin dictates key characteristics of postnatal cells, including their neurochemical content, their location within striatum, and their long-range synaptic inputs. We also integrate recent observations regarding embryonic progenitors in cortical and other regions and discuss how this might inform future research on the ganglionic eminences. Last, we examine how embryonic progenitor dysfunction can alter striatal formation, as exemplified in Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorder, and how increased understanding of embryonic progenitors can have significant implications for future research directions and the development of improved therapeutic options.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This review highlights recently defined novel roles for embryonic progenitor cells in shaping the functional properties of both projection neurons and interneurons of the striatum. It outlines the developmental mechanisms that guide neuronal development from progenitors in the embryonic ganglionic eminences to progeny in the striatum. Where questions remain open, we integrate observations from cortex and other regions to present possible avenues for future research. Last, we provide a progenitor-centric perspective onto both Huntington's disease and autism spectrum disorder. We suggest that future investigations and manipulations of embryonic progenitor cells in both research and clinical settings will likely require careful consideration of their great intrinsic diversity and neurogenic potential.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Glycine Release Is Potentiated by cAMP via EPAC2 and Ca2+ Stores in a Retinal Interneuron</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuromodulation via the intracellular second messenger cAMP is ubiquitous at presynaptic nerve terminals. This modulation of synaptic transmission allows exocytosis to adapt to stimulus levels and reliably encode information. The AII amacrine cell (AII-AC) is a central hub for signal processing in the mammalian retina. The main apical dendrite of the AII-AC is connected to several lobular appendages that release glycine onto OFF cone bipolar cells and ganglion cells. However, the influence of cAMP on glycine release is not well understood. Using membrane capacitance measurements from mouse AII-ACs to directly measure exocytosis, we observe that intracellular dialysis of 1 m<scp>m</scp> cAMP enhances exocytosis without affecting the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Responses to depolarizing pulses of various durations show that the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles nearly doubles with cAMP, while paired-pulse depression experiments suggest that release probability does not change. Specific agonists and antagonists for exchange protein activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2) revealed that the cAMP-induced enhancement of exocytosis requires EPAC2 activation. Furthermore, intact Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores were also necessary for the cAMP potentiation of exocytosis. Postsynaptic recordings from OFF cone bipolar cells showed that increasing cAMP with forskolin potentiated the frequency of glycinergic spontaneous IPSCs. We propose that cAMP elevations in the AII-AC lead to a robust enhancement of glycine release through an EPAC2 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> store signaling pathway. Our results thus contribute to a better understanding of how AII-AC crossover inhibitory circuits adapt to changes in ambient luminance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian retina operates over a wide dynamic range of light intensities and contrast levels. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of processed visual information, both excitatory and inhibitory synapses within the retina must modulate their gain in synaptic transmission to adapt to different levels of ambient light. Here we show that increases of cAMP concentration within AII amacrine cells produce enhanced exocytosis from these glycinergic interneurons. Therefore, we propose that light-sensitive neuromodulators may change the output of glycine release from AII amacrine cells. This novel mechanism may fine-tune the amount of tonic and phasic synaptic inhibition received by bipolar cell terminals and, consequently, the spiking patterns that ganglion cells send to the upstream visual areas of the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Endocannabinoids Tune Intrinsic Excitability in O-LM Interneurons by Direct Modulation of Postsynaptic Kv7 Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>KCNQ-Kv7 channels are found at the axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons, where they control cell firing and membrane potential. In oriens lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, these channels are mainly expressed in the dendrites, suggesting a peculiar function of Kv7 channels in these neurons. Here, we show that Kv7 channel activity is upregulated following induction of presynaptic long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in O-LM interneurons from rats of both sex, thus resulting in a synergistic long-term depression of intrinsic excitability (LTD-IE). Both LTD and LTD-IE involve endocannabinoid (eCB) biosynthesis for induction. However, although LTD is dependent on cannabinoid type 1 receptors, LTD-IE is not. Molecular modeling shows a strong interaction of eCBs with Kv7.2/3 channel, suggesting a persistent action of these lipids on Kv7 channel activity. Our data thus unveil a major role for eCB synthesis in triggering both synaptic and intrinsic depression in O-LM interneurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In principal cells, Kv7 channels are essentially located at the axon initial segment. In contrast, in O-LM interneurons, Kv7 channels are highly expressed in the dendrites, suggesting a singular role of these channels in O-LM cell function. Here, we show that LTD of excitatory inputs in O-LM interneurons is associated with an upregulation of Kv7 channels, thus resulting in a synergistic LTD of LTD-IE. Both forms of plasticity are mediated by the biosynthesis of eCBs. Stimulation of CB1 receptors induces LTD, whereas the direct interaction of eCBs with Kv7 channels induces LTD-IE. Our results thus provide a previously unexpected involvement of eCBs in long-lasting plasticity of intrinsic excitability in GABAergic interneurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neurokinin B-Expressing Neurons of the Central Extended Amygdala Mediate Inhibitory Synaptic Input onto Melanin-Concentrating Hormone Neuron Subpopulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) is a highly conserved brain region critical for maintaining physiological homeostasis and goal-directed behavior. LHA neurons that express melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are key regulators of arousal, energy balance, and motivated behavior. However, cellular and functional diversity among LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons is not well understood. Previous anatomic and molecular data suggest that LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons may be parsed into at least two distinct subpopulations, one of which is enriched in neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R), the receptor for neurokinin B (NKB), encoded by the <I>Tac2</I> gene. This tachykininergic ligand-receptor system has been implicated in reproduction, fear memory, and stress in other brain regions, but NKB interactions with LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons are poorly understood. We first identified how LHA<sup>MCH</sup> subpopulations may be distinguished anatomically and electrophysiologically. To dissect functional connectivity between NKB-expressing neurons and LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons, we used Cre-dependent retrograde and anterograde viral tracing in male <I>Tac2-</I>Cre mice and identified <I>Tac2</I>/EYFP+ neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala, the central extended amygdala, as major sources of NKB input onto LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons. In addition to innervating the LHA, these limbic forebrain NKB neurons also project to midbrain and brainstem targets. Finally, using a dual-virus approach, we found that optogenetic activation of these inputs in slices evokes GABA release onto a subset of LHA<sup>MCH</sup> neurons but lacked specificity for the NK3R+ subpopulation. Overall, these data define parallel tachykininergic/GABAergic limbic forebrain projections that are positioned to modulate multiple nodes of homeostatic and behavioral control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The LHA orchestrates fundamental behavioral states in the mammalian hypothalamus, including arousal, energy balance, memory, stress, and motivated behavior. The neuropeptide MCH defines one prominent population of LHA neurons, with multiple roles in the regulation of homeostatic behavior. Outstanding questions remain concerning the upstream inputs that control MCH neurons. We sought to define neurochemically distinct pathways in the mouse brain that may communicate with specific MCH neuron subpopulations using viral-based retrograde and anterograde neural pathway tracing and optogenetics in brain slices. Here, we identify a specific neuropeptide-defined forebrain circuit that makes functional synaptic connections with MCH neuron subpopulations. This work lays the foundation for further manipulating molecularly distinct neural circuits that modulate innate behavioral states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dissociated Role of Thalamic and Cortical Input to the Lateral Amygdala for Consolidation of Long-Term Fear Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Post-encoding coordinated reactivation of memory traces distributed throughout interconnected brain regions is thought to be critical for consolidation of memories. However, little is known about the role of neural circuit pathways during post-learning periods for consolidation of memories. To investigate this question, we optogenetically silenced the inputs from both auditory cortex and thalamus in the lateral amygdala (LA) for 15 min immediately following auditory fear conditioning (FC) and examined its effect on fear memory formation in mice of both sexes. Optogenetic inhibition of both inputs disrupted long-term fear memory formation tested 24 h after FC. This effect was specific such that the same inhibition did not affect short-term memory and context-dependent memory. Moreover, long-term memory was intact if the inputs were inhibited at much later time points after FC (3 h or 1 d after FC), indicating that optical inhibition for 15 min itself does not produce any nonspecific deleterious effect on fear memory retrieval. Selective inhibition of thalamic input was sufficient to impair consolidation of auditory fear memory. In contrast, selective inhibition of cortical input disrupted remote fear memory without affecting recent memory. These results reveal a dissociated role of thalamic and cortical input to the LA during early post-learning periods for consolidation of long-term fear memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coordinated communications between brain regions are thought to be essential during post-learning periods for consolidation of memories. However, the role of specific neural circuit pathways in this process has been scarcely explored. Using a precise optogenetic inhibition of auditory input pathways, either thalamic or cortical or both, to the LA during post-training periods, we here show that thalamic input is required for consolidation of both recent and remote fear memory, whereas cortical input is crucial for consolidation of remote fear memory. These results reveal a dissociated role of auditory input pathways to the LA for consolidation of long-term fear memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Constructing Others' Beliefs from One's Own Using Medial Frontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many daily choices are based on one's own knowledge. However, when predicting other people's behavior, we need to consider the differences between our knowledge and other people's presumed knowledge. Social agents need a mechanism to use privileged information for their own behavior but exclude it from predictions of others. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural implementation of such social and personal predictions in healthy human volunteers of both sexes by manipulating privileged and shared information. The medial frontal cortex appeared to have an important role in flexibly making decisions using privileged information for oneself or predicting others' behavior. Specifically, we show that ventromedial PFC tracked the state of the world independent of the type of decision (personal, social), whereas dorsomedial regions adjusted their frame of reference to the use of privileged or shared information. Sampling privileged evidence not available to another person also relied on specific interactions between temporoparietal junction area and frontal pole.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> What we know about the minds of others and how we use that information is crucial to understanding social interaction. Mentalizing, or reading the minds of others, is argued to be particularly well developed in the human and crucially affected in some disorders. However, the intractable nature of human interactions makes it very difficult to study these processes. Here, we present a way to objectively quantify the information people have about others and to investigate how their brain deals with this information. This shows that people use similar areas in the brain related to nonsocial decision-making when making decisions in social situations and modify this information processing by the knowledge about others use these to modify their information processing according to the knowledge of others.</p>

However, evidence is mixed on whether and how such excitability enhancement modulates sensory signals of interest versus noise differently, and what, if any, are the consequences for subsequent perception. Here, human subjects (male and female) performed a visual detection task in which we manipulated their decision criteria in a blockwise manner. Although our manipulation led to substantial criterion shifts, these shifts were not reflected in prestimulus alpha band changes. Rather, lower prestimulus alpha power in occipital-parietal areas improved perceptual sensitivity and enhanced information content decodable from neural activity patterns. Additionally, oscillatory alpha phase immediately before stimulus presentation modulated accuracy. Together, our results suggest that alpha band dynamics modulate sensory signals of interest more strongly than noise.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The internal state of our brain fluctuates, giving rise to variability in perception and action. Neural oscillations, most prominently in the alpha band, have been suggested to play a role in setting this internal state. Here, we show that ongoing alpha band activity in occipital-parietal regions predicts the quality of visual information decodable in neural activity patterns and subsequently the human observer's sensitivity in a visual detection task. Our results provide comprehensive evidence that visual representation is modulated by ongoing alpha band activity and advance our understanding on how, when faced with unchanging external stimuli, internal neural fluctuations influence perception and behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Awareness-Dependent Normalization Framework of Visual Bottom-up Attention</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although bottom-up attention can improve visual performance with and without awareness to the exogenous cue, whether they are governed by a common neural computation remains unclear. Using a modified Posner paradigm with backward masking, we found that the cueing effect displayed a monotonic gradient profile (Gaussian-like), both with and without awareness, whose scope, however, was significantly wider with than without awareness. This awareness-dependent scope offered us a unique opportunity to change the relative size of the attention field to the stimulus, differentially modulating the gain of attentional selection, as proposed by the normalization model of attention. Therefore, for each human subject (male and female), the stimulus size was manipulated as their respective mean attention fields with and without awareness while stimulus contrast was varied in a spatial cueing task. By measuring the gain pattern of contrast-response functions on the spatial cueing effect derived by visible or invisible cues, we observed changes in the cueing effect consonant with changes in contrast gain for visible cues and response gain for invisible cues. Importantly, a complementary analysis confirmed that subjects' awareness-dependent attention fields can be simulated by using the normalization model of attention. Together, our findings indicate an awareness-dependent normalization framework of visual bottom-up attention, placing a necessary constraint, namely, awareness, on our understanding of the neural computations underlying visual attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bottom-up attention is known to improve visual performance with and without awareness. We discovered that manipulating subjects' awareness can modulate their attention fields of visual bottom-up attention, which offers a unique opportunity to regulate its normalization processes. On the one hand, by measuring the gain pattern of contrast-response functions on the spatial cueing effect derived by visible or invisible cues, we observed changes in the cueing effect consonant with changes in contrast gain for visible cues and response gain for invisible cues. On the other hand, by using the normalization model of attention, subjects' awareness-dependent attention fields can be simulated successfully. Our study supports important predictions of the normalization model of visual bottom-up attention and further reveals its dependence on awareness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Memory Reactivation during Sleep Improves Execution of a Challenging Motor Skill</a></h4>

              
                <p>Memory reactivation during sleep reinforces various types of learning. Basic motor skills likely benefit from sleep. There is insufficient evidence, however, on whether memory reactivation during sleep contributes to learning how to execute a novel action. Here, we investigated motor learning in a myoelectric feedback task. Human male and female participants learned to control myoelectric activity in specific arm muscles to move a computer cursor to each of 16 locations. Each location was associated with a unique sound. Half of the sounds were played during slow-wave sleep to reactivate corresponding memories of muscle control. After sleep, movements cued during sleep were performed more quickly and efficiently than uncued movements. These results demonstrated that memory reactivation during sleep contributes to learning of action execution. We conclude that sleep supports learning novel actions, which also maps onto the learning required in certain neurorehabilitation procedures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior literature on motor learning has produced much evidence supporting a role for sleep but scant evidence on the execution component. This aspect of learning is critical for many complex skills that people value in their lives. Our results not only implicate sleep in skill learning but also pinpoint a benefit for motor execution using a method for modifying memory storage during sleep. We used targeted memory reactivation (TMR), whereby a stimulus that has been associated with learning is presented again during sleep to bring on a recapitulation of waking brain activity. Our demonstration that memory reactivation contributed to skilled performance may be relevant for neurorehabilitation as well as fields concerned with motor learning, such as kinesiology and physiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampus-Prefrontal Coupling Regulates Recognition Memory for Novelty Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recognition memory provides the ability to distinguish familiar from novel objects and places, and is important for recording and updating events to guide appropriate behavior. The hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have both been implicated in recognition memory, but the nature of HPC&ndash;mPFC interactions, and its impact on local circuits in mediating this process is not known. Here we show that novelty discrimination is accompanied with higher theta activity (4&ndash;10 Hz) and increased c-Fos expression in both these regions. Moreover, theta oscillations were highly coupled between the HPC and mPFC during recognition memory retrieval for novelty discrimination, with the HPC leading the mPFC, but not during initial learning. Principal neurons and interneurons in the mPFC responded more strongly during recognition memory retrieval compared with learning. Optogenetic silencing of HPC input to the mPFC disrupted coupled theta activity between these two structures, as well as the animals' (male Sprague Dawley rats) ability to differentiate novel from familiar objects. These results reveal a key role of monosynaptic connections between the HPC and mPFC in novelty discrimination via theta coupling and identify neural populations that underlie this recognition memory-guided behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many memory processes are highly dependent on the interregional communication between the HPC and mPFC via neural oscillations. However, how these two brain regions coordinate their oscillatory activity to engage local neural populations to mediate recognition memory for novelty discrimination is poorly understood. This study revealed that the HPC and mPFC theta oscillations and their temporal coupling is correlated with recognition memory-guided behavior. During novel object recognition, the HPC drives mPFC interneurons to effectively reduce the activity of principal neurons. This study provides the first evidence for the requirement of the HPC&ndash;mPFC pathway to mediate recognition memory for novelty discrimination and describes a mechanism for how this memory is regulated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cnksr2 Loss in Mice Leads to Increased Neural Activity and Behavioral Phenotypes of Epilepsy-Aphasia Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Epilepsy Aphasia Syndromes (EAS) are a spectrum of childhood epileptic, cognitive, and language disorders of unknown etiology. <I>CNKSR2</I> is a strong X-linked candidate gene implicated in EAS; however, there have been no studies of genetic models to dissect how its absence may lead to EAS. Here we develop a novel <I>Cnksr2</I> KO mouse line and show that male mice exhibit increased neural activity and have spontaneous electrographic seizures. <I>Cnksr2</I> KO mice also display significantly increased anxiety, impaired learning and memory, and a progressive and dramatic loss of ultrasonic vocalizations. We find that Cnksr2 is expressed in cortical, striatal, and cerebellar regions and is localized at both excitatory and inhibitory postsynapses. Proteomics analysis reveals Cnksr2 anchors key binding partners at synapses, and its loss results in significant alterations of the synaptic proteome, including proteins implicated in epilepsy disorders. Our results validate that loss of CNKSR2 leads to EAS and highlights the roles of Cnksr2 in synaptic organization and neuronal network activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epilepsy Aphasia Syndromes (EAS) are at the severe end of a spectrum of cognitive-behavioral symptoms seen in childhood epilepsies, and they remain an inadequately understood disorder. The prognosis of EAS is frequently poor, and patients have life-long language and cognitive disturbances. Here we describe a genetic mouse model of EAS, based on the KO of the EAS risk gene <I>Cnksr2</I>. We show that these mice exhibit electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes similar to those of patients, providing an important new model for future studies of EAS. We also provide insights into the molecular disturbances downstream of Cnksr2 loss by using <I>in vivo</I> quantitative proteomics tools.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Altered Response Dynamics and Increased Population Correlation to Tonal Stimuli Embedded in Noise in Aging Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is a chronic health condition that affects one-third of the world population. One hallmark of presbycusis is a difficulty hearing in noisy environments. Presbycusis can be separated into two components: alterations of peripheral mechanotransduction of sound in the cochlea and central alterations of auditory processing areas of the brain. Although the effects of the aging cochlea in hearing loss have been well studied, the role of the aging brain in hearing loss is less well understood. Therefore, to examine how age-related central processing changes affect hearing in noisy environments, we used a mouse model (Thy1-GCaMP6s X CBA) that has excellent peripheral hearing in old age. We used <I>in vivo</I> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to measure the responses of neuronal populations in auditory cortex (ACtx) of adult (2&ndash;6 months, nine male, six female, 4180 neurons) and aging mice (15&ndash;17 months, six male, three female, 1055 neurons) while listening to tones in noisy backgrounds. We found that ACtx neurons in aging mice showed larger responses to tones and have less suppressed responses consistent with reduced inhibition. Aging neurons also showed less sensitivity to temporal changes. Population analysis showed that neurons in aging mice showed higher pairwise activity correlations and showed a reduced diversity in responses to sound stimuli. Using neural decoding techniques, we show a loss of information in neuronal populations in the aging brain. Thus, aging not only affects the responses of single neurons but also affects how these neurons jointly represent stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Aging results in hearing deficits particularly under challenging listening conditions. We show that auditory cortex contains distinct subpopulations of excitatory neurons that preferentially encode different stimulus features and that aging selectively reduces certain subpopulations. We also show that aging increases correlated activity between neurons and thereby reduces the response diversity in auditory cortex. The loss of population response diversity leads to a decrease of stimulus information and deficits in sound encoding, especially in noisy backgrounds. Future work determining the identities of circuits affected by aging could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deficits in Behavioral and Neuronal Pattern Separation in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>In temporal lobe epilepsy, the ability of the dentate gyrus to limit excitatory cortical input to the hippocampus breaks down, leading to seizures. The dentate gyrus is also thought to help discriminate between similar memories by performing pattern separation, but whether epilepsy leads to a breakdown in this neural computation, and thus to mnemonic discrimination impairments, remains unknown. Here we show that temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by behavioral deficits in mnemonic discrimination tasks, in both humans (females and males) and mice (C57Bl6 males, systemic low-dose kainate model). Using a recently developed assay in brain slices of the same epileptic mice, we reveal a decreased ability of the dentate gyrus to perform certain forms of pattern separation. This is because of a subset of granule cells with abnormal bursting that can develop independently of early EEG abnormalities. Overall, our results linking physiology, computation, and cognition in the same mice advance our understanding of episodic memory mechanisms and their dysfunction in epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often have learning and memory impairments, sometimes occurring earlier than the first seizure, but those symptoms and their biological underpinnings are poorly understood. We focused on the dentate gyrus, a brain region that is critical to avoid confusion between similar memories and is anatomically disorganized in TLE. We show that both humans and mice with TLE experience confusion between similar situations. This impairment coincides with a failure of the dentate gyrus to disambiguate similar input signals because of pathologic bursting in a subset of neurons. Our work bridges seizure-oriented and memory-oriented views of the dentate gyrus function, suggests a mechanism for cognitive symptoms in TLE, and supports a long-standing hypothesis of episodic memory theories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">TRPM4 Contributes to Subthreshold Membrane Potential Oscillations in Multiple Mouse Pacemaker Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Select neuronal populations display steady rhythmic neuronal firing that provides tonic excitation to drive downstream networks and behaviors. In noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), circadian neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and CO<SUB>2</SUB>/H<sup>+</sup>-activated neurons of the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), large subthreshold membrane potential oscillations contribute to the pacemaker-like action potential discharge. The oscillations and firing in LC and SCN involve contributions from leak sodium (NALCN) and L-type calcium channels while recent work from RTN suggested an additional pivotal role for a secondary calcium-activated and voltage-gated cationic current sensitive to TRPM4 channel blockers. Here, we tested whether TRPM4 contributes to subthreshold oscillations in mouse LC and SCN. By RNAscope <I>in situ</I> hybridization, <I>Trpm4</I> transcripts were detected in both cell groups. In whole-cell recordings from acute slice preparations, prominent voltage-dependent membrane potential oscillations were revealed in LC and SCN after blocking action potentials. These oscillations were inhibited by two chemically-distinct blockers of TRPM4, 9-phenanthrol (9-pt) and 4-chloro-2-[[2-(2-chlorophenoxy)acetyl]amino]benzoic acid (CBA). Under whole-cell voltage clamp, inward currents evoked by oscillation voltage waveforms were inhibited in LC by blocking L-type calcium channels and TRPM4. These data implicate TRPM4 in the large subthreshold membrane potential oscillations that underlie tonic action potential discharge in LC and SCN, providing a voltage-dependent and calcium-dependent cationic current to augment the depolarizing inward Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents previously associated with this distinctive electroresponsive property.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Modeling Physiological Sources of Heading Bias from Optic Flow</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Human heading perception from optic flow is accurate for directions close to the straight-ahead and systematic biases emerge in the periphery (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B10">Cuturi and Macneilage, 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B45">Sun et al., 2020</cross-ref>). In pursuit of the underlying neural mechanisms, primate brain dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) area has been a focus because of its causal link with heading perception (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Gu et al., 2012</cross-ref>). Computational models generally explain heading sensitivity in individual MSTd neurons as a feedforward integration of motion signals from medial temporal (MT) area that resemble full-field optic flow patterns consistent with the preferred heading direction (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Britten, 2008</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Mineault et al., 2012</cross-ref>). In the present simulation study, we quantified within the structure of this feedforward model how physiological properties of MT and MSTd shape heading signals. We found that known physiological tuning characteristics generally supported the accuracy of heading estimation, but not always. A weak-to-moderate overrepresentation of peripheral headings in MSTd garnered the highest accuracy and precision out of the models that we tested. The model also performed well when noise corrupted high proportions of the optic flow vectors. Such a peripheral MSTd model performed well when units possessed a range of receptive field (RF) sizes and were strongly direction tuned. Physiological biases in MT direction tuning toward the radial direction also supported heading estimation, but the tendency for MT preferred speed and RF size to scale with eccentricity did not. Our findings help elucidate the extent to which different physiological tuning properties influence the accuracy and precision of neural heading signals.</p>

                Background: Contamination of freshwater ecosystems has become a major issue as it threatens public water sources as well as aquatic life. It is important to predict changes in organism health, given a known number of environmental factors and pollutant concentrations, in order to better manage contaminants through biomarker analysis. This study aims to examine the ecosystem health of the Brantas River based on its environmental condition and the hematology profile of Gambusia affinis fish present in the river. This species was chosen because of its wide distribution along the Brantas River, and because it is very tolerant, adaptable, highly abundant, and easy to catch. Methods: The study area included 10 sampling sites along the Brantas River watershed. In total, six water quality parameters were observed (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia concentration, and phenol concentration) and hematology measurements consisted of erythrocyte, leucocyte, and micronuclei analyses. Results: The results showed that the upstream area of Brantas River, located in Batu, was the least polluted region, while Mojokerto was the most polluted. The erythrocyte level of Gambusia affinis caught in most sampling sites was quite low. Furthermore, research revealed that the status of Gambusia affinis' hematological profile was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with water quality parameters, particularly DO, BOD, ammonia, and phenol. Conclusions: It can be concluded from these results that the hematological profile of the fish is poor due to high levels of organic waste and harmful substances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">WBC-based segmentation and classification on microscopic images: a minor improvement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction White blood cells (WBCs) are immunity cells which fight against viruses and bacteria in the human body. Microscope images of captured WBCs for processing and analysis are important to interpret the body condition. At present, there is no robust automated method to segment and classify WBCs images with high accuracy. This paper aims to improve on WBCs image segmentation and classification method. Methods A triple thresholding method was proposed to segment the WBCs; meanwhile, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classification model that adopts transfer learning technique was proposed to detect and classify WBCs as a healthy or a malignant. The input dataset of this research work is the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB). The process first converts the captured microscope images into HSV format for obtaining the H component. Otsu thresholding is applied to segment the WBC area. A 13 × 13 kernel with two iterations was used to apply morphological opening on image to ameliorate output results. Collected cell masks were used to detect the contour of each cell on the original image. To classify WBCs into a healthy or a malignant category, characteristics and conditions of WBCs are to be examined. A transfer learning technique and pre-trained InceptionV3 model were employed to extract the features from the images for classification. Results The proposed WBCs segmentation method yields 90.45% accuracy, 83.81% of the structural similarity index, 76.25% of the dice similarity coefficient, and is computationally efficient. The accuracy of fine-tuned classifier model for training, validation and test sets are 93.27%, 92.31% and 96.15% respectively. The obtained results are high in accuracy and precision are over 96% and with lower loss value. Discussion Triple thresholding outperforms K-means clustering in segmenting smaller dataset. Pre-trained InceptionV3 model and transfer learning improve the flexibility and ability of classifier.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Seroprevalence and characterisation of herpes simplex virus from human immunodeficiency virus in samples collected from two provinces in South Africa: a retrospective study [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a widely distributed human pathogen that is known for its ulcerative lesions at the infection site. HSV can cause persistent infection in the host that is often followed by a period of latency within the neurons. Considering the high rate of HIV infection in South Africa, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of HSV with a focus to determine the epidemiological association between HSV-DNA and HIV-1 in the population. Methods: A total of 44 sera samples were screened for HSV and HIV-1 using the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA positive samples were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the positivity of both viruses and to further differentiate HSV into HSV-1 and -2. Thereafter, the samples were analysed for relatedness using phylogenetic analysis. Results: Of the 44 samples, 36 (81.8%) were positive for HIV-1, while 35 (79.5%) were positive for HSV when screened with ELISA kits. The PCR results, with the use of type specific primers, showed that 4/35 (11.4%) samples were specific for HSV-1 while 30/35 (85.7%) were specific for HSV-2. Statistical analysis performed using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test showed that there is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 transmission. Conclusions: There is a significant positive association between HSV-2 and HIV-1 in the study population. Our study shows that some of the HSV-2 isolates are not related to the clinical isolate SD90e from South Africa, suggesting diversity in HSV-2 viral transmission.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">2-DOF robot modelling by SimMechanics and PD-FL integrated controller for position control and trajectory tracking [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Due to the high demand of robots to perform several industrial tasks, such as welding, machining, pick and place, position control in robotics has attracted high attention recently. Controllers’ improvement is also continuous specifically in terms of design simplicity and performance accuracy. This research plans to obtain the SimMechanics model of a two-degree of freedom (DOF) robot and to propose an integrated controller of a proportional–derivative (PD) controller and a fuzzy logic (FL) controller. Methodology The SimMechanics model of the 2-DOF robot is obtained using MATLAB SimMechanics toolbox from a CAD assembly design of the 2-DOF robot. Then, the proposed PD-FL integrated controller is designed and simulated in MATLAB Simulink. The PD controller is widely used for its simplicity, but it doesn’t have a satisfactory performance in difficult tasks. Furthermore, the FL controller is also easy for design and implementation even by non-experts in control theory, but it has the disadvantage of long computational time for multi-input systems due to the increased fuzzy rules. Results The FL controller is integrated with the PD controller for enhanced performance of the 2-DOF robot. The PD-FL integrated controller is developed and tested to control the 2-DOF robot for point-to-point position control and also tip trajectory tracking (TTT) such as triangular TTT and rhombic TTT. Conclusion The PD-FL integrated controller demonstrates enhanced performance compared to the conventional PD controller in both point-to-point position control and TTT. Furthermore, the PD-FL integrated controller has the advantage of less fuzzy rules which helps to overcome the computational time issue of the FL controller.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does COVID-19 infection change the need for future surgical interventions? An exploratory analysis. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is unknown whether recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection leads to an increased need for common surgical procedures. Our objective was to conduct an exploratory analysis of surgical procedures performed after a documented COVID-19 infection.  Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected data from the province of Ontario, Canada. We identified individuals with a positive COVID-19 test between February 1 2020 and May 31 2020, and matched them 1:2 with individuals who had a negative COVID-19 test during the same period. We used physician billing codes to identify the ten most frequent surgical procedures in the COVID-19 cohort. An at-risk period 30 days after the first positive COVID-19 swab (or matched index date in the control group) until November 30 2020 was used. Cox proportional hazard models (adjusted for important baseline differences) are reported with hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals.   Results: After exclusions and matching, we had 19,143 people in the COVID-19 cohort, and 38,286 people in the control cohort. The top ten surgical procedures were hand/wrist fracture fixation, cesarean-section, ureteral stent placement, cholecystectomy, treatment of an upper tract urinary stone, hysterectomy, femur fracture repair, hip replacement, transurethral prostatectomy, and appendectomy. There was a significantly reduced hazard of requiring upper tract renal stone surgery (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.87) or ureteral stent placement (aHR 0.54, 95%CI 0.36-0.82), or undergoing a cholecystectomy (aHR 0.43, 95%CI 0.26-0.71) among those with a prior positive COVID-19 test.   Conclusions: After a COVID-19 infection there is not an increased risk of needing several common surgical procedures. There appears to be a reduced risk of renal stone disease treatment and ureteral stent placement, and a reduced risk of cholecystectomy, however understanding the reasons for this will require further study.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-population coupling of neural activity based on Gaussian process current source densities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natalie Klein, Joshua H. Siegle, Tobias Teichert, Robert E. Kass</p>

Because local field potentials (LFPs) arise from multiple sources in different spatial locations, they do not easily reveal coordinated activity across neural populations on a trial-to-trial basis. As we show here, however, once disparate source signals are decoupled, their trial-to-trial fluctuations become more accessible, and cross-population correlations become more apparent. To decouple sources we introduce a general framework for estimation of current source densities (CSDs). In this framework, the set of LFPs result from noise being added to the transform of the CSD by a biophysical forward model, while the CSD is considered to be the sum of a zero-mean, stationary, spatiotemporal Gaussian process, having fast and slow components, and a mean function, which is the sum of multiple time-varying functions distributed across space, each varying across trials. We derived biophysical forward models relevant to the data we analyzed. In simulation studies this approach improved identification of source signals compared to existing CSD estimation methods. Using data recorded from primate auditory cortex, we analyzed trial-to-trial fluctuations in both steady-state and task-evoked signals. We found cortical layer-specific phase coupling between two probes and showed that the same analysis applied directly to LFPs did not recover these patterns. We also found task-evoked CSDs to be correlated across probes, at specific cortical depths. Using data from Neuropixels probes in mouse visual areas, we again found evidence for depth-specific phase coupling of primary visual cortex and lateromedial area based on the CSDs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">MGEnrichment: A web application for microglia gene list enrichment analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justin Jao, Annie Vogel Ciernia</p>

Gene expression analysis is becoming increasingly utilized in neuro-immunology research, and there is a growing need for non-programming scientists to be able to analyze their own genomic data. MGEnrichment is a web application developed both to disseminate to the community our curated database of microglia-relevant gene lists, and to allow non-programming scientists to easily conduct statistical enrichment analysis on their gene expression data. Users can upload their own gene IDs to assess the relevance of their expression data against gene lists from other studies. We include example datasets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from human postmortem brain samples from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and matched controls. We demonstrate how MGEnrichment can be used to expand the interpretations of these DEG lists in terms of regulation of microglial gene expression and provide novel insights into how ASD DEGs may be implicated specifically in microglial development, microbiome responses and relationships to other neuropsychiatric disorders. This tool will be particularly useful for those working in microglia, autism spectrum disorders, and neuro-immune activation research. MGEnrichment is available at https://ciernialab.shinyapps.io/MGEnrichmentApp/ and further online documentation and datasets can be found at https://github.com/ciernialab/MGEnrichmentApp. The app is released under the GNU GPLv3 open source license.

                <p>by Angelo Fortunato, Alexis Fleming, Athena Aktipis, Carlo C. Maley</p>

<i>Trichoplax adhaerens</i> is the simplest multicellular animal with tissue differentiation and somatic cell turnover. Like all other multicellular organisms, it should be vulnerable to cancer, yet there have been no reports of cancer in <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> or any other placozoan. We investigated the cancer resistance of <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i>, discovering that they are able to tolerate high levels of radiation damage (218.6 Gy). To investigate how <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> survive levels of radiation that are lethal to other animals, we examined gene expression after the X-ray exposure, finding overexpression of genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis including the <i>MDM2</i> gene. We also discovered that <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> extrudes clusters of inviable cells after X-ray exposure. <i>T</i>. <i>adhaerens</i> is a valuable model organism for studying the molecular, genetic, and tissue-level mechanisms underlying cancer suppression.

                Background: We compared the pattern of cutaneous dermatoses among Iraqi females of all ages between 4 months preceding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the same months 1 year later within the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, that targeted all female patients attending an outpatient clinic for dermatology and venereology in Al-Kindy teaching hospital, Baghdad between October 2019 to the end of January 2020, and the same 4-month duration 1 year later (October 2020 to the end of January 2021) after the COVID-19 peak period had passed and there was no or partial curfew to exclude seasonal impact. Results: A total of 2657 female-patients of all ages were enrolled in this study with 1314 females during the 4 months pre COVID-19, and 1343 females during the pandemic. The mean age of patients presented before the pandemic was 27.2±16.6 years, while the mean age of patients during the pandemic was 28.1±15.6 years with no statistically significant difference in mean ages (P >0.05). Hair loss in general with telogen effluvium specifically increased significantly. Cutaneous contagious viral infections were reduced significantly and specifically of these molluscum contagiosum and condylomata accuminata. Other forms of infections including bacterial and parasitic were also reduced while dermatophytosis was increased but not to a significant level. Acne vulgaris, rosacea, lichen planus, urticaria, pityriasis rosea, seborrheic dermatitis, and vitiligo were increased, but psoriasis, alopecia areata, other types of dermatitis, and melasma were reduced but none to a significant level. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the pattern of diseases presented to an out-patient clinic for dermatology and venereology. This could be either related to COVID-19 infection or stress associated with the pandemic, because of curfew, or wearing facemasks which may cause a decrease or increase in certain diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Unfolding of spatial representation at systems level in infant rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spatial representations enable navigation from early life on. However, the brain regions essential to form spatial representations, like the hippocampus, are considered functionally immature before weaning. Here, we examined the formation of representations of space in rat pups on postnatal day (PD) 16, using a simple habituation paradigm where the pups were exposed to an arena on three occasions, separated by ~140 min. Whereas on the first two occasions the arena was the same, on the third “test” occasion either proximal cues (Prox group), or distal cues (Dist group), or proximal and distal cues (Prox-Dist group), or no cues (No-change group) were rearranged. Locomotion (distance traveled) was used as behavioral measure of habituation, and c-Fos expression to measure regional brain activity at test. Locomotion generally decreased across the first two occasions. At test, it reached a minimum in the No-change group, indicating familiarity with the spatial conditions. By contrast, the Prox-Dist group displayed a significant increase in locomotion which was less robust in the Prox group and absent in the Dist group, a pattern suggesting that the pups relied more on proximal than distal cues during spatial exploration. c-Fos activity in the No-change group was significantly suppressed in the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus) but simultaneously enhanced in the prelimbic area (PL) of the medial prefrontal cortex, compared with untreated Home-cage controls, pointing to a possible involvement of the PL in regulating locomotion in familiar spaces. By contrast, in both Prox-Dist and Prox groups c-Fos activity was enhanced in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, suggesting these regions might be particularly involved in regulating exploration of spatial novelty. Our findings show that functional representations of space at a systems level are formed already in pre-weanling rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Perfusion Imaging Predicts Favorable Outcomes after Basilar Artery Thrombectomy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Perfusion imaging identifies anterior circulation stroke patients who respond favorably to endovascular thrombectomy (ET), but its role in basilar occlusion (BAO) is unknown. We hypothesized that BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion (Time-to-maximum [Tmax] delay &gt;10 seconds) would have a favorable response to ET compared to patients with more extensive regions involved.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of BAO patients with perfusion imaging prior to ET. We pre-specified a Critical Area Perfusion Score (CAPS; 0-6 points), which quantified severe hypoperfusion (Tmax &gt;10s) in cerebellum (1 point/hemisphere), pons (2 points), midbrain and/or thalamus (2 points). Patients were dichotomized into favorable (CAPS≤3) and unfavorable (CAPS&gt;3) groups. The primary outcome was a favorable functional outcome 90-days after ET (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>103 patients were included. CAPS≤3 patients (87%) had a lower median NIHSS (12.5 [IQR 7-22]) compared to CAPS&gt;3 patients (13%) (23 [IQR 19-36]; p=0.01). Reperfusion was achieved in 84% of all patients with no difference between CAPS groups (p=0.42). 64% of reperfused CAPS≤3 patients had a favorable outcome compared to 8% of non-reperfused CAPS≤3 patients (OR=21.0 [95% CI 2.6-170]; p&lt;0.001). No CAPS&gt;3 patients had a favorable outcome, regardless of reperfusion. In a multivariable regression analysis, CAPS≤3 was a robust independent predictor of favorable outcome after adjustment for reperfusion, age, and pre-ET NIHSS (OR 39.25 [95% CI 1.34-&gt;999)]; p=0.04).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BAO patients with limited regions of severe hypoperfusion had a favorable response to reperfusion following ET. However, patients with more extensive regions of hypoperfusion in critical brain regions did not benefit from endovascular reperfusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online harassment in Japan: Dissecting the targeting of a female journalist [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Harassment on the Internet, particularly on social media such as Twitter, has reached a level where it can, without exaggeration, be characterised as a real-world societal problem in Japan. However, studies on this phenomenon in the Japanese language environment, especially adopting a victim-centric perspective, are rare. In this paper, we incorporated the concept of online harassment and reviewed existing studies about online harassment from Japan and abroad. We then conducted a detailed case analysis of the “flaming” of a female journalist and those who targeted her on Twitter. Based on our analysis, we observed that there were three layers of users who targeted the journalist: influencers, users who responded to the instigation by influencers, and trolls. Each harassed the journalist, but in a different manner. Given Japan’s particular difficulty of imposing domestic regulations on social media companies that are mostly from abroad, we propose and describe possible measures that individuals and their employers should consider taking.

                Accumulating evidence supports the prevalence of experience-dependent oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelination in learning and memory. However, the mechanisms remain unknown. In this issue of Neuron, Osso et al., (2021) report that stress causes the secretion of dynorphin by unmyelinated axons, which induces OPC differentiation and myelination of neighboring axons.

                Stojkovska et al. found that Parkinson’s patient neurons accumulate α-synuclein and are deficient at recognizing misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), inducing pathogenic aggregation of immature lysosomal hydrolases. This phenotype is rescued by combined enhancement of ER proteostasis and protein trafficking, leading to lysosomal activation and reduction of α-synuclein.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">mTOR-dependent translation drives tumor infiltrating CD8+ effector and CD4+ Treg cells expansion</a></h4>

              
                We performed a systematic analysis of the translation rate of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the microenvironment inputs affecting it, both in humans and in mice. Measurement of puromycin incorporation, a proxy of protein synthesis, revealed an increase of translating CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in tumors, compared to normal tissues. High translation levels are associated with phospho-S6 labeling downstream of mTORC1 activation, whereas low levels correlate with hypoxic areas, in agreement with data showing that T cell receptor stimulation and hypoxia act as translation stimulators and inhibitors, respectively. Additional analyses revealed the specific phenotype of translating TILs. CD8<sup>+</sup> translating cells have enriched expression of IFN-γ and CD-39, and reduced SLAMF6, pointing to a cytotoxic phenotype. CD4<sup>+</sup> translating cells are mostly regulatory T cells (Tregs) with enriched levels of CTLA-4 and Ki67, suggesting an expanding immunosuppressive phenotype. In conclusion, the majority of translationally active TILs is represented by cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> and suppressive CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, implying that other subsets may be largely composed by inactive bystanders.

                De novo protein synthesis is required for synapse modifications underlying stable memory encoding. Yet neurons are highly compartmentalized cells and how protein synthesis can be regulated at the synapse level is unknown. Here, we characterize neuronal signaling complexes formed by the postsynaptic scaffold GIT1, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, and Raptor that couple synaptic stimuli to mTOR-dependent protein synthesis; and identify NMDA receptors containing GluN3A subunits as key negative regulators of GIT1 binding to mTOR. Disruption of GIT1/mTOR complexes by enhancing GluN3A expression or silencing GIT1 inhibits synaptic mTOR activation and restricts the mTOR-dependent translation of specific activity-regulated mRNAs. Conversely, GluN3A removal enables complex formation, potentiates mTOR-dependent protein synthesis, and facilitates the consolidation of associative and spatial memories in mice. The memory enhancement becomes evident with light or spaced training, can be achieved by selectively deleting GluN3A from excitatory neurons during adulthood, and does not compromise other aspects of cognition such as memory flexibility or extinction. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into synaptic translational control and reveal a potentially selective target for cognitive enhancement.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dysfunctions of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus induce hypersomnia in mice</a></h4>

              
                Hypersomnolence disorder (HD) is characterized by excessive sleep, which is a common sequela following stroke, infection or tumorigenesis. HD is traditionally thought to be associated with lesions of wake-promoting nuclei. However, lesions of a single wake-promoting nucleus, or even two simultaneously, did not exert serious HD. Therefore, the specific nucleus and neural circuitry for HD remain unknown. Here, we observed that the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) exhibited higher c-fos expression during the active period (23:00) than during the inactive period (11:00) in mice. Therefore, we speculated that the PVH, in which most neurons are glutamatergic, may represent one of the key arousal-controlling centers. By using vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vglut2<sup>Cre</sup>) mice together with fiber photometry, multichannel electrophysiological recordings, and genetic approaches, we found that PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons were most active during wakefulness. Chemogenetic activation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons induced wakefulness for 9 h, and photostimulation of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup>→parabrachial complex/ventral lateral septum circuits immediately drove transitions from sleep to wakefulness. Moreover, lesioning or chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>vglut2</sup> neurons dramatically decreased wakefulness. These results indicate that the PVH is critical for arousal promotion and maintenance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unconventional conservation reveals structure-function relationships in the synaptonemal complex</a></h4>

              
                Functional requirements constrain protein evolution, commonly manifesting in a conserved amino acid sequence. Here, we extend this idea to secondary structural features by tracking their conservation in essential meiotic proteins with highly diverged sequences. The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a ~100-nm-wide ladder-like meiotic structure present in all eukaryotic clades, where it aligns parental chromosomes and regulates exchanges between them. Despite the conserved ultrastructure and functions of the SC, SC proteins are highly divergent within <i>Caenorhabditis</i>. However, SC proteins have highly conserved length and coiled-coil domain structure. We found the same unconventional conservation signature in <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals, and used it to identify a novel SC protein in <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i>, Ppa-SYP-1. Our work suggests that coiled-coils play wide-ranging roles in the structure and function of the SC, and more broadly, that expanding sequence analysis beyond measures of per-site similarity can enhance our understanding of protein evolution and function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human B cell lineages associated with germinal centers following influenza vaccination are measurably evolving</a></h4>

              
                The poor efficacy of seasonal influenza virus vaccines is often attributed to pre-existing immunity interfering with the persistence and maturation of vaccine-induced B cell responses. We previously showed that a subset of vaccine-induced B cell lineages are recruited into germinal centers (GCs) following vaccination, suggesting that affinity maturation of these lineages against vaccine antigens can occur. However, it remains to be determined whether seasonal influenza vaccination stimulates additional evolution of vaccine-specific lineages, and previous work has found no significant increase in somatic hypermutation (SHM) among influenza-binding lineages sampled from the blood following seasonal vaccination in humans. Here, we investigate this issue using a phylogenetic test of measurable immunoglobulin sequence evolution. We first validate this test through simulations and survey measurable evolution across multiple conditions. We find significant heterogeneity in measurable B cell evolution across conditions, with enrichment in primary response conditions such as HIV infection and early childhood development. We then show that measurable evolution following influenza vaccination is highly compartmentalized: while lineages in the blood are rarely measurably evolving following influenza vaccination, lineages containing GC B cells are frequently measurably evolving. Many of these lineages appear to derive from memory B cells. We conclude from these findings that seasonal influenza virus vaccination can stimulate additional evolution of responding B cell lineages, and imply that the poor efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccination is not due to a complete inhibition of vaccine-specific B cell evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stronger net selection on males across animals</a></h4>

              
                Sexual selection is considered the major driver for the evolution of sex differences. However, the eco-evolutionary dynamics of sexual selection and their role for a population’s adaptive potential to respond to environmental change have only recently been explored. Theory predicts that sexual selection promotes adaptation at a low demographic cost only if sexual selection is aligned with natural selection and if net selection is stronger on males compared to females. We used a comparative approach to show that net selection is indeed stronger in males and provide preliminary support that this sex bias is associated with sexual selection. Given that both sexes share the vast majority of their genes, our findings corroborate the notion that the genome is often confronted with a more stressful environment when expressed in males. Collectively, our study supports one of the long-standing key assumptions required for sexual selection to bolster adaptation, and sexual selection may therefore enable some species to track environmental change more efficiently.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Arginine-vasopressin mediates counter-regulatory glucagon release and is diminished in type 1 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a major barrier to the treatment of type-1 diabetes (T1D). Accordingly, it is important that we understand the mechanisms regulating the circulating levels of glucagon - the body's principal blood glucose-elevating hormone which is secreted from alpha-cells of the pancreatic islets. Varying glucose over the range of concentrations that occur physiologically between the fed and fuel-deprived states (from 8 to 4 mM) has no significant effect on glucagon secretion in the perfused mouse pancreas or in isolated mouse islets (<i>in vitro</i>) and yet associates with dramatic changes in plasma glucagon <i>in vivo</i>. The identity of the systemic factor(s) that stimulates glucagon secretion remains unknown. Here, we show that arginine-vasopressin (AVP), secreted from the posterior pituitary, stimulates glucagon secretion. Glucagon-secreting alpha-cells express high levels of the vasopressin 1b receptor gene (<i>Avpr1b</i>). Activation of AVP neurons <i>in vivo</i> increased circulating copeptin (the C-terminal segment of the AVP precursor peptide, a stable surrogate marker of AVP) and increased blood glucose; effects blocked by pharmacological antagonism of either the glucagon receptor or vasopressin 1b receptor. AVP also mediates the stimulatory effects of hypoglycemia produced by exogenous insulin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose on glucagon secretion. We show that the A1/C1 neurons of the medulla oblongata drive AVP neuron activation in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Exogenous injection of AVP <i>in vivo </i>increased cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in alpha-cells (implanted into the anterior chamber of the eye) and glucagon release. Hypoglycemia also increases circulating levels of AVP in humans and this hormone stimulates glucagon secretion from isolated human islets. In patients with T1D, hypoglycemia failed to increase both plasma copeptin and glucagon levels. These findings suggest that AVP is a physiological systemic regulator of glucagon secretion and that this mechanism becomes impaired in T1D.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Urgency forces stimulus-driven action by overcoming cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Intelligent behavior requires to act directed by goals despite competing action tendencies triggered by stimuli in the environment. For eye movements, it has recently been discovered that this ability is briefly reduced in urgent situations (Salinas et al., 2019). In a time-window before an urgent response, participants could not help but look at a suddenly appearing visual stimulus, even though their goal was to look away from it. Urgency seemed to provoke a new visual–oculomotor phenomenon: A period in which saccadic eye movements are dominated by external stimuli, and uncontrollable by current goals. This period was assumed to arise from brain mechanisms controlling eye movements and spatial attention, such as those of the frontal eye field. Here, we show that the phenomenon is more general than previously thought. We found that also in well-investigated manual tasks, urgency made goal-conflicting stimulus features dominate behavioral responses. This dominance of behavior followed established trial-to-trial signatures of cognitive control mechanisms that replicate across a variety of tasks. Thus together, these findings reveal that urgency temporarily forces stimulus-driven action by overcoming cognitive control in general, not only at brain mechanisms controlling eye movements.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modulation of pulsatile GnRH dynamics across the ovarian cycle via changes in the network excitability and basal activity of the arcuate kisspeptin network</a></h4>

              
                Pulsatile GnRH release is essential for normal reproductive function. Kisspeptin secreting neurons found in the arcuate nucleus, known as KNDy neurons for co-expressing neurokinin B, and dynorphin, drive pulsatile GnRH release. Furthermore, gonadal steroids regulate GnRH pulsatile dynamics across the ovarian cycle by altering KNDy neurons' signalling properties. However, the precise mechanism of regulation remains mostly unknown. To better understand these mechanisms we start by perturbing the KNDy system at different stages of the estrous cycle using optogenetics. We find that optogenetic stimulation of KNDy neurons stimulates pulsatile GnRH/LH secretion in estrous mice but inhibits it in diestrous mice. These in-vivo results in combination with mathematical modelling suggest that the transition between estrus and diestrus is underpinned by well-orchestrated changes in neuropeptide signalling and in the excitability of the KNDy population controlled via glutamate signalling. Guided by model predictions, we show that blocking glutamate signalling in diestrous animals inhibits LH pulses, and that optic stimulation of the KNDy population mitigates this inhibition. In estrous mice, disruption of glutamate signalling inhibits pulses generated via sustained low-frequency optic stimulation of the KNDy population, supporting the idea that the level of network excitability is critical for pulse generation. Our results reconcile previous puzzling findings regarding the estradiol-dependent effect that several neuromodulators have on the GnRH pulse generator dynamics. Therefore, we anticipate our model to be a cornerstone for a more quantitative understanding of the pathways via which gonadal steroids regulate GnRH pulse generator dynamics. Finally, our results could inform useful repurposing of drugs targeting the glutamate system in reproductive therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Convergent, functionally independent signaling by mu and delta opioid receptors in hippocampal parvalbumin interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Functional interactions between G protein-coupled receptors are poised to enhance neuronal sensitivity to neuromodulators and therapeutic drugs. Mu and Delta opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) can interact when overexpressed in the same cells, but whether co-expression of endogenous MORs and DORs in neurons leads to functional interactions is unclear. Here, in mice, we show that both MORs and DORs inhibit parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PV-BCs) in hippocampal CA1 through partially occlusive signaling pathways that terminate on somato-dendritic potassium channels and presynaptic calcium channels. Using photoactivatable opioid neuropeptides, we find that DORs dominate the response to enkephalin in terms of both ligand-sensitivity and kinetics, which may be due to relatively low expression levels of MOR. Opioid-activated potassium channels do not show heterologous desensitization, indicating that MORs and DORs signal independently. In a direct test for heteromeric functional interactions, the DOR antagonist TIPP-Psi does not alter the kinetics or potency of either the potassium channel or synaptic responses to photorelease of the MOR agonist DAMGO. Thus, aside from largely redundant and convergent signaling, MORs and DORs do not functionally interact in PV-BCs in a way that impacts somato-dendritic potassium currents or synaptic transmission. These findings imply that crosstalk between MORs and DORs, either in the form of physical interactions or synergistic intracellular signaling, is not a preordained outcome of co-expression in neurons.
