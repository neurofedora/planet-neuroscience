	<p>Recent research has suggested that working-memory training interventions may benefit children with developmental language disorder (DLD). The current study investigated a short and engaging adaptive working-memory intervention that targeted executive skills and aimed to improve both language comprehension and working-memory abilities in children with DLD. Forty-seven 6- to 10-year-old children with DLD were randomly allocated to an executive working-memory training intervention (n = 24) or an active control group (n = 23). A pre-test/intervention/post-test/9-month-follow-up design was used. Outcome measures included assessments of language (to evaluate far transfer of the training) and working memory (to evaluate near transfer of the training). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for pre-intervention performance and age found the group to be a significant predictor of sentence comprehension and of performance on six untrained working-memory measures at post-intervention and 9-month follow-up. Children in the intervention group showed significantly higher language comprehension and working-memory scores at both time points than children in the active control group. The intervention programme showed the potential to improve working memory and language comprehension in children with DLD and demonstrated several advantages: it involved short sessions over a short period, caused little disruption in the school day, and was enjoyed by children.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in the Spatial Behavior Functions of Adult-Born Neurons in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Adult neurogenesis modifies hippocampal circuits and behavior, but removing newborn neurons does not consistently alter spatial processing, a core function of the hippocampus. Additionally, little is known about sex differences in neurogenesis since few studies have compared males and females. Since adult-born neurons regulate the stress response, we hypothesized that spatial functions may be more prominent under aversive conditions and may differ between males and females given sex differences in stress responding. We therefore trained intact and neurogenesis-deficient rats in the spatial water maze at temperatures that vary in their degree of aversiveness. In the standard water maze, ablating neurogenesis did not alter spatial learning in either sex. However, in cold water, ablating neurogenesis had divergent sex-dependent effects: relative to intact rats, male neurogenesis-deficient rats were slower to escape the maze and female neurogenesis-deficient rats were faster. Neurogenesis promoted temperature-related changes in search strategy in females, but it promoted search strategy stability in males. Females displayed greater recruitment (Fos expression) of the dorsal hippocampus than males, particularly in cold water. However, blocking neurogenesis did not alter Fos expression in either sex. Finally, morphologic analyses revealed greater experience-dependent plasticity in males. Adult-born neurons in males and females had similar morphology at baseline but training increased spine density and reduced presynaptic terminal size, specifically in males. Collectively, these findings indicate that adult-born neurons contribute to spatial learning in stressful conditions and they provide new evidence for sex differences in their behavioral functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Impact of {alpha}-Synuclein Fibrillar Strains and {beta}-Amyloid Assemblies on Mouse Cortical Neurons Endo-Lysosomal Logistics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Endosomal transport and positioning cooperate in the establishment of neuronal compartment architecture, dynamics, and function, contributing to neuronal intracellular logistics. Furthermore, dysfunction of endo-lysosomal has been identified as a common mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we analyzed endo-lysosomal transport when &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) fibrillar polymorphs, &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) fibrils, and oligomers were externally applied on primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons. To measure this transport, we used a simple readout based on the spontaneous endocytosis in cultured neurons of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs), a perfectly stable nano-emitter, and the subsequent automatic extraction and quantification of their directed motions at high-throughput. &alpha;-Syn fibrillar polymorphs, A&beta; fibrils, and oligomers induce a 2-fold decrease of the fraction of nanodiamonds transported along microtubules, while only slightly reducing their interaction with cortical neurons. This important decrease in moving endosomes is expected to have a huge impact on neuronal homeostasis. We next assessed lysosomes dynamics, using LysoTracker. Neurons exposure to A&beta; oligomers led to an increase in the number of lysosomes, a decrease in the fraction of moving lysosome and an increase in their size, reminiscent of that found in APP transgenic model of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. We then analyzed the effect of &alpha;-syn fibrillar polymorphs, A&beta; fibrils, and oligomers on endosomal and lysosomal transport and quantified directed transport of those assemblies within cortical neurons. We report different impacts on endosomal and lysosomal transport parameters and differences in the trajectory lengths of cargoes loaded with pathogenic protein assemblies. Our results suggest that intraneuronal pathogenic protein aggregates internalization and transport may represent a target for novel neuroprotective therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Homeostatic pH disturbance, specifically acidosis, is a trigger for panic attacks relevant to panic disorder; however, contributory mechanisms are still unclear. Here we report a role of microglial acid chemosensory G protein–coupled receptor, T-cell death-associated gene 8, within the subfornical organ in orchestrating acidosis-evoked, fear-associated behavior of relevance to panic.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>An important role of pH homeostasis has been suggested in the physiology of panic disorder, with acidosis as an interoceptive trigger leading to fear and panic. Identification of novel mechanisms that can translate acidosis into fear will promote a better understanding of panic physiology. The current study explores a role of the subfornical organ (SFO), a blood–brain barrier compromised brain area, in translating acidosis to fear-relevant behaviors. We performed SFO-targeted acidification in male, wild-type mice and mice lacking microglial acid-sensing G protein–coupled receptor—T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8). Localized SFO acidification evoked significant freezing and reduced exploration that was dependent on the presence of acid-sensor TDAG8. Acidosis promoted the activation of SFO microglia and neurons that were absent in TDAG8-deficient mice. The assessment of regional neuronal activation in wild-type and TDAG8-deficient mice following SFO acidification revealed significant acidosis and genotype-dependent alterations in the hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray nuclei. Furthermore, mapping of interregional co-activation patterns revealed that SFO acidosis promoted positive hypothalamic-cortex associations and desynchronized SFO-cortex and amygdala-cortex associations, suggesting an interplay of homeostatic and fear regulatory areas. Importantly, these alterations were not evident in TDAG8-deficient mice. Overall, our data support a regulatory role of subfornical organ microglial acid sensing in acidosis-evoked fear, highlighting a centralized role of blood–brain barrier compromised nodes in interoceptive sensing and behavioral regulation. Identification of pathways by which humoral information can modulate fear behavior is relevant to panic disorder, where aberrant interoceptive signaling has been reported.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein induced by RNA binding</a></h4>

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causal agent of COVID-19, is a multifunction phosphoprotein that plays critical roles in the virus life cycle, including transcription and packaging of the viral RNA. To play such diverse roles, the N protein has two globular RNA-binding modules, the N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains, which are connected by an intrinsically disordered region. Despite the wealth of structural data available for the isolated NTD and CTD, how these domains are arranged in the full-length protein and how the oligomerization of N influences its RNA-binding activity remains largely unclear. Herein, using experimental data from electron microscopy and biochemical/biophysical techniques combined with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, in the absence of RNA, the N protein formed structurally dynamic dimers, with the NTD and CTD arranged in extended conformations. However, in the presence of RNA, the N protein assumed a more compact conformation where the NTD and CTD are packed together. We also provided an octameric model for the full-length N bound to RNA that is consistent with electron microscopy images of the N protein in the presence of RNA. Together, our results shed new light on the dynamics and higher-order oligomeric structure of this versatile protein.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Capturing the songs of mice with an improved detection and classification method for ultrasonic vocalizations (BootSnap)</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Reyhaneh Abbasi, Peter Balazs, Maria Adelaide Marconi, Doris Nicolakis, Sarah M. Zala, Dustin J. Penn</p>

House mice communicate through ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), which are above the range of human hearing (>20 kHz), and several automated methods have been developed for USV detection and classification. Here we evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in a full, systematic comparison, while also presenting a new approach. This study aims to 1) determine the most efficient USV detection tool among the existing methods, and 2) develop a classification model that is more generalizable than existing methods. In both cases, we aim to minimize the user intervention required for processing new data. We compared the performance of four detection methods in an out-of-the-box approach, pretrained DeepSqueak detector, MUPET, USVSEG, and the Automatic Mouse Ultrasound Detector (A-MUD). We also compared these methods to human visual or ‘manual’ classification (ground truth) after assessing its reliability. A-MUD and USVSEG outperformed the other methods in terms of true positive rates using default and adjusted settings, respectively, and A-MUD outperformed USVSEG when false detection rates were also considered. For automating the classification of USVs, we developed <i>BootSnap</i> for supervised classification, which combines bootstrapping on Gammatone Spectrograms and Convolutional Neural Networks algorithms with Snapshot ensemble learning. It successfully classified calls into 12 types, including a new class of false positives that is useful for detection refinement. <i>BootSnap</i> outperformed the pretrained and retrained state-of-the-art tool, and thus it is more generalizable. <i>BootSnap</i> is freely available for scientific use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for establishing a mentorship programme</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anne M. Treasure, Siobhan Mackenzie Hall, Igor Lesko, Derek Moore, Malvika Sharan, Menno van Zaanen, Yo Yehudi, Anelda van der Walt</p>

In recent years, a wide variety of mentorship programmes targeting issues that cannot be addressed through traditional teaching and learning methods alone have been developed. Mentoring plays significant roles in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees, and the positive impacts of mentoring have been well documented. Mentorship programmes are therefore increasingly being implemented in a wide variety of fields by organisations, academic institutes, businesses, and governments. While there is a growing body of literature on mentoring and mentorship programmes, gaining a clear overview of the field is often challenging. In this article, we therefore provide a concise summary of recommendations to consider when designing and establishing mentorship programmes. These recommendations are based on the collective knowledge and experiences of 4 different emerging and established mentorship programmes and can be adapted across various mentorship settings or contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Unusual mammalian usage of TGA stop codons reveals that sequence conservation need not imply purifying selection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Thomas Ho, Laurence Daniel Hurst</p>

The assumption that conservation of sequence implies the action of purifying selection is central to diverse methodologies to infer functional importance. GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a meiotic mismatch repair bias strongly favouring GC over AT, can in principle mimic the action of selection, this being thought to be especially important in mammals. As mutation is GC→AT biased, to demonstrate that gBGC does indeed cause false signals requires evidence that an AT-rich residue is selectively optimal compared to its more GC-rich allele, while showing also that the GC-rich alternative is conserved. We propose that mammalian stop codon evolution provides a robust test case. Although in most taxa TAA is the optimal stop codon, TGA is both abundant and conserved in mammalian genomes. We show that this mammalian exceptionalism is well explained by gBGC mimicking purifying selection and that TAA is the selectively optimal codon. Supportive of gBGC, we observe (i) TGA usage trends are consistent at the focal stop codon and elsewhere (in UTR sequences); (ii) that higher TGA usage and higher TAA→TGA substitution rates are predicted by a high recombination rate; and (iii) across species the difference in TAA <-> TGA substitution rates between GC-rich and GC-poor genes is largest in genomes that possess higher between-gene GC variation. TAA optimality is supported both by enrichment in highly expressed genes and trends associated with effective population size. High TGA usage and high TAA→TGA rates in mammals are thus consistent with gBGC’s predicted ability to “drive” deleterious mutations and supports the hypothesis that sequence conservation need not be indicative of purifying selection. A general trend for GC-rich trinucleotides to reside at frequencies far above their mutational equilibrium in high recombining domains supports the generality of these results.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico comparison between the mutated and wild type androgen receptors and their influence on the selection of optimum androgenic receptor blocker for treatment of prostate cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prostate cancer is a disease that occurs in men aged more than 50 years. In Iraq, 8.89 men per 100,000 population suffer from prostate cancer, with the incidence being 14,016 cases and mortality being 6,367 cases. Despite advances in treatment against prostate cancer, it can become resistant to drugs. Therefore, the aim of current study was to search and identify binding sites for the repositioning of drugs by computational methods (docking).  Methods: Based on the protein structure of the wild androgen receptor, the analysis parameters (22x22x22 on the X, Y, and Z axes) were established. Results: The interactions of the natural ligands with androgen receptor were 10.0 (testosterone) and 10.8 (dihydrotestosterone) while mutated androgen receptor (T877A) had a low affinity with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (-5.3 and -6.7, respectively). In the interactions of both receptors with the reported inhibitors (antagonists), a decrease with Bicalutamide (-8.3 and -4.3, respectively) and an increase in affinity with Flutamide and Nilutamide (-7.7 and 8.6, wild AR; -8.7 and -9.3 AR T877A) were observed. As for Enzalutamide and Apalutamide (second-generation antagonists), the change was minimal between wild androgen receptor and T877A (-7.6 and -7.7; -7.3 and -7.3, respectively). The change in the affinity of the ligands with androgen receptor and androgen receptor T877A shows how a mutation alters the bonds between these molecules. Conclusion: The identification of key sites and potent inhibitors against abnormal androgen receptor functions will enrich prostate cancer treatments.

                Objective – To systematically review evidence on effectiveness of contact tracing apps (CTAs) for SARS-CoV-2 on epidemiological and clinical outcomes Design – Update of a systematic review (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050519) Data sources - EMBASE (OVID), MEDLINE (PubMed), BioRxiv, and MedRxiv were searched up to June 9th 2021 Study selection – Studies, empirical or model-based, assessing effect of CTAs for SARS-CoV-2 on quarantine rate, reproduction number (R), total number of infections, hospitalization, mortality, and other epidemiologically and clinically relevant outcomes, were eligible for inclusion. Data extraction – Empirical and model-based studies were both critically appraised based on dedicated quality and risk of bias assessment checklists. Data on type of study (i.e., empirical or model-based), sample size, (simulated) time horizon, study population, CTA type (and associated interventions), comparator, and outcomes assessed, were extracted. Key findings were extracted and narratively summarized. Specifically for model-based studies, characteristics and values of important model parameters were collected. Results – 5123 studies were identified, of which 27 studies (five empirical, 22 model-based studies) were eligible and included in this review. All empirical studies were observational (non-randomized) studies and either at unclear or high risk of bias, mostly due to uncontrolled confounding. Risk of bias of model-based studies was considered high for 7 of 22 studies. Most studies demonstrated beneficial effects of CTAs on R, total number of infections, hospitalization, and mortality. Effect size was dependent on other model parameter values (e.g., proportion of asymptomatic individuals, testing delays), but in general a beneficial effect was observed at CTA adoption rates of 20% and over. Conclusions – CTAs are potentially effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 related epidemiological and clinical outcomes, though effect size depends on other model parameter values. Methodologically sound comparative empirical studies on effectiveness of CTAs are lacking and would be desirable to confirm findings from model-based studies.

                The Lessons from Covid-19 Research Agenda offers a structure to study the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic response from a Global Catastrophic Risk (GCR) perspective. The agenda sets out the aims of our study, which is to investigate the key decisions and actions (or failures to decide or to act) that significantly altered the course of the pandemic, with the aim of improving disaster preparedness and response in the future. It also asks how we can transfer these lessons to other areas of (potential) global catastrophic risk management such as extreme climate change, radical loss of biodiversity and the governance of extreme risks posed by new technologies. Our study aims to identify key moments- ‘inflection points’- that significantly shaped the catastrophic trajectory of COVID-19. To that end this Research Agenda has identified four broad clusters where such inflection points are likely to exist: pandemic preparedness, early action, vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions. The aim is to drill down into each of these clusters to ascertain whether and how the course of the pandemic might have gone differently, both at the national and the global level, using counterfactual analysis. Four aspects are used to assess candidate inflection points within each cluster: 1. the information available at the time; 2. the decision-making processes used; 3. the capacity and ability to implement different courses of action, and 4. the communication of information and decisions to different publics. The Research Agenda identifies crucial questions in each cluster for all four aspects that should enable the identification of the key lessons from COVID-19 and the pandemic response.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Time to initiate randomized controlled clinical trials with methadone in cancer patients [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Public media coverage has fueled a demand for methadone as potential cure for cancer itself. Because patients have asked for respective prescriptions, clinical societies issued statements warning against the use of methadone as long as preclinical findings have not been supported by clinical evidence. In fact, not all preclinical data clearly support relevant effects. However, strong epidemiologic data suggest beneficial effects of methadone on cancer. Alternative explanations, namely better safety of methadone or hidden selection bias, seem less likely. This uncertainty can only be resolved by randomized controlled clinical trials. This review discusses all relevant data pertinent to methadone and cancer, uncovers supportive epidemiologic data, and suggests possible study designs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Current practices of physiotherapists in Switzerland regarding fall risk-assessment for community-dwelling older adults: A national cross-sectional survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Falls can strongly impact older people’s quality of life, health, and lifestyle. Multifactorial assessment can determine an individual’s risk of falling as the first step for fall prevention intervention. Physiotherapists have an essential role to play in assessing fall risk by older adults living in the community. In the absence of published data on this topic in Switzerland, this study investigated the current practices of physiotherapists to determine whether those are in line with recommendations. Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was undertaken among physiotherapists practising in Switzerland between the 21st of November and the 31st of December 2020. A priori and exploratory hypotheses were tested. Responses to open-ended questions were grouped into themes for analysis.  Results: A total of 938 questionnaires from all three language regions of Switzerland was analysed. Participants worked in different settings, with a higher representation of private practice self-employees (56%). Standardised fall risk assessments or instruments were used by 580 (62%) participants, while 235 (25%) preferred subjective assessment of fall risk only. Differences in fall risk assessment were observed according to the workplace setting (adjusted OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.7) and education level (trend test, p<0.001). The standardised assessments most frequently employed were the Berg Balance Scale (57.5%), the Timed-Up-and-Go (56.5%) and the Tinetti Balance Assessment tool (46.7%). Risk factors for falls were frequently queried, particularly history of falls (88.3%), home hazards (84.1%), and functional ability (81%). Technical resources (39.8%), knowledge (30.3%), and time (22.2%) were common barriers to implement a systematic fall risk assessment. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of the current practices of physiotherapists in Switzerland in fall risk assessment. There is still room to optimise the standardisation and systematisation of this assessment to implement a best practice strategy and prevent avoidable falls.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of forest honey (Apis dorsata) as therapy for ovarian failure causing malnutrition [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malnutrition is a crucial issue that contributes to approximately 45% of deaths among children under 5 years old and even >50% of deaths when accompanied by diarrhea. Several studies have stated that the use of honey can overcome cases of infertility due to malnutrition. Methods: An infertile female rat model with a degenerative ovary was induced with malnutrition through a 5-day food fasting but still had drinking water. The administration of (T1) 30% (v/v) and (T2) 50% (v/v) forest honey (Apis dorsata) were performed for ten consecutive days, whereas the (T+) group was fasted and not administered forest honey and the (T−) group has not fasted and not administered forest honey. Superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, IL-13 and TNF-α cytokine expressions, and ovarian tissue regeneration were analyzed. Results: Antioxidant activity (SOD) was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (65.24±7.53), T2 (74.16±12.3), and T− (65.09±6.56) compared with T+ (41.76±8.51). Oxidative stress (MDA) was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (9.71±1.53), T2 (9.23±0.96), and T− (9.83±1.46) compared with T+ (15.28±1.61). Anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-13) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (5.30±2.31), T2 (9.80±2.53), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (2.70±1.57). Pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) expression was significantly different (p<0.05) in T1 (4.40±3.02), T2 (2.50±1.65), and T− (0.30±0.48) compared with T+ (9.50±1.78). Ovarian tissue regeneration was significantly different (p<0.05) in T− (8.6±0.69) and T2 (5.10±0.99) compared with T1 (0.7±0.95) and T+ (0.3±0.67). Conclusion: The 10-day administration of 50% (v/v) forest honey can be an effective therapy for ovarian failure that caused malnutrition in the female rat model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention in octogenarian with acute-on-chronic kidney disease and total atrioventricular block after acute myocardial infarction [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Myocardial infarction (MI) is frequently complicated by the worsening of renal function. Undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) becomes crucial to a patient with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). With appropriate management of MI, acute-on-chronic kidney disease (ACKD) requiring dialysis post-MI remains an important clinical predictor of elevated in-hospital mortality among patients with MI.    In this study, we reported an octogenarian patient suffering from STEMI with ACKD and total atrioventricular block (TAVB). She underwent insertion of a temporary pacemaker and primary PCI. Renal function was improved after dialysis by decreasing the amount of serum creatinine from 8.1 mg/dL at admission to 1.05 mg/dL after primary PCI and dialysis. Primary PCI should still be considered for patients with acute MI, even though these patients have kidney disease, to save the heart muscle and even indirectly improve the kidney function itself.

                Early marriage practices undermine girls’ autonomy and seriously affect their physical and mental wellbeing. Monitoring the trends and understanding the drivers is essential in intervening against early marriage. However, many studies on early marriage in Ethiopia are cross-sectional, focusing only on the magnitude at a single point in time. Hence, we extracted data of girls of 10-17 years from Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Kersa HDSS) database for the period of 2008–2018 in order to examine the trends of early marriage. In this data note we provide the details of a research database of 24,452 girls in the age group of 10-17 years. The extracted data include date of marriage and the girls’ socio-demographic variables. Other variables considered to be potentially associated with timing of marriage were also extracted. The purpose of this publication is to describe the dataset for external researchers who may be interested in making use of it as a secondary use of their routinely collected data. This dataset is available at   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15034812.

                Background: The modern concept of oligometastatic (OM) state has been initially developed to describe patients with a low burden of disease and with a potential for cure with local ablative treatments. We systematically assessed the risk of death and relapse of oligometastatic (OM) cancers compared to cancers with more diffuse metastatic spread, through a meta-analysis of published data.  Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting prognosis of patients with OM solid tumors. Risk of death and relapse were extracted and pooled to provide an adjusted hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval (HR 95%CI).  The primary outcome of the study refers to overall mortality in OM vs. polymetastatic (PM) patients.  Results. Mortality and relapse associated with OM state in patients with cancer were evaluated among 104,234 participants (n=173 studies). Progression-free survival was better in patients with OM disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.62, 95% CI 0.57–0.68; P <.001; n=69 studies). Also, OM cancers were associated with a better overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68; P<.01; n=161 studies). In colorectal (CRC), breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) the reduction in the risk of death for OM patients were 35, 38, 30 and 42%, respectively. Biliary tract and cervical cancer do not significantly better in OM stage likely for paucity of data. Conclusions. Patients with OM cancers have a significantly better prognosis than those with more widespread stage IV tumors. In OM cancer patients a personalized approach should be pursued.

                Cholesterol granuloma is a rare non-infectious disease. Currently, there are no established guidelines, leaving the clinician to decide the best practice for each patient. A 43-year-old woman presented to the Surgery Clinic at Siloam General Hospital, Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, with the primary complaint of a painful mass located in her left breast over the previous week before being admitted to the hospital. The mass was found abruptly and was accompanied by severe pain and fever. On inspection, peau d’orange, nipple retraction, tenderness, and warmth of the skin were observed. Ultrasonography suggested a malignant mass. The primary diagnosis was breast cancer, with a secondary differential diagnosis of breast abscess. An open biopsy was chosen because a breast abscess was the possible diagnosis. The biopsy results showed characteristics of cholesterol granuloma. Following the operation, the pain score was notably reduced as the operation showed a satisfactory result. The primary purpose of this case report was to illustrate a case of breast abscess caused by cholesterol granuloma, in which open excisional biopsy and drainage was superior for pain reduction and faster recovery.

                Kim et al. review the emerging field of interorganelle contact sites, focusing on their role in organelle dynamics and interorganelle communication to maintain cellular homeostasis. In particular, they discuss how the disruptions in interorganelle contacts contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">FER-mediated phosphorylation and PIK3R2 recruitment on IRS4 promotes AKT activation and tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                Tyrosine phosphorylation, orchestrated by tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, modulates a multi-layered signaling network in a time- and space-dependent manner. Dysregulation of this post-translational modification is inevitably associated with pathological diseases. Our previous work has demonstrated that non-receptor tyrosine kinase FER is upregulated in ovarian cancer, knocking down which attenuates metastatic phenotypes. However, due to the limited number of known substrates in the ovarian cancer context, the molecular basis for its pro-proliferation activity remains enigmatic. Here, we employed mass spectrometry and biochemical approaches to identify insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) as a novel substrate of FER. FER engaged its kinase domain to associate with the PH and PTB domains of IRS4. Using a proximity-based tagging system in ovarian carcinoma-derived OVCAR-5 cells, we determined that FER-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr779 enables IRS4 to recruit PIK3R2/p85β, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, and activate the PI3K-AKT pathway. Rescuing <i>IRS4</i>-null ovarian tumor cells with phosphorylation-defective mutant, but not WT IRS4 delayed ovarian tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, we revealed a kinase-substrate mode between FER and IRS4, and the pharmacological inhibition of FER kinase may be beneficial for ovarian cancer patients with PI3K-AKT hyperactivation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A persistent behavioral state enables sustained predation of humans by mosquitoes</a></h4>

              
                Predatory animals pursue prey in a noisy sensory landscape, deciding when to continue or abandon their chase. The mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti</i> is a micropredator that first detects humans at a distance through sensory cues such as carbon dioxide. As a mosquito nears its target it senses more proximal cues such as body heat that guide it to a meal of blood. How long the search for blood continues after initial detection of a human is not known. Here we show that a 5-second optogenetic pulse of fictive carbon dioxide induced a persistent behavioral state in female mosquitoes that lasted for more than 10 minutes. This state is highly specific to females searching for a blood meal and was not induced in recently blood-fed females or in males, who do not feed on blood. In males that lack the gene <i>fruitless</i>, which controls persistent social behaviors in other insects, fictive carbon dioxide induced a long-lasting behavior response resembling the predatory state of females. Finally, we show that the persistent state triggered by detection of fictive carbon dioxide enabled females to engorge on a blood meal mimic offered up to 14 minutes after the initial 5-second stimulus. Our results demonstrate that a persistent internal state allows female mosquitoes to integrate multiple human sensory cues over long timescales, an ability that is key to their success as an apex micropredator of humans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lowland plant arrival in alpine ecosystems facilitates a decrease in soil carbon content under experimental climate warming</a></h4>

              
                Climate warming is releasing carbon from soils around the world<sup>1-3</sup>, constituting a positive climate feedback. Warming is also causing species to expand their ranges into new ecosystems<sup>4-9</sup>. Yet, in most ecosystems, whether range expanding species will amplify or buffer expected soil carbon loss is unknown<sup>10</sup>. Here we used two whole-community transplant experiments and a follow-up glasshouse experiment to determine whether the establishment of herbaceous lowland plants in alpine ecosystems influences soil carbon content under warming. We found that warming (transplantation to low elevation) led to a negligible decrease in alpine soil carbon content, but its effects became significant and 52% ± 31% (mean ± 95% CIs) larger after lowland plants were introduced at low density into the ecosystem. We present evidence that decreases in soil carbon content likely occurred <i>via</i> lowland plants increasing rates of root exudation, soil microbial respiration and CO<sub>2</sub> release under warming. Our findings suggest that warming-induced range expansions of herbaceous plants have the potential to alter climate feedbacks from this system, and that plant range expansions among herbaceous communities may be an overlooked mediator of warming effects on carbon dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">CREB5 reprograms FOXA1 nuclear interactions to promote resistance to androgen receptor targeting therapies</a></h4>

              
                Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC) are treated with therapies that antagonize the androgen receptor (AR). Nearly all patients develop resistance to AR-targeted therapies (ART). Our previous work identified CREB5 as an upregulated target gene in human mCRPC that promoted resistance to all clinically-approved ART. The mechanisms by which CREB5 promotes progression of mCRPC or other cancers remains elusive. Integrating ChIP-seq and rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy of endogenous proteins (RIME), we report that cells overexpressing CREB5 demonstrate extensive reprogramming of nuclear protein-protein interactions in response to the ART agent enzalutamide. Specifically, CREB5 physically interacts with AR, the pioneering actor FOXA1, and other known co-factors of AR and FOXA1 at transcription regulatory elements recently found to be active in mCRPC patients. We identified a subset of CREB5/FOXA1 co-interacting nuclear factors that have critical functions for AR transcription (GRHL2, HOXB13) while others (TBX3, NFIC) regulated cell viability and ART resistance and were amplified or overexpressed in mCRPC. Upon examining the nuclear protein interactions and the impact of CREB5 expression on the mCRPC patient transcriptome, we found CREB5 was associated with Wnt signaling and epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, implicating these pathways in CREB5/FOXA1-mediated ART resistance. Overall, these observations define the molecular interactions among CREB5, FOXA1, and pathways that promote ART resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reducing lipid bilayer stress by monounsaturated fatty acids protects renal proximal tubules in diabetes</a></h4>

              
                In diabetic patients, dyslipidemia frequently contributes to organ damage such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Dyslipidemia is associated with both excessive deposition of triacylglycerol (TAG) in lipid droplets (LD) and lipotoxicity. Yet, it is unclear how these two effects correlate with each other in the kidney and how they are influenced by dietary patterns. By using a diabetes mouse model, we find here that high fat diet enriched in the monounsaturated oleic acid (OA) caused more lipid storage in LDs in renal proximal tubular cells (PTC) but less tubular damage than a corresponding butter diet with the saturated palmitic acid (PA). This effect was particularly evident S2/S3 but not S1 segments of the proximal tubule. Combining transcriptomics, lipidomics and functional studies, we identify endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as the main cause of PA-induced PTC injury. Mechanistically, ER stress is caused by elevated levels of saturated TAG precursors, reduced LD formation and, consequently, higher membrane order in the ER. Simultaneous addition of OA rescues the cytotoxic effects by normalizing membrane order and by increasing both TAG and LD formation. Our study thus emphasizes the importance of monounsaturated fatty acids for the dietary management of DKD by preventing lipid bilayer stress in the ER and promoting TAG and LD formation in PTCs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inositol polyphosphate multikinase physically binds to the SWI/SNF complex and modulates BRG1 occupancy in mouse embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), a key enzyme in inositol polyphosphate (IP) metabolism, is a pleiotropic signaling factor involved in major biological events, including transcriptional control. In the yeast, IPMK and its IP products promote the activity of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, which plays a critical role in gene expression by regulating chromatin accessibility. However, the direct link between IPMK and chromatin remodelers remains unclear, raising the question of how IPMK contributes to transcriptional regulation in mammals. By employing unbiased screening approaches and in vivo/in vitro immunoprecipitation, here we demonstrate that mammalian IPMK physically interacts with the SWI/SNF complex by directly binding to SMARCB1, BRG1, and SMARCC1. Furthermore, we identified the specific domains required for IPMK-SMARCB1 binding. Notably, using CUT&RUN and ATAC-seq assays, we discovered that IPMK co-localizes with BRG1 and regulates BRG1 localization as well as BRG1-mediated chromatin accessibility in a genome-wide manner in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together, these findings show that IPMK regulates the promoter targeting of the SWI/SNF complex, thereby contributing to SWI/SNF-meditated chromatin accessibility, transcription, and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conserved structural elements specialize ATAD1 as a membrane protein extraction machine</a></h4>

              
                The mitochondrial AAA protein ATAD1 (in humans; Msp1 in yeast) removes mislocalized membrane proteins, as well as stuck import substrates from the mitochondrial outer membrane, facilitating their re-insertion into their cognate organelles and maintaining mitochondria's protein import capacity. In doing so, it helps to maintain proteostasis in mitochondria. How ATAD1 tackles the energetic challenge to extract hydrophobic membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and what structural features adapt ATAD1 for its particular function has remained a mystery. Previously, we determined the structure of Msp1 in complex with a peptide substrate (Wang et al., 2020). The structure showed that Msp1's mechanism follows the general principle established for AAA proteins while adopting several structural features that specialize it for its function. Among these features in Msp1 was the utilization of multiple aromatic amino acids to firmly grip the substrate in the central pore. However, it was not clear whether the aromatic nature of these amino acids were required, or if they could be functionally replaced by aliphatic amino acids. In this work, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the human ATAD1 in complex with a peptide substrate at near atomic resolution. The structures show that phylogenetically conserved structural elements adapt ATAD1 for its function while generally adopting a conserved mechanism shared by many AAA proteins. We developed a microscopy-based assay reporting on protein mislocalization, with which we directly assessed ATAD1's activity in live cells and showed that both aromatic amino acids in pore-loop 1 are required for ATAD1’s function and cannot be substituted by aliphatic amino acids. A short α-helix at the C-terminus strongly facilitates ATAD1's oligomerization, a structural feature that distinguishes ATAD1 from its closely related proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient neural codes naturally emerge through gradient descent learning</a></h4>

              
                Animal sensory systems are more sensitive to common features in the environment than uncommon features. For example, small deviations from the more frequently encountered horizontal orientations can be more easily detected than small deviations from the less frequent diagonal ones. Here we find that artificial neural networks trained to recognize objects also have patterns of sensitivity that match the statistics of features in images. To interpret these findings, we show mathematically that learning with gradient descent in deep neural networks preferentially creates representations that are more sensitive to common features, a hallmark of efficient coding. This result suggests that efficient coding naturally emerges from gradient-like learning on natural stimuli.

                The most common genetic mutation found in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as fronto-temporal dementia (FTD), is a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene. C9orf72 is highly expressed in human myeloid cells, and although neuroinflammation and microglial pathology are widely found in ALS/FTD, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells (hiPSC-MG) harbouring C9orf72 mutation (mC9-MG) together with gene-corrected isogenic controls (isoC9-MG) and C9ORF72 knock-out hiPSC-MG (C9KO-MG), we show that reduced C9ORF72 protein is associated with impaired phagocytosis and an exaggerated inflammatory response upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, driven by sustained activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-B signalling. Analysis of the hiPSC-MG C9ORF72 interactome revealed an association of C9ORF72 with key regulators of autophagy, a process involved in the homeostatic regulation of the innate immune response. We found impaired initiation of autophagy in C9KO-MG and mC9-MG. Furthermore, through motor neuron-microglial (MN-MG) co-culture studies, we identified that autophagy deficit in mC9-MG led to increased vulnerability of C9 MNs to excitotoxic stimulus. Pharmacological activation of autophagy ameliorated the sustained activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-{kappa}B signalling, reversed the phagocytic deficit found in mC9-MG and also reduced MN death in MN-MG co-cultures. We validated these findings in blood-derived macrophages from people with C9orf72 mutation. Our results reveal an important role for C9ORF72 in regulating microglial immune homeostasis and identify dysregulation in human myeloid cells as a contributor to neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD.

                We previously showed the prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) induced precocious growth of E15.5 internal capsule axons. We set out to further delineate which axon tracts were affected and a potential mechanism for this phenomenon. Pregnant Swiss Webster mice were exposed to saline or 20% ethanol via subcutaneous injection from embryonic days (E) 7.5 until E14.5. E15.5 embryos were captured via C-section and brains were either fixed for immunostaining or flash frozen for tissue punches. To identify internal capsule axons we performed immunohistochemistry using L1 antibody to visualize all internal capsule axons and NetrinG1 antibody to identify thalamocortical axons specifically. mRNA was extracted from tissue punches to visualize Slit1, Robo1, Slit2, and Robo2 gene expression levels via real time RT PCR. We found that L1-expressing axons exhibited increased axon crossing in females with the opposite effect in males and no difference in Netrin-G1-expressing axons. We also found PAE increased Robo1 mRNA. Taken together, our results indicate that PAE elicits specific effects on axon trajectories, potentially via the Slit/Robo guidance family of repellents and receptors. These findings add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating alcohol disruptions of axon growth and guidance during embryonic development that may contribute to connectivity errors that characterize Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.

                Background: Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed complex and heterogeneous patterns of aberrant functional connectivity (FC) in multiple sclerosis (MS), yet it remains unclear how time-resolved FC relates to variance in clinical disease severity. Objective: To characterize brain activity in MS patients with time-resolved FC analysis and explore the relationship between disease severity, multi-domain impairments, and altered network dynamics. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI data were acquired from 101 MS patients and 101 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Dynamic FC analysis identified five connectivity states that were compared between HC and patients with high vs. low disability. Results: Patients with higher disease severity exhibited a more widespread spatiotemporal pattern of altered FC and spent more time in a high-connectivity, low-occurrence state compared to patients with lower disease severity and HC. Depressive symptom severity was positively related to functional dynamics on global and network scales in patients, while fatigue and motor impairment were inversely related to frontoparietal network connectivity with the basal ganglia. Conclusions: Time-resolved FC analysis uncovered alterations in network dynamics and clinical correlations that remained undetected with a static account of brain activity. Such time-varying approaches are thus crucial for disentangling the relationship between brain dynamics, disease severity, and symptoms in MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Beyond the Euclidean brain: inferring non-Euclidean latent trajectories from spike trains</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience faces a growing need for scalable data analysis methods that reduce the dimensionality of population recordings yet retain key aspects of the computation or behaviour. To extract interpretable latent trajectories from neural data, it is critical to embrace the inherent topology of the features of interest: head direction evolves on a ring or torus, 3D body rotations on the special orthogonal group, and navigation is best described in the intrinsic coordinates of the environment. Accordingly, we recently proposed the manifold Gaussian process latent variable model (mGPLVM) to simultaneously infer latent representations on non-Euclidean manifolds and how neurons are tuned to these representations. This probabilistic method generalizes previous Euclidean models and allows principled selection between candidate latent topologies. While powerful, mGPLVM makes two unjustified approximations that limit its practical applicability to neural datasets. First, consecutive latent states are assumed independent a priori, whereas behaviour is continuous in time. Second, its Gaussian noise model is inappropriate for positive integer spike counts. Previous work in Euclidean LVMs such as GPFA has shown significant improvements in performance when modeling such features appropriately. Here, we extend mGPLVM by incorporating temporally continuous priors over latent states and flexible count-based noise models. This improves inference on synthetic data, avoiding negative spike count predictions and discontinuous jumps in latent trajectories. On real data, we also mitigate these pathologies while improving model fit compared to the original mGPLVM formulation. In summary, our extended mGPLVM provides a widely applicable tool for inferring (non-)Euclidean neural representations from large-scale, heterogeneous population recordings. We provide an efficient implementation in python, relying on recent advances in approximate inference to e.g. fit 10,000 time bins of recording for 100 neurons in five minutes on a single GPU.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping odorant sensitivities reveals a sparse but structured representation of olfactory chemical space by sensory input to the mouse olfactory bulb.</a></h4>

              
                In olfactory systems, convergence of sensory neurons onto glomeruli generates a map of odorant receptor identity. How glomerular maps relate to sensory space remains unclear. We sought to better characterize this relationship in the mouse olfactory system by defining glomeruli in terms of the odorants to which they are most sensitive. Using high-throughput odorant delivery and ultrasensitive imaging of sensory inputs, we imaged responses to 185 odorants presented at concentrations determined to activate only one or a few glomeruli across the dorsal olfactory bulb. The resulting datasets defined the tuning properties of glomeruli - and, by inference, their cognate odorant receptors - in a low-concentration regime, and yielded consensus maps of glomerular sensitivity across a wide range of chemical space. Glomeruli were extremely narrowly tuned, with ~25% responding to only one odorant, and extremely sensitive, responding to their effective odorants at sub-picomolar to nanomolar concentrations. Such narrow tuning in this concentration regime allowed for reliable functional identification of many glomeruli based on a single diagnostic odorant. At the same time, the response spectra of glomeruli responding to multiple odorants was best predicted by straightforward odorant structural features, and glomeruli sensitive to distinct odorants with common structural features were spatially clustered. These results define an underlying structure to the primary representation of sensory space by the mouse olfactory system.

                Reproduction alters animal behavior and physiology, but neuronal circuits that coordinate these changes remain largely unknown. Insights into mechanisms that regulate and possibly coordinate reproduction-related traits could be gleaned from the study of sex pheromones that manipulate potential mating partners to improve reproductive success. In C. elegans, the prominent male pheromone, ascr#10, modifies reproductive behavior and several aspects of reproductive physiology in hermaphrodite recipients, including improving oocyte quality. Here we show that a circuit that contains serotonin-producing and serotonin-uptaking neurons plays a key role in mediating these beneficial effects of ascr#10. We also demonstrate that increased serotonergic signaling promotes proliferation of germline progenitors in adult hermaphrodites. Our results establish a role for serotonin in maintaining germline quality and highlight a simple neuronal circuit that acts as a linchpin that couples food intake, mating behavior, reproductive output, and germline renewal and provisioning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Voluntary and forced exposure to ethanol vapor produces similar escalation of alcohol drinking but differential recruitment of brain regions related to stress, habit, and reward in male rats.</a></h4>

              
                A major limitation of the most widely used current animal models of alcohol dependence is that they use forced exposure to ethanol including ethanol-containing liquid diet and chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor to produce clinically relevant blood alcohol levels (BAL) and addiction-like behaviors. We recently developed a novel animal model of voluntary induction of alcohol dependence using ethanol vapor self-administration (EVSA). In this model, naive outbred rats given intermittent access to alcohol vapor self-administration exhibit BAL in the 150-300 mg% range and develop somatic signs of withdrawal during acute abstinence. However, it is unknown whether EVSA leads to an escalation of alcohol drinking per se, and whether such escalation is associated with neuroadaptations in brain regions related to stress, reward, and habit. To address these issues, we compared the levels of alcohol drinking during withdrawal between rats passively exposed to alcohol (CIE) or voluntarily exposed to EVSA and measured the number of Fos+ neurons during acute withdrawal (16 h) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), dorsomedial striatum (DMS), dorsolateral striatum (DLS), nucleus accumbens core (Nacc), periaqueducal grey area (PAG), lateral Habenula (HbL), and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT). The rats were first trained to orally self-administer alcohol in standard operant chambers and then divided in 4 groups (CIE, CI-Air, EVSA and Air-SA) and exposed to intermittent ethanol vapor (passive or active) or intermittent air (passive or active) for 8 h/day, 3 days a week. CIE and EVSA rats exhibited similar BAL (150-300 mg% range) and similar escalation of alcohol drinking during withdrawal, while no changes in terms of drinking were observed in the air exposed rats. CIE and EVSA also increased the motivation for alcohol compared to their respective air control groups under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Acute withdrawal from EVSA and CIE recruited a similar number of Fos+ neurons in the CeA, however, acute withdrawal from EVSA recruited a higher number of Fos+ neurons in every other brain region analyzed compared to acute withdrawal from CIE. Moreover, acute withdrawal from EVSA specifically recruited the DMS and PVT, a pattern not observed in CIE rats. In summary, these results demonstrate that EVSA produces similar escalation of alcohol drinking, motivation to drink, and blood-alcohol levels than the CIE model, while letting animals voluntary initiate alcohol exposure and maintain alcohol dependence. Moreover, while the behavioral measures of alcohol dependence between the voluntary (EVSA) and passive (CIE) model was similar, the recruitment of neuronal ensembles during acute withdrawal was very different with a higher recruitment of Fos+ neurons in key brain regions important for stress, reward and habit-related processes. The EVSA model may be particularly useful to unveil the neuronal networks and pharmacology responsible for the voluntary induction and maintenance of alcohol dependence and may improve translational studies by providing preclinical researchers with an animal model with better face validity for alcohol use disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep does not influence schema-facilitated motor memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Study Objectives: Novel information is rapidly learned when it is compatible with previous knowledge. This 'schema' effect, initially described for declarative memories, was recently extended to the motor memory domain. Importantly, this beneficial effect was only observed 24 hours, but not immediately, following motor schema acquisition. Given the established role of sleep in memory consolidation, we hypothesized that sleep following the initial learning of a schema is necessary for the subsequent rapid integration of novel motor information. Methods: Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of diurnal and nocturnal sleep on schema-mediated motor sequence memory consolidation. In Experiment 1, participants first learned an 8-element motor sequence through repeated practice (Session 1). They were then afforded a 90-minute nap opportunity (N=25) or remained awake (N=25) before learning a second motor sequence (Session 2) which was highly compatible with that learned prior to the sleep/wake interval. Experiment 2 was similar; however, Sessions 1 and 2 were separated by a 12-hour interval that included nocturnal sleep (N=28) or only wakefulness (N=29). Results: For both experiments, we found no group differences in motor sequence performance (reaction time and accuracy) following the sleep/wake interval. Furthermore, in Experiment 1, we found no correlation between sleep features (non-REM sleep duration, spindle and slow wave activity) and post-sleep behavioral performance. Conclusions: The results of this research suggest that integration of novel motor information into a cognitive-motor schema does not specifically benefit from post-learning sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All the ways your eyes can move if you don't look: Eyeball lifting, retraction and compression during blinks</a></h4>

              
                Blinks occur frequently in normal life and have increasingly been linked to perceptual and cognitive effects. However, the oculomechanics of blink-related eye movements remain mostly uncharted territory. While it has been known for a long time that the eye is being pulled back into its socket during a blink due to co-contraction of extraocular muscles, this elusive eye motion has not been studied in detail due to the technical difficulties that go along with a closed eyelid. Here we use dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to obtain videos of this motion and analyse the kinematics with the recently developed MREyeTrack algorithm. We show that the eye is not only retracted but also lifted up during a blink. For some participants we observed eyeball lifting by up to 3 mm, far exceeding the amount of translation believed to occur during natural eye movements. Slow blinks can be accompanied by large tonic rotations of up to 15 degree. Furthermore, we collected evidence that the co-contraction of extraocular muscles leads to a slight compression of the eyeball. These findings demonstrate the surprising complexity of ocular motility and offer new opportunities to study orbital mechanics in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gateway Identity and Spatial Remapping in a Combined Grid and Place Cell Attractor.</a></h4>

              
                The spatial specificities of hippocampal place cells, i.e., their firing fields, are subject to change if the rat enters a new compartment in the experimental maze. This effect is known as remapping. It cannot be explained from path integration (grid cell activity) and local sensory cues alone but requires additional knowledge of the different compartments, other types of "context", or the gateways that lead into each compartment. Here we present a model for the hippocampal-entorhinal interplay in which the activity of place and grid cells follows a joint attractor dynamic. Place cells depend on the current grid cell activity but can also reset the grid cell activity in the remapping process. Remapping is triggered by the recognition of a gateway, for example by visual cues (not modeled in this paper). When this happens, the previously stored pattern of place cell activity for this gateway is reactivated from a "gateway database". The joint attractor will then reinstate the grid cell pattern that was active when the gateway had first been learned and path integration can proceed from there. The model is tested with various mazes used in the experimental literature and reproduces the published results. We also make testable predictions for remapping in a new maze type. We hypothesize the existence of "gate cells" that drive the place cells and with them the joint hippocampal-entorhinal loop into the corresponding attractor whenever a gate is detected.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strategic exploration in the macaque prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans have been shown to strategically explore. They can identify situations in which gathering information about distant and uncertain options is beneficial for the future. Because primates rely on scare resources when they forage, they are also thought to strategically explore, but whether they use the same strategies as humans and the neural bases of strategic exploration in monkeys are largely unknown. We designed a sequential choice task to investigate whether monkeys mobilize strategic exploration based on whether that information can improve subsequent choice, but also to ask the novel question about whether monkeys adjust their exploratory choices based on the contingency between choice and information, by sometimes providing the counterfactual feedback, about the option not chosen. We show that monkeys decreased their reliance on expected value when exploration could be beneficial, but this was not mediated by changes in the effect of uncertainty on choices. We found strategic exploratory signals in anterior and mid-cingulate cortex (ACC/MCC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). This network was most active when a low value option was chosen which suggests a role in counteracting expected value signals, when exploration away from value should to be considered. Such strategic exploration was abolished when the counterfactual feedback was available. Learning from counterfactual outcome was associated with the recruitment of a different circuit centered on the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), where we showed that monkeys represent chosen and unchosen reward prediction errors. Overall, our study shows how ACC/MCC-dlPFC and OFC circuits together could support exploitation of available information to the fullest and drive behavior towards finding more information through exploration when it is beneficial.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural signals encoded by specific frequencies of closed-loop electrical stimulation structurally and functionally reconstruct spinal sensorimotor circuits after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Epidural electrical stimulation restores locomotion in animals and humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the coding rules underlying electrical stimulation remain poorly understood, which has greatly limited the application of such electrical neuromodulation techniques in SCI clinical treatment. To elucidate the coding rules of electrical stimulation on spinal sensorimotor circuit reconstruction after complete SCI, we initially developed a spinal-muscle closed-loop stimulation protocol to mimic feedforward and feedback electrical signals in spinal sensorimotor circuits. Afterwards, using methods of sensorimotor function evaluation, neural circuit tracing and neural signal recording, we discovered a unique stimulus frequency of 10-20 Hz under closed loop conditions was required for structural and functional reconstruction of spinal sensorimotor circuits. The single-cell transcriptome analysis of activated motoneurons characterized molecular networks involved in spinal sensorimotor circuit reconstruction. This study provides insights into neural signal decoding during spinal sensorimotor circuit reconstruction, and indicates a technological approach for the clinical treatment of SCI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective auditory attention modulates cortical responses to sound location change for speech in quiet and in babble</a></h4>

              
                Listeners use the spatial location or change in spatial location of coherent acoustic cues to aid in auditory object formation. From stimulus-evoked onset responses in normal-hearing listeners using electroencephalography (EEG), we have previously shown measurable tuning to stimuli changing location in quiet, revealing a potential window into cortical object formation. These earlier studies used non-fluctuating, spectrally narrow stimuli, so it was still unknown whether previous observations would translate to speech stimuli and whether responses would be preserved for stimuli in the presence of background maskers. To examine the effects that selective auditory attention and interferers have on object formation, we measured cortical responses to speech changing location in the free field with and without background babble (+6 dB SNR) during both passive and active conditions. Active conditions required listeners to respond to the onset of the speech stream when it occurred at a new location, explicitly indicating yes or no to whether the stimulus occurred at a block-specific location either 30 degrees to the left or right of midline. In the aggregate, results show similar evoked responses to speech stimuli changing location in quiet compared to babble background. However, the effect of the two background environments diverges when considering the magnitude and direction of the location change, in which there was a clear influence of change vector in quiet but not in babble. Therefore, consistent with challenges associated with cocktail party listening, directed spatial attention can be shunted in the presence of stimulus noise and likely leads to poorer use of spatial cues in auditory streaming.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampus Modulates Natural Sound Processing at Early Auditory Centers</a></h4>

              
                Despite its prominence in learning and memory, hippocampal influence in early auditory processing centers remains unknown. Here, we examined how hippocampal activity modulates sound-evoked responses in the auditory midbrain and thalamus using optogenetics and functional MRI (fMRI) in rodents. Ventral hippocampus (vHP) excitatory neuron stimulation at 5 Hz evoked robust hippocampal activity that propagates to the primary auditory cortex. We then tested 5Hz vHP stimulation paired with either natural vocalizations or artificial/noise acoustic stimuli. vHP stimulation enhanced auditory responses to vocalizations (with a negative or positive valence) in the inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex, but not to their temporally reversed counterparts (artificial sounds) or broadband noise. Meanwhile, pharmacological vHP inactivation diminished response selectivity to vocalizations. These results directly reveal the large-scale hippocampal participation in natural sound processing at early centers of the ascending auditory pathway. They expand our present understanding of hippocampus in global auditory networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A spatial map of antennal-expressed olfactory ionotropic receptors in the malaria mosquito</a></h4>

              
                The malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii uses odors to guide various behaviors such as host-seeking. The detection of behaviorally relevant odors is mediated by a diverse family of receptors including the olfactory Ionotropic Receptors (IRs). Olfactory receptors are expressed on olfactory neurons, with the mosquito antennae representing the main olfactory appendage for detecting volatile chemical cues from the environment. It is currently unknown how many neurons across the antenna express a certain IR, or how these IR-expressing neurons are spatially arranged. Here, we performed whole mount fluorescent in situ hybridization of all IRs expressed in the antennae. The organization of IR-positive cells within an antennal segment (flagellomere) appeared stereotyped across multiple antennae. The spatial map of IR-expressing neurons revealed that the antenna might be organized into proximal and distal functional domains. Highly expressed tuning (odor-binding) IRs exhibit distinct co-localization patterns with cognate IR co-receptor(s) in a combinatorial fashion that might predict their functional properties. These findings reveal organizing principles of Anopheles IR-expressing neurons in the mosquito which might underlie their functional contribution to the detection of behaviorally relevant odors.

	<p>Most children use their fingers when learning to count and calculate. These sensorimotor experiences were argued to underlie reported behavioral associations of finger gnosis and counting with mathematical skills. On the neural level, associations were assumed to originate from overlapping neural representations of fingers and numbers. This study explored whether finger-based training in children would lead to specific neural activation in the sensorimotor cortex, associated with finger movements, as well as the parietal cortex, associated with number processing, during mental arithmetic. Following finger-based training during the first year of school, trained children showed finger-related arithmetic effects accompanied by activation in the sensorimotor cortex potentially associated with implicit finger movements. This indicates embodied finger-based numerical representations after training. Results for differences in neural activation between trained children and a control group in the IPS were less conclusive. This study provides the first evidence for training-induced sensorimotor plasticity in brain development potentially driven by the explicit use of fingers for initial arithmetic, supporting an embodied perspective on the representation of numbers.</p>

	<p>Many concepts of the human personality are based on assumptions about underlying physiological processes. The most prominent example is probably the concept of extraversion introduced by H.J. Eysenck decades ago. However, more recent approaches also propose that personality traits may be reflected by physiological processes. For example, empathic personality dimensions have been linked to tactile perception, suggesting that individuals with higher tactile sensitivity are also more empathetic to the sensations of others. Another recent example is the concept of sensory processing sensitivity, which has been linked to enhanced primary sensory processing. However, the exact relationship between tactile abilities and personality is still unclear, thus the current study aims to test whether different personality dimensions affect the performance in a tactile acuity task. Tactile abilities of healthy participants were tested with tactile 2-point-thresholds on the hands. Personality dimensions were examined with respect to empathy, sensory processing sensitivity, and the Big Five. Results revealed that empathy, but not sensory processing sensitivity, was associated with tactile performance. We conclude that the ability to feel with someone else seems to be linked to the perception of our own body. Thus, the sense of touch may play an important role for empathy. We discuss explanations of these results and highlight possible implications of our findings.</p>

	<p>Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction involving occipital cortical damage can give rise to contralateral homonymous hemianopia. Here, we report two rare cases of patients with lesions in the left hemisphere PCA territory who developed right visuo-spatial neglect. One patient suffered right hemianopia and right visuo-spatial neglect after a stroke that damaged the left primary visual cortex and the callosal splenial fibers. The other unique case is of a patient who had a brain tumor in the posterior cerebral region in the left hemisphere and initially exhibited only right hemianopia that developed into right visuo-spatial neglect after tumor resection that included the splenial fibers. These cases indicate that, as in cases with damage in the right PCA territory, lesions in the left PCA yield visuo-spatial neglect when the damage produces contralateral hemianopia and concomitant disconnection of the splenium of the corpus callosum, which interferes with the arrival of visual inputs from the intact right to the lesioned left hemisphere. These results also emphasize the necessity of sparing the splenial fibers in surgical interventions in patients who exhibit hemianopia.</p>

	<p>In everyday life, goal-oriented motor behaviour relies on the estimation of the rewards/costs associated with alternative actions and on the appropriate selection of movements. Motor decision making is defined as the process by which a motor plan is chosen among a set of competing actions based on the expected value. In the present literature review we discuss evidence from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies of motor control. We focus primarily on studies of action selection for instructed movements and motor decision making. In the first section, we delve into the usefulness of various TMS paradigms to characterise the contribution of motor areas and distributed brain networks to cued action selection. Then, we address the influence of motivational information (e.g., reward and biomechanical cost) in guiding action choices based on TMS findings. Finally, we conclude that TMS represents a powerful tool for elucidating the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying action choices in humans.</p>

	<p>Brain science, an emerging, dynamic, multidisciplinary basic research field, is generating numerous valuable data. However, there are still several obstacles for the utilization of these data, such as data fragmentation, heterogeneity, availability, and annotation divergence. Thus, to overcome these obstacles and construct an online community, we developed a panoramic database named Brain Research Hotspot Database (BRHD). As of 30 January 2022, the database had been integrated with standardized vocabularies from various resources, including 423,681 papers, 46,344 patents, 9585 transcriptomic datasets, 261 cell markers, as well as with information regarding brain initiatives that were officially launched and well-known scholars in brain research. Based on the keywords entered by users and the search options they set, data can be accessed and retrieved through exact and fuzzy search scenarios. In addition, for brain diseases, we developed three featured functions based on deep data mining: (1) a brain disease&amp;amp;ndash;genome network, which collects the associations between common brain diseases, genes, and mutations reported in the literature; (2) brain and gut microbiome associations, based on the literature related to this topic, with added annotations for reference; (3) 3D brain structure, containing a high-precision brain anatomy model with visual links to quickly connect to an organ-on-a-chip database. In short, the BRHD integrates data from a variety of brain science resources to provide a friendly user interface and freely accessible viewing and downloading environment. Furthermore, the original functions developed based on these data provide references and insights for brain research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Ca2+-Dependent Mechanism Boosting Glycolysis and OXPHOS by Activating Aralar-Malate-Aspartate Shuttle, upon Neuronal Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calcium is an important second messenger regulating a bioenergetic response to the workloads triggered by neuronal activation. In embryonic mouse cortical neurons using glucose as only fuel, activation by NMDA elicits a strong workload (ATP demand)-dependent on Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and stimulates glucose uptake, glycolysis, pyruvate and lactate production, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent way. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> upregulation of glycolysis, pyruvate levels, and respiration, but not glucose uptake, all depend on Aralar/AGC1/Slc25a12, the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier, component of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). MAS activation increases glycolysis, pyruvate production, and respiration, a process inhibited in the presence of BAPTA-AM, suggesting that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding motifs in Aralar may be involved in the activation. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) silencing had no effect, indicating that none of these processes required MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. The neuronal respiratory response to carbachol was also dependent on Aralar, but not on MCU. We find that mouse cortical neurons are endowed with a constitutive ER-to-mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> flow maintaining basal cell bioenergetics in which ryanodine receptors, RyR2, rather than InsP<SUB>3</SUB>R, are responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, and in which MCU does not participate. The results reveal that, in neurons using glucose, MCU does not participate in OXPHOS regulation under basal or stimulated conditions, while Aralar-MAS appears as the major Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway tuning simultaneously glycolysis and OXPHOS to neuronal activation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal activation increases cell workload to restore ion gradients altered by activation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in matching increased workload with ATP production, but the mechanisms are still unknown. We find that glycolysis, pyruvate production, and neuronal respiration are stimulated on neuronal activation in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent way, independently of effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as workload inducer. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) does not play a relevant role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulated pyruvate production and oxygen consumption as both are unchanged in MCU silenced neurons. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation is blunt in the absence of Aralar, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding mitochondrial carrier component of Malate-Aspartate Shuttle (MAS). The results suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated Aralar-MAS activation upregulates glycolysis and pyruvate production, which fuels mitochondrial respiration, through regulation of cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglia Drive Pockets of Neuroinflammation in Middle Age</a></h4>

              
                <p>During aging, microglia produce inflammatory factors, show reduced tissue surveillance, altered interactions with synapses, and prolonged responses to CNS insults, positioning these cells to have profound impact on the function of nearby neurons. We and others recently showed that microglial attributes differ significantly across brain regions in young adult mice. However, the degree to which microglial properties vary during aging is largely unexplored. Here, we analyze and manipulate microglial aging within the basal ganglia, brain circuits that exhibit prominent regional microglial heterogeneity and where neurons are vulnerable to functional decline and neurodegenerative disease. In male and female mice, we demonstrate that VTA and SNc microglia exhibit unique and premature responses to aging, compared with cortex and NAc microglia. This is associated with localized VTA/SNc neuroinflammation that may compromise synaptic function as early as middle age. Surprisingly, systemic inflammation, local neuron death, and astrocyte aging do not appear to underlie these early aging responses of VTA and SNc microglia. Instead, we found that microglial lysosome status was tightly linked to early aging of VTA microglia. Microglial ablation/repopulation normalized VTA microglial lysosome swelling and suppressed increases in VTA microglial density during aging. In contrast, CX3CR1 receptor KO exacerbated VTA microglial lysosome rearrangements and VTA microglial proliferation during aging. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated regional variation in onset and magnitude of microglial proliferation and inflammatory factor production during aging and highlight critical links between microglial lysosome status and local microglial responses to aging.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia are CNS cells that are equipped to regulate neuronal health and function throughout the lifespan. We reveal that microglia in select brain regions begin to proliferate and produce inflammatory factors in late middle age, months before microglia in other brain regions. These findings demonstrate that CNS neuroinflammation during aging is not uniform. Moreover, they raise the possibility that local microglial responses to aging play a critical role in determining which populations of neurons are most vulnerable to functional decline and neurodegenerative disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptotagmins 1 and 7 Play Complementary Roles in Somatodendritic Dopamine Release</a></h4>

              
                <p>The molecular mechanisms underlying somatodendritic dopamine (DA) release remain unresolved, despite the passing of decades since its discovery. Our previous work showed robust release of somatodendritic DA in submillimolar extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB>). Here we tested the hypothesis that the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), is a key determinant of somatodendritic DA release and its Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence. Somatodendritic DA release from SNc DA neurons was assessed using whole-cell recording in midbrain slices from male and female mice to monitor evoked DA-dependent D2 receptor-mediated inhibitory currents (D2ICs). Single-cell application of an antibody to Syt7 (Syt7 Ab) decreased pulse train-evoked D2ICs, revealing a functional role for Syt7. The assessment of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of pulse train-evoked D2ICs confirmed robust DA release in submillimolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB> in wild-type (WT) neurons, but loss of this sensitivity with intracellular Syt7 Ab or in Syt7 knock-out (KO) mice. In millimolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB>, pulse train-evoked D2ICs in Syt7 KOs showed a greater reduction in decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB> than seen in WT mice; the effect on single pulse-evoked DA release, however, did not differ between genotypes. Single-cell application of a Syt1 Ab had no effect on train-evoked D2ICs in WT SNc DA neurons, but did cause a decrease in D2IC amplitude in Syt7 KOs, indicating a functional substitution of Syt1 for Syt7. In addition, Syt1 Ab decreased single pulse-evoked D2ICs in WT cells, indicating the involvement of Syt1 in tonic DA release. Thus, Syt7 and Syt1 play complementary roles in somatodendritic DA release from SNc DA neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The respective Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of somatodendritic and axonal dopamine (DA) release differs, resulting in the persistence of somatodendritic DA release in submillimolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations too low to support axonal release. We demonstrate that synaptotagmin7 (Syt7), a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, underlies phasic somatodendritic DA release and its Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In contrast, we found that synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor underlying axonal DA release, plays a role in tonic, but not phasic, somatodendritic DA release in wild-type mice. However, Syt1 can facilitate phasic DA release after Syt7 deletion. Thus, we show that both Syt1 and Syt7 act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors subserving different aspects of somatodendritic DA release processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mllt11 Regulates Migration and Neurite Outgrowth of Cortical Projection Neurons during Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>The formation of connections within the mammalian neocortex is highly regulated by both extracellular guidance mechanisms and intrinsic gene expression programs. There are two types of cortical projection neurons (CPNs): those that project locally and interhemispherically and those that project to subcerebral structures such as the thalamus, hindbrain, and spinal cord. The regulation of cortical projection morphologies is not yet fully understood at the molecular level. Here, we report a role for Mllt11 (Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia; translocated to chromosome 11/All1 Fused Gene From Chromosome 1q) in the migration and neurite outgrowth of callosal projection neurons during mouse brain formation. We show that <I>Mllt11</I> expression is exclusive to developing neurons and is enriched in the developing cortical plate (CP) during the formation of the superficial cortical layers. In cultured primary cortical neurons, Mllt11 is detected in varicosities and growth cones as well as the soma. Using conditional loss-of-function and gain-of-function analysis we show that Mllt11 is required for neuritogenesis and proper migration of upper layer CPNs. Loss of <I>Mllt11</I> in the superficial cortex of male and female neonates leads to a severe reduction in fibers crossing the corpus callosum (CC), a progressive loss in the maintenance of upper layer projection neuron gene expression, and reduced complexity of dendritic arborization. Proteomic analysis revealed that Mllt11 associates with stabilized microtubules, and <I>Mllt11</I> loss affected microtubule staining in callosal axons. Taken together, our findings support a role for Mllt11 in promoting the formation of mature upper-layer neuron morphologies and connectivity in the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The regulation of cortical projection neuron (CPN) morphologies is an area of active investigation since the time of Cajal. Yet the molecular mechanisms of how the complex dendritic and axonal morphologies of projection neurons are formed remains incompletely understood. Although conditional mutagenesis analysis in the mouse, coupled with overexpression assays in the developing fetal brain, we show that a novel protein called Mllt11 is sufficient and necessary to regulate the dendritic and axonal characteristics of callosal projection neurons in the developing mammalian neocortex. Furthermore, we show that Mllt11 interacts with microtubules, likely accounting for its role in neuritogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Oxytocin Receptor-Expressing Neurons in the Paraventricular Thalamus Regulate Feeding Motivation through Excitatory Projections to the Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxytocin receptors (OTR) have been found in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) for the regulation of feeding and maternal behaviors. However, the functional projections of OTR-expressing PVT neurons remain largely unknown. Here, we used chemogenetic and optogenetic tools to test the role of OTR-expressing PVT neurons and their projections in the regulation of food intake in both male and female OTR-Cre mice. We found chemogenetic activation of OTR-expressing PVT neurons promoted food seeking under trials with a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Using Feeding Experimentation Devices for real-time meal measurements, we found chemogenetic activation of OTR-expressing PVT neurons increased meal frequency but not cumulative food intake because of a compensatory decrease in meal sizes. In combination with anterograde neural tracing and slice patch-clamp recordings, we found optogenetic stimulation of PVT OTR terminals excited neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) as well as local PVT neurons through monosynaptic glutamatergic transmissions. Photostimulation of OTR-expressing PVT-NAcC projections promoted food-seeking, whereas selective activation of PVT-pBLA projections produced little effect on feeding. In contrast to selective activation of OTR terminals, photostimulation of a broader population of glutamatergic PVT terminals exerted direct excitation followed by indirect lateral inhibition on neurons in both NAcC and anterior basolateral amygdala. Together, these results suggest that OTR-expressing PVT neurons are a distinct population of PVT glutamate neurons that regulate feeding motivation through projections to NAcC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The paraventricular thalamus plays an important role in the regulation of feeding motivation. However, because of the diversity of paraventricular thalamic neurons, the specific neuron types promoting food motivation remain elusive. In this study, we provide evidence that oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons are a specific group of glutamate neurons that primarily project to the nucleus accumbens core and posterior amygdala. We found that activation of these neurons promotes the motivation for food reward and increases meal frequency through projections to the nucleus accumbens core but not the posterior amygdala. As a result, we postulate that oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons in the paraventricular thalamus and their projections to the nucleus accumbens core mainly regulate feeding motivation but not food consumption.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Local Interactions between Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials at Nearby Flickering Frequencies</a></h4>

              
                <p>Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are widely used to index top-down cognitive processing in human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies. Typically, two stimuli flickering at different temporal frequencies (TFs) are presented, each producing a distinct response in the EEG at its flicker frequency. However, how SSVEP responses in EEGs are modulated in the presence of a competing flickering stimulus just because of sensory interactions is not well understood. We have previously shown in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from awake monkeys that when two overlapping full-screen gratings are counterphased at different TFs, there is an asymmetric SSVEP response suppression, with greater suppression from lower TFs, which further depends on the relative orientations of the gratings (stronger suppression and asymmetry for parallel compared with orthogonal gratings). Here, we first confirmed these effects in both male and female human EEG recordings. Then, we mapped the response suppression of one stimulus (target) by a competing stimulus (mask) over a much wider range than the previous study. Surprisingly, we found that the suppression was not stronger at low frequencies in general, but systematically varied depending on the target TF, indicating local interactions between the two competing stimuli. These results were confirmed in both human EEG and monkey LFP and electrocorticogram (ECoG) data. Our results show that sensory interactions between multiple SSVEPs are more complex than shown previously and are influenced by both local and global factors, underscoring the need to cautiously interpret the results of studies involving SSVEP paradigms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are extensively used in human cognitive studies and brain&ndash;computer interfacing applications where multiple stimuli flickering at distinct frequencies are concurrently presented in the visual field. We recently characterized interactions between competing flickering stimuli in animal recordings and found that stimuli flickering slowly produce larger suppression. Here, we confirmed these in human EEGs, and further characterized the interactions by using a much wider range of target and competing (mask) frequencies in both human EEGs and invasive animal recordings. These revealed a new "local" component, whereby the suppression increased when competing stimuli flickered at nearby frequencies. Our results highlight the complexity of sensory interactions among multiple SSVEPs and underscore the need to cautiously interpret studies involving SSVEP paradigms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatial Learning Drives Rapid Goal Representation in Hippocampal Ripples without Place Field Accumulation or Goal-Oriented Theta Sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hippocampus is critical for rapid acquisition of many forms of memory, although the circuit-level mechanisms through which the hippocampus rapidly consolidates novel information are unknown. Here, the activity of large ensembles of hippocampal neurons in adult male Long-Evans rats was monitored across a period of rapid spatial learning to assess how the network changes during the initial phases of memory formation and retrieval. In contrast to several reports, the hippocampal network did not display enhanced representation of the goal location via accumulation of place fields or elevated firing rates at the goal. Rather, population activity rates increased globally as a function of experience. These alterations in activity were mirrored in the power of the theta oscillation and in the quality of theta sequences, without preferential encoding of paths to the learned goal location. In contrast, during brief "offline" pauses in movement, representation of a novel goal location emerged rapidly in ripples, preceding other changes in network activity. These data demonstrate that the hippocampal network can facilitate active navigation without enhanced goal representation during periods of active movement, and further indicate that goal representation in hippocampal ripples before movement onset supports subsequent navigation, possibly through activation of downstream cortical networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the mechanisms through which the networks of the brain rapidly assimilate information and use previously learned knowledge are fundamental areas of focus in neuroscience. In particular, the hippocampal circuit is a critical region for rapid formation and use of spatial memory. In this study, several circuit-level features of hippocampal function were quantified while rats performed a spatial navigation task requiring rapid memory formation and use. During periods of active navigation, a general increase in overall network activity is observed during memory acquisition, which plateaus during memory retrieval periods, without specific enhanced representation of the goal location. During pauses in navigation, rapid representation of the distant goal well emerges before either behavioral improvement or changes in online activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reduced Primacy Bias in Autism during Early Sensory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recent theories of autism propose that a core deficit in autism would be a less context-sensitive weighting of prediction errors. There is also first support for this hypothesis on an early sensory level. However, an open question is whether this decreased context sensitivity is caused by faster updating of one's model of the world (i.e., higher weighting of new information), proposed by predictive coding theories, or slower model updating. Here, we differentiated between these two hypotheses by investigating how first impressions shape the mismatch negativity (MMN), reflecting early sensory prediction error processing. An autism and matched control group of human adults (both <I>n</I> = 27, 8 female) were compared on the multi-timescale MMN paradigm, in which tones were presented that were either standard (frequently occurring) or deviant (rare), and these roles reversed every block. A well-replicated observation is that the initial model (i.e., the standard and deviant sound in the first block) influences MMN amplitudes in later blocks. If autism is characterized by faster model updating, and thus a smaller primacy bias, we hypothesized (and demonstrate using a simple reinforcement learning model) that their MMN amplitudes should be less influenced by the initial context. In line with this hypothesis, we found that MMN responses in the autism group did not differ between the initial deviant and initial standard sounds as they did in the control group. These findings are consistent with the idea that autism is characterized by faster model updating during early sensory processing, as proposed by predictive coding accounts of autism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent theories of autism propose that a core deficit in autism is that they are faster to update their models of the world based on new sensory information. Here, we tested this hypothesis by investigating how first impressions shape brain responses during early sensory processing, and hypothesized that individuals with autism would be less influenced by these first impressions. In line with earlier studies, our results show that early sensory processing was influenced by first impressions in a control group. However, this was not the case in an autism group. This suggests that individuals with autism are faster to abandon their initial model, and is consistent with the proposal that they are faster to update their models of the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Foundational Number Sense Training Gains Are Predicted by Hippocampal-Parietal Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>The development of mathematical skills in early childhood relies on number sense, the foundational ability to discriminate among quantities. Number sense in early childhood is predictive of academic and professional success, and deficits in number sense are thought to underlie lifelong impairments in mathematical abilities. Despite its importance, the brain circuit mechanisms that support number sense learning remain poorly understood. Here, we designed a theoretically motivated training program to determine brain circuit mechanisms underlying foundational number sense learning in female and male elementary school-age children (7&ndash;10 years). Our 4 week integrative number sense training program gradually strengthened the understanding of the relations between symbolic (Arabic numerals) and nonsymbolic (sets of items) representations of quantity. We found that our number sense training program improved symbolic quantity discrimination ability in children across a wide range of math abilities including children with learning difficulties. Crucially, the strength of pretraining functional connectivity between the hippocampus and intraparietal sulcus, brain regions implicated in associative learning and quantity discrimination, respectively, predicted individual differences in number sense learning across typically developing children and children with learning difficulties. Reverse meta-analysis of interregional coactivations across 14,371 fMRI studies and 89 cognitive functions confirmed a reliable role for hippocampal&ndash;intraparietal sulcus circuits in learning. Our study identifies a canonical hippocampal&ndash;parietal circuit for learning that plays a foundational role in children's cognitive skill acquisition. Findings provide important insights into neurobiological circuit markers of individual differences in children's learning and delineate a robust target for effective cognitive interventions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mathematical skill development relies on number sense, the ability to discriminate among quantities. Here, we develop a theoretically motivated training program and investigate brain circuits that predict number sense learning in children during a period important for acquisition of foundational cognitive skills. Our integrated number sense training program was effective in children across a wide a range of math abilities, including children with learning difficulties. We identify hippocampal&ndash;parietal circuits that predict individual differences in learning gains. Our study identifies a brain circuit critical for the acquisition of foundational cognitive skills, which will be useful for developing effective interventions to remediate learning disabilities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KL1 Domain of Longevity Factor Klotho Mimics the Metabolome of Cognitive Stimulation and Enhances Cognition in Young and Aging Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cognitive deficits are a major biomedical challenge&mdash;and engagement of the brain in stimulating tasks improves cognition in aged individuals (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B44">Wilson et al., 2002</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B19">Gates et al., 2011</cross-ref>) and rodents (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Aidil-Carvalho et al., 2017</cross-ref>), through unknown mechanisms. Whether cognitive stimulation alters specific metabolic pathways in the brain is unknown. Understanding which metabolic processes are involved in cognitive stimulation is important because it could lead to pharmacologic intervention that promotes biological effects of a beneficial behavior, toward the goal of effective medical treatments for cognitive deficits. Here we show using male mice that cognitive stimulation induced metabolic remodeling of the mouse hippocampus, and that pharmacologic treatment with the longevity hormone &alpha;-klotho (KL), mediated by its KL1 domain, partially mimicked this alteration. The shared, metabolic signature shared between cognitive stimulation and treatment with KL or KL1 closely correlated with individual mouse cognitive performance, indicating a link between metabolite levels and learning and memory. Importantly, the treatment of mice with KL1, an endogenous circulating factor that more closely mimicked cognitive stimulation than KL, acutely increased synaptic plasticity, a substrate of cognition. KL1 also improved cognition, itself, in young mice and countered deficits in old mice. Our data show that treatments or interventions mimicking the hippocampal metabolome of cognitive stimulation can enhance brain functions. Further, we identify the specific domain by which klotho promotes brain functions, through KL1, a metabolic mimic of cognitive stimulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cognitive deficits are a major biomedical challenge without truly effective pharmacologic treatments. Engaging the brain through cognitive tasks benefits cognition. Mimicking the effects of such beneficial behaviors through pharmacological treatment represents a highly valuable medical approach to treating cognitive deficits. We demonstrate that brain engagement through cognitive stimulation induces metabolic remodeling of the hippocampus that was acutely recapitulated by the longevity factor klotho, mediated by its KL1 domain. Treatment with KL1, a close mimic of cognitive stimulation, enhanced cognition and countered cognitive aging. Our findings shed light on how cognition metabolically alters the brain and provide a plausible therapeutic intervention for mimicking these alterations that, in turn, improves cognition in the young and aging brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spectral Distribution Dynamics across Different Attentional Priority States</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anticipatory covert spatial attention improves performance on tests of visual detection and discrimination, and shifts are accompanied by decreases and increases of &alpha; band power at electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes corresponding to the attended and unattended location, respectively. Although the increase at the unattended location is often interpreted as an active mechanism (e.g., inhibiting processing at the unattended location), most experiments cannot rule out the alternative possibility that it is a secondary consequence of selection elsewhere. To adjudicate between these accounts, we designed a Posner-style visual cueing task in which male and female human participants made orientation judgments of targets appearing at one of four locations: up, down, right, or left. Critically, trials were blocked such that within a block the locations along one meridian alternated in status between attended and unattended, and targets never appeared at the other two, making them irrelevant. Analyses of the concurrently measured EEG signal were conducted on "traditional" narrowband &alpha; (8&ndash;14 Hz), as well as on two components resulting from the decomposition of this signal: "periodic" &alpha;; and the slope of the aperiodic 1/f-like component. Although data from right-left blocks replicated the familiar pattern of lateralized asymmetry in narrowband &alpha; power, with neither &alpha; signal could we find evidence for any difference in the time course at unattended versus irrelevant locations, an outcome consistent with the secondary-consequence interpretation of attention-related dynamics in the &alpha; band. Additionally, 1/f slope was shallower at attended and unattended locations, relative to irrelevant, suggesting a tonic adjustment of physiological state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual spatial attention, the prioritization of one location in the visual field, is critical for guiding behavior in cluttered environments. Although influential theories posit an important role for &alpha; band oscillations in the inhibition of processing at unattended locations, we used a novel procedure to find evidence for an alternative interpretation: selection of one location may simply result in a return to physiological baseline at all others. In addition to determining one way that attention does not work (important for future progress in this field), we also discovered novel evidence for one way that it does work: by modifying the tonic physiological state (indexed by an aperiodic component of the electroencephalography (EEG)] at locations where spatial selection is likely to occur.</p>

                <p>Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die after optic nerve trauma or in degenerative disease. However, acute changes in protein expression that may regulate RGC response to injury are not fully understood, and detailed methods to quantify new protein synthesis have not been tested. Here, we develop and apply a new <I>in vivo</I> quantitative measure of newly synthesized proteins to examine changes occurring in the retina after optic nerve injury. Azidohomoalanine, a noncanonical amino acid, was injected intravitreally into the eyes of rodents of either sex with or without optic nerve injury. Isotope variants of biotin-alkyne were used for quantitative BONCAT (QBONCAT) mass spectrometry, allowing identification of protein synthesis and transport rate changes in more than 1000 proteins at 1 or 5 d after optic nerve injury. <I>In vitro</I> screening showed several newly synthesized proteins regulate axon outgrowth in primary neurons <I>in vitro</I>. This novel approach to targeted quantification of newly synthesized proteins after injury uncovers a dynamic translational response within broader proteostasis regulation and enhances our understanding of the cellular response to injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Optic nerve injury results in death and degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. The specific cellular response to injury, including changes in new protein synthesis, is obscured by existing proteins and protein degradation. In this study, we introduce QBONCAT to isolate and quantify acute protein synthesis and subsequent transport between cellular compartments. We identify novel candidate protein effectors of the regenerative response and uncover their regulation of axon growth <I>in vitro</I>, validating the utility of QBONCAT for the discovery of novel regulatory and therapeutic candidates after optic nerve injury.</p>

                Background: Postoperative depressive symptoms are associated with pain, readmissions, death, and other undesirable outcomes. Ketamine produces rapid but transient antidepressant effects in the perioperative setting. Longer infusions confer lasting antidepressant activity in patients with treatment-resistant depression, but it is unknown whether a similar approach may produce a lasting antidepressant effect after surgery. This protocol describes a pilot study that will assess the feasibility of conducting a larger scale randomized clinical trial addressing this knowledge gap. Methods: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial involves the enrollment of 32 patients aged 18 years or older with a history of depression scheduled for surgery with planned intensive care unit admission. On the first day following surgery and extubation, participants will be randomized to an intravenous eight-hour infusion of either ketamine (0.5 mg kg-1 over 10 minutes followed by a continuous rate of 0.3 mg kg-1 h-1) or an equal volume of normal saline. Depressive symptoms will be quantified using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale preoperatively and serially up to 14 days after the infusion. To detect ketamine-induced changes on overnight sleep architecture, a wireless headband will be used to record electroencephalograms preoperatively, during the study infusion, and after infusion. The primary feasibility endpoints will include the fraction of patients approached who enroll, the fraction of randomized patients who complete the study infusion, and the fraction of randomized patients who complete outcome data collection. Conclusions: This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of a future large comparative effectiveness trial of ketamine to reduce depressive symptoms in postsurgical patients. Registration: K-PASS is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05233566; registered February 10, 2022.

                Background: The accurate measurements of the mineral content of cassava roots are vital from a nutritional perspective. The research datasets were from the study assessing the influence of storage root portion, maturity, and environment on the variations of minerals in biofortified cassava roots. Methods: Twenty-five biofortified clones with three varieties as checks were harvested 12 months after planting from five different environments. Also,  a different thirty-nine (39) biofortified cassava clones from the unlimited yield trials (UYTs) that included five (5) white-fleshed varieties (as control) were harvested at the age of 9 and 12 months after planting. In addition, two different methods of sample preparations were employed, using a cork borer and without a cork borer. The samples’ elemental (minerals) analysis was determined using a standard laboratory method. Results and conclusion: The breeders could use the data in their biofortification cassava programs to know the distribution of minerals in the roots and identify the best promising pipelines. Also, the data could be used by food scientists and nutritionists to understand the parts of the roots with optimum minerals to design their processing protocols and to know those genotypes specific to different environments that could be used for various nutrition intervention programs.

                Advancements in the biological sciences have made it possible to manipulate life forms in unprecedented ways. Recognizing the possible dangers connected with this activity, as well as with work involving natural pathogens, countries have promoted the building of High Safety and High Containment Laboratories, classified as Biological Safety Levels 3 and 4. In this article I briefly summarize the major features of these laboratories, exemplify some of the research that they host, highlight the possible dangers, and argue for the opportunity of a reduction of possibly dangerous research, and for more transparency and openness about activities that imply risks not only for those involved, but for human and environmental health as well.

                The enteric nervous system regulates various physiological and pathological processes. Zhu et al. investigated the cross talk between enteric serotonergic neurons and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice and revealed the critical role of neurotransmitter 5-HT in colorectal tumor initiation. These observations provide an additional layer for tumor regulation by the enteric nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A novel spinal neuron connection for heat sensation</a></h4>

              
                How heat signals are processed in the spinal cord remains unclear. Wang et al. found that ErbB4+ excitatory interneurons are activated by noxious heat, and they participate in heat sensation in mice. In addition, the neuregulin-ErbB4 signaling regulates heat sensation and contributes to heat hypersensitivity under pathological conditions.

                Hauser et al. use the genetic tagging of a single alternative exon, targeted proteomics, and loss-of-function models to analyze the synaptic localization and function of splice isoforms of synaptic adhesion molecules. They demonstrate that post-transcriptional control generates specific splice isoforms for dendrite-targeting GABAergic synapses.

Theory has predicted the existence of a ‘fireball’ phase following directly on from the runaway fusion, which should be observable as a short, bright and soft X-ray flash before the nova becomes visible in the optical3–5. Here we report observations of a bright and soft X-ray flash associated with the classical Galactic nova YZ Reticuli 11 h before its 9 mag optical brightening. No X-ray source was detected 4 h before and after the event, constraining the duration of the flash to shorter than 8 h. In agreement with theoretical predictions4,6–8, the source’s spectral shape is consistent with a black-body of 3.27+0.11−0.33 × 105 K (28.2+0.9−2.8 eV), or a white dwarf atmosphere, radiating at the Eddington luminosity, with a photosphere that is only slightly larger than a typical white dwarf.
