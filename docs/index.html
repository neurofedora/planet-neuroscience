              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03409">Optimal Griffiths Phase in Heterogeneous Human Brain Networks: Brain Criticality Embracing Stability and Flexibility across Individuals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prominent hypothesis in neuroscience proposes that brains achieve optimal performance by operating near a critical point. However, this framework, which often assumes a universal critical point, fails to account for the extensive individual variability observed in neural dynamics and cognitive functions. These variabilities are not noise but rather an inherent manifestation of a fundamental systems-biology principle: the necessary trade-off between robustness and flexibility in human populations. Here, we propose that the Griffiths phase (GP), an extended critical regime synergically induced by two kinds of heterogeneities in brain network region and connectivity, offers a unified framework for brain criticality that better reconciles robustness and flexibility and accounts for individual variability. Using Human Connectome Project data and whole-brain modeling, we demonstrated that the synergic interplay between structural network modularity and regional heterogeneity in local excitability yields biologically viable GP featured with widely extended global excitability ranges, with an embedded optimal point that balances global/local information transmission. Crucially, an individua's position within the GP gives rise to unique global network dynamics, which in turn confer a distinctive cognitive profile via flexible configuration of functional connectivity for segregation, integration, and balance between them. These results establish GP as an evolved adaptive mechanism resolving the robustness-flexibility trade-off, fulfilling diverse cognitive demands through individualized criticality landscapes, providing a new framework of brain criticality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03907">Emergent Spatiotemporal Dynamics in Large-Scale Brain Networks with Next Generation Neural Mass Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of large-scale brain models remains a central challenge due to the inherent complexity of these systems. In this work, we explore the emergence of complex spatiotemporal patterns in a large scale-brain model composed of 90 interconnected brain regions coupled through empirically derived anatomical connectivity. An important aspect of our formulation is that the local dynamics of each brain region are described by a next-generation neural mass model, which explicitly captures the macroscopic gamma activity of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neural populations (PING mechanism). We first identify the system's homogeneous states-both resting and oscillatory-and analyze their stability under uniform perturbations. Then, we determine the stability against non-uniform perturbations by obtaining dispersion relations for the perturbation growth rate. This analysis enables us to link unstable directions of the homogeneous solutions to the emergence of rich spatiotemporal patterns, that we characterize by means of Lyapunov exponents and frequency spectrum analysis. Our results show that, compared to previous studies with classical neural mass models, next-generation neural mass models provide a broader dynamical repertoire, both within homogeneous states and in the heterogeneous regime. Additionally, we identify a key role for anatomical connectivity in cross-frequency coupling, allowing for the emergence of gamma oscillations with amplitude modulated by slower rhythms. These findings suggest that such models are not only more biophysically grounded but also particularly well-suited to capture the full complexity of large-scale brain dynamics. Overall, our study advances the analytical understanding of emerging spatiotemporal patterns in whole-brain models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03293">Prior preferences in active inference agents: soft, hard, and goal shaping</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active inference proposes expected free energy as an objective for planning and decision-making to adequately balance exploitative and explorative drives in learning agents. The exploitative drive, or what an agent wants to achieve, is formalised as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a variational probability distribution, updated at each inference step, and a preference probability distribution that indicates what states or observations are more likely for the agent, hence determining the agent's goal in a certain environment. In the literature, the questions of how the preference distribution should be specified and of how a certain specification impacts inference and learning in an active inference agent have been given hardly any attention. In this work, we consider four possible ways of defining the preference distribution, either providing the agents with hard or soft goals and either involving or not goal shaping (i.e., intermediate goals). We compare the performances of four agents, each given one of the possible preference distributions, in a grid world navigation task. Our results show that goal shaping enables the best performance overall (i.e., it promotes exploitation) while sacrificing learning about the environment's transition dynamics (i.e., it hampers exploration).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03784">Sleep Modulation: The Challenge of Transitioning from Open Loop to Closed Loop</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.03784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep disorders have emerged as a critical global health issue, highlighting the urgent need for effective and widely accessible intervention technologies. Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner. This class of approaches is collectively referred to as sleep modulation. To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions. Collectively, this work aims to advance the paradigm shift of sleep modulation from open-loop toward closed-loop systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18222">Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states of Path-structured Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.18222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives interaction pathways between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph C*-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger (TCK) algebra, which captures the diversity of path-structured flow connectivity. Equipped with the gauge action, the TCK algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of potential flow pathways within the network. Specifically, the KMS states of this system represent the stationary distributions of a non-Markovian stochastic process with memory decay, capturing how influence propagates along exponentially weighted paths, and yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions. Applied to the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network, our framework reveals that neurolocomotor neurons emerge as the primary hubs of incoming path-structured flow at inverse temperatures where the entropy of KMS states peaks. This finding aligns with experimental evidence of the foundational role of locomotion in {\em C. elegans} behavior, suggesting that functional centrality may arise from the topological embedding of neurons rather than solely from local physiological properties. Our results highlight the potential of algebraic quantum methods and graph algebras to uncover patterns of functional organization in complex systems and neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00655">Implicit Generative Modeling by Kernel Similarity Matching</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.00655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes stimuli has been a fundamental problem in computational neuroscience. Insights into this problem have led to the design and development of artificial neural networks that learn representations by incorporating brain-like learning abilities. Recently, learning representations by capturing similarity between input samples has been studied to tackle this problem. This approach, however, has thus far been used to only learn downstream features from an input and has not been studied in the context of a generative paradigm, where one can map the representations back to the input space, incorporating not only bottom-up interactions (stimuli to latent) but also learning features in a top-down manner (latent to stimuli). We investigate a kernel similarity matching framework for generative modeling. Starting with a modified sparse coding objective for learning representations proposed in prior work, we demonstrate that representation learning in this context is equivalent to maximizing similarity between the input kernel and a latent kernel. We show that an implicit generative model arises from learning the kernel structure in the latent space and show how the framework can be adapted to learn manifold structures, potentially providing insights as to how task representations can be encoded in the brain. To solve the objective, we propose a novel Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm and discuss the interpretation of the optimization process. Finally, we discuss how this representation learning problem can lead towards a biologically plausible architecture to learn the model parameters that ties together representation learning using similarity matching (a bottom-up approach) with predictive coding (a top-down approach).

                arXiv:2506.20233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley models are biophysical models of how electrical signals propagate throughout a neuron, and they form the basis of our knowledge of neural computation at the cellular level. However, these models have many free parameters that must be estimated for each cell, and existing fitting methods rely on intracellular voltage measurements that are highly challenging to obtain in vivo. Recent advances in neural recording technology with high-density probes and arrays enable dense sampling of extracellular voltage from many sites surrounding a neuron, allowing indirect measurement of many compartments of a cell simultaneously. Here, we propose a method for inferring the underlying membrane voltage, biophysical parameters, and the neuron's position relative to the probe, using extracellular measurements alone. We use an Extended Kalman Filter to infer membrane voltage and channel states using efficient, differentiable simulators. Then, we learn the model parameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the performance of this approach using simulated data and real neuron morphologies.

                arXiv:2305.10937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian models of perception and learning feature prominently in contemporary cognitive neuroscience where, for example, they inform computational concepts of mental disorders. This includes predictive coding and hierarchical Gaussian filtering (HGF), which differ in the nature of hierarchical representations. In this work, we present a new class of artificial neural networks that unifies computational principles of PC and HGFs. We extend the space of generative models underlying HGF to include a form of nonlinear hierarchical coupling between state values akin to predictive coding and artificial neural networks in general. We derive the update equations corresponding to this generalization of HGF and conceptualize them as connecting a network of (belief) nodes where parent nodes either predict the state of child nodes or their rate of change. This enables us to (1) create modular architectures with generic computational steps in each node of the network, and (2) disclose the hierarchical message passing implied by generalized HGF models and to compare this to comparable schemes under predictive coding. The practical advances of this work are twofold: on the one hand, our extension allows for a modular construction of ANNs of arbitrarily complex hierarchical structure under the general principles of HGF. On the other hand, by providing a highly flexible implementation of hierarchical Bayesian models available as open source software, it enables new types of empirical data analysis in computational psychiatry.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03879">Hybrid Temporal-8-Bit Spike Coding for Spiking Neural Network Surrogate Training</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising direction in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as strong biological plausibility and low energy consumption on neuromorphic hardware. Despite these benefits, SNNs still face challenges in achieving state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. Recent work has shown that hybrid rate-temporal coding strategies (particularly those incorporating bit-plane representations of images into traditional rate coding schemes) can significantly improve performance when trained with surrogate backpropagation. Motivated by these findings, this study proposes a hybrid temporal-bit spike coding method that integrates bit-plane decompositions with temporal coding principles. Through extensive experiments across multiple computer vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that blending bit-plane information with temporal coding yields competitive, and in some cases improved, performance compared to established spike-coding techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a hybrid temporal-bit coding scheme specifically designed for surrogate gradient training of SNNs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03895">Parameter efficient hybrid spiking-quantum convolutional neural network with surrogate gradient and quantum data-reupload</a></h4>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) has catalyzed the emergence of several optimization-driven subfields, notably neuromorphic computing and quantum machine learning. Leveraging the differentiable nature of hybrid models, researchers have explored their potential to address complex problems through unified optimization strategies. One such development is the Spiking Quantum Neural Network (SQNN), which combines principles from spiking neural networks (SNNs) and quantum computing. However, existing SQNN implementations often depend on pretrained SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of spiking activity and the limited scalability of current SNN encoders. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, Spiking-Quantum Data Re-upload Convolutional Neural Network (SQDR-CNN), that enables joint training of convolutional SNNs and quantum circuits within a single backpropagation framework. Unlike its predecessor, SQDR-CNN allow convergence to reasonable performance without the reliance of pretrained spiking encoder and subsetting datasets. We also clarified some theoretical foundations, testing new design using quantum data-reupload with different training algorithm-initialization and evaluate the performance of the proposed model under noisy simulated quantum environments. As a result, we were able to achieve 86% of the mean top-performing accuracy of the SOTA SNN baselines, yet uses only 0.5% of the smallest spiking model's parameters. Through this integration of neuromorphic and quantum paradigms, we aim to open new research directions and foster technological progress in multi-modal, learnable systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03394">VS-Graph: Scalable and Efficient Graph Classification Using Hyperdimensional Computing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph classification is a fundamental task in domains ranging from molecular property prediction to materials design. While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23762">Accuracy-Robustness Trade Off via Spiking Neural Network Gradient Sparsity Trail</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.23762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs, (particularly for vision-related tasks) remains a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks. Our findings offer new insights into the dual role of gradient sparsity in SNN training.

                Introduction Textiloma refers to a retained surgical textile material within the body after surgery. It is a rare but serious iatrogenic complication that may remain asymptomatic for years. Case Presentation We report a case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of open ovarian cystectomy 15 years earlier, presenting with persistent abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a complex pelvic mass with abscess formation and enteric fistula. Despite interventional drainage and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a retained surgical textile in the rectum, which was extracted. The patient subsequently developed generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency laparotomy revealing two retained textilomas and multiple intestinal perforations. Despite aggressive surgical intervention, the patient succumbed to septic shock on postoperative day one. Conclusion Textiloma should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal masses and previous surgical history. Preventive strategies and early recognition are critical to avoid fatal outcomes.

                Background Manufacturing inefficiencies result in substantial financial losses for global industries. The present study introduces a robust Performance Measurement System (PMS) incorporating Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) to address efficiency challenges in multi-stage manufacturing systems. Methods The study employs a case study approach within the pharmaceutical industry to reveal the pragmatic application of NDEA, which serves as the primary analytical instrument for evaluating performance across diverse production stages. Focusing on the production processes of intravenous (IV) sets, the research aims to highlight how NDEA disaggregates interconnected processes and quantify efficiency measures to pinpoint sources of inefficiencies in particular production stages and actionable insights for operational improvement. The analysis also explores the trade-off between model complexity and discrimination power as the number of stages increases. Results First, the NDEA-based PMS provides insights to address specific process inefficiencies on the shop floor, providing strategic insights for process improvement. Second, despite its power in pinpointing the source of inefficiency, modelling a process-based PMS faces a challenge as increasing the number of stages in the model presents a trade-off between the accuracy and discrimination power of the NDEA model. Conclusions This study holds significance within the broader field of performance measurement and efficiency analysis by bridging theoretical modelling and practical implementation. It advances existing knowledge through the integration of NDEA into a process-based PMS, offering a novel analytical framework for multi-stage manufacturing systems. By examining the trade-off between model complexity and discrimination power, this research contributes new methodological insights and extends the applicability of NDEA in real-world industrial settings. The framework offers managers actionable guidance for optimizing multi-stage manufacturing operations and contributes novel insights into the methodological behaviour of NDEA. Ultimately, this work strengthens the linkage between performance measurement theory and industrial practice, positioning NDEA as a valuable tool for continuous improvement in manufacturing systems.

                Background This study aimed to document the occurrence of the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus in King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Royal Nature Reserve (KSRNR), Hail region, Saudi Arabia, where its presence had not previously been confirmed. Methods Field surveys were conducted in the Hail region, and direct observations were documented using photographic and video evidence. The colony was visually counted in the field during a single daytime visit from an estimated distance of 15 meters. Results More than 50 individuals, including adults and juveniles, were observed roosting in a rock crevice. The photographic documentation confirms the presence of a colony of R. aegyptiacus in this area, extending the known distribution of the species into a previously unrecorded region of Saudi Arabia. Conclusions These findings provide the first photographic record of R. aegyptiacus in KSRNR and highlight the species’ ecological use of arid rock crevices. The results emphasize the need for targeted surveys and long-term monitoring to better understand the distribution and conservation of this species in desert environments.

                <p>Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have an increased incidence of seizures, which worsen cognitive decline. Using a transgenic mouse model of AD neuropathology that exhibits spontaneous seizures, we previously found that seizure activity stimulates and accelerates depletion of the hippocampal neural stem cell (NSC) pool, which was associated with deficits in neurogenesis-dependent spatial discrimination. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that drive seizure-induced activation and depletion of NSCs are unclear. Here, using mice of both sexes, we performed RNA-sequencing on the hippocampal dentate gyrus and identified differentially expressed regulators of neurogenesis in the Wnt signaling pathway that regulates many aspects of cell proliferation. We found that the expression of sFRP3, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, is altered in a seizure-dependent manner and might be regulated by FosB, a seizure-induced transcription factor. Increasing sFRP3 expression prevented NSC depletion and improved spatial discrimination, suggesting that the loss of sFRP3 might mediate seizure-driven impairment in cognition in AD model mice and perhaps also in AD.</p>

                <p>Decision-making is influenced by both expected rewards and social factors, such as who offers the outcomes. Therefore, although a reward might originally be independent of social factors, the two elements are closely related. However, whether and how they are processed separately or conjointly remains unclear. Here, we show that neurons in distinct subnuclei of the amygdala encode expected reward and face reality, a vital aspect of face perception. Although these encoding processes are distinct, they rely on partially shared neuronal circuits with characteristic temporal dynamics. Two male macaque monkeys made saccades under different social and reward contexts by viewing facial images with independent attributes: reality (a real monkey or a cartoon face) and associated reward (large or small). The stimulus image was presented twice per trial: during initial stimulus encoding (S1) and before saccades were made (S2). A longer gaze duration for the eye region of the monkeys compared with cartoons indicated more robust social engagement with realistic faces. During S1, a similar number of lateral nucleus neurons encoded either reality only, with a monkey-image preference; reward only, with a large-reward preference; or both. Conversely, neurons in the basal and central nuclei primarily encoded reward, preferring large- versus small-reward&ndash;associated face images. Reward-dependent modulation continued after S1 but was more conspicuous during S1 in the basal nucleus and during both S1 and S2 in the central nucleus. This anatomically and temporally specific encoding in the amygdala may underlie the computation and integration of social and reward information.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/49/e0454252025?rss=1">Identifying Key Regulators in Odorant Receptor Trafficking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Odor detection in mammals is primarily mediated by odorant receptors (ORs), the largest family of G-protein-coupled receptors, expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Buck and Axel, 1991</cross-ref>). However, most ORs exhibit little or no cell surface expression in nonolfactory cell types (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B14">Lu et al., 2003</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B7">Hague et al., 2004</cross-ref>). While the accessory protein RTP1 and RTP2 enhance the expression of certain ORs, we hypothesized that additional proteins coregulated with RTP1 and RTP2 during OSN maturation may further enhance OR cell surface expression (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">Saito et al., 2004</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Zhuang and Matsunami, 2007</cross-ref>). To test this, we developed a computational pipeline based on publicly available single-cell transcriptomic data to create an interactive tool for exploring gene expression during OSN maturation. Using this tool, we identified genes coregulated with Rtp1 during olfactory development. Three genes&mdash;Gfy, Clgn, and Syt1&mdash;exhibited transcriptional profiles similar to Rtp1. When coexpressed with an OR, these genes, in combination with Rtp1, promoted cell-surface expression of the tested ORs. Importantly, we demonstrated a physical interaction between Syt1 and an OR (Or1ad1) via co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting a novel role for Syt1 in OR trafficking or stabilization. We also observed localization of Syt1 protein in OSN cilia in both male and female mice. Together, these findings provide new insights into OSN development and the molecular mechanisms underlying OR biogenesis, paving the way for further research into the functional regulation of the olfactory systems.</p>

                <p>Predictions of future events have a major impact on how we process sensory signals. However, it remains unclear how the brain keeps predictions online in anticipation of future inputs. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate decoding techniques to investigate the content of perceptual predictions and their frequency characteristics. Thirty-two participants (23 female) were engaged in a shape discrimination task, while auditory cues predicted which specific shape would likely appear. Frequency analysis revealed significant oscillatory fluctuations of predicted shape representations in the pre-stimulus window in the alpha band (10&ndash;11&nbsp;Hz). Furthermore, we found that this stimulus-specific alpha power was linked to expectation effects on shape discrimination behavior. Our findings demonstrate that sensory predictions are embedded in pre-stimulus alpha oscillations and modulate subsequent perceptual performance, providing a neural mechanism through which the brain deploys perceptual predictions.</p>

                <p>Orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides regulate numerous essential functions including sleep/wake state stability and reward processing. Orexin synthesizing neurons respond to drug cues and undergo structural changes following persistent drug exposure. Postmortem brains from opioid users and opioid-treated rodents have orexin somata that become ~20% smaller and ~50% more numerous and are postulated to promote hypermotivation for drug seeking though increased orexin release. Biophysical considerations suggest that the decreased soma size should increase cellular excitability; however, the impact of chronic opioids on firing ability, which drives peptide release, has not been explored. To test this, we assessed the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of orexin neurons by whole-cell recordings in slices from male orexin-EGFP mice treated for 2&nbsp;weeks by daily morphine or saline injections. Paradoxically, we found that while daily morphine decreased the average soma size, it impaired excitability in a subpopulation of orexin neurons identified by electrophysiological criteria as "H-type" while entirely sparing "D-type" neurons. This impairment was manifest by smaller, broader action potentials, variable firing, and a downscaling of firing gain. These adaptations required more than a single morphine dose and recovered, along with soma size, after 4&nbsp;weeks of passive withdrawal. Taken together, these observations indicate that daily opioid exposure differentially impacts H-type orexin neurons and predicts that the ability of these neurons to encode synaptic inputs into spike trains and to release neuropeptides becomes impaired in conjunction with opioid dependence.</p>

                <p>Understanding speech while ignoring competing speech streams in the surrounding environment is challenging. Previous studies have demonstrated that attention shapes the neural representation of speech features. Attended streams are typically represented more strongly than unattended ones, suggesting either enhancement of the attended or suppression of the unattended stream. However, it is unclear how these complementary processes support attentional filtering and speech comprehension on different hierarchical levels. In this study, we used multivariate temporal response functions to analyze the EEG signals of 43 young adults (24 women), examining the relationship between the neural tracking of acoustic and higher-level linguistic features and a fine-grained speech comprehension measure. We show that the neural tracking of word and phoneme onsets and word level linguistic features in the attended stream predicted comprehension at the individual single-trial level. Moreover, acoustic tracking of the ignored speech stream was positively correlated with comprehension performance, whereas word level linguistic neural tracking of the ignored stream was negatively correlated with comprehension. Collectively, our results suggest that attentional filtering during speech comprehension requires target enhancement as well as distractor suppression at different hierarchical levels.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/49/e0691252025?rss=1">Mental Images from Long-Term Memory Differ from Perception: Evidence for Distinct Spatial Formats and Distinct Mechanisms of Spatial Attention Orientation</a></h4>

              
                <p>How is spatial attention deployed in mental images? Mental imagery is often assumed to share mechanisms with visual perception and visual working memory. Top-down, endogenous spatial attention in both visual perception and working memory modulates behavior and parieto-occipital alpha-band activity. However, working memory captures only a subset of mental imagery, which can also draw upon long-term memory. Here, we ask whether and how spatial attention operates in mental images derived from general knowledge in long-term memory and whether it recruits the same neural mechanisms as visual perception. We recorded EEG in 28 healthy volunteers (13 males, 15 females) as they performed two discrimination tasks with spatial cues (70% valid): one involving the mental visualization of a long-term memory map (a map of France) and the other using visual stimuli. We show that spatial attention shortens response times in both tasks, but through distinct mechanisms. Behavioral attentional benefits were uncorrelated across tasks, and spatial attention in mental imagery engaged distinct neural mechanisms, with frontal rather than posterior alpha activity modulation. We further reveal fundamental differences in the spatial structures of mental imagery and visual perception. Altogether, our results show that mental images drawn from long-term semantic memory are spatially organized and are amenable to spatial attention deployment, but the underlying neural mechanisms differ from those of visual perception. Our results thus point to marked differences between mental imagery from long-term memory and visual perception.</p>

                <p>A key function of the brain is to move the body through a rich, complex environment. When rodents engage with their environment, they move their whiskers as they extract tactile information. Even though the study of whisking has a long history, the details of individual whisker movements bilaterally, of nose movement, of stereotypy and variability in an active whisking to touch behavior are unknown. Here we trained five head-fixed male and 11 female mice in a go-cue task to move a whisker to touch a sensor. Our analysis of orofacial movements shows that mice specifically control movement of the whisker they use to touch and that as they move their whiskers, they move their nose and apply forces on the head post in a manner that reflects the behavioral epoch, i.e., whether go-cue triggered movement had begun or a whisker was touching the sensor. Importantly, mice control the setpoint, amplitude, and frequency of movement of whiskers bilaterally and individually. Additionally, even though mice achieved the goal of the task&mdash;to touch the sensor within 2&nbsp;s&mdash;how they coordinated movement of the nose and forces on head post with movement of individual whiskers was stereotyped and related to the distance they needed to move a whisker to touch the sensor. Our work shows how stereotyped mouse behavior can be, and it emphasizes both the level of fine motor control mice can exert over individual whiskers and the extent of facial movements in a goal-directed whisking-to-touch task.</p>

                <p>Dopaminergic transmission within the ventral striatum is broadly implicated in risk/reward decision-making and impulse control, and the rat gambling task (rGT) measures both behaviors concurrently. While the resulting indices of risky choice and impulsivity correlate at the population level, dopaminergic manipulations rarely impact both behaviors uniformly, with changes in choice more likely when dopaminergic transmission is altered during task acquisition. Although the task structure of the rGT remains constant, the relative importance of ventral striatal dopamine (DA) signals relevant for reward prediction versus impulse control may vary as learning progresses; the former should dominate while rats learn the probabilistic contingencies of the task, whereas suppression of premature responses becomes more valuable once a decision-making strategy is established and exploited. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) critically influence reinforcement learning by modulating dopamine (DA) release and gating periods of DA-facilitated neuroplasticity. We therefore hypothesized that ventral striatal CINs (vsCINs) could influence reward learning or impulse control during task acquisition or stable performance, respectively. Using chemogenetics in Sprague Dawley rats (<I>Rattus norvegicus</I>), we found support for this hypothesis: activation and inhibition of vsCINs once behavior was stable increased and decreased motor impulsivity in both sexes but had no effect on choice patterns. In contrast, activating and inhibiting vsCINs during task acquisition did not alter motor impulsivity but instead decreased and increased risky choice, respectively. Notably, the former effect was only observed in males and the latter in females. We conclude by proposing testable predictions regarding acetylcholine&ndash;DA interactions that may explain sex differences.</p>

                <p>Disorders characterized by changes in dopamine (DA) neurotransmission are often linked to changes in the temporal discounting of future rewards. Likewise, pharmacological manipulations of DA neurotransmission in healthy individuals modulate temporal discounting, but there is considerable variability in the directionality of reported pharmacological effects, as enhancements and reductions of DA signaling have been linked to both increases and reductions of temporal discounting. This may be due to meaningful individual differences in drug effects and/or false-positive findings in small samples. To resolve these inconsistencies, we (1) revisited pharmacological effects of the DA precursor <scp>l</scp>-DOPA on temporal discounting in a large sample of <I>N</I> = 76 healthy participants (<I>n</I> = 44 male) and (2) examined several putative proxy measures for DA to revisit the role of individual differences in a randomized, double-blind placebo&ndash;controlled preregistered study (<A HREF="https://osf.io/a4k9j/">https://osf.io/a4k9j/</A>). Replicating previous findings, higher rewards were discounted less (magnitude effect). Computational modeling using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation confirmed that the data in both drug conditions were best accounted for by a nonlinear temporal discounting drift diffusion model. In line with recent animal and human work, <scp>l</scp>-DOPA reliably reduced the discount rate with a small effect size, challenging earlier findings in substantially smaller samples. We found no credible evidence for effects of putative DA proxy measures on model parameters, calling into question the role of these measures in accounting for individual differences in DA drug effects.</p>

                <p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is essential for long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses, a process fundamental to learning. CaMKII responds to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into postsynaptic spines by phosphorylating proteins and forming new protein interactions. The relative importance of these enzymatic and structural functions is debated. LTP induction triggers CaMKII docking to NMDA receptors, and recent evidence indicates that LTP can proceed without kinase activity after this event. Furthermore, interactions between CaMKII and &alpha;-actinin-2 that form following LTP induction are required for dendritic spine enlargement. CaMKII can autophosphorylate at T286, which enables autonomous activity after Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM dissociation. Experiments with CaMKII variants including a T305A/T306A ("AA") double substitution have led to a model whereby T305/T306 phosphorylation by autonomously active CaMKII prevents further Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM activation. However, this mechanism is not fully compatible with previous studies including a phosphoproteomic analysis of CaMKII and imaging using CaMKII activity reporters in live neurons. In this study, we show using rat hippocampal cultures that the AA substitution has an unintended gain-of-function property: elevated binding to &alpha;-actinin-2 in unstimulated neurons to a level only normally observed after induction of LTP. CaMKII&alpha; AA also increases the proportion of enlarged spines in unstimulated neurons without altering synaptic currents. Calorimetric measurements with purified protein confirm that &alpha;-actinin-2 binds tightly to CaMKII&alpha; AA with no requirement for kinase activation. Using x-ray crystallography, we show that the AA substitution enables &alpha;-actinin-2 to adopt a different tighter binding mode. Our findings reinforce the notion that CaMKII primarily fulfils a structural role in LTP.</p>

                <p>Neural oscillations have been associated with decision-making processes, but their underlying network mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates how neural oscillations influence decision network models of competing cortical columns with varying intrinsic and emergent timescales. Our findings reveal that decision networks with faster excitatory than inhibitory synapses are more susceptible to oscillatory modulations. Higher in-phase oscillation amplitude reduces decision confidence without affecting accuracy, while decision speed increases. In contrast, antiphase modulation increases decision accuracy, confidence, and speed. Increasing oscillation frequency reverses these effects. Changing oscillatory phase difference gradually modulates decision behavior, with decision confidence affected nonlinearly. Moreover, neural resonance can further enhance modulatory susceptibility for network with faster excitatory than inhibitory synapses. These effects decouple decision accuracy, speed, and confidence, challenging standard speed-accuracy trade-off. These phenomena can be explained by excitatory neural populations contributing more to in-phase modulation, while inhibitory neural populations contribute more to antiphase modulation. State-space trajectories&rsquo; momentum swinging with respect to network steady states and decision uncertainty manifold further provide insights into the neural circuit mechanisms. Our work provides mechanistic insights into how neurobiological diversity shapes decision-making processes in the presence of ubiquitous neural oscillations.</p>

                <p>In the retina, presynaptic active zones in photoreceptors and bipolar cells are distinguished by a plate-like "ribbon" linked to the plasma membrane (PM) and surrounded by dozens of synaptic vesicles (SVs) tethered to it. SVs at the base of the ribbon, closest to the PM, are thought to constitute the readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP), i.e., SVs primed to be released 1&ndash;2&nbsp;ms following stimulation. The number of SVs in the RRP is a critical synaptic parameter that influences synaptic strength and varies with light levels to enable ribbon synapses to compute visual information. Physiological RRP measurements agree well with anatomical estimates obtained via electron microscopy (EM), although EM often employs chemical fixation, which causes exocytotic artifacts that may influence RRP size. Here, we used EM tomography to compare anatomical features of rod bipolar cell ribbon synapses in retinas, from rats of either sex, prepared by chemical fixation or high-pressure freezing (HPF), a technique that minimizes artifactual exocytosis. We found that ribbon dimensions and the number of ribbon-associated SVs were roughly similar in the two preparations. Cleft volume and SV diameter were larger in HPF-prepared tissue, however, and vesicles at the base of the ribbon were more closely associated with the PM, suggesting morphologically distinguishable steps in the SV priming process. The distribution of SV diameters was positively skewed in both conditions, but larger SVs were too scarce to explain previous electrophysiological results, which likely reflect multivesicular release at the PM rather than prefusion of SVs prior to exocytosis.</p>

                <p>Adaptive behavior requires integrating information from multiple sources. These sources can originate from distinct channels, such as internally maintained latent cognitive representations or externally presented sensory cues. Because these signals are often stochastic and carry inherent uncertainty, integration is challenging. However, the neural and computational mechanisms that support the integration of such stochastic information remain unknown. We introduce a computational neuroimaging framework to elucidate how brain systems integrate internally maintained and externally cued stochastic information to guide behavior. Neuroimaging data were collected from healthy adult human participants (both male and female). Our computational model estimates trial-by-trial beliefs about internally maintained latent states and externally presented perceptual cues and then integrates them into a unified joint probability distribution. The entropy of this joint distribution quantifies overall uncertainty, which enables continuous tracking of probabilistic task beliefs, prediction errors, and updating dynamics. Results showed that latent-state beliefs are encoded in distinct regions from perceptual beliefs. Latent state beliefs were encoded in the anterior middle frontal gyrus, mediodorsal thalamus, and inferior parietal lobule, whereas perceptual beliefs were encoded in spatially distinct regions including lateral temporo-occipital areas, intraparietal sulcus, and precentral sulcus. The integrated joint probability and its entropy converged in frontoparietal hub areas, notably middle frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus. These findings suggest that frontoparietal hubs read out and resolve distributed uncertainty to flexibly guide behavior, revealing how frontoparietal systems implement cognitive integration.</p>

                <p>Interference between visual short-term memory (VSTM) and task-irrelevant sensory distractors is a well-documented phenomenon across a wide range of visual features. Although this sensory&ndash;memory interference is believed to result from neural interactions between mnemonic and sensory processing, the nature of the interfering signals remains unclear, particularly whether the interference originates from physical stimuli entering the retina or the resulting subjective perception. Here we addressed this question by leveraging perceptual invariance during smooth pursuit eye movements, where retinal motion induced by eye movements is perceptually suppressed. Distractors were presented as either physical object motion in world coordinates or apparent motion of a stationary background induced by eye movements, allowing us to generate identical retinal motion with distinct perception. Human observers (both female and male) were tasked with comparing the speeds of two sequentially presented motion stimuli while ignoring the distractor stimuli presented between them. Our results showed that the retinal motion distractor systematically biased the memorized motion speed. Crucially, the magnitude of the bias was comparable regardless of whether the retinal motion distractor reflected physical or apparent motion. Notably, the distraction effect of the eye movement-induced retinal motion was successfully replicated using a classifier trained on data from the physical motion condition. A further experiment confirmed that this distraction effect by the apparent motion was not due to eye movements themselves. These findings provide behavioral evidence that, at least for the feature of motion speed, perception is not required for the emergence of a bias in VSTM.</p>

                <p>The cerebellum is crucial for predictive motor control and learning, but growing evidence suggests that it also generates forward models for nonmotor functions. Previous studies have reported periodic neuronal activity in the cerebellar dentate nucleus when animals predicted the timing of regularly presented visual stimuli. Since the dentate nucleus is an output structure, this activity likely reflects computations in the cerebellar cortex. Considering that Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, are more numerous than cerebellar nuclear neurons and that nuclear neurons also receive input from mossy and climbing fibers, information integration likely occurs within the cerebellar nuclei. To explore this, we recorded PC activity in the cerebellar crus lobules of three male monkeys trained to detect the omission of periodically flashing visual stimuli and compared it with dentate nucleus data. PCs showed gradually increasing periodic simple spike activity, with amplitudes proportional to the interstimulus intervals. As a population, PC signals slightly preceded those of dentate nucleus neurons and were more temporally variable. However, the individual dentate neuron activity was 84% explained by a linear sum of signals from a small subset of PCs. These results suggest that the main components of cerebellar output signals for temporal prediction may originate from the cerebellar cortex and are integrated within the deep nuclei before being sent to other brain regions. Furthermore, changes in complex spike activity were observed in more than half of the PCs, suggesting that synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex may contribute to modulating these signals.</p>

                <p>In the CA1 hippocampus, pyramidal cells (PCs) can be classified as deep or superficial based on their radial position within the stratum pyramidale. Deep and superficial PCs form biased circuits with perisomatic-targeting PV+ basket cells, but it is unknown if such cell-type&ndash;specific circuit motifs extend to dendrite-targeting interneurons. Using male and female mice, we investigated synaptic connectivity and physiology in brain slices from four transgenic lines thought to capture distinct subsets of interneurons: SST-IRES-Cre, Nkx2.1-Cre, Chrna2-Cre, and Htr3a-GFP. First, we found that oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells captured by the Chrna2-Cre line are a subset of Htr3a-GFP+ cells in the hippocampus. This novel finding is consistent with previous work showing Nkx2.1-Cre OLM cells are distinct from both Chrna2-Cre and Htr3a-GFP+ OLM cells. Indeed, in paired whole-cell recordings, Nkx2.1-Cre+ interneurons in the stratum oriens, but not Chrna2-Cre+ or Htr3a-GFP+ cells, received more excitatory synaptic connections from superficial PCs relative to deep PCs. Next, we expressed channelrhodopsin in interneurons to investigate inhibition along the proximal and distal dendrites of PCs. We found that superficial PCs received stronger inhibition along their proximal dendrites than deep PCs from SST+ interneurons. Furthermore, this circuit motif was dependent on the layer but not PC projection class. Finally, Chrna2-Cre OLM cells provided stronger inhibition to the distal dendrites of deep PCs relative to superficial PCs. Our data reveal that superficial and deep PCs engage in cell-type&ndash;specific circuits with dendrite-targeting interneurons. Furthermore, they support that Nkx2.1-Cre OLM cells and Chrna2-Cre/Htr3a-GFP OLM cells are distinct subtypes that form unique circuits in CA1.</p>

                <p>Humans can extract numerosity from different senses and a variety of context. How and where the brain abstract numerical information from low-level sensory inputs remains debated. Using multivariate pattern decoding and representational similarity analysis applied to fMRI data (collected from both male and female participants), we comprehensively investigate how the brain represents numerical information (range 2&ndash;5) across different modalities (auditory, visual) and presentation formats (sequential, simultaneous; symbolic, nonsymbolic). We identify a set of brain regions along the dorsal pathway&mdash;from early visual cortex to the intraparietal and frontal regions&mdash;that encode specific nonsymbolic numerical information across formats and modalities. The numerical distance effect, a hallmark of magnitude encoding, was observed in most of these regions. We found aligned representation of numerical information across visual and auditory modalities in intraparietal and frontal regions, but only when they shared a sequential presentation format. Maintaining a distinction between spatial and temporal numerical representations may thus be a fundamental aspect of numerical processing. RSA further revealed a posterior-to-anterior gradient in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showing that the dominant factors influencing distributed numerical representations shifted from sensory modality in the posterior parietal regions to presentation format in the anterior parietal areas. Our study reveals a multifaceted brain representation of numerosity across the senses and presentation formats.</p>

                <p>Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive tumor in the adult central nervous system, remains a major therapeutic challenge due to its high recurrence and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent evidence underscores the pivotal role of glioma stem cells (GSCs) in driving these malignant features. In this study, using intracranial xenograft models established in 4-week-old male BALB/c nude mice and patient-derived primary GSCs, we uncover a critical function of the chromatin assembly factor subunit Chaf1b in sustaining the stemness of GSCs and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment. We show that Chaf1b is markedly overexpressed in high-grade gliomas and GSC populations. Genetic silencing of Chaf1b led to a significant reduction in GSC self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity, both in vitro and in intracranial xenograft models. Mechanistically, Chaf1b was found to upregulate IL-33 secretion, thereby promoting microglial M2 polarization and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway&mdash;effects that were reversible upon IL-33 neutralization. These findings position Chaf1b as a key mediator of GBM aggressiveness and suggest it as a promising target for disrupting the stem-immune axis in GBM.</p>

                <p>Current theories of event memory propose distinct connections between the hippocampus and neocortical regions, particularly those within the default mode network (DMN) subsystems, to support processing different types of content in memory. It has been established that hippocampal connectivity supports integrating this disparate content into unified event memories, suggesting that changing the way that an event is described could change the underlying hippocampal neural network. To address this knowledge gap, we developed event narratives that described the same core story (e.g., grocery shopping) with identical central story details described with additional descriptive details that were conceptually or perceptually related to the story. Using fMRI, we established hippocampal connectivity patterns as a group of human participants (<I>N</I> = 35, of any sex) encoded these narratives and then related these patterns to later memory for the narrative details. Consistent with prior work, we found that the conceptual narratives were associated with stronger anterior hippocampal connectivity to regions within the core and dorsomedial DMN subsystems, and a portion of this connectivity pattern predicted memory for the core story of the narrative. The perceptual narratives were selectively associated with anterior hippocampal connectivity to parietal and lateral temporal regions and regions outside the standard DMN, in relation to memory performance. These results provide new insights into hippocampal and DMN functional organization and how distinct neural components contribute differently to event memory.</p>

                Background and aims Infectious aneurysm is an aneurysm of the arteries originating from endogenous bacteraemia due to bacterial or fungal origin. The major vessels involved are femoral, aorta, then intracranial visceral arteries and pulmonary arteries. These aneurysms are identified by their fusiform shape, multiple, distal location involving the entire wall of the vessel and changing morphology on repeat imaging studies. The study aims to discuss the clinical presentation & management of post infectious aneurysms. Methods This is a retrospective study of 11 case series of postinfectious aneurysms over a period of 10 years admitted at a tertiary care hospital. The detailed clinical data that included the clinical presentation, diagnostic and treatment was studied from the hospital medical records department and laboratory information system. Results Among the 11 patients diagnosed with aneurysms, 4 presented with intracranial, 4 with intra pulmonary and 3 with intra-abdominal aortic aneurysms involvement. Source was either of bacterial cause such as E.coli, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Salmonella Typhi, M. tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Methicillin Resistant S. aureus, S. hominis or fungal origin being Aspergillus spp. All of them had elevated C-reactive protein level, ESR and confirmed by positive cultures or Xpert Tb. Management of mycotic aneurysm includes imaging studies along with laboratory workup, endovascular intervention with intravenous antibiotics, or a combination of these. Conclusion High index of suspicion in patients presenting with fever, elevated C-reactive protein, ESR, total counts with sudden development of atypical aneurysms requires timely blood culture pre and post procedure. Definitive surgical/endovascular under antibiotic coverage at the earliest is a prerequisite in the management to prevent re-rupture.

                Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal, metabolic disorder in women of reproductive age. It can be induced by genetic, immunological, and environmental determinants. The main pathophysiology of PCOS, is hyperandrogenism, which can lead to acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, as well as infertility. However, PCOS is also associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the role of, (anti-FSH, and anti-LH antibodies, in PCOS occurrence). Methods About 65 patients with PCOS, and 56 healthy women (controls) were recruited. Their ages were (20-45) years. Body mass index BMI was computed as, (weight) divided by (height squared, (kg/m2). Blood samples were obtained randomly from the Medical City Hospital in Baghdad and private infertility clinics. This study was conducted between November 2024 and January 2025. The levels of anti-FSH and anti-LH antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results The results revealed a non-significant increase in anti-FSH antibody in patients (36.22±6.73) ng/ml, compared to controls (34.99±9.78 ng/ml), and a highly significant decrease in anti-LH antibody in patients (45.29±3.04 ng/ml), as compared to controls (69.16±10.90 ng/ml), (p<0.05). The fertility hormone, FSH showed a non-significant increase in non- healthy women (8.12±0.74 mIU/ml), in contrast to healthy women (7.35±0.62 mIU/ml) (p>0.05). While the LH hormone results was, in patients with PCOS (7.61±0.73 mIU/ml), as opposed to the control group it was (5.62±0.56 mIU/ml), the (p>0.05). Finally, the LH/FSH ratio showed a non- significant increase in both patients (1.161±0.37) and controls (0.7819±0.22) (p>0.05). Conclusion Women with PCOS showed increased LH levels and the LH/FSH ratio. However, a decrease in anti-LH antibody was accompanied by an increase of LH hormone and LH/FSH ratio.

                Background This policy brief examines the significant misalignment between the biological sleep patterns of students and the early start times of most educational institutions. Chronic sleep deprivation in this population is associated with detrimental effects on academic performance, mental and physical health, and interpersonal relationships. Policy and implications Compelling evidence indicates that early school schedules, dictated by historical and economic factors rather than student biology, force adolescents and young adults into a state of chronic sleep deficit. This has clear impacts, including impaired cognitive function, increased risks of obesity and cardiometabolic disease, and academic burnout. A systematic review of the literature confirms that delaying start times is an effective intervention to reduce these problems. Recommendations This brief recommends systematic changes, including later school and university start times, the integration of sleep hygiene education into curricula, limits on late-evening activities, and the use of flexible learning models. Supporting these structural changes, systems for monitoring student well-being and educating families are also advised. Conclusions Aligning educational schedules with biological sleep needs is a critical public health intervention. Comprehensive strategies that combine schedule adjustments, education, and support services offer the greatest benefit for student health and academic success. Future research should focus on socio-economic factors and local structural barriers to ensure equitable implementation.

                Background This study, entitled “University education: the way to fight poverty in Africa,” aimed to analyze the effect of university education on poverty. The research highlights the need for Congo, in particular, and sub-Saharan Africa, in general, to invest massively in university education to hope for the economic and social development so proclaimed. Indeed, the university education of individuals in a country is a critical factor in poverty reduction (Samo, 2022, Li et al., 2024). However, in sub-Saharan Africa, there needs to be more space for university education, focusing rather on primary education policies (UNESCO, 1997). Methods Data used are those from the 2011 Congolese household survey. The paper uses the decomposition of Foster Greer and Thorbecke’s (1984) poverty intensity index to show the differences in poverty by level of education attained among individuals with a higher level of education. The Full information maximum likelihood method using the Conditional mixed process (CMP) was preferred because it considers the variables’ causality by avoiding the endogeneity bias (Roodman, 2011). Results A Lorenz curve analysis shows that more education does not mean less income inequality. A multivariate explanatory analysis also shows the net effects of university education on poverty. The results obtained showed that university education helps reduce poverty. Conclusions The final analysis allows us to realize the gap between the political discourse regarding the desire to escape underdevelopment and the actions undertaken to do so, at least in terms of education. The results of this research, which are quite clear and relevant to the meaning and direction of this poverty-university education relationship, give rise to avenues of questioning on public policy in financing higher education practiced today by these sub-Saharan African countries.

                <p>by Assaf Biran, Yaron E. Antebi</p>

Signaling pathways enable cells to coordinate collective behaviors by exchanging specific information. Many pathways utilize multiple ligand variants to activate the same intracellular signaling cascade, raising the question of how cells discriminate between these seemingly redundant signals. It has been shown that individual cells can discriminate between signals based on their induced level of activity, temporal dynamics or combinatorial effect. Here, we demonstrate that ligand discrimination could also emerge at the population level. Using mathematical models of ligand-receptor interactions, we examine how response heterogeneity at the population level can encode ligand identity. We introduce a local scaling metric to quantify how variation in pathway components affects the cellular response. Our results reveal that for pathways with dimeric receptors, and more significantly for heterodimeric receptors, biochemical parameters of the ligands control the resulting heterogeneity in the response of a population of cells. Furthermore, we show that the population-level heterogeneity encodes the enzymatic activity of the resulting receptor complex. This suggests a functional advantage for utilizing heterodimeric receptor complexes in pathways acting across a population of cells, such as the type I interferon pathway, which shows several of the characteristics of our model. This contrasts to juxtacrine pathways, such as Notch, that do not act at the population level and use a single component receptor. Overall, our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which receptor architecture enables cells to encode ligand-specific information through population-level heterogeneity, offering insights into immune regulation, tissue development, and synthetic biology.

                <p>by Jakub Lála, Ayham Al-Saffar, Stefano Angioletti-Uberti</p>

Despite recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods for protein design, existing computational pipelines remain rigid, highly specific, and ill-suited for tasks requiring non-differentiable or multi-objective design goals. In this report, we introduce BAGEL, a modular, open-source framework for programmable protein engineering, enabling flexible exploration of sequence space through model-agnostic and gradient-free exploration of an energy landscape. BAGEL formalizes protein design as the sampling of an energy function, either to optimize (find a global optimum) or to explore a basin of interest (generate diverse candidates). This energy function is composed of user-defined terms capturing geometric constraints, sequence embedding similarities, or structural confidence metrics. BAGEL also natively supports multi-state optimization and advanced Monte Carlo techniques, providing researchers with a flexible alternative to fixed-backbone and inverse-folding paradigms common in current design workflows. Moreover, the package seamlessly integrates a wide range of publicly available deep learning protein models, allowing users to rapidly take full advantage of any future improvements in model accuracy and speed. We illustrate the versatility of BAGEL on four archetypal applications: designing de novo peptide binders, targeting intrinsically disordered epitopes, selectively binding to species-specific variants, and generating enzyme variants with conserved catalytic sites. By offering a modular, easy-to-use platform to define custom protein design objectives and optimization strategies, BAGEL aims to speed up the design of new proteins. Our goal with its release is to democratize protein design, abstracting the process as much as possible from technical implementation details and thereby making it more accessible to the broader scientific community, unlocking untapped potential for innovation in biotechnology and therapeutics.

                <p>by Leonardo Agasso, Ivan Molineris, Michele Caselle</p>

Two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurred about 500 million years ago and played a major role in the evolution of the vertebrate genomes. Human genes derived from WGD are called “ohnologs”. Ohnologs are involved in fundamental biological processes and significantly contributed to the complexity of the human gene regulatory network. Given the central role of miRNAs in gene regulation, we investigated the contribution of ohnolog miRNAs (ohno-miRNAs) to the human gene regulatory network. We identified intragenic ohno-miRNAs as having higher retention rates compared to intragenic Small Scale Duplicated (SSD) miRNAs. Ohno-miRNAs also show high sequence similarity, a stronger tendency to regulate common target genes and are typically more expressed compared to miRNAs unrelated to WGD events. Analyzing the role of ohno-miRNAs in the human gene regulatory network, we showed that ohno-miRNAs are statistically overrepresented in specific network motifs commonly associated with redundancy and complexity, highlighting their central role in gene regulation.

Repeated waves of emerging variants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics have highlighted the urge of collecting longitudinal genomic data and developing statistical methods based on time series analyses for detecting new threatening lineages and estimating their fitness early in time. Most models study the evolution of the prevalence of particular lineages over time and require a prior classification of sequences into lineages which is prone to induce delays and biases. More recently, several authors studied the evolution of the prevalence of mutations over time with alternative clustering approaches, avoiding specific lineage classification. Most existing methods are either non parametric or unsuited to pooled data characterizing, for instance, wastewater samples. The analysis of wastewater samples has recently been pointed out as a valuable complementary approach to clinical sample analysis, however the pooled nature of the data involves specific statistical challenges. In this context, we propose an alternative unsupervised method for clustering mutations according to their frequency trajectory over time and estimating group fitness from time series of pooled mutation prevalence data. Our model is a mixture of observed count data and latent group assignment and we use the expectation-maximization algorithm for model selection and parameter estimation. The application of our method to time series of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data collected from wastewater treatment plants in France from October 2020 to April 2021 shows its ability to agnostically group mutations in a consistent way with lineages B.1.160, Alpha, B.1.177, Beta, and with selection coefficient estimates per group in coherence with the viral dynamics in France reported by Nextstrain. Moreover, our method detected the Alpha variant as threatening as early as supervised methods (which track specific mutations over time) with the noticeable difference that, since unsupervised, it does not require any prior information on the set of mutations.

                <p>by Michael P. Mustri, Quqiming Duan, Samraat Pawar</p>

The generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model is a cornerstone of theoretical ecology for modeling the dynamics emerging from species interactions within complex ecological communities. The GLV is also increasingly being used to infer species interactions and predict dynamics from empirical data on microbial communities, in particular. However, despite its widespread use, the accuracy of the GLV’s pairwise interaction structure in capturing the unseen dynamics of microbial consumer-resource interactions—arising from resource competition and metabolite exchanges—remains unclear. Here, we rigorously quantify how well the GLV can represent the dynamics of a general mathematical model that encapsulates key consumer-resource processes in microbial communities. We find that the GLV significantly misrepresents the feasibility, stability, and reactivity of microbial communities above a threshold biologically feasible level of consumer-resource coupling, because it omits higher-order nonlinear interactions. We show that the probability of the GLV making inaccurate predictions can be quantified by a simple, empirically accessible measure of timescale separation between consumers and resources. These insights advance our understanding of the temporal dynamics of resource-mediated microbial interactions and provide a method for gauging the GLV’s reliability across various empirical and theoretical scenarios.

                <p>by Monica Sacco, Stefano Lancellotti, Antonietta Ferretti, Maria Basso, Leonardo Di Gennaro, Giancarlo Castaman, Raimondo De Cristofaro</p>

Type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) is often caused by variants in von Willebrand factor (VWF), including p.R1205H (“Vicenza mutation”), which accelerate VWF clearance via macrophage receptor LRP1 and impair platelet adhesion and activation. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain partially unclear. Here, we use integrative computational modeling (I-TASSER, HADDOCK2.4, and PRODIGY) to predict how p.R1205H/C/L/S variants alter VWF interaction with LRP1 and its platelet receptor GPIbα that binds to the A1 VWF domain. Our models reveal that R1205 acts as a structural hinge: its variants disrupt polar networks in VWF’s D3 domain, exposing neo-epitopes that enhance LRP1 binding (ΔΔG up to −5.3 kcal/mol) while destabilizing the A1 domain’s α1-β2 loop, reducing GPIbα affinity (≅30-fold for R1205L/C). These findings explain clinical observations, p.R1205H rapid clearance yet retained platelet adhesion, and establish R1205 as a dual-functional switch regulating VWF circulatory lifetime and hemostatic activity. This analytical procedure provides a template for predicting pathogenicity of VWF variants and designing targeted therapies for VWD.

                <p>by Esteban Dodero-Rojas, Angel Mendieta, Yao Fehlis, Nicholas Mayala, Vinícius G. Contessoto, José N. Onuchic</p>

Chromatin within the nucleus adopts complex three-dimensional structures that are crucial for gene regulation and cellular function. Recent studies have revealed the presence of distinct chromatin subcompartments beyond the traditional A/B compartments (eu- and hetero-chromatin), each exhibiting unique structural and functional properties. Here, we introduce TECSAS (Transformer of Epigenetics to Chromatin Structural AnnotationS), a deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture, designed to predict chromatin subcompartment annotations directly from epigenomic data. TECSAS leverages information from histone modifications, transcription factor binding profiles, and RNA-Seq data to decode the relationship between the biochemical composition of chromatin and its 3D structural behavior. TECSAS achieves high accuracy in predicting subcompartment annotations and reveals the influence of long-range epigenomic context on chromatin organization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model’s capability to predict the association of loci with nuclear bodies, such as the lamina, nucleoli, and speckles, providing insights into the role of these structures in shaping the 3D genome organization. This study highlights the potential of deep learning models for deciphering the complex interplay between epigenomic features and 3D genome organization, allowing us to better understand genome structure and function.

Diplonemids are among the most diverse and abundant protists in the deep ocean, have extremely complex and ancient cellular systems, and exhibit unique metabolic capacities. Despite this, we know very little about this major group of eukaryotes. To establish a model organism for comprehensive investigation, we performed subcellular proteomics on <i>Paradiplonema papillatum</i> and localized 4,870 proteins to 22 cellular compartments. We additionally confirmed the predicted location of several proteins by epitope tagging and fluorescence microscopy. To probe the metabolic capacities of <i>P. papillatum</i>, we explored the proteins predicted to the cell membrane compartment in our subcellular proteomics dataset. Our data revealed an accumulation of many carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CDZymes). Our predictions suggest that these CDZymes are exposed to extracellular space, supporting proposals that diplonemids may specialize in breaking down carbohydrates in plant and algal cell walls. Further exploration of carbohydrate metabolism revealed an evolutionary divergence in the function of glycosomes (modified peroxisomes) in diplonemids versus kinetoplastids. Our subcellular proteome provides a resource for future investigations into the unique cell biology of diplonemids.

                Background Hybrid nanofluids, consisting of two distinct nanoparticles dispersed in a base fluid, are widely used in industries requiring enhanced heat and mass transfer, such as cooling systems and heat exchangers. These fluids improve thermal conductivity and fluid dynamics, leading to better heat management and energy efficiency. This study investigates the combined effects of non-linear thermal radiation, Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass fluxes, and other factors on the three-dimensional flow, heat, and mass transfer of a Williamson hybrid nanofluid. The flow occurs over a stretching porous sheet subjected to an external magnetic field, Joule heating, chemical reactions, and heat generation. Methods Copper (Cu) and aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) nanoparticles are suspended in ethylene glycol (C₂C₆O₂) to form the hybrid nanofluid. The governing partial differential equations are transformed into ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations and solved numerically with MATLAB’s bvp4c solver. The study examines various parameters, including stretching ratio, nanoparticle volume fraction, and relaxation times for concentration and thermal effects. Results are validated against existing literature. Results The findings reveal that a higher stretching ratio reduces velocity, temperature, concentration profiles, and local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, while also lowering skin friction and secondary velocity. Increasing nanoparticle volume fraction decreases velocity and temperature profiles but enhances skin friction, local Nusselt, and Sherwood numbers. Concentration profiles decline with higher concentration relaxation time, while temperature increases with longer thermal relaxation time. Conclusions In conclusion, Cu−Al₂O₃/C₂C₆O₂ hybrid nanofluids demonstrate superior heat and mass transfer capabilities compared to mono-nanofluids. The performance is significantly influenced by parameters such as nanoparticle volume fraction, relaxation times, and the stretching ratio, providing valuable insights for heat and mass transfer applications.

                Background Education is the key to stimulating the all-around development of any nation. Teachers should ensure that appropriate methods and strategies are employed to equip learners with the necessary knowledge and skills to enable them to become economically and socially innovative. Thus, teachers should endeavor to understand how different factors, both internal and external to the school, may influence the academic achievement of learners to apply appropriate interventions for the best of the learners. Aim This study aimed to examine learners’ perceptions based on their gender of the influence of class participation in physics among secondary schools in Rukungiri District, Southwestern Uganda. Methods Quantitative research with a cross-sectional design was used. The sample consisted of 355 ordinary-level secondary samples. Learners’ perceptions of class participation surveys were developed by the researchers and used to collect the data. Data were analyzed using means, standard deviations, and independent t-tests. Findings The findings revealed that Both males and females believed that improved class participation led to enhanced academic achievement. Learners’ perceptions did not vary significantly based on their gender. Recommendations The study recommends designing and implementing school-based gender-sensitive policies by relevant authorities, training teachers in interactive teaching methods, and creating initiatives to promote engaging and non-discriminatory interactive methods to positively boost learners’ class participation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-608/v2?src=rss">Assembly and quantification of transcripts from noisy long reads with NIFFLR [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Long-read RNA sequencing technologies can produce complete or near-complete transcript sequences. Recently introduced methods for direct RNA and cDNA sequencing can provide a high-throughput strategy for the discovery of novel and rare gene isoforms. However, the high error rates in ONT sequences limit the ability to exactly pinpoint splice site boundaries when aligning reads to the genome. Methods In this paper, we present a novel tool called NIFFLR (Novel IsoForm Finder using Long Reads) that identifies and quantifies both known and novel isoforms using long-read RNA sequencing data. NIFFLR recovers known transcripts and assembles novel transcripts present in the data by aligning exons from a reference annotation to the long reads. Results NIFFLR effectively recovers correct transcripts from simulated reads based on known transcript annotations, achieving higher sensitivity and precision compared to several previously published tools. On real data, NIFFLR shows high accuracy as measured by concordance of isoform counts to the counts computed from Illumina data for the same sample. We applied NIFFLR to a set of 92 GTEx long-read samples and produced transcript counts for both novel and known isoforms. In total, we identified and quantified 119,928 isoforms present in the RefSeq annotation of GRCh38 and 42,868 novel isoforms across 34,383 genes, more than previous studies identified in this dataset. Conclusions NIFFLR is an effective tool aimed at assembly and quantification of transcripts present in the long, high error transcriptome reads. NIFFLR is released under an open-source license (GPL 3.0) and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/alguoo314/NIFFLR/releases, and from BioConda as “nifflr”.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-912/v3?src=rss">Modernizing Commercial Agency Regulations in Saudi Arabia: Legal Reforms and Comparative Insights [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study analyzes Saudi Arabia’s 2022–2023 reforms to the Commercial Agency Law through legal, economic, and comparative lenses. The pre-reform regime—marked by rigid nationality limits, procedural burdens, and litigation-prone termination rules—constrained market entry and investor confidence. Methods Using a doctrinal approach to statutes and implementing regulations, triangulated with Saudi judicial practice and policy instruments, we benchmark Saudi reforms against the UAE and UK. A Shariah lens clarifies how gharar (uncertainty), fasakh (rescission), and unjust enrichment (akl al-māl bil-bāṭil) shape agency disputes. Results Key changes include more flexible nationality rules, end-to-end digital registration and renewal, clearer termination/compensation standards, and formal recognition of arbitration (including SCCA). Together these measures enhance contractual predictability and lower compliance frictions, with early indications of improved market transparency and investor sentiment. Conclusions The reforms signal a hybrid model—liberalization aligned with global practice while preserving a Shariah-grounded identity. Remaining priorities include consistent judicial application, practitioner training, clearer guidance, and GCC coordination. We propose thematically grouped policy steps to consolidate gains and support Vision 2030’s diversification agenda.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-888/v2?src=rss">Next-Generation Interference Management: A Narrative Review of power Allocation and SIC Enhancement in 5G/6G NOMA [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is an emerging technology to support 5G and beyond wireless networks. It increases spectral efficiency, connectivity, and system throughput. At the core of NOMA is Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), which separates superimposed signals in the power domain. However, SIC performance is highly susceptible to interference, channel estimation errors, and inefficient power allocation. This review summarizes optimization-based, heuristic, hybrid, and artificial intelligence-based power allocation methods. It also examines energy-efficient designs, massive connectivity support, cross-layer optimization, cooperative NOMA, and robust SIC for ultra-reliable low-latency communication. The insights presented can guide researchers in improving SIC and power allocation in dense network environments.

                Zhang et al. demonstrate that IL-1R1/TLR signaling enhances atherosclerosis by disrupting β-arrestin-2 (βarr2)-mediated OR6A2 internalization in macrophages. This shift, driven by βarr2K295 deSUMOylation-dependent TRAF6-βarr2 coupling, sustains NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Targeting this pathway may offer therapeutic strategies to mitigate inflammation-driven vascular disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103781">The electrogenicity of the Na+/K+-ATPase poses challenges for computation in highly active spiking cells</a></h4>

              
                The evolution of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase laid the foundation for ion homeostasis and electrical signaling. While not required for restoration of ionic gradients, the electrogenicity of the pump (resulting from its 3:2 stoichiometry) is useful to prevent runaway activity. As we show here, electrogenicity could also come with disadvantageous side effects: (1) an activity-dependent shift in a cell’s baseline firing and (2) interference with computation, disturbing network entrainment when inputs change strongly. We exemplify these generic effects in a mathematical model of the weakly electric fish electrocyte, which spikes at hundreds of Hz and is exposed to abrupt rate changes when producing behaviorally relevant communication signals. We discuss biophysical strategies that may allow cells to mitigate the consequences of electrogenicity at additional metabolic cost and postulate an interesting role for a voltage dependence of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Our work shows that the pump’s electrogenicity can open an additional axis of vulnerability that may play a role in brain disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103545">The primate Major Histocompatibility Complex as a case study of gene family evolution</a></h4>

              
                Gene families are groups of evolutionarily related genes. One large gene family that has experienced rapid evolution lies within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), whose proteins serve critical roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Across the ∼60 million year history of the primates, some MHC genes have turned over completely, some have changed function, some have converged in function, and others have remained essentially unchanged. Past work has typically focused on identifying MHC alleles within particular species or comparing gene content, but more work is needed to understand the overall evolution of the gene family across species. Thus, despite the immunologic importance of the MHC and its peculiar evolutionary history, we lack a complete picture of MHC evolution in the primates. We readdress this question using sequences from dozens of MHC genes and pseudogenes spanning the entire primate order, building a comprehensive set of gene and allele trees with modern methods. Overall, we find that the Class I gene subfamily is evolving much more quickly than the Class II gene subfamily, with the exception of the Class II MHC-DRB genes. We also pay special attention to the often-ignored pseudogenes, which we use to reconstruct different events in the evolution of the Class I region. We find that despite the shared function of the MHC across species, different species employ different genes, haplotypes, and patterns of variation to achieve a successful immune response. Our trees and extensive literature review represent the most comprehensive look into primate MHC evolution to date.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105863">Dorsal hippocampus mediates light–tone associations in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Daily choices are often influenced by environmental cues that are not directly associated with reinforcers. This phenomenon, known as higher-order conditioning, can be studied using sensory preconditioning tasks in rodents. This behavioral paradigm involves the repeated pairing of two innocuous stimuli, such as a light and a tone, followed by a devaluation phase in which one stimulus is associated with an unconditioned stimulus, such as a mild footshock. The result is a conditioned response (e.g., freezing) to both the conditioned stimulus (direct learning) and the non-conditioned stimulus (mediated learning). In our study, we successfully established a light–tone sensory preconditioning task specifically in male mice, as sex differences were observed in both control experimental groups and in sensory preconditioning responses. We employed in vivo, freely moving fiber photometry to monitor neural activity in the dorsal and ventral subregions of the hippocampus in male mice during the formation of associations between innocuous stimuli and reinforcers. Additionally, we combined our sensory preconditioning task with chemogenetic approaches to investigate the roles of these hippocampal subregions in sensory preconditioning. Our results indicate that dorsal, but not ventral, CaMKII-positive neurons are involved in encoding innocuous stimuli during the preconditioning phase. Overall, we developed a novel light–tone sensory preconditioning protocol in male mice, enabling the detection of sex differences and furthering our understanding of how specific hippocampal subregions and cell types regulate complex cognitive processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107503">Dominant spinal muscular atrophy linked mutations in the cargo binding domain of BICD2 result in altered interactomes and dynein hyperactivity</a></h4>

              
                Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is responsible for the transport of most cellular cargo towards the minus end of microtubules. Dynein activation requires the multi-subunit dynactin complex and an activating cargo adaptor. The adaptors serve to link dynein with cargo and to fully activate the motor. Mutations in one of these activating adaptors, Bicaudal-D2 (BICD2), are associated with a neurodegenerative disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Lower Extremity Predominance (SMALED2). The molecular defect that underlies SMALED2 is largely unknown. In addition to interacting with dynein, BICD2 has also been shown to associate with KIF5B, a plus-end directed microtubule motor. We hypothesized that interactome changes associated with mutant versions of BICD2, and the resulting differences in cargo transport, might underlie the etiology of SMALED2. To test our hypothesis, we first defined the interactome of wild-type human BICD2. This led to the identification of known BICD2 interacting proteins in addition to potentially novel cargo such as components of the HOPS complex, a six-subunit complex involved in endo-lysosomal trafficking. We next determined the interactome of three SMALED2-linked mutants in BICD2, two of which reside in the cargo binding domain. Interestingly, all three mutations resulted in BICD2-mediated dynein hyper-activation. Furthermore, all three mutants were associated with interactome changes. One of these mutants, BICD2_R747C, was deficient in binding to HOPS complex components and the nucleoporin RANBP2. In addition, this mutant also resulted in a gain-of-function interaction with GRAMD1A, a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. This gain-of-function interaction resulted in mislocalization of GRAMD1A in BICD2_R747C expressing cells. Collectively, our results suggest that dynein hyperactivity, interactome changes, and cargo transport defects might contribute to the symptoms associated with SMALED2.

">Early Diabetic Ca2+ Handling Impairments in the Rod Bipolar Pathway</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous work showed that electrically-evoked inhibition to Rod Bipolar Cells (RBC) is reduced in a mouse model of early diabetes. It is hypothesized that this is due to impaired Ca2+ handling in the presynaptic amacrine cell, either through increased Ca2+ buffering or decreased influx. To test this hypothesis and develop a mechanism for this effect, a model where direct optogenetic activation of inhibitory amacrine cells that expressed the light-activated channel ChR2 was used to isolate amacrine cell inputs to RBCs. Application of selective Ca2+ channel blockers could then assess potential locations of amacrine Ca2+ disruption. Using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, recordings were made from a 6 week diabetic population (DM) and vehicle injected non-DM animals. Results: Robust GABA C receptor inhibitory currents were recorded from RBCs after ChR2 stimulus that were significantly diminished by the application of nifedipine to block L-typeCa2+ channels in both DM and non-DM conditions. There were significant differences in the peak amplitude of these responses between DM and non- DM groups (p = 0.0146). However, in the non-DM group the decay tau of the response to the 50ms stimulus was significantly diminished by nifedipine ( p =0.0498, n = 5), but this was not seen in the DM group ( p = 0.9498, n=7). A 1s nifedipine-reduced response saw its decay tau increase in the DM group but not the non-DM. Ca2+ - induced Ca2+ release (CICR) blockade with ryanodine decreased responsivity equally between groups in the 1s stimulus but showed no significant kinetic changes. CICR blockade for a 50ms stimulus response showed significant kinetic changes in diabetes but otherwise reduced the response equally between DM and non-DM. Blockade of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) had little effect on the optogenetic response. Conclusion: This study presents evidence that diabetes alters amacrine cell output to the RBC unmasked through blockade of the L-type calcium channel, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). An apparent explanation for our results is that DM calcium buffering is dysregulated, leading to prolonged responses. The underlying mechanism for this alteration is complex and not yet clearly elucidated.

">Torsional Force by Helical Pericytes Regulates Blood Flow in Downstream Capillaries</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the contractile properties of downstream capillaries, which are traditionally regarded as passive conduits, and addresses ongoing debates surrounding blood flow regulation. It is widely accepted that these capillaries passively dilate in response to increased blood flow in upstream microvessels, and that the helical pericytes located on them lack contractile capability, largely due to the absence of detectable a-SMA expression. Challenging this prevailing view, we demonstrate that downstream capillary pericytes do express both a-SMA and Myosin11, as shown using in situ hybridization on whole-mount intact retinas -unlike prior studies that relied on dissociated cells. Furthermore, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis reveals that a-SMA and Myosin11 are in sufficiently close proximity to permit actomyosin bridge cycling, a process essential for contraction. We also show that pericyte contraction can be inhibited by disrupting this molecular interaction. Distinct from the nodal constrictions caused by circular pericyte processes in upstream microvessels, we identify torsional contractions in the downstream capillaries in the retina of living mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM), which regulates blood flow. These contractions provide direct evidence that downstream capillaries actively contribute to blood flow regulation. Notably, such contractions were overlooked in previous TPLSM studies that monitored only luminal diameter, unless the specialized analytical techniques we employed were applied. Our 3D modeling confirms that these torsional contractions correlate with the helical morphology of pericytes in downstream capillaries -a structure previously thought incapable of producing significant constrictive force. In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that downstream pericytes play an active role in regulating blood flow. They highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism -torsional contraction- that aligns with the helical structure of these pericytes and contributes to flow regulation in small-caliber capillaries located nearest to regions of high oxygen demand.

">Molecular dynamics of the pathogenic KCNQ2 variant G256W reveal mechanisms of channel dysfunction in epileptic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Brain voltage-gated potassium channels containing the subunit KCNQ2 are essential for regulating electrical signals contributing to sensation, learning, memory, and motor control. De novo KCNQ2 variants are among the more common Mendelian causes of early life epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment. Some patients with KCNQ2 variants are affected with KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2 DEE) characterized by seizures and developmental delays. Children with KCNQ2 DEE exhibit a range of impairment patterns that appear to be correlated with specific consequences of the variant for protein function. Here, we used all-atom molecular dynamics to analyze a pathogenic missense variant KCNQ2 G256W, located in the pore turret. G256W subunit simulations showed migration of the hydrophobic W256 sidechain towards the lipid membrane. This movement affected turret structure and mobility prominently involving K255. We identified novel hydrogen bonding interactions in the wild type KCNQ2 turret region which formed a network that extended to the selectivity filter and identified N258, H260P, and K283 as key residues. Simulations comparing WT and G256W tetrameric channels exhibited more conformationally unstable ion selectivity filters for G256W. We analyzed how different stoichiometries of wild type and G256W subunits, as expected in heterozygous individuals, impacted dynamics and compared the G256W results to three additional variants of the turret-selectivity filter network. Our results provide additional support for an integral role of the KCNQ2 turret selectivity filter stability. The majority of severe KCNQ2 DEE variants are clustered near the selectivity filter in the pore domain. Our study provides insights that may be broadly applicable to this clinically important allele subgroup.

">Anterior thalamic nucleus inputs to the retrosplenial cortex are unperturbed in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive function. Although research has traditionally focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, other regions important for memory and spatial navigation, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), are also affected. The RSC is an important brain region for both memory and spatial navigation, and displays dysfunction in humans during prodromal phases of AD. The ATN provide a major input to RSC, with loss of this input to RSC causing a dramatic reduction in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. The ATN to RSC connection may thus present a new target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Here, we set out to determine whether AD-like pathology perturbed projections from ATN to RSC using the hAPP-J20 amyloidopathy mouse model, using optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs combined with ex vivo patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that RSC displayed an age-dependent decline in basal c-Fos activity, with no additional effect of amyloid pathology on c-Fos expression. At all time points (3, 6 and 9 months) measured, we found no evidence of impairments in the synaptic strength or efficacy of the ATN projections to either granular or dysgranular subdivisions of RSC. We conclude that, in the hAPP-J20 mouse model, this pathway is unaffected by amyloid-{beta} overexpression.

">Advancing High-Resolution 7T Diffusion MRI: Evaluating Phase-Encoding Correction Strategies for Distortion Correction from Basic to Four-Way Acquisitions</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: High-resolution 7T diffusion MRI (dMRI) is limited by image artifacts that compromise anatomical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate phase-encoding (PE) acquisition and correction strategies to determine which methods best mitigate geometric distortions and improve data reproducibility. Methods: Five healthy adults were each scanned twice on a 7T MRI scanner (0.9 mm isotropic resolution), using a highly oversampled dMRI protocol with four PE directions (AP, PA, RL, LR). From this dataset, we created and processed eleven time-equivalent, 10-minute acquisitions, ranging from uncorrected single-PE data to comprehensive 4-way PE schemes. These strategies were quantitatively compared on their geometric alignment with T1-weighted images and on the scan-rescan reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics. Results: (1) All distortion-corrected schemes significantly improved geometric accuracy over uncorrected data; (2) Strategies correcting with a full set of reversed-PE (2-way) diffusion weighted images (DWIs) outperformed the common approach of using only a single reversed b=0 image; and (3) a 4-way PE acquisition consistently provided the highest image fidelity and reproducibility. The optimized acquisition enabled high-quality reconstruction of both long-range and fine-scale superficial white matter pathways. Conclusion: For high-resolution 7T dMRI, multi-PE acquisition is essential to achieve accurate geometry and stable microstructural estimates (i.e., less residual EPI distortion and better scan-rescan agreement). A 4-way PE scheme provides the most accurate and reproducible results for microstructural and connectivity modeling. Data statement: Data will be made available in BIDS format in openneuro sharing platform upon acceptance of the manuscript. To be updated with DOI.

">Model-based separation of visual and oculomotor signals in marmoset lateral intraparietal area</a></h4>

              
                The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) integrates visual information with task demands to guide saccadic eye movements. Most prior studies have relied on imposed prolonged delays to separate sensory and motor activity, whereas natural behavior involves rapid sensory-motor transformations. To examine LIP function during more naturalistic oculomotor behavior, we recorded multi-unit activity from LIP in two marmosets performing a task requiring rapid selection of salient visual stimuli. Because sensory and motor signals temporally overlap in such fast tasks, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that separately captured visually driven and oculomotor-related components. The model explained substantial neural variance during correct and missed saccades, as well as spontaneous eye movements, and revealed heterogeneous sensory and motor encoding across recorded neural units. Our approach demonstrated that the origins of neural activity can be segregated without relying on imposed delays, and showed the presence of a strong post-saccadic motor signal in LIP.

">Top-down control of sustained attention by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)- locus coeruleus (LC) circuit during the rodent continuous performance task (rCPT)</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a pivotal role in attention by exerting top-down control to allocate cognitive resources toward behaviorally relevant stimuli based on learned context and expectations. mPFC neurons project to multiple cortical and subcortical regions, including the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's primary source of norepinephrine (NE). The mPFC also receives inputs from the LC, which release NE to modulate mPFC neuronal activity and downstream cellular signaling. While enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and LC in mice during sustained attention tasks suggest an important role for the mPFC-LC circuit, functional evidence directly implicating this circuit in attention is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of the mPFC-LC circuit in attention by comparing selective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons that project to the LC (mPFC-LC projectors) to non-specific chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons. Selective activation of mPFC-LC projectors in mice performing the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT), a translational sustained attention task, robustly improves attentional performance by enhancing discrimination while non-selective activation of mPFC neurons increases attentional performance by increasing responsiveness and impulsivity. Behavioral effects of mPFC-LC projector activation were mediated by recruitment of a microcircuit involving LC-NE neurons and glutamate and GABA peri-LC neurons. while effects of non-selective activation of mPFC neurons were mediated by engaging downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as the LC/peri-LC region.

">GABA co-release guides the functional maturation of glycinergicsynapses in an auditory sound localization circuit.</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian brainstem and spinal cord, glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also co-release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA co-release on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA co-release at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses co-release GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA co-release from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA co-release resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA co-release in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.

">Cognitive cartography of mammalian brains using meta-analysis of AI experts</a></h4>

              
                The complexity of the brain is increasingly mirrored by the complexity of the neuroscientific literature, yet no individual mind can fully grasp the diversity of scales, methodologies and model organisms. Where human experts flag, the latest AI models excel: large language models can seamlessly integrate knowledge across scientific domains. Here we show how large language models can systematically and quantitatively synthesise literature-wide neuroscientific knowledge about the cognitive operations and dysfunctions associated with each brain region. Meta-analysis of AI experts reveals structurefunction mappings to which existing meta-analytic frameworks are blind, demonstrated by lesions and direct intracranial stimulation. It also unlocks the possibility of extending quantitative literature metaanalysis and decoding of brain maps to other model organisms beyond human. As proof of concept, we integrate LLM meta-analysis with species-specific transcriptomics in human, macaque, and mouse, to discover an evolutionarily conserved molecular circuit for cognition. Altogether, meta-analysis of AI experts can fundamentally catalyze neuroscientific discovery by overcoming the barrier of data aggregation from heterogeneous studies, finally bringing together a scattered literature to identify emergent patterns and latent insights across disparate subfields, modalities, and species.

">Human Mediodorsal Thalamus in Seizure Propagation</a></h4>

              
                Background: How different thalamic sites are recruited during seizure propagation remains poorly understood. Simultaneous recordings from multiple thalamic sites in patients with focal seizures provide a rare opportunity to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of thalamic involvement during human epilepsy. Objective: To characterize the recruitment patterns of mediodorsal (MD) thalamic subregion during seizures and their generalization to the contralateral hemisphere. Methods: We analyzed 119 seizures from 23 patients (12 male, age range: 20-57y) undergoing multisite thalamic recordings. In accordance with current clinical standards, we determined the spatial and temporal features of thalamic seizure activity by visually reviewing intracranial EEG recordings from different seizure types in each individual patient. Results: The procedure of multisite thalamic recordings had no complications. In total, we captured seizures originating from temporal lobes (63%), orbitofrontal (11%), frontotemporal (8%), occipital (8%), lateral frontal (4%), parietal (3%), and cingulate (2%) regions. Seizures were focal (76% in 21 patients), focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC, 9% in nine patients), or only electrographic (15% in six patients). Thalamic engagement was seen in 100% of patients occurring typically early during seizure evolution (83% within 15 seconds of seizure onset). Majority of FBTC seizures (73%) had faster thalamic recruitment, often within the first 5 seconds. The pulvinar (PLV) subregion was the most common first-activated thalamic site, particularly in temporal lobe seizures. Although the MD was involved in most seizures (88.2%), it was rarely the initial or sole thalamic structure engaged and more often followed anterior (ANT) and/or PLV sites. Contralateral propagation occurred in 66% of seizures and was strongly linked to MD involvement: the ipsilateral and contralateral MDs were engaged in about 95% of these cases. When ipsilateral MD engagement was absent, contralateral spread of seizures was uncommon. In majority of seizures (60%) that generalized to the contralateral hemisphere, the ipsilateral MD was involved before or simultaneously with the contralateral cortical sites. Importantly, seizures that first activated the MD originated mainly from the medial temporal lobes, whereas those spreading primarily to the contralateral cortex were mostly neocortical in onset. Conclusions: The thalamic MD subregion was often involved after the other thalamic sites, but the MD sites, along with the massa intermedia connecting the two thalami, were significantly involved when seizures spread to contralateral hemisphere. Our findings suggest that a single thalamic lead capturing both MD subregions may yield important clinical information about laterality, origin, and generalization of seizures.

">Dual-targeting snRNA gene therapy rescues STMN2 and UNC13A splicing in TDP-43 proteinopathies</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the selective deterioration of motor neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). A key driver of this pathogenesis is nuclear loss of ALS-associated protein TDP-43, leading to mis-splicing of TDP-43 targets including important neuronal genes STMN2 and UNC13A. Here, we have developed a gene therapy strategy for ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies, to correct mis-splicing of both STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons using small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) encoded from a single vector. We identified promoter sequence elements to increase therapeutic snRNA expression by 10-fold, then further optimized the expression cassette with combinatorial snRNA targeting to rescue multiple cryptic splicing targets. The engineered snRNAs restored normal pre-mRNA processing of both STMN2 and UNC13A transcripts despite TDP-43 loss of function, rescuing stathmin-2 protein levels in iPSC derived motor neurons, restoring their axonal regeneration capacity to wild-type levels. In addition, adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of the snRNAs to the murine central nervous system in the constitutive cryptic splicing model Stmn2Hum{Delta}GU fully restored cortical Stmn2 pre-mRNA processing, highlighting the utility of snRNAs as a therapeutic modality in vivo. Together, this study demonstrates that snRNAs are a promising and versatile therapeutic strategy for the simultaneous correction of multiple aberrant transcripts affected by cryptic splicing in TDP-43 proteinopathies.

">Neonatal morphine and HIV synergy induce persistent neuroimmune and anxiety-related transcriptional states</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early life opioid exposure can disrupt neurodevelopment and heighten vulnerability to anxiety and affective disorders, particularly in individuals with HIV. Methods: Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we profiled adolescent brains from wild-type and HIV1 transgenic (Tg26) mice exposed to morphine during postnatal days 2 to 7. Results: Morphine exposure in Tg26 mice resulted in a highly dysregulated microglial phenotype, characterized by the ectopic upregulation of genes encoding neuronpeptides (Avp, Hcrt, and Pmch), while simultaneously showing a reduction in both inflammatory and homeostatic markers (Map3k6, Lgals3, Ccl3). Microglia also showed enhanced expression of dynorphin (Pdyn) and {kappa}-opioid receptor (Oprk1) signaling modules implicated in dysphoria and stress-induced negative effects. Furthermore, transcriptomic mapping revealed cell-type-specific neuronal adaptations: cholinergic neurons upregulated genes linked to anxiety and arousal (Avp, Oxt), GABAergic neurons upregulated genes linked to condition and aversive behavior, whereas glutamatergic neurons enriched for transcripts associated with thigmotaxis and fear behaviors. Conclusions: Together, these findings demonstrate that brief neonatal morphine exposure in an HIV-inflamed milieu induces persistent, cell-type-specific neuroimmune and neurotransmitter reprogramming that engages the dynorphin KOR pathway and predisposes to anxiety- and aversion-related behaviors.

">Sex differences define the molecular and cellular phenotypes of pain resolution in dorsal root ganglia</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal root ganglion (DRG), a key site for the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain, was examined for sex-dependent phenotypes in sensory neurons, satellite glial cells (SGCs), and local macrophages following traumatic nerve injury and during natural pain resolution. Systematic analysis of 7,495 DRG immunofluorescence images and 62 transcriptomes revealed pronounced sex-specific, multicellular DRG phenotypes, especially during pain resolution. System parameters, including tissue size and neuron density also showed sex-dependent differences. Neuropathic pain resolved without tissue or sensory neuron loss. After injury, macrophages invaded the space between sensory neurons and satellite glial cells (SGCs); this was partially reversed during pain resolution, particularly in males. In females, immune-related gene expression and macrophage phenotypes persisted longer, while SGC activation and contact to sensory neurons was more persistent in males. During resolution, synaptic and excitability-related processes were pronounced in both sexes. However, while injury responses were largely shared between sexes, the resolution phase displayed distinctly sex-specific molecular and cellular signatures.

">Directed cortico-limbic dialogue in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                How can one trace the brain's orderly directed signals amid a tangle of nerve fibers? Because direct access to actual brain signaling is rare in humans, the precise wiring diagrams for cortico-limbic communication during sleep and wake remain essentially unmapped, hampering progress in neuroscience. Now, a unique neurosurgical window on the human brain allows for electrically mapping cortical connections at the hospital, but studies so far have relied on average signals, masking the dynamic nature of signal flow across brain regions. To causally estimate signaling dynamics, we repeatedly probed cortico-limbic networks with short-lived electrical pulses over days and assessed the variable fate of each transmitted signal on a single-trial basis. In the resulting openly available dataset, we characterized signaling probabilities and directionality across thousands local and long-range cortico-limbic connections over days. Challenging established views, we found that limbic structures send twice as many signals as they receive, in both wakefulness and sleep. Our findings provide a fundamental framework for causally interpreting signal flow in the brain and formulating therapeutic strategies for brain networks disorders.

">The Protein Disulfide Isomerase P4HB/PDIA1 Modulates PrPC Levels and Prion Replication</a></h4>

              
                Prions are misfolded, self-propagating versions of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) that cause invariably fatal transmissible neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. Little is known about how prions replicate in the brain, including whether other proteins participate in prion replication in vivo. Several members of the protein disulfide isomerase family have been shown to reside in close spatial proximity to PrPC in cells and mice, implying that they could be involved in prion biogenesis. Here, we show that stable knock-down of the protein disulfide isomerase P4HB (also called PDIA1) in prion-susceptible CAD5 cells reduces PrPC levels and results in lower levels of protease-resistant PrP (PrPres), a marker of infectious prions, following infection with two different prion strains. Partial reduction of P4HB activity using the P4HB-selective inhibitor KSC-34 also decreases PrPC levels in uninfected CAD5 cells whereas treatment of prion-infected CAD5 cells with KSC-34 results in higher levels of PrPres. A proportion of P4HB reaches the cell surface where PrPC is located, and a secreted P4HB variant increases PrPres levels in cells. Collectively, these results suggest that P4HB facilitates prion replication in cells by stabilizing PrPC and potentially acting as a chaperone that directly modulates prion conversion. Thus, targeting P4HB during prion disease may have therapeutic benefit.

">Reward Modality and Task Complexity jointly shape learning Dynamics in mice</a></h4>

              
                Learning efficacy relies on balancing reward-driven motivation with the difficulty of reaching a goal. Disentangling these factors is essential for understanding learning dynamics. Spatial navigation is a standard paradigm for probing these processes in rodents, but variation in mazes, cues, and protocols makes it difficult to determine how reward properties, rather than task design, shape learning and exploration-exploitation strategies. To date, no studies have directly compared reward type and learning difficulty within a single behavioral context. Here, we used the Starmaze to examine how reward modality and task complexity jointly influence learning and the transition from exploration to exploitation. We created three versions of the same sequential egocentric task in which a fixed goal was rewarded with either a hidden escape platform (aquatic version), food pellets, or medial forebrain bundle stimulation. Task difficulty varied by increasing the number of required decision points from zero to three. Our results reveal distinct behavioral dynamics across reward modalities and provide a unified framework for studying reward-dependent learning in sequential navigation.

">Biochemical Regulation of Brain Kynurenic Acid Synthesis and Inhibition in Rats is Sensitive to the Time of Day</a></h4>

              
                Neurochemical imbalances, including elevations of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous antagonist of glutamatergic and cholinergic receptors, are linked to cognitive and sleep disturbances in psychiatric and neurocognitive disorders. Therapeutic strategies to reduce brain KYNA by inhibiting kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) are under investigation. However, few studies consider time as a biological variable, despite recent evidence that the time of day can affect brain metabolism and drug effectiveness. Therefore, we explore the hypothesis that KYNA formation and synthesis inhibition change throughout the day. Using rats of both sexes, we measured basal KYNA levels and the effects of kynurenine (100 mg/kg, i.p.), to stimulate de novo KYNA, and/or PF-04859989 (KAT II inhibitor, 30 mg/kg, s.c.), at the beginning of light or dark phases. Microdialysis was used to assess extracellular KYNA in the dorsal hippocampus, and ex vivo assays evaluated KAT enzyme activity in separate animals. Additionally, we examined KYNA levels and the effects of PF-04859989 during acute sleep deprivation in male rats. PF-04859989 significantly decreased stimulated KYNA synthesis in both sexes and basal KYNA in males. In the dark phase, compared with the light phase, male rats treated with kynurenine and/or PF-04859989 showed higher KYNA levels and greater KYNA synthesis inhibition, respectively. In vitro, KAT II activity was similarly higher, and PF-04859989 was more effective, in the dark than in the light phase. Sleep deprivation increased extracellular KYNA levels, and PF-04859989 prevented this increase. Overall, our findings highlight the need to consider time-dependent factors when developing therapies impacting KYNA synthesis.

">Elucidating an anterior cingulate circuit for self-initiated actions and rescue of Parkinsonian akinesia</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) depletion is known to result in Parkinsonian symptoms such as the inability to initiate movements (akinesia). While Parkinsonian akinesia is traditionally associated with reduced DA signaling in the striatum, the contribution of cortical regions that also receive DA projections and project to the striatum remains unclear. Here, we identify a previously unexplored cortical circuit involving D1-like dopamine receptor-expressing neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that is critical for initiating goal-directed movements. We find that a selective activation of ACC-D1+ neurons can flexibly drive targeted movement and locomotion even in akinetic mice after dopamine depletion or receptor antagonism. These findings uncover a cortical mechanism for movement initiation and offer promising new therapeutic targets for treating Parkinsonian akinesia.

">Modeling Hierarchical Brain Dynamics Outperforms Hormonal Biomarkers in Predicting Menstrual Cycle Phases</a></h4>

              
                Hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle influence large-scale brain dynamics, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, 60 naturally cycling women were scanned using resting-state fMRI during the early follicular, pre-ovulatory, and mid-luteal phases. We then applied a thermodynamics-inspired framework to explore the functional hierarchical organization of whole-brain dynamics across these phases. First, we found that brain dynamics are significantly modulated by estradiol, progesterone, and age across multiple resting-state networks. Second, to elucidate underlying mechanisms, we estimated generative effective connectivity (GEC) matrices using whole-brain models and trained support vector machine classifiers to predict menstrual phases. These model-based biomarkers outperformed traditional functional connectivity and hormone measures in classifying menstrual cycle phases. These findings reveal that menstrual cycle-related changes modulate the hierarchical reorganization of brain dynamics, highlighting the potential of model-based approaches to advance women's brain health research.

">Category learning disentangles representation of trial events in hippocampus CA1</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus (HC) is known to encode task-relevant variables, including latent ones, capturing and parsing critical information from sequences into episodes. This is thought to be the basis to form a cognitive map of possible abstract states beyond mere perceptual details, akin a state machine, with predictive value, contributing to an internal world model. However, its specific role in categorization tasks in general, where learning a category may depend on independent, unordered (non sequential) experienced examples, remains unclear. Here, we investigate CA1 population coding during a categorization paradigm in mice in combination with calcium imaging at different stages of category training with interleaved generalization tests. Our results reveal that hippocampal coding changes critically throughout the different stages of categorization training. Specifically, the disentangling of choice and outcome variables emerges as factorized, abstract, representations and fundamentally distinguishes simple discrimination from categorization training. Furthermore, this factorized geometry relates to improved behavioral performance. Our findings suggest that trial encoding on HC adapts in response to the category structure presented by representing critical events into the appropriate computational format to support generalization of category membership.

">DENDRO: Recovery and denoising of whole-tree dendritic voltagefrom 2D voltage movies</a></h4>

              
                The ability to image voltage at high spatiotemporal resolution across an entire dendritic tree would represent a major advance in systems and circuit neuroscience. Recent advances in genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) have brought this possibility closer to reality. However, due to fundamental tradeoffs between imaging speed, resolution, SNR, and volume, this goal has remained out of reach. Here we develop a computational method that fuses 3D anatomical information with 2D voltage video data, yielding full time-varying 3D voltage estimates. Our method, termed DENDRO, comprises two steps. In step one, we use the anatomical data to build a microscope model which maps from voltages along the tree to observed fluorescence at the imaging plane. By exploiting local spatial smoothness of the voltage signal, we parameterize the voltage signal using a set of local basis functions, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem and allows us to approximately invert the microscope model. This step leverages spatial but not temporal smoothness of the underlying signal and yields noisy 3D estimates. In step two, we train a lightweight self-supervised neural network to perform spatiotemporal denoising of the inferred voltages. On simulated data, we find that DENDRO is able to recover voltages at high accuracy across an entire dendritic tree. On real voltage movies from hippocampal slices, DENDRO recovers known dendritic phenomena at single trial resolution and millisecond time-scales, and allows visualization of backpropagating action potentials in 3D.

">Informational and Normative Influence on Conformity in Autism</a></h4>

              
                This preregistered study examined whether adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show reduced social conformity and whether any such reduction depends on the type of social influence. Social conformity, defined as the tendency to adjust judgments to align with those of others, is typically driven by normative (acceptance-seeking) and informational (accuracy-seeking) motives. Thirty adults with ASD and 30 matched neurotypical (NT) adults completed two tasks: a preference rating task indexing normative influence, and a dot-counting task indexing informational influence with monetary rewards. Contrary to our predictions, adults with ASD conformed as much as NT adults in the preference rating task but showed significantly reduced conformity in the dot-counting task. Exploratory analyses indicated that this reduction was driven by a distinct subgroup of nine adults with ASD who never revised their initial estimates despite informative social cues, resulting in poorer accuracy and lower rewards. When this subgroup was excluded, group differences in conformity were no longer evident. These findings suggest that, overall, adults with ASD are as susceptible as NT adults to normative influence but less responsive to informational influence, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between types of social influence and considering individual differences when characterizing social behavior in ASD.

">The Human Hippocampus Is Involved in Auditory Short-Term Memory Trace Formation</a></h4>

              
                The human hippocampus has been claimed to play an important role in long-term memory, or episodic memory. It has long been argued whether the hippocampus does contribute to short-term memory. Here, we demonstrate human hippocampus has been involved in auditory short-term memory (ASTM) trace formation. We used a classic oddball paradigm and intracranial recordings across various human brain areas. High frequency activities evoked by deviant stimuli in subjects indicate the generation of ASTM trace. Auditory response latencies recorded from the hippocampus, insula, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and frontal lobe showed the early processing of ASTM trace at a pre-attention stage. Moreover, Granger causality analyses showed ASTM trace is processed in hierarchical cortical areas and interactions among this memory process have been clarified. Specifically, bottom-up auditory signals processed by the insula, and auditory regions of the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe at an early stage, then auditory top-down information transmitted from the frontal lobe to the hippocampus, the inferior temporal lobe, as well as insula at a relatively late pre-attention stage of the auditory information processing. These results provide evidence that the human hippocampus contributes to the short-term memory of auditory perception at a pre-attention stage and suggests a challenge to entrenched beliefs in the classification/definition of memory systems.

">MOSAIC: A scalable framework for fMRI dataset aggregation and modeling of human vision</a></h4>

              
                Recent large-scale vision fMRI datasets have been invaluable resources to the vision neuroscience community for their deep sampling of individual subjects and diverse stimulus sets. However, practical limitations to the number of subjects, stimuli, and trials that can be collected prevent individual fMRI datasets from reaching the scale necessary for modern modeling approaches and robust conclusions. Here, we introduce MOSAIC (Meta-Organized Stimuli And fMRI Imaging data for Computational modeling), a fMRI dataset aggregation framework designed to leverage the richness of individual datasets for computationally intensive modeling and robust tests of generalization. MOSAIC is composed of eight large-scale vision fMRI datasets totaling 93 subjects, 430,007 fMRI-stimulus pairs, and 162,839 naturalistic and artificial stimuli. A shared fMRI preprocessing pipeline and a filtered test-train split minimizes dataset-specific confounds and test-set leakage when aggregating the datasets. Crucially, additional datasets can be integrated into MOSAIC post hoc, allowing MOSAIC to evolve according to the community's interests. We use MOSAIC to show that perceptually diverse stimulus sets consistently improve decoding accuracy and stability, carrying implications for future fMRI stimulus set design. We then jointly train brain-optimized encoding models across subjects and datasets to predict fMRI activity of all visual cortex and even the whole brain. In silico functional localizer experiments performed on these digital twin models can recover subject-specific category-selective cortical regions, thereby validating our approach. Together, MOSAIC provides a scalable and community-driven solution to build robust, larger-scale models of human vision.

">Hypothesis Testing Governs an Efficiency-Flexibility Trade-off in Strategic Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                It remains unknown how people discover an effective movement strategy when the environment changes (e.g., when adapting to a new computer trackpad). We propose that strategic adaptation operates through hypothesis testing: learners generate candidate hypotheses, discard those inconsistent with feedback, and iteratively refine their actions through practice. A core prediction of this account is an efficiency-flexibility trade-off. In constrained environments, where few hypotheses are viable, learning slows as people eliminate competing hypotheses but supports broader generalization. In unconstrained environments, where many hypotheses are viable, learning accelerates as learners adopt one of many expedient hypotheses but yields poorer generalization. In two reaching experiments (N = 560), we varied the arrangement of target positions to manipulate how tightly the hypothesis space was constrained. As predicted, the constrained group learned more slowly but generalized more - an efficiency-flexibility trade-off that highlights hypothesis testing as a novel process governing human motor learning.

                Background University lecturers often face heavy workloads and emotional pressures that can undermine their well-being. Artistic engagement, such as singing and dancing, may offer valuable means of emotional renewal and personal growth. This study explores how artistic performance contributes to lecturers’ well-being in higher education through the lens of the PERMA framework, which comprises Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment. Methods A qualitative focus group discussion was conducted with six lecturers from a university in Southern Vietnam. The discussion, held in Vietnamese, was recorded with verbal consent, transcribed, translated into English, and analyzed thematically according to the PERMA dimensions. Results Engaging in artistic performance enhanced lecturers’ positive emotions, deepened engagement, strengthened collegial relationships, and fostered meaning and accomplishment. Participants viewed artistic activities as outlets for stress reduction and self-expression, helping them maintain motivation and emotional balance amid professional challenges. However, institutional recognition of such creative engagement remained limited. Conclusions Artistic participation supports lecturers’ holistic well-being and contributes to a more positive and connected academic environment. Universities should consider incorporating arts-based initiatives into well-being strategies to promote educators’ psychological resilience and sense of community. Future studies could extend this inquiry across disciplines and explore policy-level approaches to embedding creative practices in higher education.

                <p>by Xitong Luo, Lei Zhang, Yafeng Pan</p>

We often give advice to influence others, but could our own advice also be shaped by the very individuals we aim to influence (i.e., advisees)? This reverse flow of social influence—from those typically seen as being influenced to those who provide the influence—has been largely neglected, limiting our understanding of the reciprocal nature of human communications. Here, we conducted a series of experiments and applied computational modelling to systematically investigate how advisees’ opinions shape the advice-giving process. In an investment game, participants (<i>n</i> = 346, across four studies) provided advice either independently or after observing advisees’ opinions (Studies 1 & 2), with feedback on their advice (acceptance or rejection) provided by advisees (Studies 3 & 4). Our findings reveal that advisors tend to adjust their advice to align with the advisees’ opinions (we refer to this as the <i>alignment bias</i>) (Study 1). This tendency, which reflects normative conformity, persists even when advisors were directly incentivized to provide accurate advice (Study 2). As feedback is introduced, advisors’ behavior shifts in ways best captured by a reinforcement learning model, suggesting that advisees’ feedback drives adaptations in advice giving that maximize acceptance and minimize rejection (Study 3). This adaptation persisted even when acceptance is rare, as bolstered by the model-based evidence (Study 4). Collectively, our findings highlight advisors’ susceptibility to the consequence of giving advice, which can lead to counterproductive impacts on decision-making processes and misinformation exacerbation in social encounters.

Membrane nanotubes serve as critical cytoskeletal structures that facilitate intercellular communication and signal transmission across distances in both plants and animals. Here, we report the role of microtubule (MT) nanotubes in rendering the <i>Drosophila</i> micropyle functional, a structure essential for sperm entry during fertilization. Our study highlights that MT-nanotubes emanate from the apical end of the specialized epithelial cells called the polar cells in late oogenesis, forming a narrow channel through the eggshell. Utilizing a combination of fly genetics, live cell imaging, and tissue immunochemistry, our research elucidates the structural and functional characteristics of the polar cell nanotube. We show that tubulin is vital for the formation of these nanotubes, which are enriched in the lateral membrane marker, Fasciclin III. Moreover, the overall polarity of the migrating cell cluster is critical for the successful development of the micropyle. Notably, both lysosomal function and lysosomal trafficking within the polar cells are essential for the opening of the vitelline layer, further facilitating the micropyle’s role in fertilization.

Neuronal activity and sensory experience regulate the subunit stoichiometry of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors (NMDARs), a critical determinant for brain development, synaptic plasticity, and a line of neurological disorders. Here we found that Ras and Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), a neuron-specific protein in the brain, played an important role in dictating synaptic NMDAR subunit composition in spinal cord somatostatin-positive (SOM<sup>+</sup>) neuron, a key component in the spinal circuit transmitting mechanical pain in mice. Our data showed that the protein level of RIN1 was low early after birth, which progressively increased with synapse maturation and promoted the switch from synaptic GluN2B- to GluN2A-containing NMDARs. In adult mice, the nerve injury-induced pathological pain paralleled a significant increase of RIN1 protein in spinal SOM<sup>+</sup> neurons, which drove a new round of GluN2B-to-GluN2A switching at mature synapses. Our data revealed the molecular mechanisms by which RIN1 differentially regulated the synaptic trafficking of GluN2B and GluN2A receptors, and implied that RIN1-mediated pathological switch of NMDAR subunit composition strikingly altered the analgesic efficacy of distinct NMDAR subunit antagonists with the development of neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003231">Low-dose mixtures of dietary nutrients ameliorate behavioral deficits in multiple mouse models of autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tzyy-Nan Huang, Ming-Hui Lin, Tsan-Ting Hsu, Chen-Hsin Yu, Yi-Ping Hsueh</p>

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of heterogeneous, behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental conditions influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Here, we show that supplementation of multiple low-dose nutrients—an important environmental factor contributing to ASD—can modulate synaptic proteomes, reconfigure neural ensembles, and improve social behaviors in mice. First, we used <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice, a well-established model of ASD, to investigate the effect of nutrient cocktails containing zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and serine, all of which are known to regulate synapse formation and activity. Supplementation of nutrient cocktails for 7 days altered total proteomes by increasing synapse-related proteins. Our results further reveal that <i>Tbr1</i> haploinsufficiency promotes hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, enhancing the activity correlation between individual neurons and their corresponding ensembles. Nutrient supplementation normalized the activity and connectivity of the BLA neurons in <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice during social interactions. We further show that although a low dose of individual nutrients did not alter social behaviors, treatment with supplement mixtures containing low-dose individual nutrients improved social behaviors and associative memory of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice, implying a synergistic effect of combining low-dose zinc, BCAA, and serine. Moreover, the supplement cocktails also improved social behaviors in <i>Nf1</i><sup>+/−</sup> and <i>Cttnbp2</i><sup>+/M120I</sup> mice, two additional ASD mouse models. Thus, our findings reveal aberrant neural connectivity in the BLA of <i>Tbr1</i><sup>+/−</sup> mice and indicate that dietary supplementation with zinc, BCAA, and/or serine offers a safe and accessible approach to mitigate neural connectivity and social behaviors across multiple ASD models.
