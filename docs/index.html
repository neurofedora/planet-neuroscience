     alt="A schizophrenia risk factor induces marked anatomical deficits at GABAergic-dopaminergic synapses in the rat ventral tegmental area: Essential evidence for new targeted therapies"/>
<p><i>Hypothesis</i>: Synaptic changes occur within a midbrain GABA-dopamine circuit of male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. <i>Outcomes</i>: In the offspring of MIA dams, markedly smaller inhibitory synapses were observed for non-triadic (classic) and newly discovered triadic synapses. These changes could contribute to well-documented striatal hyperdopaminergia. The findings provide a new therapeutic target.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To develop new therapies for schizophrenia, evidence accumulated over decades highlights the essential need to investigate the GABAergic synapses that presynaptically influence midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Since current technology restricts these studies to animals, and evidence accumulated in recent decades indicates a developmental origin of schizophrenia, we investigated synaptic changes in male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. Using a novel combination of lentiviruses, peroxidase-immunogold double labeling, three-dimensional serial section transmission electron microscopy and stereology, we observed clear anatomical alterations in synaptic inputs on dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA). These changes relate directly to a characteristic feature of schizophrenia: increased dopamine release. In 3-month-old and 14-month-old MIA rats, we found a marked decrease in the volume of presynaptic GABAergic terminals from the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and in the length of the synapses they made, when innervating pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In MIA rats in the long-term, we also discovered a decrease in the volume of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and in the maximum thickness of the PSD at the same synapses. These marked deficits were evident in conventional GABA-dopamine synapses and in synaptic triads that we discovered involving asymmetric synapses that innervated RMTg GABAergic presynaptic terminals, which in turn innervated pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In triads, the PSD thickness of asymmetric synapses was significantly decreased in MIA rats in the long-term cohort. The extensive anatomical deficits provide a potential basis for new therapies targeted at synaptic inputs on midbrain pVTA dopaminergic neurons, in contrast to current striatum-targeted antipsychotic drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presynaptic Short-Term Plasticity Persists in the Absence of PKC Phosphorylation of Munc18-1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) is a form of short-term plasticity that lasts for tens of seconds following a burst of presynaptic activity. It has been proposed that PTP arises from protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of Munc18-1, an SM (Sec1/Munc-18 like) family protein that is essential for release. To test this model, we made a knock-in mouse in which all Munc18-1 PKC phosphorylation sites were eliminated through serine-to-alanine point mutations (Munc18-1SA mice), and we studied mice of either sex. The expression of Munc18-1 was not altered in Munc18-1SA mice, and there were no obvious behavioral phenotypes. At the hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapse and the granule cell parallel fiber (PF)-to-Purkinje cell (PC) synapse, basal transmission was largely normal except for small decreases in paired-pulse facilitation that are consistent with a slight elevation in release probability. Phorbol esters that mimic the activation of PKC by diacylglycerol still increased synaptic transmission in Munc18-1SA mice. In Munc18-1SA mice, 70% of PTP remained at CA3-to-CA1 synapses, and the amplitude of PTP was not reduced at PF-to-PC synapses. These findings indicate that at both CA3-to-CA1 and PF-to-PC synapses, phorbol esters and PTP enhance synaptic transmission primarily by mechanisms that are independent of PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A leading mechanism for a prevalent form of short-term plasticity, post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), involves protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of Munc18-1. This study tests this mechanism by creating a knock-in mouse in which Munc18-1 is replaced by a mutated form of Munc18-1 that cannot be phosphorylated. The main finding is that most PTP at hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses or at cerebellar granule cell-to-Purkinje cell synapses does not rely on PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1. Thus, mechanisms independent of PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1 are important mediators of PTP.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reelin Regulates Neuronal Excitability through Striatal-Enriched Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP61) and Calcium Permeable AMPARs in an NMDAR-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease marked by the accumulation of amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A&beta; oligomers cause synaptic dysfunction early in AD by enhancing long-term depression (LTD; a paradigm for forgetfulness) via metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent regulation of striatal-enriched tyrosine phosphatase (STEP<SUB>61</SUB>). Reelin is a neuromodulator that signals through ApoE (apolipoprotein E) receptors to protect the synapse against A&beta; toxicity (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B12">Durakoglugil et al., 2009</cross-ref>) Reelin signaling is impaired by ApoE4, the most important genetic risk factor for AD, and A&beta;-oligomers activate metabotropic glutamate receptors (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Renner et al., 2010</cross-ref>). We therefore asked whether Reelin might also affect mGluR-LTD. To this end, we induced chemical mGluR-LTD using DHPG (Dihydroxyphenylglycine), a selective mGluR5 agonist. We found that exogenous Reelin reduces the DHPG-induced increase in STEP<SUB>61</SUB>, prevents the dephosphorylation of GluA2, and concomitantly blocks mGluR-mediated LTD. By contrast, Reelin deficiency increased expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors along with higher STEP<SUB>61</SUB> levels, resulting in occlusion of DHPG-induced LTD in hippocampal CA1 neurons. We propose a model in which Reelin modulates local protein synthesis as well as AMPA receptor subunit composition through modulation of mGluR-mediated signaling with implications for memory consolidation or neurodegeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reelin is an important neuromodulator, which in the adult brain controls synaptic plasticity and protects against neurodegeneration. Amyloid-&beta; has been shown to use mGluRs to induce synaptic depression through endocytosis of NMDA and AMPA receptors, a mechanism referred to as LTD, a paradigm of forgetfulness. Our results show that Reelin regulates the phosphatase STEP, which plays an important role in neurodegeneration, as well as the expression of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which play a role in memory formation. These data suggest that Reelin uses mGluR LTD pathways to regulate memory formation as well as neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">FLRT2 and FLRT3 Cooperate in Maintaining the Tangential Migratory Streams of Cortical Interneurons during Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuron migration is a hallmark of nervous system development that allows gathering of neurons from different origins for assembling of functional neuronal circuits. Cortical inhibitory interneurons arise in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially forming three transient migratory streams in the cortex before reaching the final laminar destination. Although migration defects lead to the disruption of inhibitory circuits and are linked to aspects of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the molecular mechanisms controlling cortical interneuron development and final layer positioning are incompletely understood. Here, we show that mouse embryos with a double deletion of <I>FLRT2</I> and <I>FLRT3</I> genes encoding cell adhesion molecules exhibit an abnormal distribution of interneurons within the streams during development, which in turn, affect the layering of somatostatin+ interneurons postnatally. Mechanistically, FLRT2 and FLRT3 proteins act in a noncell-autonomous manner, possibly through a repulsive mechanism. In support of such a conclusion, double knockouts deficient in the repulsive receptors for FLRTs, Unc5B and Unc5D, also display interneuron defects during development, similar to the <I>FLRT2</I>/<I>FLRT3</I> mutants. Moreover, FLRT proteins are chemorepellent ligands for developing interneurons <I>in vitro</I>, an effect that is in part dependent on FLRT-Unc5 interaction. Together, we propose that FLRTs act through Unc5 receptors to control cortical interneuron distribution in a mechanism that involves cell repulsion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Disruption of inhibitory cortical circuits is responsible for some aspects of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. These defects include interneuron migration during development. A crucial step during this process is the formation of three transient migratory streams within the developing cortex that determine the timing of interneuron final positioning and the formation of functional cortical circuits in the adult. We report that FLRT proteins are required for the proper distribution of interneurons within the cortical migratory streams and for the final laminar allocation in the postnatal cortex. These results expand the multifunctional role of FLRTs during nervous system development in addition to the role of FLRTs in axon guidance and the migration of excitatory cortical neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Visual Mapping following Ocular Gene Augmentation Therapy for Achromatopsia</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability of the adult human brain to develop function following correction of congenital deafferentation is controversial. Specifically, cases of recovery from congenital visual deficits are rare. <I>CNGA3</I>-achromatopsia is a congenital hereditary disease caused by cone-photoreceptor dysfunction, leading to impaired acuity, photoaversion, and complete color blindness. Essentially, these patients have rod-driven vision only, seeing the world in blurry shades of gray. We use the uniqueness of this rare disease, in which the cone-photoreceptors and afferent fibers are preserved but do not function, as a model to study cortical visual plasticity. We had the opportunity to study two <I>CNGA3</I>-achromatopsia adults (one female) before and after ocular gene augmentation therapy. Alongside behavioral visual tests, we used novel fMRI-based measurements to assess participants' early visual population receptive-field sizes and color regions. Behaviorally, minor improvements were observed, including reduction in photoaversion, marginal improvement in acuity, and a new ability to detect red color. No improvement was observed in color arrangement tests. Cortically, pretreatment, patients' population-receptive field sizes of early visual areas were untypically large, but were decreased following treatment specifically in the treated eye. We suggest that this demonstrates cortical ability to encode new input, even at adulthood. On the other hand, no activation of color-specific cortical regions was demonstrated in these patients either before or up to 1 year post-treatment. The source of this deficiency might be attributed either to insufficient recovery of cone function at the retinal level or to challenges that the adult cortex faces when computing new cone-derived input to achieve color perception.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The possibility that the adult human brain may regain or develop function following correction of congenital deafferentation has fired the imagination of scientists over the years. In the visual domain, cases of recovery from congenital deficits are rare. Gene therapy visual restoration for congenital <I>CNGA3</I>-achromatopsia, a disease caused by cone photoreceptor dysfunction, gave us the opportunity to examine cortical function, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, both before and after restorative treatment. While behaviorally only minor improvements were observed post-treatment, fMRI analysis, including size algorithms of population-receptive fields, revealed cortical changes, specifically receptive field size decrease in the treated eyes. This suggests that, at least to some degree, the adult cortex is able to encode new input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Fingerprints Underlying Individual Language Learning Profiles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human language learning differs significantly across individuals in the process and ultimate attainment. Although decades of research exploring the neural substrates of language learning have identified distinct and overlapping neural networks subserving learning of different components, the neural mechanisms that drive the large interindividual differences are still far from being understood. Here we examine to what extent the neural dynamics of multiple brain networks in men and women across sessions of training contribute to explaining individual differences in learning multiple linguistic components (i.e., vocabulary, morphology, and phrase and sentence structures) of an artificial language in a 7 d training and imaging paradigm with functional MRI. With machine-learning and predictive modeling, neural activation patterns across training sessions were highly predictive of individual learning success profiles derived from the four components. We identified four neural learning networks (i.e., the Perisylvian, frontoparietal, salience, and default-mode networks) and examined their dynamic contributions to the learning success prediction. Moreover, the robustness of the predictions systematically changes across networks depending on specific training phases and the learning components. We further demonstrate that a subset of network nodes in the inferior frontal, insular, and frontoparietal regions increasingly represent newly acquired language knowledge, while the multivariate connectivity between these representation regions is enhanced during learning for more successful learners. These findings allow us to understand why learners differ and are the first to attribute not only the degree of success but also patterns of language learning across components, to neural fingerprints summarized from multiple neural network dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Individual differences in learning a language are widely observed not only within the same component of language but also across components. This study demonstrates that the dynamics of multiple brain networks across four imaging sessions of a 7 d artificial language training contribute to individual differences in learning-outcome profiles derived from four language components. With machine-learning predictive modeling, we identified four neural learning networks, including the Perisylvian, frontoparietal, salience, and default-mode networks, that contribute to predicting individual learning-outcome profiles and revealed language-component-general and component-specific prediction patterns across training sessions. These findings provide significant insights in understanding training-dependent neural dynamics underlying individual differences in learning success across language components.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Representational Similarity Analysis of Cognitive Control during Color-Word Stroop</a></h4>

              
                <p>Progress in understanding the neural bases of cognitive control has been supported by the paradigmatic color-word Stroop task, in which a target response (color name) must be selected over a more automatic, yet potentially incongruent, distractor response (word). For this paradigm, models have postulated complementary coding schemes: dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) is proposed to evaluate the demand for control via incongruency-related coding, whereas dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) is proposed to implement control via goal and target-related coding. Yet, mapping these theorized schemes to measured neural activity within this task has been challenging. Here, we tested for these coding schemes relatively directly, by decomposing an event-related color-word Stroop task via representational similarity analysis. Three neural coding models were fit to the similarity structure of multivoxel patterns of human fMRI activity, acquired from 65 healthy, young-adult males and females. Incongruency coding was predominant in DMFC, whereas both target and incongruency coding were present with indistinguishable strength in DLPFC. In contrast, distractor information was strongly encoded within early visual cortex. Further, these coding schemes were differentially related to behavior: individuals with stronger DLPFC (and lateral posterior parietal cortex) target coding, but weaker DMFC incongruency coding, exhibited less behavioral Stroop interference. These results highlight the utility of the representational similarity analysis framework for investigating neural mechanisms of cognitive control and point to several promising directions to extend the Stroop paradigm.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How the human brain enables cognitive control &mdash; the ability to override behavioral habits to pursue internal goals &mdash; has been a major focus of neuroscience research. This ability has been frequently investigated by using the Stroop color-word naming task. With the Stroop as a test-bed, many theories have proposed specific neuroanatomical dissociations, in which medial and lateral frontal brain regions underlie cognitive control by encoding distinct types of information. Yet providing a direct confirmation of these claims has been challenging. Here, we demonstrate that representational similarity analysis, which estimates and models the similarity structure of brain activity patterns, can successfully establish the hypothesized functional dissociations within the Stroop task. Representational similarity analysis may provide a useful approach for investigating cognitive control mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predicting Identity-Preserving Object Transformations across the Human Ventral Visual Stream</a></h4>

              
                <p>In everyday life, we have no trouble categorizing objects varying in position, size, and orientation. Previous fMRI research shows that higher-level object processing regions in the human lateral occipital cortex may link object responses from different affine states (i.e., size and viewpoint) through a general linear mapping function capable of predicting responses to novel objects. In this study, we extended this approach to examine the mapping for both Euclidean (e.g., position and size) and non-Euclidean (e.g., image statistics and spatial frequency) transformations across the human ventral visual processing hierarchy, including areas V1, V2, V3, V4, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and lateral occipitotemporal cortex. The predicted pattern generated from a linear mapping function could capture a significant amount of the changes associated with the transformations throughout the ventral visual stream. The derived linear mapping functions were not category independent as performance was better for the categories included than those not included in training and better between two similar versus two dissimilar categories in both lower and higher visual regions. Consistent with object representations being stronger in higher than in lower visual regions, pattern selectivity and object category representational structure were somewhat better preserved in the predicted patterns in higher than in lower visual regions. There were no notable differences between Euclidean and non-Euclidean transformations. These findings demonstrate a near-orthogonal representation of object identity and these nonidentity features throughout the human ventral visual processing pathway with these nonidentity features largely untangled from the identity features early in visual processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Presently we still do not fully understand how object identity and nonidentity (e.g., position, size) information are simultaneously represented in the primate ventral visual system to form invariant representations. Previous work suggests that the human lateral occipital cortex may be linking different affine states of object representations through general linear mapping functions. Here, we show that across the entire human ventral processing pathway, we could link object responses in different states of nonidentity transformations through linear mapping functions for both Euclidean and non-Euclidean transformations. These mapping functions are not identity independent, suggesting that object identity and nonidentity features are represented in a near rather than a completely orthogonal manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emergence of Nonlinear Mixed Selectivity in Prefrontal Cortex after Training</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons in the PFC are typically activated by different cognitive tasks, and also by different stimuli and abstract variables within these tasks. A single neuron's selectivity for a given stimulus dimension often changes depending on its context, a phenomenon known as nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS). It has previously been hypothesized that NMS emerges as a result of training to perform tasks in different contexts. We tested this hypothesis directly by examining the neuronal responses of different PFC areas before and after male monkeys were trained to perform different working memory tasks involving visual stimulus locations and/or shapes. We found that training induces a modest increase in the proportion of PFC neurons with NMS exclusively for spatial working memory, but not for shape working memory tasks, with area 9/46 undergoing the most significant increase in NMS cell proportion. We also found that increased working memory task complexity, in the form of simultaneously storing location and shape combinations, does not increase the degree of NMS for stimulus shape with other task variables. Lastly, in contrast to the previous studies, we did not find evidence that NMS is predictive of task performance. Our results thus provide critical insights on the representation of stimuli and task information in neuronal populations, in working memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How multiple types of information are represented in working memory remains a complex computational problem. It has been hypothesized that nonlinear mixed selectivity allows neurons to efficiently encode multiple stimuli in different contexts, after subjects have been trained in complex tasks. Our analysis of prefrontal recordings obtained before and after training monkeys to perform working memory tasks only partially agreed with this prediction, in that nonlinear mixed selectivity emerged for spatial but not shape information, and mostly in mid-dorsal PFC. Nonlinear mixed selectivity also displayed little modulation across either task complexity or correct performance. These results point to other mechanisms, in addition to nonlinear mixed selectivity, representing complex information about stimulus and task context in neuronal activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Music of Silence: Part I: Responses to Musical Imagery Encode Melodic Expectations and Acoustics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Musical imagery is the voluntary internal hearing of music in the mind without the need for physical action or external stimulation. Numerous studies have already revealed brain areas activated during imagery. However, it remains unclear to what extent imagined music responses preserve the detailed temporal dynamics of the acoustic stimulus envelope and, crucially, whether melodic expectations play any role in modulating responses to imagined music, as they prominently do during listening. These modulations are important as they reflect aspects of the human musical experience, such as its acquisition, engagement, and enjoyment. This study explored the nature of these modulations in imagined music based on EEG recordings from 21 professional musicians (6 females and 15 males). Regression analyses were conducted to demonstrate that imagined neural signals can be predicted accurately, similarly to the listening task, and were sufficiently robust to allow for accurate identification of the imagined musical piece from the EEG. In doing so, our results indicate that imagery and listening tasks elicited an overlapping but distinctive topography of neural responses to sound acoustics, which is in line with previous fMRI literature. Melodic expectation, however, evoked very similar frontal spatial activation in both conditions, suggesting that they are supported by the same underlying mechanisms. Finally, neural responses induced by imagery exhibited a specific transformation from the listening condition, which primarily included a relative delay and a polarity inversion of the response. This transformation demonstrates the top-down predictive nature of the expectation mechanisms arising during both listening and imagery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that the human brain is activated during musical imagery: the act of voluntarily hearing music in our mind without external stimulation. It is unclear, however, what the temporal dynamics of this activation are, as well as what musical features are precisely encoded in the neural signals. This study uses an experimental paradigm with high temporal precision to record and analyze the cortical activity during musical imagery. This study reveals that neural signals encode music acoustics and melodic expectations during both listening and imagery. Crucially, it is also found that a simple mapping based on a time-shift and a polarity inversion could robustly describe the relationship between listening and imagery signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Music of Silence: Part II: Music Listening Induces Imagery Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>During music listening, humans routinely acquire the regularities of the acoustic sequences and use them to anticipate and interpret the ongoing melody. Specifically, in line with this predictive framework, it is thought that brain responses during such listening reflect a comparison between the bottom-up sensory responses and top-down prediction signals generated by an internal model that embodies the music exposure and expectations of the listener. To attain a clear view of these predictive responses, previous work has eliminated the sensory inputs by inserting artificial silences (or sound omissions) that leave behind only the corresponding predictions of the thwarted expectations. Here, we demonstrate a new alternate approach in which we decode the predictive electroencephalography (EEG) responses to the silent intervals that are naturally interspersed within the music. We did this as participants (experiment 1, 20 participants, 10 female; experiment 2, 21 participants, 6 female) listened or imagined Bach piano melodies. Prediction signals were quantified and assessed via a computational model of the melodic structure of the music and were shown to exhibit the same response characteristics when measured during listening or imagining. These include an inverted polarity for both silence and imagined responses relative to listening, as well as response magnitude modulations that precisely reflect the expectations of notes and silences in both listening and imagery conditions. These findings therefore provide a unifying view that links results from many previous paradigms, including omission reactions and the expectation modulation of sensory responses, all in the context of naturalistic music listening.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Music perception depends on our ability to learn and detect melodic structures. It has been suggested that our brain does so by actively predicting upcoming music notes, a process inducing instantaneous neural responses as the music confronts these expectations. Here, we studied this prediction process using EEGs recorded while participants listen to and imagine Bach melodies. Specifically, we examined neural signals during the ubiquitous musical pauses (or silent intervals) in a music stream and analyzed them in contrast to the imagery responses. We find that imagined predictive responses are routinely co-opted during ongoing music listening. These conclusions are revealed by a new paradigm using listening and imagery of naturalistic melodies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Delays to Reward Delivery Enhance the Preference for an Initially Less Desirable Option: Role for the Basolateral Amygdala and Retrosplenial Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal costs influence reward-based decisions. This is commonly studied in temporal discounting tasks that involve choosing between cues signaling an imminent reward option or a delayed reward option. However, it is unclear whether the temporal delay before a reward can alter the value of that option. To address this, we identified the relative preference between different flavored rewards during a free-feeding test using male and female rats. Animals underwent training where either the initial preferred or the initial less preferred reward was delivered noncontingently. By manipulating the intertrial interval during training sessions, we could determine whether temporal delays impact reward preference in a subsequent free-feeding test. Rats maintained their initial preference if the same delays were used across all training sessions. When the initial less preferred option was delivered after short delays (high reward rate) and the initial preferred option was delivered after long delays (low reward rate), rats expectedly increased their preference for the initial less desirable option. However, rats also increased their preference for the initial less desirable option under the opposite training contingencies: delivering the initial less preferred reward after long delays and the initial preferred reward after short delays. These data suggest that sunk temporal costs enhance the preference for a less desirable reward option. Pharmacological and lesion experiments were performed to identify the neural systems responsible for this behavioral phenomenon. Our findings demonstrate the basolateral amygdala and retrosplenial cortex are required for temporal delays to enhance the preference for an initially less desirable reward.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The goal of this study was to determine how temporal delays influence reward preference. We demonstrate that delivering an initially less desirable reward after long delays subsequently increases the consumption and preference for that reward. Furthermore, we identified the basolateral amygdala and the retrosplenial cortex as essential nuclei for mediating the change in reward preference elicited by sunk temporal costs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Monoamine Oxidase-B Inhibition Facilitates {alpha}-Synuclein Secretion In Vitro and Delays Its Aggregation in rAAV-Based Rat Models of Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cell-to-cell transmission of &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) pathology is considered to underlie the spread of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have demonstrated that &alpha;-syn is secreted under physiological conditions in neuronal cell lines and primary neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate extracellular &alpha;-syn secretion remain unclear. In this study, we found that inhibition of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) enzymatic activity facilitated &alpha;-syn secretion in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Both inhibition of MAO-B by selegiline or rasagiline and siRNA-mediated knock-down of MAO-B facilitated &alpha;-syn secretion. However, TVP-1022, the S-isomer of rasagiline that is 1000 times less active, failed to facilitate &alpha;-syn secretion. Additionally, the MAO-B inhibition-induced increase in &alpha;-syn secretion was unaffected by brefeldin A, which inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi transport, but was blocked by probenecid and glyburide, which inhibit ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter function. MAO-B inhibition preferentially facilitated the secretion of detergent-insoluble &alpha;-syn protein and decreased its intracellular accumulation under chloroquine-induced lysosomal dysfunction. Moreover, in a rat model (male Sprague Dawley rats) generated by injecting recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-A53T &alpha;-syn, subcutaneous administration of selegiline delayed the striatal formation of Ser129-phosphorylated &alpha;-syn aggregates, and mitigated loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Selegiline also delayed &alpha;-syn aggregation and dopaminergic neuronal loss in a cell-to-cell transmission rat model (male Sprague Dawley rats) generated by injecting rAAV-wild-type &alpha;-syn and externally inoculating &alpha;-syn fibrils into the striatum. These findings suggest that MAO-B inhibition modulates the intracellular clearance of detergent-insoluble &alpha;-syn via the ABC transporter-mediated non-classical secretion pathway, and temporarily suppresses the formation and transmission of &alpha;-syn aggregates.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The identification of a neuroprotective agent that slows or stops the progression of motor impairments is required to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). The process of &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) aggregation is thought to underlie neurodegeneration in PD. Here, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition or knock-down of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) in SH-SY5Y cells facilitated &alpha;-syn secretion via a non-classical pathway involving an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. MAO-B inhibition preferentially facilitated secretion of detergent-insoluble &alpha;-syn protein and reduced its intracellular accumulation under chloroquine-induced lysosomal dysfunction. Additionally, MAO-B inhibition by selegiline protected A53T &alpha;-syn-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal loss and suppressed the formation and cell-to-cell transmission of &alpha;-syn aggregates in rat models. We therefore propose a new function of MAO-B inhibition that modulates &alpha;-syn secretion and aggregation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Change of Endocannabinoid Signaling in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Controls the Development of Depression After Neuropathic Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many patients with chronic pain conditions suffer from depression. The mechanisms underlying pain-induced depression are still unclear. There are critical links of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) synaptic function to depression, with signaling through the endocannabinoid (eCB) system as an important contributor. We hypothesized that afferent noxious inputs after injury compromise activity-dependent eCB signaling in the mPFC, resulting in depression. Depression-like behaviors were tested in male and female rats with traumatic neuropathy [spared nerve injury (SNI)], and neuronal activity in the mPFC was monitored using the immediate early gene c-<I>fos</I> and <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiological recordings. mPFC eCB Concentrations were determined using mass spectrometry, and behavioral and electrophysiological experiments were used to evaluate the role of alterations in eCB signaling in depression after pain. SNI-induced pain induced the development of depression phenotypes in both male and female rats. Pyramidal neurons in mPFC showed increased excitability followed by reduced excitability in the onset and prolonged phases of pain, respectively. Concentrations of the eCBs, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the mPFC, were elevated initially after SNI, and our results indicate that this resulted in a loss of CB1R function on GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC. These data suggest that excessive release of 2-AG as a result of noxious stimuli triggers use-dependent loss of function of eCB signaling leading to excessive GABA release in the mPFC, with the final result being behavioral depression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pain has both somatosensory and affective components, so the complexity of mechanisms underlying chronic pain is best represented by a biopsychosocial model that includes widespread CNS dysfunction. Many patients with chronic pain conditions develop depression. The mechanism by which pain causes depression is unclear. Although manipulation of the eCB signaling system as an avenue for providing analgesia per se has not shown much promise in previous studies. An important limitation of past research has been inadequate consideration of the dynamic nature of the connection between pain and depression as they develop. Here, we show that activity-dependent synthesis of eCBs during the initial onset of persistent pain is the critical link leading to depression when pain is persistent.</p>

                Background: Surface roughness is one of the most important characteristics of endodontic instruments, correlating to instrument fracture. The purpose of this study was to measure the surface roughness values of these instruments before and after resin root canal preparation without previous glide path preparation, with the new method. Data was obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopes (FE-SEM) combined with independent ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Methods: A total of 20 simulated J-shape resin blocks with a radius of 4.5 mm, length of 16 mm, and angle of inflection of 600 were chosen and distributed into two equal groups. Each group was prepared by the WaveOne Gold Primary (Dentsply Sirona, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) or the Reciproc Blue R25 (VDW, Munich, Germany) instruments, without glide path preparation. Special molds were used to confirm the same areas on the cutting blade at 3 mm and the instruments’ tips were scanned by FE-SEM, at different observed times. The parameters of Ra, Rq, and Rz in each sample were collected using the ImageJ software for analyses. The data was processed using the paired t-test with a significance level of 0.05. Results: Right after the first resin canal instrumentation, the surface roughness parameters of the two reciprocating investigated instruments were decreased. Conclusions: The FE-SEM images processed using the ImageJ software offered a trustworthy and suitable method for assessment of the NiTi endodontic file surface roughness.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Distributions of vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 in the visual thalamus and associated areas of the cat</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glutamate is packaged in vesicles via two main vesicular transporter (VGLUT) proteins, VGLUT1 and VGLUT 2 which regulate its storage and release from synapses of excitatory neurons. Studies in rodents, primates, <b>ferrets</b> and tree shrews suggest that these transporters may identify distinct subsets of excitatory projections in visual structures, particularly in thalamocortical pathways where they tend to correlate with modulatory and driver projections respectively. Despite being a well-studied model of thalamocortical connectivity, little is known about their expression pattern in the cat visual system. To expand current knowledge on their distribution and how they correlated with known driver and modulator projecting sites, we examined the protein expression patterns of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the visual thalamus of the cat (lateral geniculate nucleus and the pulvinar complex). We also studied their expression pattern in relevant visual structures projecting to or receiving significant thalamic projections such <b>as</b> the primary visual cortex and the superior colliculus. Our results indicate that both VGLUTs are consistently present throughout the cat visual system and show laminar or nuclei specificity in their distribution which suggests, as in other species, that <b>VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 represent distinct populations of glutamatergic projections.</b></p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The acceptability and side effects of COVID-19 vaccine among health care workers in Nigeria: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is global public health crisis. Mass vaccination, until herd immunity is achieved, is one of the most effective ways of combating the deadly infectious virus. The disposition of health workers towards the AstraZeneca vaccine will most likely determine if other members of the community will be willing to get vaccinated or not. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes of healthcare workers to the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as determine the various side effects experienced by those who have already been vaccinated. Method: Frequency tables were created, and Chi-square was used to determine the relationship between respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, as well as their acceptance or rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine and attitude towards it. Using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0, multinominal logistic regression was used to determine the key factors which influenced respondents’ decision to have the vaccine. Result: There was a statistically significant relationship between the cadre of health care workers, their tribe, and their involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients and their attitude towards the vaccine. Conclusion: Previous involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients is one of the most important determinants of health care workers' acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Most respondents were positive about the vaccine; however, the fear of side effects was the primary reason why those who were yet to be vaccinated, do not plan to do so. The most common side effect reported by those who had already been vaccinated, was pain at the injection site. Public awareness of the vaccine and its benefits should be increased, and the vaccine should be made available in all health care facilities.

                Background: Due to advances in digital technology, it is possible to obtain digital dental models through intraoral scanning. The stereolithographic data collected from the scanner can subsequently be printed into a three-dimensional dental model in resinic material. However, the accuracy between digital dental models and printed dental models needs to be evaluated since it might affect diagnosis and treatment planning in orthodontic treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of digital models scanned by a Trios intraoral scanner and three-dimensional dental models printed using a Formlabs 2 3D printer in linear measurements and Bolton analysis. Methods: A total of 35 subjects were included in this study. All subjects were scanned using a Trios intraoral scanner to obtain digital study models. Stereolithographic data from previous scanning was printed using a Formlabs 2 3D printer to obtain printed study models. Mesiodistal, intercanine, intermolar, and Bolton analysis from all types of study models were measured. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess intraobserver and interobserver reliability. All data were then statistically analyzed. Results: The reliability tests were high for both intraobserver and interobserver reliability, which demonstrates high reproducibility for all measurements on all model types. Most of the data compared between study models showed no statistically significant differences, though some data differed significantly. However, the differences are considered clinically insignificant. Conclusion: Digital dental models and three-dimensional printed dental models may be used interchangeably with plaster dental models for diagnostic and treatment planning purposes. Keywords: Accuracy, 3D printing, digital dental model, printed dental model.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Co‐localisation of nociceptive markers in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord of dromedary camel</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nociceptive markers in mice have been identified in two distinct peptidergic and nonpeptidergic neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and distributed in different laminae of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Recently, however, a study in humans showed a significant overlapping in these two populations. In this study, we investigated the distribution of various nociceptive markers in the lumbar DRG and spinal cord of the dromedary camel. Immunohistochemical data showed a remarkable percentage of total neurons in the DRG expressed IB4 binding (54.5%), CGRP (49.5%), TRPV1 (48.2%), and NOS (30.6%). The co-localisation data showed that 89.6% of CGRP- and 74.0% of TRPV1-labelled neurons were IB4-positive. In addition, 61.6% of TRPV1- and 84.2% of NOS-immunoreactive neurons were also co-localised with CGRP. The distribution of IB4-, CGRP-, TRPV1-, SP-, and NOS-immunoreactivities in the spinal cord were observed in laminae I-IIo. Quantitative data showed that 82.4% of IB4 positive nerve terminals in laminae I-IIo were co-localised with CGRP, and 86.0% of CGRP labelled terminals were co-localised with IB4. Similarly, 85.1% of NOS labelled nerve terminals were co-localised with CGRP. No NPY- or CCK- immunoreactivities were detected in the DRG, and no co-localisation between IB4, NPY, and CCK were observed in the spinal cord. Our results demonstrate marked convergence of nociceptive markers in the primary afferent neurons in camels, which is similar to humans rather than the mouse. The data also emphasises the importance of interspecies differences when selecting ideal animal models for studying nociception and treating chronic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Expression and distribution of synaptotagmin family members in the zebrafish retina</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Synaptotagmins belong to a large family of proteins. While various synaptotagmins have been implicated as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for vesicle replenishment and release at conventional synapses, their roles at retinal ribbon synapses remain incompletely understood. Zebrafish is a widely used experimental model for retinal research. We therefore investigated the homology between human, rat, mouse, and zebrafish synaptotagmins 1 to 10 using a bioinformatics approach. We also characterized the expression and distribution of various synaptotagmin (<i>syt</i>) genes in the zebrafish retina using RT-PCR, qPCR and <i>in situ</i> hybridization, focusing on the family members whose products likely underlie Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis in the central nervous system (synaptotagmins 1, 2, 5 and 7). Most zebrafish synaptotagmins are well conserved and can be grouped in the same classes as mammalian synaptotagmins, based on crucial amino acid residues needed for coordinating Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and determining phospholipid binding affinity. The only exception is synaptotagmin 1b, which lacks 34 amino acid residues in the C2B domain and is therefore unlikely to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> there. Additionally, the products of zebrafish <i>syt5a</i> and <i>syt5b</i> genes share identity with mammalian class 1 and 5 synaptotagmins. Zebrafish <i>syt1</i>, <i>syt2</i>, <i>syt5</i> and <i>syt7</i> paralogues are found in the zebrafish brain, eye, and retina, excepting <i>syt1b</i>, which is only present in the brain. The complementary expression pattern of the remaining paralogues in the retina suggests that <i>syt1a</i> and <i>syt5a</i> may underlie synchronous release and <i>syt7a</i> and <i>syt7b</i> may mediate asynchronous release or other Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent processes in different retinal neurons.</p>

                Learning to act in an environment to maximise rewards is among the brain’s key functions. This process has often been conceptualised within the framework of reinforcement learning, which has also gained prominence in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) as a way to optimise decision making. A common aspect of both biological and machine reinforcement learning is the reactivation of previously experienced episodes, referred to as replay. Replay is important for memory consolidation in biological neural networks and is key to stabilising learning in deep neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/current.rss">Characterization of the subunit composition and structure of adult human glycine receptors</a></h4>

              
                Yu et al. characterized the structures of a principal neurotransmitter receptor in adult humans, the heteromeric glycine receptor, in multiple functional states. They discovered an unexpected architecture and revealed how it gives rise to native physiological function, which suggests how higher-order assemblies form to allow neurotransmission.

                In this study, Lagomarsino et al. describe the generation of an iPSC collection from 53 deeply phenotyped individuals. These lines are coupled to RNA-seq and proteomic profiling of both iPSC neurons and brain of the same individuals. Using this system, biological insights are uncovered regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s disease.

                Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays an important role in innate immunity by controlling type I interferon response against invaded pathogens. In this work we describe a previously unknown role of STING in lipid metabolism in <i>Drosophila</i>. Flies with <i>STING</i> deletion are sensitive to starvation and oxidative stress, have reduced lipid storage and downregulated expression of lipid metabolism genes. We found that <i>Drosophila</i> STING interacts with lipid synthesizing enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). ACC and FASN also interact with each other, indicating that all three proteins may be components of a large multi-enzyme complex. The deletion of <i>Drosophila</i><i> STING </i>leads to disturbed ACC localization and decreased FASN enzyme activity. Together, our results demonstrate a previously undescribed role of STING in lipid metabolism in <i>Drosophila</i>.

                Escape from threats has paramount importance for survival. However, it is unknown if a single circuit controls escape vigor from innate and conditioned threats. Cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing cells in the hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) are necessary for initiating escape from innate threats via a projection to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). We now show that in mice PMd-cck cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Intriguingly, PMd-cck and dlPAG activity in mice showed higher mutual information during exposure to innate and conditioned threats. In parallel, human fMRI data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increased activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd-dlPAG circuit as a central node, controlling escape vigor elicited by both innate and conditioned threats.

                Fungal adhesins (Als) or flocculins are family of cell surface proteins that mediate adhesion to diverse biotic and abiotic surfaces. A striking characteristic of Als proteins originally identified in the pathogenic <i>Candida albicans</i> is to form functional amyloids that mediate <i>cis-</i>interaction leading to the formation of adhesin nanodomains and <i>trans</i>- interaction between amyloid sequences of opposing cells. In this report, we show that flocculins encoded by <i>FLO11</i> in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> behave like adhesins in <i>C. albicans</i>. To do so, we show that the formation of nanodomains under an external physical force requires a threshold number of amyloid-forming sequences in the Flo11 protein. Then, using a genome editing approach, we constructed strains expressing variants of the Flo11 protein under the endogenous<i> FLO11</i> promoter, leading to the demonstration that the loss of amyloid-forming sequences strongly reduces cell-cell interaction but has no effect on either plastic adherence or invasive growth in agar, both phenotypes being dependent on the N- and C-terminal ends of Flo11p. Finally, we show that the location of Flo11 is not altered either by the absence of amyloid-forming sequences or by the removal of the N- or C-terminus of the protein.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Endoplasmic reticulum tubules limit the size of misfolded protein condensates</a></h4>

              
                The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is composed of sheets and tubules. Here we report that the COPII coat subunit, SEC24C, works with the long form of the tubular ER-phagy receptor, RTN3, to target dominant-interfering mutant proinsulin<i> Akita</i> puncta to lysosomes. When the delivery of <i>Akita</i> puncta to lysosomes was disrupted, large puncta accumulated in the ER. Unexpectedly, photobleach analysis indicated that <i>Akita</i> puncta behaved as condensates and not aggregates, as previously suggested. <i>Akita</i> puncta enlarged when either RTN3 or SEC24C were depleted, or when ER sheets were proliferated by either knocking out Lunapark or overexpressing CLIMP63. Other ER-phagy substrates that are segregated into tubules behaved like <i>Akita</i>, while a substrate (type I procollagen) that is degraded by the ER-phagy sheets receptor, FAM134B, did not. Conversely, when ER tubules were augmented in Lunapark knock-out cells by overexpressing reticulons, ER-phagy increased and the number of large <i>Akita</i> puncta were reduced. Our findings imply that segregating cargos into tubules has two beneficial roles. First, it localizes mutant misfolded proteins, the receptor and SEC24C to the same ER domain. Second, physically restraining condensates within tubules, before they undergo ER-phagy, prevents them from enlarging and impacting cell health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The mitochondrial permeability transition pore activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and promotes aging</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial activity determines aging rate and the onset of chronic diseases. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a pathological pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane thought to be composed of the F-ATP synthase (complex V). OSCP, a subunit of F-ATP synthase, helps protect against mPTP formation. How the destabilization of OSCP may contribute to aging, however, is unclear. We have found that loss OSCP in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> initiates the mPTP and shortens lifespan specifically during adulthood, in part via initiation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>). Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the mPTP inhibits the UPR<sup>mt</sup> and restores normal lifespan. Loss of the putative pore-forming component of F-ATP synthase extends adult lifespan, suggesting that the mPTP normally promotes aging. Our findings reveal how an mPTP/UPR<sup>mt</sup> nexus may contribute to aging and age-related diseases and how inhibition of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> may be protective under certain conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human genetic analyses of organelles highlight the nucleus in age-related trait heritability</a></h4>

              
                Most age-related human diseases are accompanied by a decline in cellular organelle integrity, including impaired lysosomal proteostasis and defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. An open question, however, is the degree to which inherited variation in or near genes encoding each organelle contributes to age-related disease pathogenesis. Here, we evaluate if genetic loci encoding organelle proteomes confer greater-than-expected age-related disease risk. As mitochondrial dysfunction is a 'hallmark' of aging, we begin by assessing nuclear and mitochondrial DNA loci near genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome and surprisingly observe a lack of enrichment across 24 age-related traits. Within nine other organelles, we find no enrichment with one exception: the nucleus, where enrichment emanates from nuclear transcription factors. In agreement, we find that genes encoding several organelles tend to be 'haplosufficient', while we observe strong purifying selection against heterozygous protein-truncating variants impacting the nucleus. Our work identifies common variation near transcription factors as having outsize influence on age-related trait risk, motivating future efforts to determine if and how this inherited variation then contributes to observed age-related organelle deterioration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural insights into the activation of human calcium-sensing receptor</a></h4>

              
                Human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that maintains Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in serum. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the CaSR in the inactive and agonist+PAM bound states. Complemented with previously reported structures of CaSR, we show that in addition to the full inactive and active states, there are multiple intermediate states during the activation of CaSR. We used a negative allosteric nanobody to stabilize the CaSR in the fully inactive state and found a new binding site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion that acts as a composite agonist with L-amino acid to stabilize the closure of active Venus flytraps. Our data show that agonist binding leads to compaction of the dimer, proximity of the cysteine-rich domains, large-scale transitions of 7-transmembrane domains, and inter- and intrasubunit conformational changes of 7-transmembrane domains to accommodate downstream transducers. Our results reveal the structural basis for activation mechanisms of CaSR and clarify the mode of action of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and L-amino acid leading to the activation of the receptor.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In situ imaging of bacterial outer membrane projections and associated protein complexes using electron cryo-tomography</a></h4>

              
                The ability to produce outer membrane projections in the form of tubular membrane extensions (MEs) and membrane vesicles (MVs) is a widespread phenomenon among diderm bacteria. Despite this, our knowledge of the ultrastructure of these extensions and their associated protein complexes remains limited. Here, we surveyed the ultrastructure and formation of MEs and MVs, and their associated protein complexes, in tens of thousands of electron cryo-tomograms of ~ 90 bacterial species that we have collected for various projects over the past 15 years (Jensen lab database), in addition to data generated in the Briegel lab. We identified outer MEs and MVs in 13 diderm bacterial species and classified several major ultrastructures: 1) tubes with a uniform diameter (with or without an internal scaffold), 2) tubes with irregular diameter, 3) tubes with a vesicular dilation at their tip, 4) pearling tubes, 5) connected chains of vesicles (with or without neck-like connectors), 6) budding vesicles and nanopods. We also identified several protein complexes associated with these MEs and MVs which were distributed either randomly or exclusively at the tip. These complexes include a secretin-like structure and a novel crown-shaped structure observed primarily in vesicles from lysed cells. In total, this work helps to characterize the diversity of bacterial membrane projections and lays the groundwork for future research in this field.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Skeleton interoception regulates bone and fat metabolism through hypothalamic neuroendocrine NPY</a></h4>

              
                The central nervous system regulates activity of peripheral organs through interoception. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that PGE2/EP4 skeleton interception regulate bone homeostasis. Here we show that ascending skeleton interoceptive signaling downregulates expression of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and induce lipolysis of adipose tissue for osteoblastic bone formation. Specifically, the ascending skeleton interoceptive signaling induces expression of small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE) in the hypothalamus. SMILE binds to pCREB as a transcriptional heterodimer on Npy promoters to inhibit NPY expression. Knockout of EP4 in sensory nerve increases expression of NPY causing bone catabolism and fat anabolism. Importantly, inhibition of NPY Y1 receptor (Y1R) accelerated oxidation of free fatty acids in osteoblasts and rescued bone loss in Avil<sup>Cre</sup>:Ptger<sup>4fl/fl</sup> mice. Thus, downregulation of hypothalamic NPY expression lipolyzes free fatty acids for anabolic bone formation through a neuroendocrine descending interoceptive regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Right fronto-parietal networks mediate the neurocognitive benefits of enriched environments.</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to enriched environments (EE) throughout a lifetime, providing so called reserve, protects against cognitive decline in later years. It has been hypothesised that high levels of alertness necessitated by EE might strengthen the right fronto-parietal networks (FPN) to facilitate this neurocognitive resilience. We have previously shown that EE offset age-related deficits in selective attention by preserving grey matter within right fronto-parietal regions. Here, using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), we examined the relationship between EE, microstructural properties of fronto-parietal white matter association pathways (three branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, SLF), structural brain health (atrophy), and attention (alertness, orienting and executive control) in a group of older adults. We show that EE is associated with a lower orientation dispersion index (ODI) within the right SLF1 which in turn mediates the relationship between EE and alertness, as well as grey- and white-matter atrophy. This suggests that EE may induce white matter plasticity (and prevent age-related dispersion of axons) within the right FPN to facilitate the preservation of neurocognitive health in later years.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity gradients as a common neural architecture for predictive processing in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Predictive processing is emerging as a common neurocomputational hypothesis to account for diverse psychological functions subserved by a brain, enabling characterization of computational capacities of its distinct substructures. However, the literature is currently lacking a systems-level framework for understanding brain structure-function relationships based on the unified computational principles. Here, we contribute to this framework by examining gradients of functional connectivity as a low dimensional spatial representation of functional variation within a given structure. Specifically, we investigated functional connectivity gradients in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus using resting-state functional MRI data collected from large samples of healthy young adults. We then evaluated the degree to which these structures share common principles of functional organization by assessing the correspondence of their gradients. We show that the organizing principles of these structures primarily follow two functional gradients consistent with the existing accounts of predictive processing: A model-error gradient that describes the flow of prediction and prediction error signals, and a model-precision gradient that differentiates regions involved in the representation and attentional modulation of such signals in the cerebral cortex. Using these gradients, we also demonstrate triangulation of functional connectivity involving distinct subregions of the three structures, suggesting the existence of parallel functional circuits that may subserve different aspects of predictive processing in the brain. These findings allow formulation of novel computational hypotheses about the functional relationships between the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus that may be instrumental for understanding the brain's dynamics within its large-scale predictive architecture.

                Performing a cognitive task requires going through a sequence of functionally diverse stages. Although it is typically assumed that these stages are characterized by distinct states of cortical synchrony that are triggered by sub-cortical events, little reported evidence supports this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis, we first identified cognitive stages in single-trial MEG data of an associative recognition task, showing with a novel method that each stage begins with local modulations of synchrony followed by a state of directed functional connectivity. Second, we developed the first whole-brain model that can simulate cortical synchrony throughout a task. The model suggests that the observed synchrony is caused by thalamocortical bursts at the onset of each stage, targeted at cortical synapses and interacting with the structural anatomical connectivity. These findings confirm that cognitive stages are defined by distinct states of cortical synchrony and explains the network-level mechanisms necessary for reaching stage-dependent synchrony states.

                Numerous enveloped viruses use specialized surface molecules called fusogens to enter host cells. During virus replication, these fusogens decorate the host cells membrane enabling them the ability to fuse with neighboring cells, forming syncytia that the viruses use to propagate while evading the immune system. Many of these viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infect the brain and may cause serious neurological symptoms through mechanisms which remain poorly understood. Here we show that expression of either the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or p15 protein from the baboon orthoreovirus is sufficient to induce fusion between interconnected neurons, as well as between neurons and glial cells. This phenomenon is observed across species, from nematodes to mammals, including human embryonic stem cells-derived neurons and brain organoids. We show that fusion events are progressive, can occur between distant neurites, and lead to the formation of multicellular syncytia. Finally, we reveal that in addition to intracellular molecules, fusion events allow diffusion and movement of large organelles such as mitochondria between fused neurons. Our results provide important mechanistic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses could affect the nervous system circuitries causing neurological symptoms.

                Intracranially-recorded interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been proposed as a promising spatial biomarker of the epileptogenic zone. However, visual verification of HFOs is time-consuming and exhibits poor inter-rater reliability. Furthermore, no method is currently available to distinguish HFOs generated from the epileptogenic zone (epileptogenic HFOs: eHFOs) from those generated from other areas (non-epileptogenic HFOs: non-eHFOs). To address these issues, we constructed a deep learning (DL)-based algorithm using HFO events from chronic intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data via subdural grids from 19 children with medication-resistant neocortical epilepsy to: 1) replicate human expert annotation of artifacts and HFOs with or without spikes, and 2) discover eHFOs by designing a novel weakly supervised model (HFOs from the resected brain regions are initially labeled as eHFOs, and those from the preserved brain regions as non-eHFOs). The "purification power" of DL is then used to automatically relabel the HFOs to distill eHFOs. Using 12,958 annotated HFO events from 19 patients, the model achieved 96.3% accuracy on artifact detection (F1 score = 96.8%) and 86.5% accuracy on classifying HFOs with or without spikes (F1 score = 80.8%) using patient-wise cross-validation. Based on the DL-based algorithm trained from 84,602 HFO events from nine patients who achieved seizure-freedom after resection, the majority of such DL-discovered eHFOs were found to be HFOs with spikes (78.6%, p < 0.001). While the resection ratio of detected HFOs (number of resected HFOs/number of detected HFOs) did not correlate significantly with post-operative seizure freedom (the area under the curve [AUC]=0.76, p=0.06), the resection ratio of eHFOs positively correlated with post-operative seizure freedom (AUC=0.87, p=0.01). We discovered that the eHFOs had a higher signal intensity associated with ripple (80-250 Hz) and fast ripple (250-500 Hz) bands at the HFO onset and with a lower frequency band throughout the event time window (the inverted T-shaped), compared to non-eHFOs. We then designed perturbations on the input of the trained model for non-eHFOs to determine the model's decision-making logic. The model probability significantly increased towards eHFOs by the artificial introduction of signals in the inverted T-shaped frequency bands (mean probability increase: 0.285, p < 0.001), and by the artificial insertion of spike-like signals into the time domain (mean probability increase: 0.452, p < 0.001). With this DL-based framework, we reliably replicated HFO classification tasks by human experts. Using a reverse engineering technique, we distinguished eHFOs from others and identified salient features of eHFOs that aligned with current knowledge.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scale Invariance in fNIRS as a Measurement of Cognitive Load</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive load is an important psychological construct, closely related to performance and fatigue in daily cognitive tasks. Scale invariant neural dynamics are a relatively new but effective means of measuring changes in brain states as a result of varied cognitive load and task difficulty. This study is the first to test whether scale invariance (as measured by the Hurst exponent, H) can be used with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to quantify cognitive load. We analyzed H extracted from the fNIRS time series while participants completed an N-back working memory task. Consistent with what has been demonstrated in fMRI, the current results showed that scale-invariance analysis significantly differentiated between task and rest periods as calculated from both oxy- (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) concentration changes. Results from both channel-averaged Hurst and a multivariate partial least squares approach (Task PLS) demonstrated higher H during the 1-back task than the 2-back task. These results were stronger for Hurst derived from HbR than from HbO. As fNIRS is relatively portable and robust to motion-related artifacts, these preliminary results shed light on the promising future of measuring cognitive load in real life settings.

                The mammalian brain contains a large number of specialized cells that develop from a thin sheet of neuroepithelial progenitor cells. Recently, high throughput single-cell technologies have been used to define the molecular diversity of hundreds of cell types in the nervous system. However, the lineage relationships between mature brain cells and progenitor cells are not well understood, because transcriptomic studies do not allow insights into clonal relationships and classical fate-mapping techniques are not scalable. Here we show in vivo barcoding of early progenitor cells that enables simultaneous profiling of cell phenotypes and clonal relations in the mouse brain using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. We reconstructed thousands of clones to uncover the existence of fate-restricted progenitor cells in the mouse hippocampal neuroepithelium and show that microglia are derived from few primitive myeloid precursors that massively expand to generate widely dispersed progeny. By coupling spatial transcriptomics with clonal barcoding, we disentangle migration patterns of clonally related cells in densely labelled tissue sections. Compared to classical fate mapping, our approach enables high-throughput dense reconstruction of cell phenotypes and clonal relations at the single-cell and tissue level in individual animals and provides an integrated approach for understanding tissue architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age differences in aperiodic neural activity measured with resting EEG</a></h4>

              
                Previous research using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) has shown that neural oscillatory activity within the alpha band (8 to 12 Hz) becomes slower and lower in amplitude with advanced age. However, most studies have focused on quantifying age-related differences in periodic oscillatory activity with little consideration of the influence of aperiodic activity on these measures. The aim of this study was to investigate age differences in aperiodic activity inherent in the resting EEG signal. We assessed aperiodic activity in 85 healthy younger adults (mean age: 22.2 years, SD: 3.9, age range: 18 to 35, 37 male) and 92 healthy older adults (mean age: 66.1 years, SD: 8.2, age range 50 to 86, 53 male) by fitting the 1/f-like background activity evident in EEG power spectra using the fitting oscillations & one over f (FOOOF) toolbox. Across the scalp, the aperiodic exponent and offset were smaller in older compared to younger participants, reflecting a flatter 1/f-like slope and a downward broadband shift in the power spectra with age. Before correcting for aperiodic activity, older adults showed slower peak alpha frequency and reduced peak alpha power relative to younger adults. After correcting for aperiodic activity, peak alpha frequency remained slower in older adults; however, peak alpha power no longer differed statistically between age groups. The large sample size utilized in this study, as well as the depth of analysis, provides further evidence that the aperiodic component of the resting EEG signal is altered with aging and should be considered when investigating neural oscillatory activity.

                Neural activity in sensory cortex combines stimulus responses and ongoing activity, but it remains unclear whether they reflect the same underlying dynamics or separate processes. Here we show that during wakefulness, the neuronal assemblies evoked by sounds in the auditory cortex and thalamus are specific to the stimulus and distinct from the assemblies observed in ongoing activity. In contrast, during anesthesia, evoked assemblies are indistinguishable from ongoing assemblies in cortex, while they remain distinct in the thalamus. A strong remapping of sensory responses accompanies this dynamical state change produced by anesthesia. Together, these results show that the awake cortex engages dedicated neuronal assemblies in response to sensory inputs, which we suggest is a network correlate of sensory perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stability of spectral estimates in resting-state magnetoencephalography: recommendations for minimal data duration with neuroanatomical specificity</a></h4>

              
                The principle of resting-state paradigms is appealing and practical for collecting data from impaired patients and special populations, especially if data collection times can be minimized. To achieve this goal, researchers need to ensure estimated signal features of interest are robust. In electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG, MEG) we are not aware of studies of the minimal length of recording required to yield a robust one-session snapshot of the frequency-spectrum derivatives that are typically used to characterize the complex dynamics of the brain's resting-state. We aimed to fill this knowledge gap by studying the stability of common spectral measures of resting-state MEG source time series obtained from large samples of single-session recordings from shared data repositories featuring different recording conditions and instrument technologies (OMEGA: N = 107; Cam-CAN: N = 50). We discovered that the rhythmic and arrhythmic spectral properties of intrinsic brain activity can be robustly estimated in most cortical regions when derived from relatively short recordings of 30-s to 120-s of resting-state data, regardless of instrument technology and resting-state paradigm. Using an adapted leave-one-out approach and Bayesian analysis, we also provide evidence that the stability of spectral features over time is unaffected by age, sex, handedness, and general cognitive function. In summary, short MEG sessions are sufficient to yield robust estimates of frequency-defined brain activity during resting-state. This study may help guide future empirical designs in the field, particularly when recording times need to be minimized, such as with patient or special populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sequential Transmission of Task-Relevant Information in Cortical Neuronal Networks</a></h4>

              
                During auditory task performance, cortical processing of task-relevant information enables mammals to recognize sensory input and flexibly select behavioral responses. In mouse auditory cortex, small neuronal networks encode behavioral choice during a pure-tone detection task, but it is poorly understood how neuronal networks encode behavioral choice during a pure-tone discrimination task where tones have to be categorized into targets and non-targets. While the interactions between networked neurons are thought to encode behavioral choice, it remains unclear how patterns of neuronal network activity indicate the transmission of task-relevant information within the network. To this end, we trained mice to behaviorally discriminate target vs. non-target pure-tones while we used in vivo 2-photon imaging to record neuronal population activity in primary auditory cortex layer 2/3. We found that during task performance, a specialized subset of neurons transiently encoded intersection information, i.e., sensory information that was used to inform behavioral choice. Granger causality analysis showed that these neurons formed functional networks in which task-relevant information was transmitted sequentially between neurons. Differences in network structure between target and non-target sounds encoded behavioral choice. Correct behavioral choices were associated with shorter timescale communication between neurons. In summary, we find that specialized neuronal populations in auditory cortex form functional networks during auditory task performance whose structures depend on both sensory input and behavioral choice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neck motor unit activity displays neural signatures of temporal control during sequential saccade planning</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed behavior involves the transformation of neural movement plans into appropriate muscle activity patterns. Studies involving single saccades have shown that a rapid, direct pathway links saccade planning in frontal eye fields (FEF) to neck muscle activity. It is unknown if the rapid connection between FEF and neck muscle is maintained during sequential saccade planning. We show that sequence planning signals in the FEF are preserved in the neck EMG, although the activity is delayed specifically for the second saccade. Our results suggest that while the direct link between FEF and neck muscle facilitates downstream continuation of FEF response patterns, an indirect route exists through an inhibitory control center like the basal ganglia, limiting the information flow during processing of saccade sequences. Thus, the indirect and direct pathways from the FEF may function together to enable rapid synchronous, but controlled eye-head responses to sequential gaze shifts.

                Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) is a chaperone that catalyses the formation of thiol-disulphide bonds during protein folding. Whilst up-regulation of PDI is a protective mechanism to regulate protein folding, an increasingly wide range of cellular functions have been ascribed to PDI. Originally identified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PDI has now been detected in many cellular locations, including the nucleus. However, its role in this cellular compartment remains undefined. PDI is implicated in multiple diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal and rapidly progressing neurodegenerative condition affecting motor neurons. Loss of essential proteins from the nucleus is an important feature of ALS. This includes TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), a DNA/RNA binding protein present in a pathological form in the cytoplasm in almost all (97%) ALS cases, that is also mutated in a proportion of familial cases. PDI is protective against disease-relevant phenotypes associated with dysregulation of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in ALS. DNA damage is also increasingly linked to ALS, which is induced by pathological forms of TDP-43 by impairment of its normal function in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) mechanism of DNA repair. However, it remains unclear whether PDI is protective against DNA damage in ALS. In this study we demonstrate that PDI was protective against several types of DNA damage, induced by either etoposide, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or ALS-associated mutant TDP-43M337V in neuronal cells. This was demonstrated using widely used DNA damage markers, phosphorylated H2AX and 53BP1, which is specific for NHEJ. Moreover, we also show that PDI translocates into the nucleus following DNA damage. Here PDI is recruited directly to sites of DNA damage, implying that it has a direct role in DNA repair. This study therefore identifies a novel role of PDI in the nucleus in preventing DNA damage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pre- and postsynaptically expressed spike-timing-dependent plasticity contribute differentially to neuronal learning</a></h4>

              
                A plethora of experimental studies have shown that long-term synaptic plasticity can be expressed pre- or postsynaptically depending on a range of factors such as developmental stage, synapse type, and activity patterns. The functional consequences of this diversity are not clear, although it is understood that whereas postsynaptic expression of plasticity predominantly affects synaptic response amplitude, presynaptic expression alters both synaptic response amplitude and short-term dynamics. In most models of neuronal learning, long-term synaptic plasticity is implemented as changes in connective weights. The consideration of long-term plasticity as a fixed change in amplitude corresponds more closely to post- than to presynaptic expression, which means theoretical outcomes based on this choice of implementation may have a postsynaptic bias. To explore the functional implications of the diversity of expression of long-term synaptic plasticity, we adapted a model of long-term plasticity, more specifically spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), such that it was expressed either independently pre- or postsynaptically, or in a mixture of both ways. We compared pair-based standard STDP models and a biologically tuned triplet STDP model, and investigated the outcomes in a minimal setting, using two different learning schemes: in the first, inputs were triggered at different latencies, and in the second a subset of inputs were temporally correlated. We found that presynaptic changes adjusted the speed of learning, while postsynaptic expression was more efficient at regulating spike timing and frequency. When combining both expression loci, postsynaptic changes amplified the response range, while presynaptic plasticity allowed control over postsynaptic firing rates, potentially providing a form of activity homeostasis. Our findings highlight how the seemingly innocuous choice of implementing synaptic plasticity by single weight modification may unwittingly introduce a postsynaptic bias in modelling outcomes. We conclude that pre- and postsynaptically expressed plasticity are not interchangeable, but enable complimentary functions.

                Neuroticism is characterized by a tendency to experience negative and anxious emotions. This personality trait is linked to an increased risk of anxiety and mood disorders. In a cross-sectional 3T diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study in children and adolescents, we found an association between neuroticism and a relative imbalance between left and right (i.e., asymmetry) fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum and white matter underlying the ventromedial prefrontal cortex with opposite directions in females and males. Here we analyzed the longitudinal follow-up DTI data, which was acquired in 76 typically-developing 7- to 18-year-olds, including up to 11 scans per subject. Neuroticism was assessed up to four times. Our longitudinal DTI measurements substantiate robust associations between higher neuroticism scores and increased left relative to right cingulum FA in females and decreased left relative to right cingulum FA in males. In females, the association was already present in late childhood and with a stable expression across childhood and adolescence. In males, the association gradually emerged during adolescence. Future longitudinal studies should clarify which neurobiological factors (e.g., genetic variation, prenatal stress, sex hormones) contribute to the sex-specific associations in the relationship between neuroticism and interhemispheric microstructural asymmetry of the cingulum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explainable Machine Learning Analysis Reveals Gender Differences in the Phenotypic and Neurobiological Markers of Cannabis Use Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) has been linked to environmental, personality, mental health, neurocognitive and neurobiological risk factors. While many studies have revealed gender differences in CUD, the relative importance of these complex factors by gender has not been described. Methods: We conducted a data-driven examination of gender differences in CUD in a community sample of young adults (Human Connectome Project [HCP]; n = 1204, 54% female). We employed state-of-the-art machine learning methods [gradient tree boosting, XGBoost] in combination with novel factor ranking tools [SHapley's Additive exPlanations (SHAP)] as an 'explainable machine learning approach' in the multimodal data collected by the HCP (phenotypic and brain data). Results: We were able to successfully classify both cannabis dependence and cannabis use levels. Previously identified environmental, personality, mental health, neurocognitive, and brain factors highly contributed to the classification. Predominantly-male risk factors included personality (high openness), mental health (high externalizing, high childhood conduct disorder, high fear somaticism), neurocognitive (impulsive delay discounting, slow working memory performance) and brain (low hippocampal volume) factors. Conversely, predominantly-female risk factors included environmental (low education level, low instrumental support) factors. Conclusions: Our data-driven analysis of gender differences in the multimodal risk factors underlying cannabis dependence and use levels demonstrate that environmental factors contribute more strongly to CUD in women, whereas individual factors such as personality, mental health and neurocognitive factors have a larger importance in men. This warrants further investigations, and suggests the importance of understanding how these differences relate to the development of effective treatment approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Weakly activated core inflammation pathways were identified as a central signaling mechanism contributing to the chronic neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuro-inflammation signaling has been identified as an important hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in addition to amyloid {beta} plaques (A{beta}) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, our knowledge of neuro-inflammation is very limited; and the core signaling pathways associated with neuro-inflammation are missing. From a novel perspective, i.e., investigating weakly activated molecular signals (rather than the strongly activated molecular signals), in this study, we uncovered the core neuro-inflammation signaling pathways in AD. Our novel hypothesis is that weakly activated neuro-inflammation signaling pathways can cause neuro-degeneration in a chronic process; whereas, strongly activated neuro-inflammation often cause acute disease progression like in COVID-19. Using the two large-scale genomics datasets, i.e., Mayo Clinic (77 control and 81 AD samples) and RosMap (97 control and 260 AD samples), our analysis identified 7 categories of signaling pathways implicated on AD and related to virus infection: immune response, x-core signaling, apoptosis, lipid dysfunctional, biosynthesis and metabolism, and mineral absorption signaling pathways. More interestingly, most of genes in the virus infection, immune response and x-core signaling pathways, are associated with inflammation molecular functions. Specifically, the x-core signaling pathways were defined as a group of 9 signaling proteins: MAPK, Rap1, NF-kappa B, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, Wnt, TGF-beta, Hippo and TNF, which indicated the core neuro-inflammation signaling pathways responding to the low-level and weakly activated inflammation and hypoxia, and leading to the chronic neuro-degeneration. The core neuro-inflammation signaling pathways can be used as novel therapeutic targets for effective AD treatment and prevention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangling the flow of signals between populations of neurons</a></h4>

              
                Technological advances have granted the ability to record from large populations of neurons across multiple brain areas. These recordings may illuminate how communication between areas contributes to brain function, yet a substantial barrier remains: How do we disentangle the concurrent, bidirectional flow of signals between two populations of neurons? We therefore propose here a novel dimensionality reduction framework: Delayed Latents Across Groups (DLAG). DLAG disentangles signals relayed in both directions; identifies how these signals are represented by each population; and characterizes how they evolve over time and trial-to-trial. We demonstrate that DLAG performs well on synthetic datasets similar in scale to current neurophysiological recordings. Then we study simultaneously recorded populations in primate visual areas V1 and V2, where DLAG reveals signatures of concurrent yet selective communication. Our framework lays the foundation for dissecting the intricate flow of signals across populations of neurons, and how this signaling contributes to cortical computation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SMN controls neuromuscular junction integrity through U7 snRNP</a></h4>

              
                The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an essential synapse for animal survival whose loss is a key hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). While insights into the function of the causative genes implicate RNA dysregulation in NMJ pathogenesis, the RNA-mediated mechanisms controlling the biology of this specialized synapse that go awry in disease remain elusive. Here, we show that activity of the SMA-determining SMN protein in the assembly of U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which functions in the 3'-end processing of replication-dependent histone mRNAs, is required for NMJ integrity. AAV9-mediated gene delivery of U7-specific Lsm10 and Lsm11 proteins selectively enhances U7 snRNP assembly, corrects histone mRNA processing defects, and rescues key structural and functional abnormalities of neuromuscular pathology in SMA mice - including NMJ denervation, reduced synaptic transmission, and skeletal muscle atrophy. Furthermore, U7 snRNP dysfunction induced by SMN deficiency drives selective loss of the synaptic organizing protein Agrin at NMJs innervating vulnerable axial muscles of SMA mice, revealing an unanticipated link between U7-dependent histone mRNA processing and motor neuron-derived expression of an essential factor for NMJ biology. Together, these findings establish a direct contribution of U7 snRNP dysfunction to the neuromuscular phenotype in SMA and the requirement of RNA-mediated histone gene regulation for maintaining functional synaptic connections between motor neurons and muscles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two microRNA regulatory circuits set start and end times for dendritic arborization of a nociceptive neuron</a></h4>

              
                Choreographic dendritic arborization takes place within a defined time frame, but the timing mechanism is currently not known. Here, we report that a precisely timed lin-4-lin-14 regulatory circuit triggers an initial dendritic growth activity whereas a precisely timed let-7-lin-41 regulatory circuit signals a subsequent developmental decline in dendritic growth ability, hence restricting dendritic arborization within a defined time frame. Loss-of-function mutations in the lin-4 microRNA gene cause limited dendritic outgrowth whereas loss-of-function mutations in its direct target, the lin-14 transcription factor gene, cause precocious and excessive outgrowth. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in the let-7 microRNA gene prevent a developmental decline in dendritic growth ability whereas loss-of-function mutations in its direct target, the lin-41 tripartite motif protein gene, cause further decline. lin-4 and let-7 regulatory circuits are expressed at the right place and the right time to set start and end times for PVD dendritic arborization. Replacing the endogenous lin-4 promoter at the lin-4 locus with a late-onset let-7 promoter delays PVD dendrite arborization whereas replacing the endogenous let-7 promoter at the let-7 locus with an early-onset lin-4 promoter causes precocious decline in dendritic growth ability in PVD neurons. We further find that lin-28 acts upstream of let-7 in regulating developmental decline in dendritic growth ability. Our results indicate that the lin-4-lin-14 and the lin-28-let-7-lin-41 regulatory circuits control the timing of PVD dendrite arborization through antagonistic regulation of the DMA-1 receptor level on PVD dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A comprehensive neural simulation of slow-wave sleep and highly responsive wakefulness dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Hallmarks of neural dynamics during healthy human brain states span spatial scales from neuromodulators acting on microscopic ion channels to macroscopic changes in communication between brain regions. Developing a scale-integrated understanding of neural dynamics has therefore remained challenging. Here, we perform the integration across scales using mean-field modeling of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) neurons, explicitly incorporating intrinsic properties of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We report that when AdEx mean-field neural populations are connected via structural tracts defined by the human connectome, macroscopic dynamics resembling human brain activity emerge. Importantly, the model can qualitatively and quantitatively account for properties of empirical spontaneous and stimulus-evoked dynamics in the space, time, phase, and frequency domains. Remarkably, the model also reproduces brain-wide enhanced responsiveness and capacity to encode information particularly during wake-like states, as quantified using the perturbational complexity index. The model was run using The Virtual Brain (TVB) simulator, and is open-access in EBRAINS. This approach not only provides a scale-integrated understanding of brain states and their underlying mechanisms, but also open access tools to investigate brain responsiveness, toward producing a more unified, formal understanding of experimental data from conscious and unconscious states, as well as their associated pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Compensatory reconfiguration of functional networks between white matter and grey matter in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The temporal synchronization of BOLD signals within white matter (WM) and between WM and grey matter (GM) exhibited intrinsic architecture and cognitive relevance. However, few studies examined the network property within- and between-tissue in Alzheimers disease (AD). The hub regions with high weighted degree (WD) were prone to the neuropathological damage of AD. To systematically investigate the changes of hubs within- and between-tissue functional networks in AD patients, we used the resting-state fMRI data of 30 AD patients and 37 normal older adults (NC) from the ADNI open database, and obtained four types of voxel-based WD metrics and four types of distant-dependent WD metrics (ddWD) based on a series of Euclidean distance ranges with a 20mm increment. We found that AD patients showed decreased within-tissue ddWD in the thalamic nucleus and increased between-tissue ddWD in the occipito-temporal cortex, posterior thalamic radiation, and sagittal stratum, compared to NC. We also found that AD patients showed the increased between-tissue FCs between the posterior thalamic radiation and occipito-temporal cortex, and between the sagittal stratum and the salience and executive networks. The dichotomy of decreased and increased ddWD metrics and their locations were consistent with previous studies on the neurodegnerative and compensatory mechanisms of AD, indicating that despite the disruptions, the brain still strived to compensate for the neural inefficiency by reorganizing functional circuits. Our findings also suggested the short-to-medium ranged ddWD metrics between WM and GM as useful biomarker to detect the compensatory changes of functional networks in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coordinated drift of receptive fields during noisy representation learning</a></h4>

              
                Long-term memories and learned behavior are conventionally associated with stable neuronal representations. However, recent experiments showed that neural population codes in many brain areas continuously change even when animals have fully learned and stably perform their tasks. This representational "drift" naturally leads to questions about its causes, dynamics, and functions. Here, we explore the hypothesis that neural representations optimize a representational objective with a degenerate solution space, and noisy synaptic updates drive the network to explore this (near-)optimal space causing representational drift. We illustrate this idea in simple, biologically plausible Hebbian/anti-Hebbian network models of representation learning, which optimize similarity matching objectives, and, when neural outputs are constrained to be nonnegative, learn localized receptive fields (RFs) that tile the stimulus manifold. We find that the drifting RFs of individual neurons can be characterized by a coordinated random walk, with the effective diffusion constants depending on various parameters such as learning rate, noise amplitude, and input statistics. Despite such drift, the representational similarity of population codes is stable over time. Our model recapitulates recent experimental observations in hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex, and makes testable predictions that can be probed in future experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulus degradation impairs performance in a rodent continuous performance test</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention is a core cognitive domain that is often disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders. Continuous performance tests (CPTs) are the most common clinical assay of sustained attention. In CPTs, participants produce a behavioral response to target stimuli and refrain from responding to non-target stimuli. Performance in CPTs is measured as the ability to discriminate between targets and non-targets. Rodent versions of CPTs (rCPT) have been developed and validated with both anatomical and pharmacological studies, providing a translational platform for understanding the neurobiology of sustained attention. In human studies, using degraded stimuli (decreased contrast) in CPTs impairs performance and patients with schizophrenia experience a larger decrease in performance compared to healthy controls. In this study, we tested multiple levels of stimulus degradation in a touchscreen version of the CPT in mice. We found that stimulus degradation significantly decreased performance in both males and females. The changes in performance consisted of a decrease in stimulus discrimination, measured as d prime, and increases in hit reaction time and reaction time variability. These findings are in line with the effects of stimulus degradation in human studies. Overall, female mice demonstrated a more liberal response strategy than males, but response strategy was not affected by stimulus degradation. These data extend the utility of the mouse CPT by demonstrating that stimulus degradation produces equivalent behavioral responses in mice and humans. Therefore, the degraded stimuli rCPT has high translational value as a preclinical assay of sustained attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiple Sclerosis Patients have an Altered Gut Mycobiome and Increased Fungal to Bacterial Richness Running Title: RRMS Patients have Gut Fungal Dysbiosis</a></h4>

              
                Trillions of microbes such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses exist in the healthy human gut microbiome. Although gut bacterial dysbiosis has been extensively studied in multiple sclerosis (MS), the significance of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) is an understudied and neglected part of the intestinal microbiome in MS. The aim of this study was to characterize the gut mycobiome of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), compare it to healthy controls, and examine its association with changes in the bacterial microbiome. We characterized and compared the mycobiome of 20 RRMS patients and 33 healthy controls (HC) using Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and compared mycobiome interactions with the bacterial microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results demonstrate an altered mycobiome in RRMS patients compared with HC. RRMS patients showed an increased abundance of Basidiomycota and decreased Ascomycota at the phylum level with an increased abundance of Candida and Epicoccum genera along with a decreased abundance of Saccharomyces compared to HC. We also observed an increased ITS2/16S ratio, altered fungal and bacterial associations, and altered fungal functional profiles in MS patients compared to HC. This study demonstrates that RRMS patients had a distinct mycobiome with associated changes in the bacterial microbiome compared to HC. There is an increased fungal to bacterial ratio as well as more diverse fungal-bacterial interactions in RRMS patients compared to HC. Our study is the first step towards future studies in delineating the mechanisms through which the fungal microbiome can influence MS disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive cognitive maps for curved surfaces in the 3D world</a></h4>

              
                Terrains in a 3D world can be undulating. Yet, most prior research has exclusively investigated spatial representations on a flat surface, leaving a 2D cognitive map as the dominant model in the field. Here, we investigated whether humans represent a curved surface by building a dimension-reduced flattened 2D map or a full 3D map. Participants learned the location of objects positioned on a flat and curved surface in a virtual environment by driving on the surface (Experiment 1), driving and looking vertically (Experiment 2), or flying (Experiment 3). Subsequently, they were asked to retrieve either the path distance or the 3D Euclidean distance between the objects. Path distance estimation was good overall, but we found a significant underestimation bias for the path distance on the curve, suggesting an influence of potential 3D shortcuts, even though participants were only driving on the surface. Euclidean distance estimation was better when participants were exposed more to the global 3D structure of the environment by looking and flying. These results suggest that the representation of the 2D manifold, embedded in a 3D world, is neither purely 2D nor 3D. Rather, it is flexible and dependent on the behavioral experience and demand.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HCN1 channels mediate mu opioid receptor long-term depression at insular cortex inputs to the dorsal striatum</a></h4>

              
                Mu opioid receptors (MORs) are expressed in the dorsal striatum, a brain region that mediates goal-directed (via the dorsomedial striatum), and habitual (via the dorsolateral striatum, DLS) behaviors. Our previous work indicates that glutamate transmission is depressed when MORs are activated in the dorsal striatum, inducing MOR-mediated long-term synaptic depression (MOR-LTD) or short-term depression (MOR-STD), depending on the input. In the DLS, MOR-LTD is produced by MORs on anterior insular cortex (AIC) inputs and MOR-STD occurs at thalamic inputs, suggesting input-specific MOR plasticity mechanisms. Here, we evaluated the mechanisms of induction of MOR-LTD and MOR-STD in the DLS using pharmacology and optogenetics combined with patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that cAMP/PKA signaling and protein synthesis are necessary for MOR-LTD expression, similar to previous studies of endocannabinoid-mediated LTD (eCB-LTD) in DLS. However, MOR-LTD does not require mTOR signaling as eCB-LTD does. MOR-STD does not utilize these same mechanisms. We characterized the role of presynaptic HCN1 channels in MOR-LTD induction as HCN1 channels expressed in AIC are necessary for MOR-LTD expression in the DLS. These results suggest a mechanism in which MOR activation needs HCN1 to induce MOR-LTD, suggesting a new target for pharmacological modulation of synaptic plasticity, providing new opportunities to develop novel drugs to treat alcohol and opioid use disorders.

                Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) is a method that allows to select and dissecting specific structures, cell populations, or even single cells from different types of tissue to extract DNA, RNA, or proteins. It is easy to perform and precise, avoiding unwanted signals from irrelevant cells, because gene expression may be affected by a bulk of heterogeneous material in a sample. However, despite its efficiency, several steps can affect the sample RNA integrity. In comparison to DNA, RNA is a much more unstable molecule and represents a challenge in the LCM method. Here we describe an optimized protocol to provide good concentration and high-quality RNA in specific structures, such as Dentate Gyrus and CA1 in the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex of mouse brain tissue. Keywords: Laser capture microdissection, high-quality RNA, RNA integrity, mouse brain tissue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Axonal length determines distinct homeostatic phenotypes in human iPSC derived motor neurons on a bioengineered platform</a></h4>

              
                Stem cell-based experimental platforms for neuroscience can effectively model key mechanistic aspects of human development and disease. However, conventional culture systems often overlook the engineering constraints that cells face in vivo. This is particularly relevant for neurons covering long range connections such as spinal motor neurons (MNs). The axons of these neurons extend up to 1m in length and require a complex interplay of mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis. It follows that shorter axons in conventional cultures may not faithfully capture important aspects of their longer counterparts. Here we directly address this issue by establishing a bioengineered platform to assemble arrays of human axons ranging from micrometers to centimeters, permitting systematic investigation of the effects of length on human axonal biology for the first time. With this approach, we reveal a link between length and metabolism in human MNs in vitro, where axons above a threshold size induce specific molecular adaptations in cytoskeleton composition, functional properties, local translation and mitochondrial homeostasis. Our findings specifically indicate the existence of a length-dependent mechanism that switches homeostatic processes within human MNs in order to sustain long axons. Our findings have critical implications for in vitro modelling of several neurodegenerative disorders and reinforce the importance of modelling cell shape and biophysical constraints with fidelity and precision in vitro.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population dynamics of the thalamic head direction system during drift and reorientation</a></h4>

              
                The head direction (HD) system is classically modeled as a ring attractor network which ensures a stable representation of the animal's head direction. This unidimensional description popularized the view of the HD system as the brain's internal compass. However, unlike a globally consistent magnetic compass, the orientation of the HD system is dynamic, depends on local cues and exhibits remapping across familiar environments. Such a system requires mechanisms to remember and align to familiar landmarks, which may not be well described within the classic 1-dimensional framework. To search for these mechanisms, we performed large population recordings of mouse thalamic HD cells using calcium imaging, during controlled manipulations of a visual landmark in a familiar environment. First, we find that realignment of the system was associated with a continuous rotation of the HD network representation. The speed and angular distance of this rotation was predicted by a 2nd dimension to the ring attractor which we refer to as network gain, i.e. the instantaneous population firing rate. Moreover, the 360-degree azimuthal profile of network gain, during darkness, maintained a 'memory trace' of a previously displayed visual landmark. In a 2nd experiment, brief presentations of a rotated landmark revealed an attraction of the network back to its initial orientation, suggesting a time-dependent mechanism underlying the formation of these network gain memory traces. Finally, in a 3rd experiment, continuous rotation of a visual landmark induced a similar rotation of the HD representation which persisted following removal of the landmark, demonstrating that HD network orientation is subject to experience-dependent recalibration. Together, these results provide new mechanistic insights into how the neural compass flexibly adapts to environmental cues to maintain a reliable representation of the head direction.

	<p>The paper presents a study on the changes in cognitive functioning in patients undergoing chemotherapy with diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). The aim of the study was to answer the following two main research questions: Does the treatment stage differentiate the functioning of cognitive processes in patients with diagnosed MM and to what extent? Is it possible to treat biological factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and BDNF) as predictors of patients’ cognitive functioning? The patients were examined twice, before the treatment and after 4–6 cycles of chemotherapy. Selected neuropsychological research methods as well as experimental and clinical trials were employed to diagnose the patients’ general cognitive state, attention, memory, and executive functions. The level of biological factors was assessed with the ELISA test. The results show that the patients’ cognitive functioning was worse before the treatment than during the cytostatic therapy. It was also possible to predict the cognitive state of patients suffering from multiple myeloma based on a selected biological parameter (neurotrophin BDNF).</p>

	<p>Current epilepsy surgery planning protocol determines the seizure onset zone (SOZ) through resource-intensive, invasive monitoring of ictal events. Recently, we have reported that Granger Causality (GC) maps produced from analysis of interictal iEEG recordings have potential in revealing SOZ. In this study, we investigate GC maps’ network connectivity patterns to determine possible clinical correlation with patients’ SOZ and resection zone (RZ). While building understanding of interictal network topography and its relationship to the RZ/SOZ, we identify algorithmic tools with potential applications in epilepsy surgery planning. These graph algorithms are retrospectively tested on data from 25 patients and compared to the neurologist-determined SOZ and surgical RZ, viewed as sources of truth. Centrality algorithms yielded statistically significant RZ rank order sums for 16 of 24 patients with RZ data, representing an improvement from prior algorithms. While SOZ results remained largely the same, this study validates the applicability of graph algorithms to RZ/SOZ detection, opening the door to further exploration of iEEG datasets. Furthermore, this study offers previously inaccessible insights into the relationship between interictal brain connectivity patterns and epileptic brain networks, utilizing the overall topology of the graphs as well as data on edge weights and quantity of edges contained in GC maps.</p>

                Background: The prevention of Clostridium tetani bacterial infection through the administration of the tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine in women is important. The purpose of this study was to determine the regional disparities and factors associated with TT vaccine coverage in women aged 15–49 years in Indonesia. Methods: The Indonesian Demographic Health Survey (IDHS) 2017 data was used in this study. A total of 36,028 women, aged 15–49 years were recruited using the two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. The questionnaire used was based on the DHS Questionnaire Phase 7. Chi-squared and binary logistic regression were used in this study as part of the analysis. Results: We found that the TT vaccine coverage was 75.32% and that the majority were spread across several provinces. The provinces of Bali and Nusa Tenggara, the richer respondents, living in a rural area, visiting the health facility, having health insurance, and those currently working were factors making it more likely that the women would receive the TT vaccine. The respondents aged 15–24 years with a primary education level and the respondents who were divorced were less likely to receive the TT vaccine. Conclusion: The coverage of the TT vaccine among women can be increased by considering the regional disparities in Indonesia and the socio-economic demographic details of the respondents. Strengthening the policies from the central government in the local governments can improve the screening process and vaccine delivery outcomes. In addition, the importance of giving the TT vaccine to women needs to be relayed through health education in collaboration between health workers and the public.

                Background: Driving-induced lower back pain (DLBP) is associated with long driving times and awkward postures. Nonetheless, its actual causes and solutions remain unclear due to intervening causes from activities of daily living and traumatic injuries. This study investigated the causes and recommendations for DLBP using the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ). Methods: A cause-and-effect chain analysis (CECA) was conducted based on discussions with 19 ergonomics experts from Malaysia. Engineering contradictions were formulated according to the causes and associated with the parameters of the TRIZ system. These parameters were then intersected in the contradiction matrix to extract the inventive principles. Finally, recommendations were made based on these principles. Results: CECA uncovered the design- and posture-related causes of DLBP. It was implied that missing seat adjustment controls might cause drivers to sit with their knees positioned higher than their hips. This issue causes an excessive posterior pelvic tilt, resulting in DLBP. To address this issue, an inert atmosphere involving the addition of inflatable bubble wraps to elevate the posterior position was recommended. Conclusion: While there have been studies on DLBP, the present study demonstrated originality by using TRIZ to preliminarily but systematically investigate and resolve DLBP. Further triangulations, prototyping, experimentations, and verifications were not possible due to time and budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, this research uncovered the TRIZ-integrated perspectives on ergonomic solutions to DLBP that are more cost-effective than medical treatments or design overhauls.

                Genome biology shows substantial progress in its analytical and computational part in the last decades. Differential gene expression is one of many computationally intense areas; it is largely developed under R programming language. Here we explain possible reasons for such dominance of R in gene expression data. Next, we discuss the prospects for Python to become competitive in this area of research in coming years. We indicate that Python can be used already in a field of a single cell differential gene expression. We pinpoint still missing parts in Python and possibilities for improvement.

                Background: Accurate viral load (VL) determination is paramount to determine the efficacy of anti-HIV-1 therapy. The conventional method used, fit-point (FP), assumes an equal efficiency in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) among samples that might not hold for low-input templates. An alternative approach, maxRatio, was introduced to compensate for inhibition in PCR. Methods: Herein, we assessed whether maxRatio could improve VL quantification using 2,544 QIAgen artus HI virus-1 RT-PCR reactions. The assay’s standard dilutions were used to build external standard curves with either FP or maxRatio that re-calculated the VLs. Results: FP and maxRatio were highly comparable (Pearson’s ρ=0.994, Cohen’s  κ=0.885), and the combination of the two methods identified samples (n=41) with aberrant amplification profiles. Conclusions: The combination of maxRatio and FP could improve the predictive value of the assay.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Genome-wide regulation of CpG methylation by ecCEBPα in acute myeloid leukemia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy characterized by genetic and epigenetic aberrations that alter the differentiation capacity of myeloid progenitor cells. The transcription factor CEBPα is frequently mutated in AML patients leading to an increase in DNA methylation in many genomic locations. Previously, it has been shown that ecCEBPα (extra coding CEBPα) - a lncRNA transcribed in the same direction as CEBPα gene - regulates DNA methylation of CEBPα promoter in cis. Here, we hypothesize that ecCEBPα could participate in the regulation of DNA methylation in trans. Method: First, we retrieved the methylation profile of AML patients with mutated CEBPα locus from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We then predicted the ecCEBPα secondary structure in order to check the potential of ecCEBPα to form triplexes around CpG loci and checked if triplex formation influenced CpG methylation, genome-wide. Results: Using DNA methylation profiles of AML patients with a mutated CEBPα locus, we show that ecCEBPα could interact with DNA by forming DNA:RNA triple helices and protect regions near its binding sites from global DNA methylation. Further analysis revealed that triplex-forming oligonucleotides in ecCEBPα are structurally unpaired supporting the DNA-binding potential of these regions. ecCEBPα triplexes supported with the RNA-chromatin co-localization data are located in the promoters of leukemia-linked transcriptional factors such as MLF2. Discussion: Overall, these results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for ecCEBPα as a genome-wide epigenetic modulator through triple-helix formation which may provide a foundation for sequence-specific engineering of RNA for regulating methylation of specific genes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Noninvasive fungal rhinosinusitis: a case series [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Fungal rhinosinusitis (FRS) remains a rare disease. The noninvasive forms are hard to diagnose. The management protocols remain controversial. We aim to describe the clinical, radiological and pathological features of noninvasive FRS and present our management protocol and follow-up results. Patients and methods: This descriptive study was conducted in the ear-nose-throat department of the university hospital, Taher Sfar in Mahdia, Tunisia. All patients who responded to the definition of noninvasive FRS (fungal balls and allergic fungal sinusitis) were included. The study was conducted over a three year period (May 2017 – April 2021). Results: Eleven patients were included in this study: four cases of fungal balls and seven cases of allergic fungal sinusitis. Patients presented with symptoms of chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis with no response to conventional treatments. Computed tomodensitometry scan showed opacification of the paranasal sinuses in all patients. Other signs were heterogeneous opacities, local calcifications and thinning of the bony walls of the sinuses. Histopathological findings were inflammatory polyps in all cases of allergic FRS with the presence of fungal hyphae in 42.8% of the cases. All patients underwent surgery after a median delay of 12 [6–24] months of the symptom’s onset. The used procedures were endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy for all patients, ethmoidectomy (81.8%) and sphenoidotomy (36.4%). None received systemic antifungals or corticosteroids with a favorable outcome in all cases. Conclusion: Symptoms of noninvasive FRS are nonspecific. The scan images contribute to the diagnosis, but the perioperative findings and the histopathological results remain crucial.  The management is mainly surgical.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">IUSMMT: Survival mediation analysis of gene expression with multiple DNA methylation exposures and its application to cancers of TCGA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhonghe Shao, Ting Wang, Meng Zhang, Zhou Jiang, Shuiping Huang, Ping Zeng</p>

Effective and powerful survival mediation models are currently lacking. To partly fill such knowledge gap, we particularly focus on the mediation analysis that includes multiple DNA methylations acting as exposures, one gene expression as the mediator and one survival time as the outcome. We proposed IUSMMT (intersection-union survival mixture-adjusted mediation test) to effectively examine the existence of mediation effect by fitting an empirical three-component mixture null distribution. With extensive simulation studies, we demonstrated the advantage of IUSMMT over existing methods. We applied IUSMMT to ten TCGA cancers and identified multiple genes that exhibited mediating effects. We further revealed that most of the identified regions, in which genes behaved as active mediators, were cancer type-specific and exhibited a full mediation from DNA methylation CpG sites to the survival risk of various types of cancers. Overall, IUSMMT represents an effective and powerful alternative for survival mediation analysis; our results also provide new insights into the functional role of DNA methylation and gene expression in cancer progression/prognosis and demonstrate potential therapeutic targets for future clinical practice.

                Background  Poisoning has become a major public health problem, with the intent in most cases being self-harm and commit suicide. This study highlights the psychological and clinical-epidemiological profile of patients visiting Scheer Memorial Adventist Hospital after poisoning.  Methods  This retrospective record-based study was done among poisoning patients of a hospital in Nepal from 1st January 2018 to 31st December 2020. Data were analyzed using STATA version-15.  Results  Out of 134 total poisoning cases, 71 had consumed organophosphate compounds. The majority of the cases were female (59.2% in organophosphate groups, 69.8% in non-organophosphate groups). The circumstances of poisoning were mostly suicidal (95.8% in organophosphate groups, 90.5% in non-organophosphate groups) and the reasons for this being mostly family disputes. Organophosphate groups had 8.41 times higher odds of having complications when compared to non-organophosphorus compounds.   Conclusions  The majority of the poisoning cases were suicidal in nature and family disputes being the major reason for the intake of a poisonous substance. This demands that more attention be given to psychological and family counseling to resolve any disputes, as well as psychological management of poisoning cases after medical management. Also, a strong regulatory mechanism should be imposed to control the easy access to poisonous substances.

                We define a new concept of ‘active milieu’ that unifies all components of nervous tissue (neuronal and glial compartments, extracellular space, extracellular matrix, and vasculature) into a dynamic information processing system. Within this framework, we focus on the role of astrocytic processes, classified into organelle-containing branches and organelle-free leaflets. We argue that astrocytic branches with emanating leaflets are homologous to dendritic shafts with spines. Within the active milieu, astrocytic processes are engaged in reciprocal interactions with neuronal compartments and communication with other cellular and non-cellular elements of the nervous tissue.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Rack1 is essential for corticogenesis by preventing p21-dependent senescence in neural stem cells</a></h4>

              
                The precise control of NSC growth and survival is crucial for brain development. Zhu et al. show that Rack1 is critical for maintaining the survival of NSCs by preventing the cellular senescence during early development. By interacting with Smad3, Rack1 suppresses the p21-dependent senescence and developmental abnormalities of the brain.

                Pan and O’Connor identify Jeb/Alk and Pvf/Pvr as additional signaling pathways that control developmental timing and body size in Drosophila. Jeb/Alk signaling occurs in a juxtracrine fashion between the prothoracic gland (PG) neurons and the PG to control ecdysone production, while Pvf/Pvr signals via autocrine activity within the PG itself.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">FAN1 controls mismatch repair complex assembly via MLH1 retention to stabilize CAG repeat expansion in Huntington’s disease</a></h4>

              
                FAN1 modifies Huntington’s disease pathogenesis, but the mechanism has remained elusive. Goold et al. demonstrate that FAN1 binds MLH1 through residues 126SPYF129, competing with MSH3, and sequesters MLH1 from the mismatch repair pathway. In turn, this reduces mismatch repair activity and suppresses expansion of the pathogenic HTT CAG trinucleotide repeat.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Transcriptional control of brain tumor stem cells by a carbohydrate binding protein</a></h4>

              
                Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are central to glioblastoma heterogeneity and resistance. Sharanek et al. describe an LGALS1/HOXA5 signaling pathway that reprograms the GSC genome and drives glioblastoma resistance to therapy. LGALS1 is a direct transcriptional target of STAT3 and promotes the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma.

                The cancer/testis (CT) antigen GAGE is expressed in several cancers. However, the molecular intricacies of how GAGE functions within the cell remains poorly defined. Nin et al. describe a role for GAGE in altering chromatin accessibility, leading to more efficient DNA repair, contributing to the radio-resistant phenotype in cervical cancer.

                In their mass cytometry study of newly diagnosed tubo-ovarian HGSC, Gonzalez et al. identify decidual-like NK cells that correlate with tumor cell abundance. CD9 distinguishes decidual NK cells from other NK cell phenotypes. In coculture, CD9 trogocytosis from ovarian tumor to NK cells confers NK cells with immune-suppressive properties.

Rab40 is enriched in Golgi and regulates the distribution of lysosomal protein Lamp1 on starvation. Loss of Rab40 leads to lipophagy defects.

To what extent is that true? New research suggests that, like physical space, social knowledge is encoded as a cognitive map in the human brain and represented with a grid-like code.
