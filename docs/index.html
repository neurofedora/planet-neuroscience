              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13815">A Two-Feature Quantitative EEG Index of Pediatric Epilepsy Severity: External Pre-Validation on CHB-MIT and Roadmap to Dravet Cohorts</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective biomarkers for staging pediatric epileptic encephalopathies are scarce. We revisited a large open repository -- the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, 22 subjects aged 1.5-19 y recorded at 256 Hz under the 10-20 montage -- to derive and validate a compact quantitative index, DS-Qi = (theta/alpha)_posterior + (1 - wPLI_beta). The first term captures excess posterior slow-wave power, a recognized marker of impaired cortical maturation; the second employs the debiased weighted Phase-Lag Index to measure loss of beta-band synchrony, robust to volume conduction and small-sample bias. In 30-min awake, eyes-open segments, DS-Qi was 1.69 +/- 0.21 in epilepsy versus 1.23 +/- 0.17 in age-matched normative EEG (Cohen's d = 1.1, p < 0.001). A logistic model trained with 10 x 10-fold cross-validation yielded an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.81-0.97) and optimal sensitivity/specificity of 86%/83% at DS-Qi = 1.46. Across multi-day recordings, test-retest reliability was ICC = 0.74, and higher DS-Qi correlated with greater seizure burden (rho = 0.58, p = 0.004). These results establish DS-Qi as a reproducible, single-number summary of electrophysiological severity that can be computed from short scalp EEG segments using only posterior and standard 10-20 electrodes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13826">Towards Neurocognitive-Inspired Intelligence: From AI's Structural Mimicry to Human-Like Functional Cognition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced significantly through deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language and vision models. However, these systems often remain task specific, struggle to adapt to changing conditions, and cannot generalize in ways similar to human cognition. Additionally, they mainly focus on mimicking brain structures, which often leads to black-box models with limited transparency and adaptability. Inspired by the structure and function of biological cognition, this paper introduces the concept of "Neurocognitive-Inspired Intelligence (NII)," a hybrid approach that combines neuroscience, cognitive science, computer vision, and AI to develop more general, adaptive, and robust intelligent systems capable of rapid learning, learning from less data, and leveraging prior experience. These systems aim to emulate the human brain's ability to flexibly learn, reason, remember, perceive, and act in real-world settings with minimal supervision. We review the limitations of current AI methods, define core principles of neurocognitive-inspired intelligence, and propose a modular, biologically inspired architecture that emphasizes integration, embodiment, and adaptability. We also discuss potential implementation strategies and outline various real-world applications, from robotics to education and healthcare. Importantly, this paper offers a hybrid roadmap for future research, laying the groundwork for building AI systems that more closely resemble human cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13841">Hybrid Deep Learning Approaches for Classifying Autism from Brain MRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.13841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is most often diagnosed using behavioral evaluations, which can vary between clinicians. Brain imaging, combined with machine learning, may help identify more objective patterns linked to ASD. This project used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from the publicly available ABIDE I dataset (n = 1,112) to test two approaches for classifying ASD and control participants. The first was a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) trained end-to-end. The second was a hybrid approach that used the CNN as a feature extractor and then applied a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The baseline CNN reached moderate performance (accuracy = 0.66, AUC = 0.70), while the hybrid CNN + SVM achieved higher overall accuracy (0.76) and AUC (0.80). The hybrid model also produced more balanced results between ASD and control groups. Separating feature extraction and classification improved performance and reduced bias between diagnostic groups. These findings suggest that combining deep learning and traditional machine learning methods could enhance the reliability of MRI-based research on ASD.

                arXiv:2510.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary progress in bridging textual and visual inputs. However, MLLMs still face challenges in situated physical and social interactions in sensorally rich, multimodal and real-world settings where the embodied experience of the living organism is essential. We posit that next frontiers for MLLM development require incorporating both internal and external embodiment -- modeling not only external interactions with the world, but also internal states and drives. Here, we describe mechanisms of internal and external embodiment in humans and relate these to current advances in MLLMs in early stages of aligning to human representations. Our dual-embodied framework proposes to model interactions between these forms of embodiment in MLLMs to bridge the gap between multimodal data and world experience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13883">Large Language Model Agents Enable Autonomous Design and Image Analysis of Microwell Microfluidics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwell microfluidics has been utilized for single-cell analysis to reveal heterogeneity in gene expression, signaling pathways, and phenotypic responses for identifying rare cell types, understanding disease progression, and developing more precise therapeutic strategies. However, designing microwell microfluidics is a considerably complex task, requiring knowledge, experience, and CAD software, as well as manual intervention, which often fails initial designs, demanding multiple costly and time-consuming iterations. In this study, we establish an autonomous large language model (LLM)-driven microwell design framework to generate code-based computer-aided design (CAD) scripts, that enables the rapid and reproducible creation of microwells with diverse geometries and imaging-based analysis. We propose a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-logistic regression framework based on integrating high-level semantic descriptions generated by MLLMs with image embeddings for image classification tasks, aiming to identify microwell occupancy and microwell shape. The fused multimodal representation is input to a logistic regression model, which is both interpretable and computationally efficient. We achieved significant improvements, exceeding 0.92 for occupancy classification and 0.99 for shape classification, across all evaluated MLLMs, compared with 0.50 and 0.55, respectively, when relying solely on direct classification. The MLLM-logistic regression framework is a scalable, efficient solution for high-throughput microwell image analysis. Our study demonstrates an autonomous design microwell platform by translating natural language prompts into optimized device geometries, CAD scripts and image analysis, facilitating the development of next-generation digital discovery by integration of literature mining, autonomous design and experimental data analysis.

Abstract: Although quantum systems are generally described by quantum state vectors, we show that in certain cases their measurement processes can be reformulated as probabilistic equations expressed in terms of probabilistic state vectors. These probabilistic representations can, in turn, be approximated by the neural network dynamics of the Tensor Brain (TB) model.
  The Tensor Brain is a recently proposed framework for modeling perception and memory in the brain, providing a biologically inspired mechanism for efficiently integrating generated symbolic representations into reasoning processes.

                arXiv:2510.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neuroscience, methods from information geometry (IG) have been successfully applied in the modelling of binary vectors from spike train data, using the orthogonal decomposition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and mutual information to isolate different orders of interaction between neurons. While spike train data is well-approximated with a binary model, here we apply these IG methods to data from electroencephalography (EEG), a continuous signal requiring appropriate discretization strategies. We developed and compared three different binarization methods and used them to identify third-order interactions in an experiment involving imagined motor movements. The statistical significance of these interactions was assessed using phase-randomized surrogate data that eliminated higher-order dependencies while preserving the spectral characteristics of the original signals. We validated our approach by implementing known second- and third-order dependencies in a forward model and quantified information attenuation at different steps of the analysis. This revealed that the greatest loss in information occurred when going from the idealized binary case to enforcing these dependencies using oscillatory signals. When applied to the real EEG dataset, our analysis detected statistically significant third-order interactions during the task condition despite the relatively sparse data (45 trials per condition). This work demonstrates that IG methods can successfully extract genuine higher-order dependencies from continuous neural recordings when paired with appropriate binarization schemes.

                arXiv:2510.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4E views of cognition seek to replace many of the long-held assumptions of tra- ditional cognitive science. One of the most radical shifts is the rejection of the sandwich model of cognition [8], which holds that mental processes are located be- tween action and perception. Subversion of such a long-held assumption requires an accessible theoretical alternative with firm experimental support. One unifying thread among the emerging 4E camps is their shared insistence that sensorimotor contingencies (SMCs) are such an alternative.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14382">Joint encoding of "what" and "when" predictions through error-modulated plasticity in reservoir spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain understands the external world through an internal model that generates predictions and refines them based on prediction errors. A complete prediction specifies what will happen, when it will happen, and with what probability, which we refer to as a "prediction object". Existing models typically capture only what and when, omit probabilities, and rely on biologically-implausible algorithms. Here we show that a single population of spiking neurons can jointly encode the prediction object through a biologically grounded learning mechanism. We implement a heterogeneous Izhikevich spiking reservoir with readouts trained by an error-modulated, attention-gated three-factor Hebbian rule and test it on a novel paradigm that controls both the timing and probability of upcoming stimuli. By integrating real-time learning of "when" with offline consolidation of "what", the model encodes the complete prediction object, firing at the correct times with magnitudes proportional to the probabilities. Critically, it rapidly adapts to changes in both stimulus timing and probability, an ability that global least-squares methods such as FORCE lack without explicit resets. During learning, the model self-organizes its readout weights into near-orthogonal subspaces for "what" and "when," showing that multiplexed encoding arises naturally from generic recurrent dynamics under local, error-gated modulation. These results challenge the view that "what" and "when" predictions require separate modules, suggesting instead that mixed selectivity within shared populations supports flexible predictive cognition. The model also predicts phase-specific neuromodulation and overlapping neural subspaces, offering a parsimonious alternative to hierarchical predictive-coding accounts.

Abstract: Brains learn to represent information from a large set of stimuli, typically by weak supervision. Unsupervised learning is therefore a natural approach for exploring the design of biological neural networks and their computations. Accordingly, redundancy reduction has been suggested as a prominent design principle of neural encoding, but its ``mechanistic'' biological implementation is unclear. Analogously, unsupervised training of artificial neural networks yields internal representations that allow for accurate stimulus classification or decoding, but typically rely on biologically-implausible implementations. We suggest that interactions between parallel subnetworks in the brain may underlie such learning: we present a model of representation learning by ensembles of neural networks, where each network learns to encode stimuli into an abstract representation space by cross-supervising interactions with other networks, for inputs they receive simultaneously or in close temporal proximity. Aiming for biological plausibility, each network has a small ``receptive field'', thus receiving a fixed part of the external input, and the networks do not share weights. We find that for different types of network architectures, and for both visual or neuronal stimuli, these cross-supervising networks learn semantic representations that are easily decodable and that decoding accuracy is comparable to supervised networks -- both at the level of single networks and the ensemble. We further show that performance is optimal for small receptive fields, and that sparse connectivity between networks is nearly as accurate as all-to-all interactions, with far fewer computations. We thus suggest a sparsely interacting collective of cross-supervising networks as an algorithmic framework for representational learning and collective computation in the brain.

                arXiv:2510.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature of cognitive neuroscience, researchers tend to assume a linear relationship between brain activation level and task performance; however, controversial findings have been reported in participants at different ages and different proficiency levels. Therefore, there may be a non-linear relationship between task performance and brain activation if a full range of task performance is considered. In the current study, using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset we examined the relationship between brain activation and working memory performance in two conditions (i.e. faces and places). We found a gradual change from a U-shaped relationship to an inverted U-shaped relationship along the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis in the face condition. In other words, in low-order sensorimotor areas, it is U-shaped and in the high-order prefrontal and association areas, it is inverted U-shaped, which suggests different properties in the encoding/representation region and in the cognitive calculation regions. However, in the place condition, such a shift is missing, presumably because most of the regions that are sensitive to task performance in the place condition are in the lower end of the S-A axis. Taken together, our study revealed a novel difference of functional property in response to task performance in the sensorimotor areas versus the association areas.

Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.

                arXiv:2505.05497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cognition has made it possible to model human cognitive processes very effectively, revealing numerous parallels between the properties of conceptual entities tested by the human mind and those of microscopic entities tested by measurement apparatuses. The success of quantum cognition has also made it possible to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the conceptuality interpretation, which ascribes to quantum entities a conceptual nature similar to that of human concepts. The present work fits into these lines of research by analyzing a cognitive version of single, double, and triple-slit experiments. The data clearly show the formation of the typical interference fringes between the slits as well as the embryos of secondary fringes. Our analysis also shows that while quantum entities and human concepts may share a same conceptual nature, the way they manifest it in specific contexts can be quite different. This is also evident from the significant deviation from zero observed for the Sorkin parameter, indicating the presence of strong irreducible third-order interference contributions in human decision.

                arXiv:2509.13875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chronic stress is a risk factor for cognitive decline and illness, yet reliable individual markers remain limited. We tested whether two single channel high dynamic range EEG biomarkers, ST4 and T2, index stress responses by linking neural activity to validated physiological and subjective measures.
  Study 1 included 101 adults between 22 and 82 years of age who completed questionnaires on stress, resilience, and burnout, provided salivary cortisol, and performed resting, cognitive load, emotional, and startle conditions. Study 2 included 82 adults between 19 and 42 years who completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, underwent heart rate variability monitoring, and performed auditory, stress inducing, and emotional conditions. Correlations were considered meaningful when r was at least 0.30. Results showed that ST4 reflected physiological arousal and cognitive strain. In Study 1, resting ST4 was positively related to cortisol and lower in more resilient participants. In Study 2, ST4 correlated negatively with heart rate variability during stress and recovery. T2 reflected emotional and autonomic regulation. In Study 1, T2 tracked higher cortisol and was lower with greater resilience. In Study 2, T2 was higher with trait anxiety and correlated negatively with heart rate variability during stress and emotional conditions. Together, ST4 and T2 provide complementary portable markers of stress, supporting individualized assessment in clinical and real world contexts.

                arXiv:2510.02853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the principles that determine neural population activity is paramount in the field of neuroscience. We propose the Principle of Isomorphism (PIso): population activity preserves the essential mathematical structures of the tasks it supports. Using grid cells as a model system, we show that the neural metric task is characterized by a flat Riemannian manifold, while path integration is characterized by an Abelian Lie group. We prove that each task independently constrains population activity to a toroidal topology. We further show that these perspectives are unified naturally in Euclidean space, where commutativity and flatness are intrinsically compatible and can be extended to related systems including head-direction cells and 3D grid cells. To examine how toroidal topology maps onto single-cell firing patterns, we develop a minimal network architecture that explicitly constrains population activity to toroidal manifolds. Our model robustly generates hexagonal firing fields and reveals systematic relationships between network parameters and grid spacings. Crucially, we demonstrate that conformal isometry, a commonly proposed hypothesis, alone is insufficient for hexagonal field formation. Our findings establish a direct link between computational tasks and the hexagonal-toroidal organization of grid cells, thereby providing a general framework for understanding population activity in neural systems and designing task-informed architectures in machine learning.

                arXiv:2510.12141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision. MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.

Abstract: This survey paper presents a comprehensive examination of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture search (SNNaS) from a unique hardware/software co-design perspective. SNNs, inspired by biological neurons, have emerged as a promising approach to neuromorphic computing. They offer significant advantages in terms of power efficiency and real-time resource-constrained processing, making them ideal for edge computing and IoT applications. However, designing optimal SNN architectures poses significant challenges, due to their inherent complexity (e.g., with respect to training) and the interplay between hardware constraints and SNN models. We begin by providing an overview of SNNs, emphasizing their operational principles and key distinctions from traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then provide a brief overview of the state of the art in NAS for ANNs, highlighting the challenges of directly applying these approaches to SNNs. We then survey the state-of-the-art in SNN-specific NAS approaches. Finally, we conclude with insights into future research directions for SNN research, emphasizing the potential of hardware/software co-design in unlocking the full capabilities of SNNs. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, offering a holistic view of SNNaS and underscoring the importance of a co-design approach to harness the true potential of neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Analysing how information flows along the layers of a multilayer perceptron is a topic of paramount importance in the field of artificial neural networks. After framing the problem from the point of view of information theory, in this position article a specific investigation is conducted on the way information is processed, with particular reference to the requirements imposed by supervised learning. To this end, the concept of information matrix is devised and then used as formal framework for understanding the aetiology of optimisation strategies and for studying the information flow. The underlying research for this article has also produced several key outcomes: i) the definition of a parametric optimisation strategy, ii) the finding that the optimisation strategy proposed in the information bottleneck framework shares strong similarities with the one derived from the information matrix, and iii) the insight that a multilayer perceptron serves as a kind of "adaptor", meant to process the input according to the given objective.

Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays (MCA) are emerging as efficient building blocks for in-memory computing and neuromorphic hardware due to their high density and parallel analog matrix-vector multiplication capabilities. However, the physical properties of their nonvolatile memory elements introduce new attack surfaces, particularly under fault injection scenarios. This work explores Laser Fault Injection as a means of inducing analog perturbations in MCA-based architectures. We present a detailed threat model in which adversaries target memristive cells to subtly alter their physical properties or outputs using laser beams. Through HSPICE simulations of a large MCA on 45 nm CMOS tech. node, we show how laser-induced photocurrent manifests in output current distributions, enabling differential fault analysis to infer internal weights with up to 99.7% accuracy, replicate the model, and compromise computational integrity through targeted weight alterations by approximately 143%.

Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.

                arXiv:2510.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning. Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences, thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling (including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences. Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$ less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

                arXiv:2510.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor communications and achieving low detection latency.

                arXiv:2510.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models, addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch. Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful} unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic Gaussian-mixture setting.

                arXiv:2507.02901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment. However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes. Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic (NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269">Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.12269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP and Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

">Epilepsy-associated Variants of a Single SCN1A Codon exhibit Divergent Functional Properties</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Pathogenic variants in SCN1A, which encodes the voltage gated sodium channel NaV1.1, are associated with multiple epilepsy syndromes exhibiting a range of clinical severity. Loss or gain of function SCN1A variants are reported in different syndromes including Dravet syndrome, which is associated with loss-of-function whereas neonatal/infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is associated with gain-of-function. Strategies to predict SCN1A variant pathogenicity and dysfunction have been proposed but are limited by available training data. We investigated the functional properties of four epilepsy-associated SCN1A variants affecting the same codon and sought to correlate channel dysfunction with phenotype. Methods: Whole-cell manual patch-clamp recording was performed on heterologously-expressed NaV1.1 variants. Structural modeling of NaV1.1 variant proteins was conducted using AlphaFold 3. Results: We describe an individual with early infantile onset DEE associated with SCN1A-I1347T, and identified three additional cases from the literature or ClinVar with distinct variation of the same codon (I1347N, I1347V, I1347F). Functional studies demonstrated mixed gain and loss of function properties for I1347T, I1347V, and I1347F, but complete loss-of-function for I1347N. Structural models suggest important interactions between isoleucine-1347 and the sixth transmembrane helices of domains 3 and 4 that are disrupted most significantly with asparagine replacement at this position (I1347N). Interpretation: Pathogenic variants in SCN1A involving the same codon can produce divergent functional effects. Our findings suggest that predicting specific functional effects of SCN1A variants should not rely heavily on position in the protein.

                Background The population is increasingly demanding a better quality of life in their territories, which requires better urban planning. This study aims to find out the effectiveness of urban planning implemented by local governments on citizen satisfaction. Method A systematic literature review was conducted exploring the evolution of the state-of-the-art databases in Scopus, WOS and Dimensions, involving a relevant selection of empirical studies on the effectiveness of urban planning on citizen satisfaction, using quality criteria and the application of the PRISMA diagram. Results The findings in the various empirical contributions find converging in three main blocks the contributions related to: (i) Urban planning as a catalyst for the impact of citizen satisfaction, given that using the planning tool will lead to the development of local policies based on the Neoliberalism approach for smart urban development; (ii) Theoretical contributions for urban planning that contextualises a modernist planning based on a multidimensional aspect to address quality of life for modern well-being and (iii) Smart planning for citizen satisfaction for the design and implementation of public governance reforms aimed at optimising urban planning management at the local level for smart urban city development. Conclusion There is strong theoretical and empirical support that is closely linked to sustainable development, happiness, public space, urban growth, urban areas, satisfied customers and urban residents. Future research should examine the relative weight of urban planning dimensions and effectiveness in the sustainable development of territories and citizen satisfaction.

                Phyllanthus acidus (L.) Skeels (Phyllanthaceae) is a potential medicinal plant recognized for its sour and tart-tasting fruits. In this study, the chloroplast genome of P. acidus was sequenced, assembled, and characterized. The chloroplast genome size was 156,331 bp, and the overall GC content was 36.9%. Additionally, the chloroplast genome had a quadripartite structure consisting of a large single copy (LSC; 85,807 bp in length; GC content: 34.6%), a small single copy (SSC; 19,262 bp in length; GC content: 30.6%), and two inverted repeat regions (IR; 25,631 bp in length; GC content: 43.1%). A total of 113 unique genes were annotated in the chloroplast genome, including 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs, and four rRNAs. The phylogenetic analysis based on 79 protein-coding genes revealed the paraphyly of the Phyllanthus genus. These findings provided additional genetic information for further research on P. acidus and the cp genome in the Phyllanthaceae family.

                Background The adoption of prepaid billing systems by water utilities in developing economies is a significant management initiative. Understanding its impact on customer satisfaction is crucial. This study investigates this impact at Uganda’s National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), grounded in the behavioral beliefs construct of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional design was employed. Data were collected from 261 prepaid water customers in Bushenyi-Ishaka Municipality using a structured questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS software, with descriptive statistics and linear regression applied to examine the relationship between the prepaid system’s attributes and customer satisfaction. Results The linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between the prepaid system’s attributes and customer satisfaction (B = 0.592, p < 0.05). This confirms that the behavioral beliefs associated with the prepaid system, as per the TPB, are significant predictors of customer satisfaction. The regression model explains 15.3% of the variance in satisfaction, indicating that other factors not measured in the study also play an influential role. Conclusions The prepaid water billing system significantly enhances customer satisfaction at NWSC by leveraging the principles of transparency and consumer control, as predicted by the TPB. Utility managers should emphasize these benefits and support system implementation with targeted customer education and investment in robust technical infrastructure. This study provides original empirical evidence on the drivers of prepaid water satisfaction in a developing economy and validates the application of the TPB framework in this context.

                Background Oral health is fundamental to general health and well-being, yet it remains a neglected priority in health systems, particularly within the World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Oral diseases affect an estimated 330 million people (46.5%) across the region, driven by unaddressed risk factors, inequalities, and weak integration into the Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) and Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agendas. Despite this high burden, oral health initiatives to address this burden and prioritize the oral research agenda remain limited. This scoping review represents the first comprehensive effort to systematically map and identify the status of Oral Health Research (OHR), including scope, output, and collaboration within the WHO EMR (hereafter, EMR) between 2014 and 2024. Methods A comprehensive search strategy was developed in Ovid MEDLINE and translated into Embase, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos, and will be applied to global and regional databases. Searching covers January 2014 to December 2024 without language restrictions. Eligible studies will include primary and secondary research covering clinical, public health, and health systems research. Excluded will be in vitro, in vivo, case reports, protocols, editorials, and commentaries. Screening and data extraction will be managed using DistillerSR software. Extracted data will be analyzed in RStudio, using descriptive statistics, collaboration mapping, and interactive visualization. Discussion This scoping review will provide the first comprehensive mapping of OHR across the EMR. The review will highlight oral health research strengths and gaps at regional and country-specific levels by examining research topics, study designs, funding sources, and collaboration patterns. These findings will guide policymakers, researchers, and academic schools and institutions to prioritize the OHR agenda and inform the development and enactment of oral health policies. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference abstracts, and regional interest-holders engagement. Registration The protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF): https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MXWKC.

                Background Many graduates are unprepared for the workforce because of the abysmal increase in unemployment rates. While academics have tried to incorporate employable skills into curricula, graduates must understand social and humanitarian principles to meet globalization demands. This study investigated how service-learning influences the prosocial skills of economics undergraduate pre-service teachers and its impact on their future employment prospects. Method We adopted a mixed-method design of the sequential explanatory approach. A purposive random sampling technique was used to select 150 pre-service teachers (300 and 400 level) from five departments in the Faculty of Education at the University of Ibadan offering economics. A convenience sampling technique was used to sample 10 students for focus group discussions, who served as team leaders in service-learning courses. The Students’ Prosocial and Professional Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.79) and a Focus Group Discussion Guide were used for data collection. Quantitative data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation and paired sample t-test at significance level of 0.05, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results The mean scores for the constructs were communication skills (2.61), teamwork (2.45), empathy (2.35), culture (2.30) and social responsibility (2.50). The mean for communication skills increased significantly from 2.61 before the intervention to 3.35. The reduction in the standard deviation indicates that the communication skills of pre-service teachers have become more consistent and prominent (F=24.87), confirming the statistical significance of these improvements. Similar improvements were observed in teamwork skills, with the mean score rising from 2.62 before intervention to 3.36 and statistically significant (F=9.71). Conclusion The undergraduate students had low overall prosocial ability scores, indicating a lack of prosocial competencies essential for effective teaching and professional success in education. Policymakers and stakeholders should recognize the value of service learning and support its integration into teacher education programs through funding, resources, and institutional encouragement.

Taste peptides have emerged as promising natural flavoring agents attributed to their unique organoleptic properties, high safety profile, and potential health benefits. However, the <i>de novo</i> identification of taste peptides derived from animal, plant, or microbial sources remains a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, significantly impeding their widespread application in the food industry. In this work, we present TastePepAI, a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework for customized taste peptide design and safety assessment. As the key element of this framework, a loss-supervised adaptive variational autoencoder (LA-VAE) is implemented to efficiently optimize the latent representation of sequences during training and facilitate the generation of target peptides with desired taste profiles. Notably, our model incorporates a novel taste-avoidance mechanism, allowing for selective flavor exclusion. Subsequently, our in-house developed toxicity prediction algorithm (SpepToxPred) is integrated in the framework to undergo rigorous safety evaluation of generated peptides. Using this integrated platform, we successfully identified 73 peptides exhibiting sweet, salty, and umami, significantly expanding the current repertoire of taste peptides. This work demonstrates the potential of TastePepAI in accelerating taste peptide discovery for food applications and provides a versatile framework adaptable to broader peptide engineering challenges.

                <p>by Austin Polanco, Mark E. J. Newman</p>

Repurposing existing drugs to treat new diseases is a cost-effective alternative to <i>de novo</i> drug development, but there are millions of potential drug-disease combinations to be considered with only a small fraction being viable. In silico predictions of drug-disease associations can be invaluable for reducing the size of the search space. In this work we present a novel network of drugs and the diseases they treat, compiled using a combination of existing textual and machine-readable databases, natural-language processing tools, and hand curation, and analyze it using network-based link prediction methods to identify potential drug-disease combinations. We measure the efficacy of these methods using cross-validation tests and find that several methods, particularly those based on graph embedding and network model fitting, achieve impressive prediction performance, significantly better than previous approaches, with area under the ROC curve above 0.95 and average precision almost a thousand times better than chance.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies offer detailed and inexpensive identification of the genetic structure of living organisms. The massive data volume necessitates the utilization of advanced computational resources for analyses. However, the rapid accumulation of data and the urgent need for analysis tools have caused the development of imperfect software solutions. Given their immense potential in clinical applications and the recent reproducibility crisis discussions in science and technology, these tools must be thoroughly examined. Typically, NGS data analysis tools are benchmarked under homogeneous conditions, with well-trained personnel and ideal hardware and data environments. However, in the real world, these analyses are done under heterogeneous conditions in terms of computing environments and experience levels. This difference is mostly overlooked, therefore studies that examine NGS workflows generated under various conditions would be highly valuable. Moreover, a detailed assessment of the difficulties faced by the trainees would allow for improved educational programs for better NGS analysis training. Considering these needs, we designed an elective undergraduate bioinformatics course project for computer engineering students at Istanbul Technical University. Students were tasked to perform and compare 12 different somatic variant calling pipelines on the recently published SEQC2 dataset. Upon examining the results, we have realized that despite seeming correct, the final variant lists created by different student groups display a high level of heterogeneity. Notably, the operating systems and installation methods were the most influential factors in variant-calling performance. Here, we present detailed evaluations of our case study and provide insights for better bioinformatics training.

                <p>by Haley V. Goodwin, Nigel S. Atkinson</p>

AlphaFold-Multimer models protein complexes and facilitates protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. Mapping of protein interaction domains and motifs onto the 3D structure can lend credence to the model and provide insight into the function of a given interaction. Furthermore, limiting structure prediction to only the domains and motifs that are likely to interact can reduce the computational demand and produce a higher quality model. To satisfy these needs, we built the Protein-Protein Interaction Identifier (PPI-ID). PPI-ID maps interaction domains and motifs onto molecular structures and filters for those that are sufficiently close to interact. Once an interface is found, PPI-ID labels interacting amino acids. Given only sequences, PPI-ID predicts regions for AlphaFold-Multimer modeling, reporting potential interactions only when each protein has one-half of a paired sequence. Testing with known dimers confirms high accuracy of the tool.

Nitrogen balance is a major challenge for herbivores when consuming a low-nitrogen diet. Gut microbiota-mediated urea nitrogen recycling facilitates protein homeostasis during times of nitrogen deficiency, yet its relevance to wild nonhibernating small mammals remains unclear. Here, through a combination of isotope tracing, metagenomics, targeted short-chain fatty acid analysis, and fecal microbiota transplantation, we investigated the effects of protein restriction in winter on urea nitrogen recycling in plateau pikas (<i>Ochotona curzoniae</i>) of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Hepatic urea-cycle metabolism was downregulated during winter protein restriction, accompanied by increases in beneficial bacteria with ureolytic capacity (such as the genus <i>Alistipes</i>), gut urease activity, and urea transporters, and acetate production, with a consequent increase in nitrogen reincorporation into the pika’s protein pool. Critically, supplementing a low-protein diet with yak fecal microbiota enhanced the ureolytic capacity by increasing <i>Alistipes</i> abundance, revealing a critical mechanism whereby interspecies horizontal microbial transfer between sympatric species enhances host protein homeostasis. Our results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiota in urea nitrogen recycling to maintain protein balance in winter-active herbivorous small mammals and contribute to our understanding of species coexistence and mammalian adaptation to high-altitude environments. Our findings establish that microbiota-driven urea nitrogen recycling is a key adaptive strategy for protein homeostasis in winter-active herbivores. This work provides new insights into the mechanisms of mammalian adaptation to high-altitude environments and the dynamics of interspecies coexistence.

                <p>by Eva Marina Stirnemann, Joëlle Sasse</p>

Root exudates, species-specific metabolites released by plants into the rhizosphere, shape plant nutrient uptake, plant–plant and plant–microbiome interactions. When optimized, such interactions boost the productivity of sustainable agricultural systems such as intercropping and crop rotation. However, why certain combinations of crops are beneficial and others are not, remains unclear. This Essay outlines how optimal crop combinations could be determined, focusing on the molecular interplay of crops and their microbial partners. With an advanced understanding of root exudation and its effects on microbes, new strategies for sustainable farming could be unlocked, reducing reliance on fertilizers and pesticides, and tackling challenges raised by a changing climate.

Models of visual salience detection rely on center–surround interactions, yet it remains unclear how these computations are distributed across retinal, cortical, and subcortical circuits due to their overlapping contributions. Here, we reveal a <i>de novo</i> collicular mechanism for surround suppression by combining patterned optogenetics with whole-cell recordings from individual neurons in the mouse superficial superior colliculus (SCs). Center zones were defined by monosynaptic input from channelrhodopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in collicular midbrain slices. Surround network optoactivation suppressed center responses compared to center-only input. This suppression is excitatory in origin, arising from the withdrawal of center excitation via surround-driven inhibition of local recurrent excitatory circuits, as demonstrated by cell-type-specific <i>trans-</i>synaptic tracing and computational modeling. These findings identify a local circuit mechanism for saliency computation in the SCs, independent of cortical input.

                <p>by Michele Angelo Colombo, Jacopo Favaro, Ezequiel Mikulan, Andrea Pigorini, Flavia Maria Zauli, Ivana Sartori, Piergiorgio d’Orio, Laura Castana, Irene Toldo, Stefano Sartori, Simone Sarasso, Tim Bayne, Anil K. Seth, Marcello Massimini</p>

Hemispherotomy is a neurosurgical procedure for treating refractory epilepsy, which entails disconnecting a significant portion of the cortex, potentially encompassing an entire hemisphere, from its cortical and subcortical connections. While this intervention prevents the spread of seizures, it raises important questions. Given the complete isolation from sensory-motor pathways, it remains unclear whether the disconnected cortex retains any form of inaccessible awareness. More broadly, the activity patterns that large portions of the deafferented cortex can sustain in awake humans remain poorly understood. We address these questions by exploring for the first time the electroencephalographic (EEG) state of the isolated cortex during wakefulness before and after surgery in 10 pediatric patients, focusing on non-epileptic background activity. Post-surgery, the isolated cortex exhibited prominent slow oscillations (<2 Hz) and a steeper broad-band spectral decay, reflecting a redistribution of power toward lower frequencies. This broad-band EEG slowing resulted in a marked decrease of the spectral exponent, a validated consciousness marker, reaching values characteristic of deep anesthesia and the vegetative state. When compared with a reference pediatric sample across the sleep–wake cycle, the spectral exponent of the contralateral cortex aligned with wakefulness, whereas that of the isolated cortex was consistent with deep NREM sleep. The findings of prominent slow oscillations and broad-band slowing provisionally support inferences of absent or reduced awareness in the isolated cortex. Moreover, the persistence of unihemispheric sleep-like patterns years after surgery provides unique insights into the long-term electrophysiological effects of cortical disconnections in the human brain.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Aging is associated with changes in spatial memory and navigation, yet the mechanisms underlying these changes are not yet fully understood. Environmental boundaries are among the most salient and reliable spatial cues, supporting both spatial memory and orientation. Here, we investigated how aging affects the use and the neural representation of boundary information during a virtual object location memory task. Healthy young and older adults navigated a square virtual environment while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, allowing us to assess moment-to-moment encoding of distance to environmental boundaries in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Behaviorally, both age groups showed more accurate memory for objects located near boundaries, but this effect was amplified in older adults, whose spatial precision declined more steeply with increasing distance from boundaries. Older adults also exhibited a stronger bias to recall objects closer to boundaries. Analysis of navigation behavior revealed that older adults followed boundary-oriented paths regardless of target location, whereas young adults flexibly adapted their navigation based on spatial context. Neurally, older adults—but not young adults—showed significant blood-oxygen-level-dependent modulation by boundary distance in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum, with activity decreasing as participants moved farther from boundaries. This effect was most pronounced in low-performing older adults and was associated with stronger behavioral boundary bias, suggesting a maladaptive reliance on proximity-based cues. Together, our results provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that aging alters the use and representation of boundary information, with downstream effects on spatial memory. Altered boundary processing may represent a key mechanism contributing to age-related declines in spatial cognition.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In this commentary, I recount my personal research journey that brought me to studying the hippocampus, which I vigorously avoided earlier in my career. I focus on studies of contextual fear conditioning and how they led me in this direction. The adventure was largely unplanned and driven by several findings that were unanticipated when the experiments were initially designed. Because I sometimes chose not to publish the studies in the order that they were completed, and journals have variable publication lags, the discovery process is not immediately apparent from reading the literature in the order that things were published. In a general sense, the chronology shows how well-established ideas may obscure discovery, but a readiness to abandon and replace them when the data lead you elsewhere is a catalyst to better understanding. In this case, that understanding is what makes a context a unique stimulus and why we need the hippocampus to deal with that uniqueness.</p>

     alt="Immunohistochemical Profile of a Conspicuously Organized Structure in the Dorsal Forebrain of the Peacock Gudgeon, Tateurndina ocellicauda"/>
<p>In the dorsal telencephalon of gobiiform fishes, there is a conspicuously organized structure, consisting of readily identifiable subregions that are surrounded by layers of cell bodies. Using immunohistochemistry against several antigen targets in this structure, we demonstrate that each of these subregions is characterized by its own individual neurochemical profile, which indicates corresponding differential inputs into different subregions.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In the pallium of mammals and reptiles, layered neuronal organizations appear as a key feature to facilitate neuronal processing. Such layered organizations allow to segregate inputs and information processing into different neuronal compartments and are used in a variety of tasks, including multisensory integration and the formation/retrieval of memories. Although teleost fishes also need to process multisensory information and form memories, their pallium generally does not contain any layered structures. Instead, neurons appear to be organized into nuclei with loosely arranged cells. One exception to this general principle can be found in gobiiform fishes: Their caudo-dorsal telencephalon is, in part, marked by neurons, which are organized into several soma-dense and fiber-rich subregions, which are referred to as Dl4–Dl7 in lateral to medial order. To better understand the organization of this structure, we investigated the immunoreactivity of these subregions using a variety of different antigen targets: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), parvalbumin (PV), substance P (SP), calretinin (calret), neurofilament heavy chain (NFH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Our results reveal a differential distribution of the investigated antigens throughout the subregions, with immunoreactivity hotspots of dense putative terminal fields in different fiber-rich subregions, depending on the antigen investigated. Within Dl7, dense fiber fields were most immunoreactive for calret and PV, within Dl6 for PV, SP, and NFH, within Dl5 for ChAT, and within Dl4 for calret. This differential distribution shows that individual subregions receive input from different sources, which, in turn, suggests that they are different functional compartments.</p>

                Majumdar, Ashcroft, Fritsche, et al. show that neuronal representations of economic decision variables—expected value and risk—exhibit distinct spatial gradients across the mouse frontal cortex. Furthermore, the encoding of these variables depends on where frontal neurons project. The findings reveal a structured, multi-scale code for economic decision variables.

This difference is induced by dietary vitamin A and amplified by the microbiota.

                Ghose et al. perform multi-temperature deep mutational scanning to provide a comprehensive accounting of variants with altered temperature-dependent behavior in a model kinase, challenging previous assumptions surrounding temperature sensitivity and adaptation. Heat-sensitive variants were distributed across the protein structure and affected expression, whereas heat-resistant variants showed increased enzymatic activity, not stability.

                Rahaman et al. show that heat shock leads to monosome accumulation without a corresponding increase in monosome-associated mRNAs, indicating that most monosomes are silent rather than elongation paused. This reduces the median rate of mRNA association with ribosomes, except for mRNAs encoding heat shock proteins, which maintain steady association.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106303">Cross-species insemination reveals mouse sperm ability to enter and cross the fish micropyle</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular matrices surrounding eggs in fish (chorion) and mammals (zona pellucida [ZP]) regulate gamete recognition before fertilization, though their mechanisms differ. Mouse sperm bind and cross the ZP at any site, while fish sperm cross the chorion through a funnel-shaped opening, the micropyle. To explore these divergent processes, we established cross-species insemination assays, mixing zebrafish eggs with mouse sperm. While mouse sperm could not bind to the chorion, a subpopulation successfully located and crossed the fish micropyle. Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that sperm entered the micropyle and accumulated in the zebrafish inter-chorion space. However, transgenic mouse sperm with mCherry-labeled acrosomes failed to undergo acrosome exocytosis efficiently in the micropyle, with both acrosome-intact and reacted sperm found in the inter-chorion space. Sperm entry and crossing were dependent on hyperactive motility, as sperm from <i>CatSperd<sup>Null</sup></i> mice, which fail to undergo hyperactivation, did not interact with or cross the micropyle. These findings suggest a conserved mechanism for sperm entry into the micropyle, providing a novel platform to investigate cross-species gamete interactions and uncover novel steps in fertilization.

                Effective mucosal immunity in the intestine involves a fine balance between tolerance of the microbiome, recognition, and elimination of pathogens, and inflammatory tissue injury. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 regulates these processes in the intestines of mice and humans; the anti-inflammatory activity of IL10 is also conserved in birds. To determine the function of IL10 in avian mucosal immunity, we generated germ line modifications of the chicken <i>IL10</i> locus to abolish or reduce IL10 expression. <i>In vitro</i> analysis of macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide confirmed the loss of IL10 protein expression, the lack of dosage compensation in heterozygotes, and prevention of autocrine inhibition of nitric oxide production in homozygous IL10 knockout macrophages. IL10-deficiency significantly altered the composition of the caecal microbiome, but unlike IL10-deficient mice and humans, IL10-deficient chickens did not exhibit spontaneous colitis. Following experimental challenge with <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium or <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> in IL10-deficient chickens, enhanced clearance of the pathogens was associated with elevated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells into gut mucosa. In IL10-deficient chickens challenged with the parasite <i>Eimeria tenella,</i> pathogen clearance was accelerated but caecal lesions were more severe and weight gain was compromised. Neither the heterozygous IL10 knockout nor a homozygous IL10 enhancer mutation had a major effect on pathogen clearance or inflammation in any of the challenge models. Our findings highlight the intrinsic compromise in mucosal immune response and have important implications for the development of strategies to combat avian and zoonotic pathogens in poultry.

">Evaluating oscillatory mechanisms underlying flexible neural communication in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                How the brain orchestrates the flow of information between its multiple functional units flexibly, quickly, and accurately, remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. Multiple theories identify neural oscillations as a likely basis for this process. However, a lack of empirical validation of proposed theories, particularly at the whole-brain scale, has hampered consensus on oscillatory principles governing neural communication, limiting our understanding of a process central to perception and cognition and its integration into experiments and clinical applications. Here, we empirically validate previously proposed neural-oscillatory communication mechanisms in the human brain - specifically those involving power and interareal phase coherence - at the whole-brain scale. We do this by estimating the dependence of inferred communication on oscillatory measures that have been theorised to facilitate communication, in source-localised resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. We find that power and phase coherence in the alpha, beta, and high-gamma bands track communication better than others. Crucially, the relation between communication and oscillatory measures varied across regions, indicating spatial heterogeneity in routing mechanisms. Notably, power and coherence-based principles tracked communication patterns of unimodal regions better than those of transmodal regions. In sum, these findings suggest that the human brain implements regionally specific communication mechanisms with complex neural-oscillatory dependence.

">Sleep after Motor Sequence Learning Enhances Post-Movement Parietal Beta Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                The neural substrates supporting the beneficial effect of sleep on motor memory consolidation are well described. However, less is known about the brain oscillatory dynamics underlying these processes. We characterized the oscillatory dynamics associated with motor sequence learning and their modulation by post-learning sleep using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in young healthy adults. After learning a motor sequence task while their brain activity was recorded with MEG, participants were distributed in two groups according to whether they slept or were totally sleep deprived during the first post-training night. Consolidation was assessed with a retest in the MEG three days after training. Behaviorally, performance improved over the consolidation interval irrespective of whether sleep was afforded during the first night. MEG results showed that initial motor sequence learning was characterized by a progressive decrease in beta Event Related Desynchronization (ERD, 18-25Hz) over bilateral motor areas. Interestingly, while these practice-related modulations of beta ERD were not influenced by the sleep status, post-learned-movement beta Event Related Synchronization (ERS) over bilateral parietal areas increased over the consolidation interval in the sleep, compared to the sleep deprived, group. These results extend current models of motor memory consolidation by identifying ERS as an oscillatory marker of sleep-dependent consolidation.

">Investigating the Contribution of Molecular-Enriched Functional Connectivity to Brain-Age Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Brain-age prediction from neuroimaging data provides a proxy of biological aging, yet most models rely on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a modality that captures macroanatomy but offers limited biological specificity. We tested whether integrating molecular-enriched functional connectivity (FC), from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data, improves brain-age prediction and biological explainability. We analyzed MRI data of 2,120 healthy adults (1,243/877 F/M; 18 -90 years) from three public datasets. Molecular-enriched connectivity maps were derived with Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) using receptor-density templates for the dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), and serotonin (SERT) transporter systems. Support vector regression models were applied to predict chronological age from molecular-enriched FC, structural morphometry, or both combined. The effect of multi-site variability was mitigated via ComBat harmonization with and without Empirical Bayes pooling. We additionally conducted a common-parcellation analysis to assess the impact of differing parcellations between modalities. Single-transporter molecular-enriched FC explained up to 51% of age variance. The most predictive transporter varied by dataset, with DAT dominating in the harmonized and common-parcellation settings. Combining the three molecular-enriched maps consistently improved prediction over any single map and increased explained variance up to 64%. In the merged multi-site cohort using a common parcellation, augmenting structural information with transporter-enriched FC reduced mean absolute error (MAE) from 6.02 to 5.81 years, supporting complementarity of the two modalities. In contrast, when different parcellations were applied, incorporating molecular-enriched FC into brain age prediction resulted in a 2% higher MAE compared to structural morphometry alone, suggesting that parcellation mismatch may obscure the functional contributions. In conclusion, molecular-enriched FC is a feasible and biologically informative extension to brain-age modeling, enhancing prediction and interpretability with respect to neurotransmitter systems.

">Fast Capture, Slow Shift: How Working Memory Guides Perception</a></h4>

              
                The top-down influence of working memory (WM) can manifest as attentional capture and a "tinted lens" that alters perceptual appearance. Yet it remains unclear whether these effects arise from a common mechanism or reflect functionally and mechanistically distinct processes. Across two experiments, we embedded a perceptual estimation task during WM maintenance. Hierarchical Bayesian mixture modeling revealed robust bidirectional attraction between memory and perception. More importantly, time-resolved analyses of mouse trajectories showed that attentional capture emerged as a fast, transient deviation linked to movement initiation, whereas perceptual bias reflected a slower, sustained shift shaping the final perceptual judgment. Notably, the prospective influence of WM on perception engaged both effects, whereas the retrospective influence of perception on WM involved only the sustained shift. These findings indicate that WM deploys distinct top-down signals that operate over different timescales to dynamically shape our perceptual experience.

">Activation of CP-AMPARs is required for homosynaptic and heterosynaptic structural LTP in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Long-term potentiation (LTP) involves alterations in synaptic structure that are believed to underlie the persistent increase in synaptic efficacy. Here we compared structural LTP (sLTP) in EGFP-labelled spines with functional LTP, using field potential recording, at CA3-CA1 synapses in mouse hippocampal slices for ~ 2 h following theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Activity-dependent labelling with FM4-64 allowed us to compare activated (FM+) and non-activated synapses and thereby compare homo- and hetero-synaptic sLTP. In addition, we related spine volume changes according to the probability of release, P(r), of activated synapses. At homosynaptic sites there was the expected NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent potentiation of spine volume that persisted throughout the recording period. We found that this sLTP also required the synaptic activation of CP-AMPARs. There was also sLTP at heterosynaptic sites that, surprisingly, developed more quickly than the associated homosynaptic sLTP. This heterosynaptic sLTP was also dependent on the synaptic activation of both NMDARs and CP-AMPARs. Additionally, we observed a trans- and hetero-synaptic interaction, whereby the heterosynaptic spines grew according to the P(r) of the neighbouring active (homosynaptic) synapse. These observations have therefore advanced our understanding of sLTP in several ways; the first demonstration of the absolute requirement for the synaptic activation of CP-AMPARs for sLTP; the magnitude of heterosynaptic sLTP relative to homosynaptic sLTP and the hitherto unexpected combination of trans- and hetero-synaptic interactions.

">Genome-wide CRISPR screen reveals Wnt signaling defects regulate lipid accumulation in APOE4 oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                APOE4 is the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but the cellular mechanisms by which APOE variants influence risk of disease remain incompletely understood. We have previously found that APOE4 expression led to the intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets in oligodendrocytes, causing decreased myelination. However, the mechanisms by which APOE4 alters lipid metabolism are not fully understood. Here, we leveraged a genome-wide CRISPR screen and ATAC-sequencing in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived oligodendrocytes to dissect APOE4's lipid-associated mechanisms of action. Using these approaches, we identified decreased Wnt signaling, and overactive GSK3b activity, as regulators of lipid droplet accumulation in oligodendrocytes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of GSK3b reduced lipid droplets in APOE4 oligodendrocytes, and increased myelination in three-dimensional iPSC-derived brain organoids. Finally, we show that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3b reduces lipid droplets and improves myelination in APOE4;PS19 Tau transgenic mice. Together, our results provide a framework for understanding the mediation of APOE4-related changes to oligodendrocyte lipid metabolism and myelination.

                Changes in neurotransmitter usage in homologous neurons may drive evolutionary adaptations in neural circuits across animal phylogeny. The predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus can be used as a model system to examine nervous system evolution by comparing neurotransmitter expression with that of C. elegans and other nematodes. Here we characterize P. pacificus neurotransmitter expression and function in specific neurons, focusing on its complete set of monoaminergic neurons. We discover patterns of conservation as well as novelties. We examine the roles of monoamines in specific behaviors using neurotransmitter synthesis and vesicular transporter mutants, finding possible differences in the control of host-finding and dispersal behavior.

">Autistic traits modulate neural responses to social signals during natural vision</a></h4>

              
                Impairments in social perception, a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are also evident at subclinical levels in the general population. However, it remains unclear how such variation in autistic traits modulate neural processing of different types of social information. Here, we investigated whether autistic traits in neurotypical individuals are associated with neural responses to a broad array of social perceptual features during viewing naturalistic stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also tested the generalizability of these effects across two experiments. Ninety-seven participants completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and watched a set of 96 movie clips and a full movie during an fMRI scan. Intensity of 126 social features in the movie stimuli was continuously annotated by independent observers, and 44 most reliably rated features were used to model neural responses. We examined how consistently the responses to each social feature were dependent on the participant's AQ scores. Replicable AQ-dependent neural responses to social features were found in both datasets. The temporal cortex and especially the superior temporal gyrus (STG), served as a central "hub" where autistic traits consistently modulated responses to social features across datasets. Different AQ subscales also revealed distinct association patterns in other brain regions. These findings indicate that autism-related traits broadly influence neural processing of naturalistic social signals, providing insight into how characteristics of autistic symptoms relate to socioemotional processing.

">Presynaptic Release Probability Determines the Need for Sleep</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is universal among animals with synapses, yet the synaptic functions determining the need for sleep remain elusive. By directly measuring synaptic transmission at anatomically defined synapses in Drosophila, we found that synaptic strength remained stable or declined after sleep deprivation in a circuit-specific manner. In contrast, presynaptic release probability (Pr) consistently decreased with sleep loss across circuits and species, stemming from reduced Ca2+ influx or weakened vesicle-channel coupling at presynaptic terminals, and recovered after sleep. Bidirectional manipulations of Pr altered sleep pressure, establishing a causal relationship between presynaptic function and sleep need. Non-synaptic sleep-regulatory signaling pathways consistently modulate Pr but not synaptic strength. Thus, our findings identify Pr, rather than synaptic strength, as the conserved synaptic substrate underlying sleep need.

">Hyperexcitability in Alzheimers Disease triggers a compensatoryneuroprotective response via TREK1</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers Disease (AD) is marked by early hippocampal and neocortical accumulation of amyloid-beta 42 oligomers, driving neuronal hyperactivity and synaptic dysfunction years before symptom onset. While two-pore domain leak potassium channels like TREK1 provide neuroprotection against hyperexcitability, their role in AD remains unknown. Here, we discover an activity-dependent upregulation of TREK1 in AD transgenic mice (3xTg and APP/PS1) and cultured hippocampal/cortical neurons, triggered by amyloid-beta 42 oligomers -induced hyperactivity. Mechanistically, we show that increased intracellular calcium activates adenylate cyclase 1/8 (AC1/8), initiating a cAMP-PKA signalling cascade that enhances the expression of chromatin regulator CTCF. This increased CTCF in turn enhances the expression of TREK1 both in vitro and in AD transgenic mice. Using calcium imaging, patch clamp electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry assays, we demonstrate that the upregulation of TREK1 serves as a critical brake on neuronal hyperexcitability and is essential for restoring synaptic balance and mitigating AD pathology. Our study identifies a multi-step signalling cascade triggered by amyloid-beta 42 oligomers leading to upregulation of TREK1 that functions as an essential compensatory mechanism for neuronal survival in early AD.

">Attention and Explicit Knowledge Drive Predictive Sharpening in Early Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Perception is increasingly understood as an inferential process, whereby what we perceive results from the integration of sensory inputs with expectations derived from prior knowledge. Top-down predictions have been shown to alter the encoding of sensory information, from early to late stages of processing. Yet, how such predictions shape neural representations in sensory cortices remains debated. Competing accounts suggest that predictions either sharpen neural representations by enhancing selectivity or dampen activity by broadly suppressing stimulus-driven responses. In a preregistered fMRI study, we tested whether these effects depend on the level of attentional engagement and explicit knowledge of predictive associations. Using a multisensory fMRI paradigm with concurrent but independent visual and auditory probabilistic associations (75% validity) and manipulated attention, we investigated predictive effects in human early visual cortex. Consistent with prior work, expected visual stimuli elicited reduced BOLD activity. Critically, sharpening of expected visual stimuli occurred exclusively when visual inputs were attended and the concurrently presented auditory inputs expected. In addition, the magnitude of the sharpening of visual representations correlated positively with participants' explicit knowledge of the visuo-predictive associations. These findings highlight the key roles of attention and explicit knowledge in promoting predictive sharpening and underscore the need to study predictive processing in more ecologically valid, multisensory contexts.

">The Spiking Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine: Emergent Spatial and Temporal Coding through Spiking Network Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal-entorhinal system supports spatial navigation and memory by orchestrating the interaction between grid cells and place cells. While various models have reproduced these patterns, many rely on predefined connectivity or fixed weights and lack mechanisms for learning or biologically realistic temporal dynamics. The Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine (TEM) has recently gained attention as a unified generative model that explains the emergence of both grid and place cells through learning. However, existing TEM implementations rely on rate-based units and simplified architectures, which limit their biological plausibility. Here, we introduce the Spiking Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine (Spiking TEM)--a spiking neural network model that extends the original TEM with spike-based computation and an anatomically inspired hippocampal-entorhinal architecture. Our model learns grid-like codes in the entorhinal module and context-specific place codes in the hippocampal module, while also exhibiting key temporal coding phenomena observed in electrophysiological recordings, including phase locking of spikes to theta oscillations and phase precession. Furthermore, the model gives rise to predictive grid cells in layer III of the entorhinal cortex, which prospectively encode upcoming spatial positions. These results demonstrate that structured spatial representations and temporally precise coding schemes can emerge from biologically plausible spike-based learning and dynamics, offering a unified framework for understanding spatial and temporal coding in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit.

">Longitudinal Assessment of Fluorescence Stability Shows Fluorescence Intensity Decreases Over Time: Implications for Fluorescence Microscopy Studies</a></h4>

              
                Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is one of the most widely used techniques across basic, translational, and clinical sciences. Key considerations need to be made to achieve reliable and robust IHC staining, however what has been understudied is the stability of IHC signal intensity over time. Changes in signal intensity over time have significant implications for data analysis and interpretation and ultimately impact scientific conclusions. In order to explore changes in IHC signal, the stability of fluorescence intensity was assessed over the course of six weeks using widefield or confocal microscopy. Results indicate that fluorescence intensity can decrease over this time course and that whether this decrease occurs and to what extent is influenced by the selection of the primary antibody as well as that of the secondary antibody, primary-secondary antibody combination, and utilization of chemical staining versus IHC staining. This investigation reinforces best practices for imaging fluorescent staining to ensure accurate and reliable data collection, be it for cell counting, assessing protein expression levels, or marker colocalization.

">Sustained alpha oscillations serve attentional prioritization in working memory, not maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Recent theory on the neural basis of working memory (WM) has attributed an important role to "activity-silent" mechanisms, suggesting that sustained neural activity might not be essential in the retention of information. This idea has been challenged by reports of ongoing neural activity in the alpha band during WM maintenance, however. The precise role of these alpha oscillations is unclear: Do they reflect attentional prioritization of stored information, or do they serve as a general maintenance mechanism, for instance to periodically refresh synaptic traces? To address this, we designed a visual WM task involving two memory items, one of which was prioritized for recall. The task included both a short (1 s) and a long (3 s) delay intervals between encoding and retrieval. The long delay was implemented to provide a more decisive test of WM maintenance, providing a point in time when any initially silent synaptic traces would likely need to be refreshed as well. Time-resolved decoding analyses revealed that both prioritized and deprioritized items were initially decodable following stimulus presentation. However, only the prioritized item exhibited sustained decodability throughout the delay, particularly in the long delay condition, where it transitioned into a stable coding scheme. This prolonged representation was selectively supported by induced alpha power, which reliably tracked the prioritized item, but not the deprioritized one. Impulse-based decoding further confirmed this asymmetry, highlighting a selective reactivation of the deprioritized item only upon contextual relevance. Together, these findings suggest that sustained alpha-band activity reflects attentional prioritization, rather than general memory maintenance. Unattended, non-prioritized items appear to transition into an activity-silent state, consistent with models of synaptic storage in WM.

">Brain-Wide Subnetworks within and between Naturally Socializing Typical and Autism Model Mice</a></h4>

              
                Social interaction is inherently asymmetric, requiring coordinated activity between non-homologous brain regions across individuals. However, the brain-wide dynamics underlying such inter-brain coordination remain poorly understood. We used multi-fiber photometry to simultaneously record from 24 brain regions in pairs of freely interacting mice, including a model of autism. Social interactions evoked widespread, dynamic activity across brains, with inter-brain synchrony, especially between non-homologous areas, exceeding intra-brain synchrony, particularly in dominant mice. Network analysis revealed three subnetworks: (1) Emotional, intra-brain enhanced in subordinates; (2) Sensory, spanning both mice; (3) Decision/consolidation, linking dominant prefrontal cortex to subordinate hippocampus. These subnetworks encoded dominance, identity, and interaction roles, and followed a clear temporal sequence around social events. In an autism model, socially evoked activity was hyperactive displaying mostly within brain synchrony but lacked inter-brain synchrony. Our results uncover dynamic inter-brain circuits as a hallmark of social behavior and reveal their disruption in autism.

">KF/parabrachial complex PACAP - glutamate pathway to the extended amygdala couples rapid autonomic and delayed endocrine responses to acute hypotension</a></h4>

              
                The calyx of Held is a giant axo-somatic synapse classically confined to the auditory brainstem. We recently identified morphologically similar calyx-like terminals in the extended amygdala (EA) that arise from the ventrolateral parabrachial complex and co-express PACAP, CGRP, VAChT, VGluT1, and VGluT2, targeting PKCdelta+/GluD1+ EA neurons. Here we asked whether this parabrachial - EA pathway participates in compensation during acute hypotension. In rats given hydralazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), we quantified Fos protein during an early phase (60 min) and a late phase (120 min). Early after hypotension, Fos surged in a discrete subpopulation of the parabrachial Kolliker - Fuse (KF) region and in the EA, whereas magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (SON/PVN) remained largely silent. By 120 min, magnocellular SON/PVN neurons were robustly Fos-positive. Confocal immunohistochemistry showed that most Fos+ PKCdelta/GluD1 EA neurons were encircled by PACAP+ perisomatic terminals (80.8%), of which the majority co-expressed VGluT1 (88.1%). RNAscope in situ hybridization further identified a selective KF population co-expressing Adcyap1 (PACAP) and Slc17a7 (VGluT1) that became Fos-positive during the early phase. Together these data indicate that a KFPACAP/VGluT1 projection forms calyceal terminals around PKCdelta/GluD1 EA neurons, providing a high-fidelity route for rapid autonomic rebound to falling blood pressure, while slower endocrine support is subsequently recruited via vasopressinergic magnocellular activation. This work links multimodal parabrachial output to temporally layered autonomic - neuroendocrine control.

">Time-Dependent Facilitation of Homologous Actions</a></h4>

              
                Unimanual actions can interfere with or facilitate similar actions performed with the opposite hand, especially when in close temporal proximity. Across three sequential button-press experiments, we tested how effector homology - anatomical similarity between fingers - and temporal delays between actions shape these effects. Specifically, we examined whether a priming action altered the reaction time (RT) of a subsequent action. Compared with unimanual RTs, we indexed slowing of the RT from the second action as interference, and quickening as facilitation. Priming with homologous actions (e.g., index finger-index finger) produced interference at short intervals ([&le;] 200ms) but transitioned to facilitation at longer intervals ([&ge;] 400ms). Priming with non-homologous actions (e.g., little finger-index finger) also produced interference at short intervals, but never resulted in facilitation. Critically, these patterns emerged whether the priming actions were performed with the opposite or the same hand, indicating that interference and facilitation do not depend on interhemispheric dynamics. Our results reveal a previously undocumented time-dependent shift from interference to facilitation that is specific to homologous actions, challenging models that explain the interference between parallel actions solely by competitive interhemispheric dynamics or central bottleneck processes. We propose that facilitation and interference flexibly coexist, and are shaped by effector homology and timing. These findings extend current models of bimanual coordination and highlight new opportunities for enhancing motor performance and neurorehabilitation.

">Cingulate-centered flexible control: physiologic correlates and enhancement by internal capsule stimulation</a></h4>

              
                The flexible deployment of cognitive control is essential for adaptive functioning in dynamic environments given limited cognitive resources. That flexibility depends on rapid detection and resolution of control-prediction errors (CPEs) when current demands diverge from the control plan. Deficits in control and control flexibility are common in psychiatric disorders, yet targeted interventions are limited by incomplete circuit-level understanding and limited means for modulating control circuits . We analyzed two intracranial electroencephalography datasets (one with brief internal capsule stimulation, ICS) to identify a human neurocomputational mechanism for CPE resolution and to test its modifiability. A third dataset of patients receiving internal capsule deep brain stimulation (IC DBS) assessed clinical relevance of modifying CPE-related processes. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) anchored to the {theta} phase of right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC-R), especially {theta}- coupling between rACC-R and nodes of the cognitive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC; dorsal ACC, dACC), was associated with faster CPE resolution. An adaptive drift-diffusion model indicated that ICS improves control flexibility specifically under high CPE, and mediation analyses showed that this behavioral improvement is mediated by CPE-dependent increases in rACC-R {theta}-centered PAC. In a psychiatric cohort (N=14; primarily treatment-resistant depression, TRD) with IC DBS, enhanced control flexibility, rather than CPE-independent general cognitive control, was strongly associated with clinical response (AUC = 0.90), suggesting both a behavioral flexibility index and rACC-R PAC as candidate biomarkers for DBS optimization. These findings identify a rACC-centered, {theta} phase-based coordination of the cognitive control network as a neurocomputational substrate of flexible control. They demonstrate that capsule stimulation selectively augments this substrate when flexibility is required, and establish flexibility, rather than general control, as the feature that tracks therapeutic benefit in TRD. Together, they suggest actionable biomarkers to guide, personalize, and potentially enable closed-loop neuromodulation for disorders marked by cognitive rigidity.

">Increased attentive use leads to more idiosyncratic functional connections</a></h4>

              
                Experience is thought to modify neural connections to adapt the network to be more optimal for the environment. Given the brains complexity, multiple network changes could each move the system toward optimality. Standard methods ignore this multiplicity and examine each connection independently; these studies have often shown considerable inter-individual variability and modest effects (1). Here, we take a different strategy, determining how a whole-brain connection pattern differs from the typical pattern, that is, how idiosyncratic the pattern is. We examined how the idiosyncrasy of whole brain connection patterns varies with frequency of the use of that part of cortex for attention-demanding tasks, focusing on central versus peripheral vision in healthy individuals (where individuals use central vision more frequently for attention-demanding tasks). We found that the whole-brain pattern of functional connections to the cortical representations of central vision is idiosyncratic, whereas patterns of connections to representations of peripheral vision were very similar person-to-person. In a second set of analyses, we examined the brains of people with central vision loss who use a portion of peripheral vision (called the preferred retinal locus) more frequently for attention-demanding tasks in their daily lives. The cortical representation of the preferred retinal locus exhibits more idiosyncratic connections, compared to a control brain region, or compared to the same brain region in matched control participants with healthy vision. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased attentive use of a brain area results in idiosyncratic patterns of whole brain connections.

                Mutation in paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) is used as the diagnostic marker of Haddad syndrome (HS). The mutant gene/protein afflict neural crest cells during embryonic development which leads to congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Previous studies on HS and CCHS have mainly focused on the conformational dynamics of the mutant protein and have remained controversial. Here we performed RNA-sequencing on the patient derived neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs), pertinent to the neurodevelopmental phenotype in HS, and found that the PHOX2B-PARM has a profound impact on the transcriptional profile of the cells. The single copy of PHOX2B-PARM in heterozygote cells were leading to >10 fold differentially expressed genes. In the patient cells there was a significant enrichment of genes related to neuronal development and synapse organization mainly driven by L1CAM interactions and synaptogenesis signaling pathway. Our result not only highlight the use of a suitable model of HS but also provide a clear path for future experimental validation and downstream targets with potential therapeutic values.

">Establishment of spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 model mice accompanied by early glial activation and degeneration of cerebellar neurons</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 34 (SCA34) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by progressive cerebellar atrophy and ataxia, frequently accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and erythrokeratodermia variabilis. In 2014, missense mutations in the gene encoding elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4) were identified as the causative gene for SCA34. ELOVL4, which is involved in the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, ELOVL4 is highly expressed in the cerebellum compared to other brain regions, with predominant expression in neurons. We attempted to establish a mouse model of SCA34 by expressing mutant ELOVL4 in cerebellar neurons using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and to elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Expression of W246G mutant ELOVL4 successfully induced progressive motor dysfunction beginning at two weeks post-AAV vector injection. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells and neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) paralleled the observed motor decline. Importantly, microglial activation was detected in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortices and the DCN prior to the onset of both neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction. Furthermore, after the onset of motor symptoms, the SCA34 model mice exhibited decreased synaptic inputs from climbing fibers to Purkinje cells, as well as reduce inputs from Purkinje cells to DCN neurons. These findings suggest that early microglial activation and the resulting synaptic disturbance are critical preceding events that lead to the progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction observed in this SCA34 mouse model.

Here we present a comprehensive spatially-resolved proteome atlas of the human brain, analyzing over two thousand MRI-guided locations across four individuals. Proteome analysis integrated with transcriptomics reveals extensive post-transcriptional regulation, with cortical regions showing markedly higher protein diversity than transcript. Unsupervised molecular clustering defines distinct brain territories that transcend anatomical boundaries, instead reflecting metabolic demands and functional specialization patterns. Application to epilepsy brain tissue uncovered disrupted astrocyte metabolism, protein homeostasis and therapeutic targets including the seizure-associated purinergic receptor P2RX7.

">Cardiac activity impacts spinal cord excitability. A Call to Return to the Roots</a></h4>

              
                The heart continuously shapes neural processing and behavior through cardiac-brain interactions. While cortical excitability fluctuations and their role in cardiac-dependent cognitive and sensorimotor phenomena have been extensively studied, the temporal dynamics and contribution of spinal excitability oscillations across the cardiac cycle remain poorly characterized. In this study, we examine whether motor evoked potentials elicited by magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord are modulated by the cardiac cycle phase in healthy participants. Real-time adapting ECG-triggered stimulation enabled precise targeting of five phases across the cardiac cycle. Spinal excitability was significantly phase-dependent, with MEPs peaking during late diastole. MEPs amplitude was also found to be modulated by preceding cardiac intervals, where shorter intervals predict stronger diastolic facilitation. These findings establish that spinal excitability is rhythmically modulated by the cardiac cycle, potentially through blood pressure-mediated mechanisms. Notably, the diastolic facilitation observed here contrasts with previously reported motor cortex excitability profiles, indicating a non-synchronous cardiac modulation of spinal versus cortical excitability. These results may benefit neuromodulation approaches for motor and psychiatric disorder treatment and emphasize the critical importance of including spinal measures in future heart-brain interaction studies.

">Multimodal lesion mapping in affective blindsight reveals dual amygdala and superior temporal sulcus contributions to nonconscious emotion processing</a></h4>

              
                Affective blindsight, the capacity to discriminate emotional stimuli despite bilateral damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) and without conscious awareness, offers a unique model of non-conscious visual processing. Subcortical pathways involving the pulvinar and amygdala have been proposed, but putative cortical contributions remain unclear. We examined 182 patients, including 31 with bilateral V1 lesions. Among these, 15 had cortical visual loss and 7 showed affective blindsight. Using behavioral testing, lesion symptom mapping, and tractography, we found that preserved pulvinar connectivity with both the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the amygdala is necessary for affective blindsight. These findings provide causal evidence for a multi-route architecture, identifying the pulvinar-STS pathway, alongside the pulvinar-amygdala pathway, as a critical substrate for non-conscious affective processing.

">Perceiving surface colour requires attention</a></h4>

              
                Colour constancy refers to our ability to distinguish changes in surface properties from changes in the properties of light illuminating the scene. The apparent ease with which we can tell that objects do not change colour, for example, when moving from sunlight to the shade, belies the complexity of solving this ill-constrained problem. Although there is a substantial body of work testing which image cues might be used to accomplish this, there is surprisingly little known of how the brain performs this computation. Here, we tested a fundamental aspect of this perceptual process: whether it requires attention. We measured visual search times for both surface colour (requiring separation of surface and illuminant properties) and 'raw', colorimetric colour (which does not). We found a clear difference between the two: visual search for colorimetric colour was fast and near-parallel, while search for surface colour was slow and consistent with the serial deployment of attention. That is, search times suggest that the perceptual separation of surface and illuminant properties in colour constancy may require an attention-based process analogous to perceiving conjunctions of simple features in 'feature binding'. Colour discrimination thresholds suggested that while colorimetric colour detection is fast and parallel, once attention was directed to these stimuli and perceptual scission occurs, colorimetric colour information was discarded by the visual system. These results offer important new insights into the sequence of processes the brain uses to accomplish colour constancy.

">Resting-state functional MRI derivatives: A dataset derived from the The Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia Study</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) holds promise for the detection and characterisation of dementia. The Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) Study, by the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA), provides a unique resource to study deeply phenotyped neurodegenerative conditions. We present RSFC derivatives for 784 participants (data release 7 of the cohort) who were either cognitively unimpaired or diagnosed primarily with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mixed dementia (AD with a vascular component), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular MCI, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease with or without MCI or dementia, Lewy body disease or subjective cognitive impairment. Functional MRI scans were preprocessed using fMRIPrep, and time-series and whole-brain connectomes generated using three atlases at multiple resolutions, denoised using seven different techniques. High-motion artifacts were managed using a liberal quality control threshold appropriate for an older clinical population, resulting in data from 680 participants. These derivatives are made available to the research community to accelerate research on RSFC biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease, reducing duplication of effort, saving computational resources, and improving standardisation across studies.

                <p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons project to both cortex and thalamus, inducing multiple effects including the modulation of cortical and thalamic firing, and the emergence of high gamma oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP). We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations driven by L6CT neuron activation reflect the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice (both male and female) expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway in awake, head-fixed mice, we presented ramp-and-hold light at different intensities while recording neural activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) of the thalamus using silicon probes. We found that the activation of S1 L6CT neurons induces high-frequency LFP oscillations in S1 that are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across light intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the temporal evolution of firing rate in S1 and VPm. While most S1 neurons were steadily suppressed, VPm and S1 layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to facilitated within 500&nbsp;ms, suggesting differential recruitment of the intracortical versus cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we found that LFP frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons sculpt the frequency of S1 LFP oscillations through cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, linking the recurrent interactions mediated by L6CT neurons to the high gamma oscillations observed across physiological and pathological conditions.</p>

                <p>Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB<SUB>1</SUB> cannabinoid receptors (CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. Here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal CB<SUB>1</SUB>R downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. Transient loss of CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs as induced by in-utero small-interference RNA electroporation at Embryonic Day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. Whole-cell current&ndash;clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer&ndash;native pyramidal neurons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), identified by microarray characterization of FACS-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. The gene expression profile of siCB<SUB>1</SUB>R-derived neurons showed DEGs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. Venn diagrams unveiled one common DEG for neuropsychiatric risk databases and CB<SUB>1</SUB>R expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor ZBTB20. Prenatal knockdown of CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in siCB<SUB>1</SUB>R-derived adult mice. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability.</p>

                <p>Vocal communication is a complex social behavior that entails the integration of auditory perception and vocal production. Both anatomical and functional evidence have implicated the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), including area 32, in these processes, but the dynamics of neural responses in area 32 during naturalistic vocal interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this by recording the activity of single area 32 neurons using chronically implanted ultrahigh-density Neuropixels probes in freely moving male common marmosets (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) engaged in an antiphonal calling paradigm in which they exchanged long-distance "phee" calls with a virtual conspecific. We found that many neurons exhibited complex modulations in discharge rates in response to presented calls, prior to and following self-generated calls, and during the interval between presented and produced vocalizations. These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of area 32 as an audiovocal interface integrating auditory information, cognitive processes, and motor outputs in the service of vocal communication.</p>

                <p>Zinc is crucial for neuron function, but whether and how labile zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) acts as an intracellular signaling molecule remains unclear. In this work, we investigate the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> dynamics using fluorescence imaging. Our findings reveal that manipulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through various pathways induces intracellular acidification, which subsequently elicits Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes that reflect transient increases in cytosolic Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes have been recorded in both rat (<I>Rattus norvegicus</I>) primary neuron cultures and organotypic mouse (<I>Mus musculus</I>) hippocampal slice cultures prepared from both males and females. They are specific to neurons and astrocytes but are absent in other cell types we tested including HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and fibroblasts. We further identify Metallothionein III (MT3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup> buffering protein specifically expressed in brain cells, as the source of these Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Reduction in MT3 expression by knockdown with shRNAmiR techniques significantly decreases the amplitude of Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, while overexpression of MT3 in HeLa and COS-7 cells is sufficient to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes, demonstrating the crucial roles of MT3 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> release. Lastly, we explore the biological roles of MT3-mediated Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurons. Suppressing Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes with either MT3 knockdown or mild Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation results in increased dendritic branching in primary rat hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from endogenous MT3 acts as a regulatory signal to inhibit dendrite branching and growth, establishing a critical role for Zn<sup>2+</sup> spikes in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development.</p>

                <p>Addiction, particularly opioid use disorder (OUD), is often characterized by heightened propensity for risk-taking. While tolerance for risk and uncertainty varies across individuals, the elevated risk-taking in people with OUD is assumed to stem from altered cognitive decision-making processes beyond differences due to idiosyncratic yet lawful tolerances. Specifically, the prevailing assumption is that people with addiction exhibit impairments in the internal representation and integration of information that should guide decisions and judgments about what is valuable. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the choice behavior of treatment-engaged male and female participants with chronic OUD aligns with the neural encoding of their inferred subjective value (SV) of uncertain (risky and ambiguous) rewards and the evidence for impairment in this neural process. Using both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that canonical value regions [ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and posterior cingulate cortex] track the SV of uncertain choice options in both participants with OUD and comparison controls, irrespective of their tolerance for uncertainty. This speaks against a fundamentally impaired subjective valuation process in OUD. However, value representations were less reliably decodable in people with OUD in some value regions (vmPFC) and throughout the brain, especially within the limbic and salience/ventral-attention networks. Thus, while people with OUD engage a neurocomputationally similar process during risky decision-making to controls, they may differ in the fidelity and distribution of SV signals across brain networks.</p>

                <p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>

                <p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>

                <p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>

                <p>Neonatal injury alters synaptic transmission in the spinal superficial dorsal horn (SDH), resulting in aberrant amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission. Astrocytes orchestrate synapse development and function across the CNS and play a critical role in the emergence and maintenance of persistent pain. However, little is currently known about the postnatal development of spinal astrocytes, nor about how the maturation of SDH astrocytes is impacted by early life injury. Here, we used a hindpaw incision model of postsurgical pain in postnatal day (P) 3 mice of both sexes to elucidate the effects of neonatal injury on the maturation of SDH astrocytes. Three-dimensional morphological analysis of individual astrocytes revealed that incision elicits age-dependent changes to astrocyte structure. At P4, spinal astrocytes in incised mice show increased size and complexity compared with naive controls. This is reversed at P10 and P24, as astrocytes from incised mice are smaller and less ramified compared with their naive counterparts. Transcriptomic analysis of spinal astrocytes revealed acute changes to gene expression after neonatal injury, as 76 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at P4 (such as <I>Thbs1</I>, <I>Efemp1</I>, <I>Acta1</I>, <I>Acta2</I>, <I>Tpm2</I>, and <I>Fgf14</I>), which included genes related to cell motility and cytoskeletal organization, but very few DEGs were detected at P10 and P24. Lastly, we identified that microglial engulfment of astrocyte material occurs in the developing dorsal horn and this process is altered by neonatal incision in a sex-dependent manner. These data illustrate, for the first time, that neonatal injury alters the postnatal development of spinal astrocytes.</p>

                <p>Although phasic alertness generally benefits cognitive performance, it often increases the impact of distracting information, resulting in impaired decision-making and cognitive control. However, it is unclear why phasic alertness has these negative effects. Here, we present a novel, biologically informed account, according to which phasic alertness generates a transient, evidence-independent input (TEI) to the decision process. This shortens overall response times but also amplifies competition between evidence accumulators, thus slowing down decision-making and impairing cognitive control. The key hypotheses of this account are supported with pupil measurements and electrophysiological data from human decision-makers of either sex performing an arrow flanker task. We also show that a computational model of the flanker task that incorporates a TEI can reproduce the behavioral effects of phasic alertness but only when the evidence accumulators compete with each other through lateral inhibition. Our results reveal a close interplay between dynamic changes in alertness, cognitive control, and evidence accumulation.</p>

                <p>Learning to detect and recognize a broad range of visual objects is a crucial developmental task during the first year of life. However, many of the neurophysiological changes underlying the emergence of this cognitive ability remain poorly understood. The current study tested the hypothesis that training infants to recognize novel objects leads to selectively enhanced visuocortical responses and a competitive advantage that prioritizes the processing of trained relative to untrained objects. A cross-sectional sample of parent&ndash;infant dyads at 6, 9, and 12&nbsp;months of age read books in which novel objects were associated with different types of labels. The next day, EEG was recorded while infants (<I>N</I> = 51, 24 females and 26 males, 1 unknown) were concurrently presented with trained objects (i.e., from the book) and untrained objects (i.e., novel objects not in the book). Trained and untrained objects flickered at distinct frequencies (5&nbsp;Hz, 6&nbsp;Hz) to evoke frequency-tagged steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs). Analyses of the visuocortical response showed training-related competition effects that increased with age. Specifically, responses to trained stimuli increased while responses to untrained stimuli decreased with age. At 6&nbsp;months, infants showed no visuocortical bias for trained objects, but by 9 and 12&nbsp;months, visuocortical responses favored trained objects. This pattern suggests that competitive neural interactions between trained and untrained stimuli may support the development of object recognition and that experience with objects guides attentional prioritization in the infant brain.</p>

                <p>Despite the functional specialization in visual cortex, there is growing evidence that the processing of chromatic and spatial visual features is intertwined. While past studies focused on visual field biases in retina and behavior, large-scale dependencies between coding of color and retinotopic space are largely unexplored in the cortex. Using a sample of male and female volunteers, we asked whether spatial color biases are shared across different human observers and whether they are idiosyncratic for distinct areas. We tested this by predicting the color a person was seeing using a linear classifier that has never been trained on chromatic responses from that same brain, solely by taking into account: (1) the chromatic responses in other individuals&rsquo; brains and (2) commonalities between the spatial coding in brains used for training and the test brain. We were able to predict the color (and luminance) of stimuli seen by an observer based on other subjects&rsquo; activity patterns in areas V1&ndash;V3, hV4, and LO1. In addition, we found that different colors elicited systematic, large-scale retinotopic biases that were idiosyncratic for distinct areas and common across brains. The area-specific spatial color codes and their conservation across individuals suggest functional or evolutionary organization pressures that remain to be elucidated.</p>

                <p>The association between brain structural connectivity (BSC) and different subtypes of stroke has not been reported. The current study determined whether some BSC patterns may contribute to the risk of stroke. A two-sample, bidirectional, multivariate Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed. Genome-wide association summary statistics for BSC were obtained from the GWAS Catalog at the European Bioinformatics Institute, while stroke outcome data were obtained from the FinnGen study for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and from the MEGASTROKE Consortium for ischemic stroke (IS) and its subtypes. A colocalization analysis was performed to determine whether the association between BSC and stroke was driven by loci within genomic regions. Reverse MR was performed to evaluate potential stroke-induced changes in BSC. Among the significant findings, left hemisphere (LH) somatomotor network-to-LH salience/ventral attention network white matter (WM) structural connectivity (SC) [OR = 1.30; <I>p</I> = 5.96 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;4</sup>; <I>p</I> value after Bonferroni&rsquo;s correction [<I>p.bfr</I>] = 0.0125] and right hemisphere (RH) dorsal attention network (DAN)-to-thalamus WM-SC (OR = 1.23; <I>p</I> = 1.60 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>; <I>p.bfr</I> = 0.0125) were shown to have a positive association with the risk of IS. RH DAN-to-amygdala WM-SC (OR = 0.78; <I>p</I> = 1.26 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>; <I>p.bfr</I> = 0.0125) showed a negative relationship with the risk of IS. A high LH somatomotor network-to-RH visual network WM-SC (OR = 1.62; <I>p</I> = 9.10 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>; <I>p.bfr</I> = 0.025) was associated with an increased risk of large atherosclerotic stroke. In conclusion, the results of the current study provided some evidence from the perspective of genetics that different BSCs may have close associations with ICH, IS, and stroke subtypes. These findings may facilitate the screening and the risk stratification for stroke patients.</p>

                <p>Previous studies emphasize the importance of prestimulus neural oscillations in shaping endogenous brain states that substantially impact perceptual outcomes. However, what features in such oscillations drive perception remains unknown. Furthermore, research has shown that non-oscillatory activity is also important for cognitive processing. However, their interaction prior to perceiving a multisensory stimulus remains unexplored. In this human EEG study (<I>n</I> = 18, 10 males and 8 females), we investigated the role of prestimulus periodic power and aperiodic activity in modulating perception of the widely studied McGurk illusion on a trial-by-trial basis. Using logistic mixed-effects models, we reveal that the illusion perception is associated with reduced prestimulus alpha (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) and beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power over frontal and occipital regions; increased theta (4&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz) power in parietal, central, and occipital regions; and increased gamma (31&ndash;45&nbsp;Hz) power across the scalp. Furthermore, lower aperiodic offset and exponent values in central, parietal, and occipital regions also predicted illusory responses. Our logistic mixed interaction models revealed that the aperiodic exponent and periodic power jointly influence the perception of upcoming McGurk stimuli. Specifically, a decrease in occipital theta and global beta power and an increase in occipital and parietal gamma power were associated with a steeper slope. We conclude that the predominant source of variations in the prestimulus state is the aperiodic activity and that fluctuations in both periodic and aperiodic activity account for inter-trial variability in the perception of the McGurk illusion.</p>

                Background Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by tumors in the parathyroid, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior pituitary. This study discusses two distinct clinical cases to illustrate the diverse manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for MEN 1. Methods A case-based approach was employed to examine the clinical presentation, biochemical findings, imaging results, and therapeutic interventions in two patients with MEN 1. Relevant literature was reviewed to contextualize the findings. Results Case 1 involved a 47-year-old female presenting with hyperparathyroidism and a gastrinoma, managed conservatively due to comorbid chronic kidney disease. Case 2 featured a 26-year-old female with aggressive manifestations, including severe osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, and a pancreatic tail lesion, necessitating prompt surgical intervention. Both cases highlighted the utility of advanced imaging (Tc99 MIBI scans, MRI) and biochemical markers (serum calcium, iPTH, chromogranin A) in diagnosis and management. Genetic testing was emphasized as a key component of family screening and long-term surveillance. Discussion MEN 1 requires a multidisciplinary approach due to its multisystemic nature. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions, including parathyroidectomy and medical therapies like cinacalcet and somatostatin analogs, are critical to optimizing outcomes. The variability in clinical presentations underscores the need for personalized management plans. Conclusion The diverse spectrum of MEN 1 demands vigilant surveillance and a collaborative healthcare approach. Advances in diagnostics and targeted treatments continue to improve patient outcomes, but long-term management and genetic counseling remain pivotal.

                Obesity remains a global health problem, and bariatric surgery is considered the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. However, postoperative complications such as anastomotic stenosis or inflammation of the anastomosis can occur. This report describes a case of early anastomositis on the first postoperative day after a one-anastomosis gastric bypass in a 38-year-old patient with morbid obesity and metabolic comorbidities. Conservative management, including hormonal, antibacterial, and supportive therapy, led to resolution of symptoms without the need for endoscopic balloon dilation or revision surgery. Follow-up showed complete recovery with no dysphagia or reflux, and weight loss was achieved by the third postoperative month. This case demonstrates the potential effectiveness of non-surgical therapy in managing early postoperative anastomositis.

                Obesity and metabolic syndrome remain major global health challenges, with bariatric surgery being the most effective treatment in cases of severe obesity. Despite satisfactory outcomes, conventional one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is often complicated by weight regain, gastroesophageal reflux, and dumping syndrome. To address these issues, we developed a modified approach—FundoRing OAGB—which employs the patient’s own gastric fundus to create an autologous restrictive wrap, thereby enhancing weight control and reducing reflux without the risks associated with synthetic gastric band. This single-center, randomized controlled trial enrolled 1000 patients with body mass index (BMI) 30–50 kg/m2, allocated into two groups: the experimental group underwent OAGB with the FundoRing modification and hiatal repair when indicated, while the control group underwent standard OAGB. Patients will be followed for up to 60 months. Primary outcomes include changes in BMI, remission of comorbidities, and quality of life improvement. Secondary endpoints assess reflux parameters, gastric pouch dilation, intraoperative perfusion imaging, and cost-effectiveness. The FundoRing technique offers a physiologic, autologous alternative to conventional banding methods, aiming to strengthen the restrictive effect of OAGB while minimizing complications. Results from this large-scale trial are expected to clarify the role of FundoRing OAGB in optimizing long-term bariatric and metabolic outcomes.

<p>NO-synthesizing neurons, soluble guanylate cyclase, and catecholaminergic inputs converge in the pigeon nidopallium caudolaterale, suggesting a substrate for nitric oxide–dopamine interactions in memory flexibility.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a diffusible neuromodulator that acts as a retrograde messenger in vertebrates, regulating synaptic plasticity and interacting with dopaminergic systems. Despite its established functions in mammals, little is known about the anatomical distribution and potential roles of NO in birds. Using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques, we mapped NO-synthesizing neurons—identified by NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)—and analyzed their relationship with soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic pathways in the pigeon brain. We found NADPH-d labeling throughout forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions. Within dopaminergic midbrain structures, the locus coeruleus showed strong colocalization with nNOS, and moderate overlap was observed in the ventral tegmental area, substantia grisea centralis, and substantia nigra. In the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), a prefrontal-like associative area, sGC-positive neurons were contacted by both TH- and NADPH-d–positive fibers. Our results highlight an anatomical link between NO and dopaminergic pathways in pigeons, suggesting that mechanisms of memory flexibility known from other species may also operate in birds. In particular, our findings support the potential for NO–dopamine interactions in avian species, reminiscent of recently described mechanisms in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. In this invertebrate model, a subset of dopaminergic neurons was shown to co-release NO, targeting sGC-expressing neurons to modulate memory flexibility, a circuit-level organization not yet described in vertebrates</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1004/v4?src=rss">Case Report: A Case Report: Chickenpox Acquired Through Surface Contamination: A Rare Clincal Observation [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 3 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Chickenpox is an extremely contagious disease caused by a primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. This case report describes a rare transmission of chickenpox potentially linked to an indirect route via surface contamination rather than direct person-to-person contact. A 27-year-old adult Black African male health care worker presented with severe headache, intermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, shortness of breath, itching, pruritus, lesions with pus on the skin, sleep disturbances, and nightmares for two days. In this case report, the patient’s face, neck, and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body, and the rest of the body, except the legs, hands, genital areas, and buttocks, was also highly infected. Chickenpox was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), positive IgM, viral culture, and low IgG. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five times a day, was given for ten days to treat chickenpox infection because acyclovir inhibits varicella zoster virus replication. It is typically unable to eradicate VZV from the latent state in neurons. The patient showed marked improvement within a week and fully recovered without complications or post-herpetic sequelae. This case emphasizes the importance of strict infection control and hygiene protocols in preventing rare indirect transmission of the VZV, particularly in healthcare settings.

A bibliometric study from 1988 to 2024 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                1) Introduction Cognitive enhancers, or nootropics, are agents that aim to improve cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive processing. This bibliometric study investigates the scientific landscape surrounding Ginkgo biloba as a cognitive enhancer, using data retrieved from the Scopus database and analyzed via Biblioshiny and VOSviewer. This bibliometric study analyzes literature from Scopus to identify key trends, influential authors, and research gaps, providing guidance for future research. 2) Methods This study employs a literature review methodology to gather data from the Scopus database on Neuroaid, analyzing it using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software. The focus was on Ginkgo Biloba as a niche-theme cognitive enhancer agent based on Scopus data, using both quantitative and qualitative analyses. 3) Results and discussion Ginkgo biloba, the ‘maidenhair tree’ from the order Ginkgoales, appeared 290 million years ago. Chinese and Japanese culture has been cultivated for thousands of years. This tree is valued for its resilience and therapeutic properties, often used in traditional medicine for respiratory and blood circulation issues. 4) Conclusions This bibliometric analysis reveals that Ginkgo biloba remains a focal point in cognitive enhancer research, with increasing scholarly attention over the past decade. Despite its historical and cultural significance, the literature shows fragmented research clusters and limited clinical consensus. The study highlights the need for standardized methodologies, stronger interdisciplinary collaboration, and more rigorous clinical trials to validate Ginkgo biloba’s cognitive benefits. These findings provide a roadmap for future research and underscore the importance of bridging traditional knowledge with modern scientific inquiry. This study was conducted in December 2024.

                This case report describes an exceedingly rare complication of endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) surgery. We reported a delayed remote combined supratentorial intracerebral and subdural haemorrhage following the resection of a tuberculum sella meningioma. This report aims to analyse the pathophysiology and discuss the management of this critical complication, which is seldom documented in the literature. We present the case of a 54-year-old female with a WHO Grade I tuberculum sella meningioma. She underwent a complete (Simpson Grade I) resection via an endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Her initial postoperative recovery was unremarkable for four days. On the fifth postoperative day, the patient experienced an acute decline in consciousness. An emergency non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a remote left parietal intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) of approximately 20cc, associated with an acute left frontoparietal subdural haematoma (SDH), causing a significant midline shift. Despite the severity of the radiological findings, the patient was managed successfully with non-operative medical therapy. She made a full clinical recovery, and a three-month follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed complete resolution of the haematomas with no evidence of residual tumour or underlying vascular malformation. The clinical timeline and radiological pattern strongly suggest a venous aetiology. The most plausible mechanism is a cascade initiated by an occult cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, leading to intracranial hypotension, cerebral ptosis, and the subsequent rupture of a cortical bridging vein. This case underscores the need for a high index of suspicion for remote intracranial haemorrhage (RIH) in any patient with delayed neurological deterioration after transsphenoidal surgery. Furthermore, it demonstrates that this life-threatening complication can often be managed successfully with conservative therapy.

                Background Phacoemulsification is one of the most frequent surgeries in the world. However, prolonged use of phacoemulsification machines produces reactive oxygen species which will damage corneal endothelial cells. Ascorbic acid has an antioxidant capacity to neutralize oxidative stress in the anterior chamber. This study will investigate the protective effect of ascorbic acid on corneal endothelial cells in patients with hard nuclear cataracts. Methods This study is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Samples will be divided into three groups, and 500 mg of vitamin C, tid, or placebo will be received for seven weeks. Clinical characteristics, ascorbic acid, malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant capacity of patients in serum and aqueous humor will be measured before and after intervention and phacoemulsification. Conclusions Data from this study will reveal the protective effect of oral vitamin C supplementation on the corneal endothelial cells in patients with hard nucleus cataracts. This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT06781970; registered on 17 January 2025).

                The role of posture in spinal pain is unclear which might be linked to characteristics of postural outcome measures. This systematic scoping review mapped the clinical utility of postural outcome tools for spinal pain. Following Joanna Briggs Institute framework, twelve bibliographic databases were searched until 8th August 2023. Article selection, characterisation/mapping and synthesis using qualitative content analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. Clinical utility was defined by psychometric and clinimetric criteria including construct validity, predictive validity, intra and inter rater reliability, sensitivity to change, ease of use, sensibility, format, and alignment with the biopsychosocial pain model. 85 eligible studies were identified from 89 publications. Twenty-eight distinct postural outcome tools plus bespoke measures were identified. Most tools were sophisticated computer-based electronic devices or complex time-consuming questionnaires, with limited applicability in non-occupational settings. Clinical utility domains most achieved were construct validity and inter/intra-rater reliability. Alignment with the biopsychosocial pain model, sensitivity to clinical change, and predictive validity were the least achieved. Tools had limited clinical utility and were based on postural-structural-biomechanical pain model.

                <p>by Damon J. A. Toth, Karim Khader, Christopher Mitchell, Matthew H. Samore</p>

Some infections may be sustained in the human population by persistent transmission among patients in healthcare facilities, including patients colonized with multi-drug-resistant organisms posing a major health threat. A nuanced understanding of facility characteristics that contribute to crossing a threshold for self-sustaining outbreak potential may be crucial to designing efficient interventions for lowering regional disease burden and preventing high-risk infections. Using a mathematical model, we define the facility basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, where a single facility can sustain an outbreak without ongoing importation under the threshold condition <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> > 1. We define <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> for a general model with heterogeneous patient susceptibility and transmissibility and with generic length-of-stay assumptions, and we provide a software package for numerical calculation of user-defined examples. We estimate <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> using published data for carbapenemase–producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in long-term acute-care hospitals (LTACHs) and the effects of interventions on <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, including surveillance, pathogen reduction treatments, and length-of-stay reduction. In a simple model, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is directly proportional to the sum of the mean and variance-to-mean ratio of the length-of-stay distribution. In intervention models, <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> depends on the moment-generating function of the length-of-stay distribution. From the CPE data, we estimated <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.45) prior to intervention. Weekly surveillance with 50% transmission reduction of detected patients alone could have reduced <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> to 0.85 (0.72, 0.98), with additional reduction if detected patients could be decolonized. Reducing the mean length of stay does not necessarily reduce <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> if the variance-to-mean ratio is not also reduced. We conclude that <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> > 1 conditions plausibly exist in LTACHs, where CPE outbreaks could be sustained by patients who acquire colonization and subsequently transmit to other patients during the same hospital stay. Our findings illuminate epidemiological mechanisms producing those conditions and their relationship to interventions that could efficiently improve population health.

                <p>by Haitao Li, Long Zheng, Lei Li, Yiwei Chen, Junjie Li, Chunhou Zheng, Yansen Su</p>

Cancer drug combination therapies offer a promising strategy to overcome resistance and improve treatment efficacy, but identifying synergistic drug pairs is challenging due to complex biological interactions and tumor heterogeneity. Current machine learning algorithms for drug synergy prediction primarily rely on large-scale, multimodal datasets, yet suffer from critical limitations including poor interpretability, difficulty distinguishing causative biological relationships from correlations, and inadequate modeling of cancer-specific molecular interactions. To address these challenges, we propose CASynergy (Causal Attention and Cross-attention Synergy), a novel deep learning model for predicting cancer drug synergy that addresses limitations of prior approaches in accuracy and interpretability. CASynergy introduces a causal attention mechanism to distinguish true causal genomic features from spurious correlations, cell line-specific gene network construction to capture the unique molecular context of each cancer cell line, and a cross-attention module to integrate drug molecular features with cell line gene expression profiles. These improvements allow CASynergy to clearly identify significant drug-gene interactions and provides interpretable insights into why a combination is predicted to be synergistic. Experiments on two benchmark datasets (DrugCombDB and Oncology-Screen) suggests that CASynergy outperformed five state-of-the-art models. CASynergy offers a better and more reliable way to predict effective drug combinations. It works well across different cancer types and is easier to understand, which is important for personalized cancer treatment and finding new drugs.

                <p>by Pradeep Eranti, Megha Hegde, Syed Muktadir Al Sium, R. Gonzalo Parra, Alastair M. Kilpatrick, Sayane Shome, Farzana Rahman</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic led to devastating physical, psychological, and financial impacts on millions of people across the world. Amidst a rapidly evolving research landscape, the global scientific community was forced to swiftly adapt to novel working methods, including remote collaboration tools, virtual conferences, and online research platforms. Surveys of life sciences researchers have indicated that computational biologists experienced less disruption and a smoother transition to remote working than experimental biologists, due to their reduced reliance on laboratory equipment. Despite this adaptability, the sudden shift to remote work, compounded by stress and social isolation, has posed significant mental health challenges for these workers. However, remote work has also facilitated opportunities for more flexible work arrangements and increased collaboration across geographical boundaries. To investigate these impacts, we conducted surveys of computational biologists during the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conferences in 2020 and 2021, which were held virtually due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. This study implements a thorough statistical analysis of the survey results to offer insights into the repercussions of the lockdowns on researchers and their work. Key areas of investigation include the effects of institutional support (or lack thereof), the difference in productivity compared to pre-lockdown levels, and the significance of gender in determining these impacts. Notably, a lack of institutional support with regard to mental health and finances was shown to have a significant negative effect on early-career researchers. Although limited by a small sample size, our study sets the stage for a more robust exploration of these trends in future research. Importantly, by illuminating the challenges and opportunities arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, our study offers hope for potential solutions supporting the well-being of early-career researchers in unprecedented circumstances.

Multiplexed imaging allows multiple cell types to be simultaneously visualised in a single tissue sample, generating unprecedented amounts of spatially-resolved, biological data. In topological data analysis, persistent homology provides multiscale descriptors of “shape" suitable for the analysis of such spatial data. Here we propose a novel visualisation of persistent homology (PH) and fine-tune vectorisations thereof (exploring the effect of different weightings for persistence images, a prominent vectorisation of PH). These approaches offer new biological interpretations and promising avenues for improving the analysis of complex spatial biological data especially in multiple cell type data. To illustrate our methods, we apply them to a lung data set from fatal cases of COVID-19 and a data set from lupus murine spleen.

Understanding tissue morphogenesis is an important goal in developmental biology and tissue engineering. Accurately describing tissue deformation processes and how cell rearrangements contribute to these is a challenging task. Live analysis of morphogenesis in 3D is frequently used to obtain source data that allow to extract such features from developing organs. However, several limitations are encountered when applying these methodologies to mammalian embryos. The mouse embryo is the most frequently used model, but most studies use a very limited number of specimens and present only individual acquisitions due to constraints imposed by embryo culture and imaging. Here, we leverage live imaging of mouse heart development to build a novel computational framework that overcomes these limitations. Our methodology first extracts tissue dynamics from individual specimens and then integrates these fragmented datasets into a deterministic and dynamic consensus model of heart development. This integrated model allows us to quantify patterns of tissue growth and anisotropy and generate an in-silico fate map of cardiomyocyte trajectories. This work provides a foundational toolkit for dissecting the complex morphogenetic processes underlying mammalian organogenesis, converting collections of variable live images into robust, quantitative blueprints of development.

                <p>by Mogan Gim, Jaewoo Kang, Donghyeon Park, Minji Jeon</p>

CYP450 isoenzymes are known to be deeply involved in the formation of drug-food interactions (DFI). Previously introduced computational approaches for predicting DFIs do not take drug-CYP450 interactions (DCI) into account and have limited generalizability in handling compounds unseen during model training. We introduce ArcDFI, a model that utilizes attention regularization guided by CYP450 interactions to predict drug-food interactions. Experiments on DFI prediction—evaluated under stringent cold-drug and cold-food settings—show that our model outperforms ten baseline approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating CYP450 interactions. Analysis of its attention mechanism provides insight into its current understanding of DCI and how they are related to its DFI predictions. To the best of our knowledge, ArcDFI is the first DFI prediction model that incorporates the concept of DCI, resulting in improved predictive generalizability and model explainability. ArcDFI is available at https://github.com/KU-MedAI/ArcDFI.

                <p>by Thomas Badet, Daniel Croll</p>

Fungal genome sizes exhibit more than a 100-fold variation, largely driven by the expansion of repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs). Silencing mechanisms targeting TEs at the epigenetic or transcript level have independently evolved in many lineages. In fungi, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) targets TEs by recognizing repetitive sequences and inducing mutagenesis. However, the prevalence of RIP across the fungal kingdom and the fidelity of the canonical C-to-T mutation signatures remain unclear. In this study, we address these gaps by tracking shifts in genome architecture across the fungal kingdom. We find that a striking approximately 30-fold increase in genome size within a clade of leotiomycetes is associated with the absence of several RIP-related genes, suggesting a relaxation of genome defense mechanisms during this expansion. To track the impact of genome defenses, we designed a quantitative screen for RIP-like mutation signatures. The phylum of ascomycetes was unique in showing enrichment in mutation signatures in non-coding and repetitive sequences, consistent with a phylogenetically restricted occurrence of RIP-like genome defense systems. Then, we performed a phylogeny-aware association study to identify gene functions associated with RIP-like mutation signatures. We identified a zinc-finger protein as the strongest candidate underpinning a novel mechanism of genome defenses. Our findings reveal the multifaceted drivers of genome defense systems and their close ties to genome size evolution in fungi, particularly in lineages with evidence for recent RIP activity, highlighting how proximate molecular mechanisms can shape genome evolution on deep phylogenetic scales.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70043?af=R">β‐Adrenergic Receptor Activation Modulates the Induction of Complex Spike‐Dependent LTP by Regulating Multiple Forms of Heterosynaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Norepinephrine, acting through β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs), has a key role in hippocampus-dependent forms of learning. Although β-AR activation also facilitates the induction of Hebbian LTP, recent findings indicate that a non-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity, known as behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), underlies hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. To explore the role of noradrenergic signaling in BTSP, I investigated the effects of the β-AR activation on complex spike (CS) burst-dependent LTP, a form of BTSP induced by theta-pulse stimulation (TPS) protocols in the CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices. β-AR activation not only enhanced the homosynaptic potentiation of synaptic transmission induced by TPS but also modulated heterosynaptic forms of plasticity critical for CS burst-dependent LTP induction. Specifically, β-AR activation enhanced the heterosynaptic facilitation of CS bursting induced by brief TPS trains and facilitated the ability of synapses to interact in a cooperative fashion to undergo LTP, even when independent groups of synapses were activated up to 10 s apart. β-AR activation also enhanced a CS burst-dependent form of heterosynaptic depression elicited by longer trains of TPS, resulting in a winner-take-all form of synaptic competition where the β-AR-mediated facilitation of LTP induction at one group of synapses was associated with a strong, heterosynaptic suppression of LTP at other synapses. Together, these findings indicate that β-AR activation dynamically regulates fundamental properties of CS burst-dependent synaptic plasticity by modulating multiple forms of heterosynaptic plasticity.</p>
