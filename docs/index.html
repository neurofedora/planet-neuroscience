              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05476">Attachment: a predictive coding approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel predictive coding framework for studying attachment theory. Building off an established model of attachment, the dynamic-maturational model (DMM), as well as the neuroanatomical Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model of interoception and emotion, we not only elucidate how neural processes can shape attachment strategies, but also explore how early attachment experiences can shape those processes in the first place. Returning to John Bowlby's original vision for attachment theory, our framework is based on four simple, empirically-supported principles that can easily be interpreted with predictive coding.
  We apply our framework to further our understanding of the attachment strategies in the DMM. Specifically, we propose that the type A strategies (analogous to "avoidant" or "dismissive" attachment) involve the suppression of interoceptive prediction errors as an adaptive response to maltreatment, relieving stress in the short-term at the cost of interoceptive awareness in the long-term. Furthermore, we propose that type C strategies (analogous to "ambivalent/resistant" or "preoccupied" attachment) involve the suppression of exteroceptive prediction errors to reflect the unreliability of external cues, motivating the obsessive seeking of information through increased vigilance and histrionic displays of affect. Finally, we explore the implications of our proposals, making several novel hypotheses that could have implications for the treatment of attachment-related psychopathology.

                arXiv:2505.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores foundational questions about the relationship of qualia to natural selection. The primary result is a derivation of specific formal conditions under which structural systems subject to natural selection can convey consistent effects in an associated qualitative domain, placing theoretical and empirical constraints on theories of consciousness. In order to achieve this result, information-theoretic measures are developed to quantify the mutual determinability between structure and quality, quantifying fidelity between the two domains. The fidelities represented by that space are then incorporated into the Price Equation to yield key bounds on the transmission of selective effects between domains. Finally, transmission of higher-order structures between domains is explored. Placement within a broader philosophical context can be found in the companion paper Structure & Quality.

                arXiv:2505.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the hard problem of consciousness from a different perspective. Instead of drawing distinctions between the physical and the mental, an exploration of a more foundational relationship is examined: the relationship between structure and quality.
  Information-theoretic measures are developed to quantify the mutual determinability between structure and quality, including a novel Q-S space for analyzing fidelity between the two domains. This novel space naturally points toward a five-fold categorization of possible relationships between structural and qualitative properties, illustrating each through conceptual and formal models.
  The ontological implications of each category are examined, shedding light on debates around functionalism, emergentism, idealism, panpsychism, and neutral monism.
  This new line of inquiry has established a framework for deriving theoretical constraints on qualitative systems undergoing evolution that is explored in my companion paper, Qualia & Natural Selection.

Abstract: This paper introduces a biomathematical model designed to describe the internal dynamics of dream formation and spontaneous cognitive processes. The model incorporates neurocognitive factors such as dissatisfaction, acceptance, forgetting, and mental activity, each of which is linked to established neural systems. We formulate a system of differential equations to simulate interactions among these variables and validate the model using simulated neural data. Our results demonstrate biologically plausible cognitive patterns consistent with findings from EEG and fMRI studies, particularly related to the default mode network (DMN), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and hippocampal memory mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05497">The cognitive triple-slit experiment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cognition has made it possible to model human cognitive processes very effectively, revealing numerous parallels between the properties of conceptual entities tested by the human mind and those of microscopic entities tested by measurement apparatuses. The success of quantum cognition has also made it possible to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the conceptuality interpretation, which ascribes to quantum entities a conceptual nature similar to that of human concepts. The present work fits into these lines of research by analyzing a cognitive version of single, double, and triple-slit experiments. The data clearly show the formation of the typical interference fringes between the slits as well as the embryos of secondary fringes. Our analysis also shows that while quantum entities and human concepts may share a same conceptual nature, the way they manifest it in specific contexts can be quite different. This is also evident from the significant deviation from zero observed for the Sorkin parameter, indicating the presence of strong irreducible third-order interference contributions in human decision.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05515">Nature's Insight: A Novel Framework and Comprehensive Analysis of Agentic Reasoning Through the Lens of Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous AI is no longer a hard-to-reach concept, it enables the agents to move beyond executing tasks to independently addressing complex problems, adapting to change while handling the uncertainty of the environment. However, what makes the agents truly autonomous? It is agentic reasoning, that is crucial for foundation models to develop symbolic logic, statistical correlations, or large-scale pattern recognition to process information, draw inferences, and make decisions. However, it remains unclear why and how existing agentic reasoning approaches work, in comparison to biological reasoning, which instead is deeply rooted in neural mechanisms involving hierarchical cognition, multimodal integration, and dynamic interactions. In this work, we propose a novel neuroscience-inspired framework for agentic reasoning. Grounded in three neuroscience-based definitions and supported by mathematical and biological foundations, we propose a unified framework modeling reasoning from perception to action, encompassing four core types, perceptual, dimensional, logical, and interactive, inspired by distinct functional roles observed in the human brain. We apply this framework to systematically classify and analyze existing AI reasoning methods, evaluating their theoretical foundations, computational designs, and practical limitations. We also explore its implications for building more generalizable, cognitively aligned agents in physical and virtual environments. Finally, building on our framework, we outline future directions and propose new neural-inspired reasoning methods, analogous to chain-of-thought prompting. By bridging cognitive neuroscience and AI, this work offers a theoretical foundation and practical roadmap for advancing agentic reasoning in intelligent systems.

                arXiv:2505.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circadian rhythm plays a crucial role in regulating biological processes, and its disruption is linked to various health issues. Identifying small molecules that influence the circadian period is essential for developing targeted therapies. This study explores the use of evolutionary optimization techniques to enhance the classification of these molecules. We applied an evolutionary algorithm to optimize feature selection and classification performance. Several machine learning classifiers were employed, and performance was evaluated using accuracy and generalization ability. The findings demonstrate that the proposed evolutionary optimization method improves classification accuracy and reduces overfitting compared to baseline models. Additionally, the use of variance in accuracy as a penalty factor may enhance the model's reliability for real-world applications. Our study confirms that evolutionary optimization is an effective strategy for classifying small molecules regulating the circadian rhythm. The proposed approach not only improves predictive performance but also ensures a more robust model.

                arXiv:2505.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve business efficiency and minimize costs, Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners have adopted a shift from formulating models from scratch towards sharing pretrained models. The pretrained models are then aggregated into a global model with higher generalization capabilities, which is afterwards distributed to the client devices. This approach is known as federated learning and inherently utilizes different techniques to select the candidate client models averaged to obtain the global model. This approach, in the case of communication systems, faces challenges arising from the existential diversity in device profiles. The multiplicity in profiles motivates our conceptual assessment of a metaheuristic algorithm (FedAvgen), which relates each pretrained model with its weight space as metadata, to a phenotype and genotype, respectively. This parent-child genetic evolution characterizes the global averaging step in federated learning. We then compare the results of our approach to two widely adopted baseline federated learning algorithms like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD).

                arXiv:2505.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processes of evidence accumulation for motor control contribute to the ecological validity of driver models. According to established theories of cognition, drivers make control adjustments when a process of accumulation of perceptual inputs reaches a decision boundary. Unfortunately, there is not a standard way for building such models, limiting their use. Current implementations are hand-crafted, lack adaptability, and rely on inefficient optimization techniques that do not scale well with large datasets. This paper introduces Akkumula, an evidence accumulation modelling framework built using deep learning techniques to leverage established coding libraries, gradient optimization, and large batch training. The core of the library is based on Spiking Neural Networks, whose operation mimic the evidence accumulation process in the biological brain. The model was tested on data collected during a test-track experiment. Results are promising. The model fits well the time course of vehicle control (brake, accelerate, steering) based on vehicle sensor data. The perceptual inputs are extracted by a dedicated neural network, increasing the context-awareness of the model in dynamic scenarios. Akkumula integrates with existing machine learning architectures, benefits from continuous advancements in deep learning, efficiently processes large datasets, adapts to diverse driving scenarios, and maintains a degree of transparency in its core mechanisms.

                arXiv:2505.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation (INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies for replacing batch normalization.

Abstract: This study aims to analyze the economic performance of various parks under different conditions, particularly focusing on the operational costs and power load balancing before and after the deployment of energy storage systems. Firstly, the economic performance of the parks without energy storage was analyzed using a random forest model. Taking Park A as an example, it was found that the cost had the greatest correlation with electricity purchase, followed by photovoltaic output, indicating that solar and wind power output are key factors affecting economic performance. Subsequently, the operation of the parks after the configuration of a 50kW/100kWh energy storage system was simulated, and the total cost and operation strategy of the energy storage system were calculated. The results showed that after the deployment of energy storage, the amount of wind and solar power curtailment in each park decreased, and the operational costs were reduced. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the energy storage configuration of each park. The energy storage operation strategy was optimized through fitness functions, crossover operations, and mutation operations. After optimization, the economic indicators of Parks A, B, and C all improved. The research results indicate that by optimizing energy storage configuration, each park can reduce costs, enhance economic benefits, and achieve sustainable development of the power system.

Abstract: Initialization profoundly affects evolutionary algorithm (EA) efficacy by dictating search trajectories and convergence. This study introduces a hybrid initialization strategy combining empty-space search algorithm (ESA) and opposition-based learning (OBL). OBL initially generates a diverse population, subsequently augmented by ESA, which identifies under-explored regions. This synergy enhances population diversity, accelerates convergence, and improves EA performance on complex, high-dimensional optimization problems.

                arXiv:2505.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiobjective feature selection seeks to determine the most discriminative feature subset by simultaneously optimizing two conflicting objectives: minimizing the number of selected features and the classification error rate. The goal is to enhance the model's predictive performance and computational efficiency. However, feature redundancy and interdependence in high-dimensional data present considerable obstacles to the search efficiency of optimization algorithms and the quality of the resulting solutions. To tackle these issues, we propose a high-dimensional feature selection algorithm based on multiobjective differential evolution. First, a population initialization strategy is designed by integrating feature weights and redundancy indices, where the population is divided into four subpopulations to improve the diversity and uniformity of the initial population. Then, a multiobjective selection mechanism is developed, in which feature weights guide the mutation process. The solution quality is further enhanced through nondominated sorting, with preference given to solutions with lower classification error, effectively balancing global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, an adaptive grid mechanism is applied in the objective space to identify densely populated regions and detect duplicated solutions. Experimental results on 11 UCI datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art multiobjective feature selection approaches regarding feature selection performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating both natural language and code, but LLM reasoning is prone to hallucination and struggle with complex, novel scenarios, often getting stuck on partial or incorrect solutions. However, the inherent ability of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore extensive and complex search spaces makes them particularly effective in scenarios where traditional optimization methodologies may falter. However, EAs explore a vast search space when applied to complex problems.
  To address the computational bottleneck of evaluating large populations, particularly crucial for complex evolutionary tasks, we introduce a highly efficient evaluation framework. This implementation maintains compatibility with existing primitive definitions, ensuring the generation of valid individuals.
  Using LLMs, we propose an enhanced evolutionary search strategy that enables a more focused exploration of expansive solution spaces. LLMs facilitate the generation of superior candidate solutions, as evidenced by empirical results demonstrating their efficacy in producing improved outcomes.

                arXiv:2505.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in spiking neural networks (SNNs) in numerous tasks, their architectures remain highly similar to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), restricting their ability to mimic natural connections between biological neurons. This paper develops a new modeling paradigm for SNN with random graph architecture (RGA), termed Cognition-aware SNN (CogniSNN). Furthermore, we improve the expandability and neuroplasticity of CogniSNN by introducing a modified spiking residual neural node (ResNode) to counteract network degradation in deeper graph pathways, as well as a critical path-based algorithm that enables CogniSNN to perform continual learning on new tasks leveraging the features of the data and the RGA learned in the old task. Experiments show that CogniSNN with re-designed ResNode performs outstandingly in neuromorphic datasets with fewer parameters, achieving 95.5% precision in the DVS-Gesture dataset with only 5 timesteps. The critical path-based approach decreases 3% to 5% forgetting while maintaining expected performance in learning new tasks that are similar to or distinct from the old ones. This study showcases the potential of RGA-based SNN and paves a new path for biologically inspired networks based on graph theory.

Abstract: The neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) approach has shown great potential for solving routing problems without the requirement of expert knowledge. However, existing constructive NCO methods cannot directly solve large-scale instances, which significantly limits their application prospects. To address these crucial shortcomings, this work proposes a novel Instance-Conditioned Adaptation Model (ICAM) for better large-scale generalization of neural combinatorial optimization. In particular, we design a powerful yet lightweight instance-conditioned adaptation module for the NCO model to generate better solutions for instances across different scales. In addition, we develop an efficient three-stage reinforcement learning-based training scheme that enables the model to learn cross-scale features without any labeled optimal solution. Experimental results show that our proposed method is capable of obtaining excellent results with a very fast inference time in solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs) across different scales. To the best of our knowledge, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance among all RL-based constructive methods for TSP and CVRP with up to 1,000 nodes.

Abstract: Constructive neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has attracted growing research attention due to its ability to solve complex routing problems without relying on handcrafted rules. However, existing NCO methods face significant challenges in generalizing to large-scale problems due to high computational complexity and inefficient capture of structural patterns. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning-based search space reduction method that adaptively selects a small set of promising candidate nodes at each step of the constructive NCO process. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed heuristics, our selection model dynamically prioritizes nodes based on learned patterns, significantly reducing the search space while maintaining solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained solely on 100-node instances from uniform distribution, generalizes remarkably well to large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) instances with up to 1 million nodes from the uniform distribution and over 80K nodes from other distributions.

Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, it suffers from low scalability and numerical imprecision. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability. We formulate the problem, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence properties, great potential, and possible new research directions to improve the method in a simulated proof-of-concept.

                arXiv:2505.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly pushing the limits of contemporary computing hardware. For example, training GPT-3 has been estimated to consume around 1300 MWh of electricity, and projections suggest future models may require city-scale (gigawatt) power budgets. These demands motivate exploration of computing paradigms beyond conventional von Neumann architectures. This review surveys emerging photonic hardware optimized for next-generation generative AI computing. We discuss integrated photonic neural network architectures (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, lasers, wavelength-multiplexed microring resonators) that perform ultrafast matrix operations. We also examine promising alternative neuromorphic devices, including spiking neural network circuits and hybrid spintronic-photonic synapses, which combine memory and processing. The integration of two-dimensional materials (graphene, TMDCs) into silicon photonic platforms is reviewed for tunable modulators and on-chip synaptic elements. Transformer-based LLM architectures (self-attention and feed-forward layers) are analyzed in this context, identifying strategies and challenges for mapping dynamic matrix multiplications onto these novel hardware substrates. We then dissect the mechanisms of mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and LLaMA, highlighting their architectural similarities and differences. We synthesize state-of-the-art components, algorithms, and integration methods, highlighting key advances and open issues in scaling such systems to mega-sized LLM models. We find that photonic computing systems could potentially surpass electronic processors by orders of magnitude in throughput and energy efficiency, but require breakthroughs in memory, especially for long-context windows and long token sequences, and in storage of ultra-large datasets.

Abstract: We study two models of ReLU neural networks: monotone networks (ReLU$^+$) and input convex neural networks (ICNN). Our focus is on expressivity, mostly in terms of depth, and we prove the following lower bounds. For the maximum function MAX$_n$ computing the maximum of $n$ real numbers, we show that ReLU$^+$ networks cannot compute MAX$_n$, or even approximate it. We prove a sharp $n$ lower bound on the ICNN depth complexity of MAX$_n$. We also prove depth separations between ReLU networks and ICNNs; for every $k$, there is a depth-2 ReLU network of size $O(k^2)$ that cannot be simulated by a depth-$k$ ICNN. The proofs are based on deep connections between neural networks and polyhedral geometry, and also use isoperimetric properties of triangulations.

MERGE$^3$ achieves this by Extracting a reduced dataset for evaluation, Estimating model abilities using Item Response Theory (IRT), and Evolving optimal merges via IRT-based performance estimators. Our method enables state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual merging, transferring knowledge across languages with significantly lower computational overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees and an open-source library, democratizing high-quality model merging.

Abstract: The brain prepares for learning even before interacting with the environment, by refining and optimizing its structures through spontaneous neural activity that resembles random noise. However, the mechanism of such a process has yet to be thoroughly understood, and it is unclear whether this process can benefit the algorithm of machine learning. Here, we study this issue using a neural network with a feedback alignment algorithm, demonstrating that pretraining neural networks with random noise increases the learning efficiency as well as generalization abilities without weight transport. First, we found that random noise training modifies forward weights to match backward synaptic feedback, which is necessary for teaching errors by feedback alignment. As a result, a network with pre-aligned weights learns notably faster than a network without random noise training, even reaching a convergence speed comparable to that of a backpropagation algorithm. Sequential training with both random noise and data brings weights closer to synaptic feedback than training solely with data, enabling more precise credit assignment and faster learning. We also found that each readout probability approaches the chance level and that the effective dimensionality of weights decreases in a network pretrained with random noise. This pre-regularization allows the network to learn simple solutions of a low rank, reducing the generalization loss during subsequent training. This also enables the network robustly to generalize a novel, out-of-distribution dataset. Lastly, we confirmed that random noise pretraining reduces the amount of meta-loss, enhancing the network ability to adapt to various tasks. Overall, our results suggest that random noise training with feedback alignment offers a straightforward yet effective method of pretraining that facilitates quick and reliable learning without weight transport.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in a decentralized manner while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. This survey examines recent advancements in FL-driven LLMs, with a particular emphasis on architectural designs, performance optimization, and security concerns, including the emerging area of machine unlearning. In this context, machine unlearning refers to the systematic removal of specific data contributions from trained models to comply with privacy regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten. We review a range of strategies enabling unlearning in federated LLMs, including perturbation-based methods, model decomposition, and incremental retraining, while evaluating their trade-offs in terms of efficiency, privacy guarantees, and model utility. Through selected case studies and empirical evaluations, we analyze how these methods perform in practical FL scenarios. This survey identifies critical research directions toward developing secure, adaptable, and high-performing federated LLM systems for real-world deployment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375">Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.05375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.

">Profiling metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 expression in Rett syndrome: consequences for pharmacotherapy</a></h4>

              
                We have reported that levels of metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu7) are dramatically decreased in brain samples from Rett syndrome patients carrying truncation mutations in the Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Additionally, we identified decreases in mGlu7 levels in Mecp2+/- female mice and demonstrated that administration of a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) with activity at mGlu7 corrected deficits in cognitive, social, and respiratory domains. Here, we expanded our studies to a larger cohort of RTT samples covering a range of mutations and evaluated expression of the three widely expressed group III mGlu receptors (mGlu4,7 and 8). We found significant decreases in mGlu7, but not mGlu4 or mGlu8, mRNA expression across this larger cohort; additionally, we identified a previously unknown and robust correlation in the expression of mGlu4 and mGlu8 in control individuals. Stratification of RTT patients into individuals with mutations that are clinically correlated with severe versus mild disease revealed statistically significant decreases in mGlu7 expression only in patients with mutations that induce more severe symptoms. We then administered the PAM VU0422288 to mice modeling the mild R306C mutation (Mecp2R306C/+) and found a significant reduction in apneas induced by VU0422888 administration despite no decreases in mGlu7 expression in the brainstem or cortex. These results provide the first evidence of potentially broad utility for mGlu7 PAMs in reducing apneas in RTT patients.

">BetaII-Spectrin Gaps and Patches Emerge from the Patterned Assembly of the Actin/Spectrin Membrane Skeleton in Human Motor Neuron Axons</a></h4>

              
                The membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), composed of F-actin and spectrin, is a cytoskeletal structure that supports axonal integrity and organization. Using high-resolution imaging, we characterized the spatial distribution and assembly dynamics of {beta}II-spectrin in human motor neuron (MN) axons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered a striking gap-and-patch pattern in the medial axon, where sharply demarcated {beta}II-spectrin gaps alternate with patches containing a well-organized MPS. These gaps lack periodic F-actin and II-spectrin and do not reflect axonal degeneration or spectrin cleavage. The pattern increases with culture time and is acutely induced by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization prevents patch formation, indicating a requirement for actin nucleation in MPS assembly. Our data supports a model in which spectrin incorporation into nascent MPS patches depletes neighboring regions, producing periodic interruptions. This study provides the first detailed nanoscale analysis of MPS organization in human MNs, offering new insights into cytoskeletal remodeling in axons and its potential relevance to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Key words: iPSCs, MPS, actin, spectrin, cytoskeleton, motor neurons, staurosporine.

">Predicting cochlear synaptopathy in mice with varying degrees of outer hair cell dysfunction using auditory evoked potentials</a></h4>

              
                Human temporal bones suggest a steady decline of cochlear synapses with age and greater synapse loss in adults with a history of military or occupational noise exposure. However, there is currently no validated method of diagnosing this type of cochlear deafferentation in living humans. Animal models indicate that cochlear synaptopathy is associated with reduced auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave 1 amplitude and envelope following response (EFR) magnitude for a sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tone. However, translating the SAM EFR to humans is complicated because it is difficult to obtain this measurement in humans using the same modulation frequency that showed the strongest relationship with synaptopathy in mice (1000 Hz). Computational modeling suggests that EFR magnitude measured with a rectangular amplitude modulated (RAM) tone may be a more sensitive measure of synaptopathy than the SAM EFR. In addition, because synaptopathy likely co-occurs with outer hair cell dysfunction, a diagnostic assay for synaptopathy needs to be robust even when auditory thresholds are abnormal. This study compared the relative ability of the ABR, SAM EFR, and RAM EFR to predict synapse numbers in mice with a large range of auditory thresholds and degrees of synaptopathy. The results indicate that the RAM EFR modulated at 1000 Hz is the single best predictor of synapse number when there is a broad loss of synapses across frequency, while combining RAM EFR and ABR further improves synapse prediction. In contrast, focal synaptopathy is best predicted by ABR wave 1 amplitude.

">Brain-derived synaptic vesicles have an intrinsic ability to sequester tubulin</a></h4>

              
                The presence and function of microtubules within the synaptic bouton has long been under investigation. In recent years evidence has accumulated that connects the synaptic vesicle cluster to the local dynamics of microtubule ends. Nonetheless, one question remains open, namely whether the vesicles influence the availability of tubulin within the synaptic compartment. An analysis of previously published live imaging experiments indicates that tubulin is strongly enriched in the synaptic vesicle cluster. To analyze the vesicle-tubulin interaction directly, we isolated vesicles from the mouse brain and imaged them together with fluorescent tubulin in vitro. We found that soluble tubulin is collected by synaptic vesicles in physiological buffers, resulting in the formation of tubulin-rich regions (TRRs) on the respective vesicle clusters. We conclude that the synaptic vesicle cluster is indeed able to recruit soluble tubulin.

">Atlas-independent brain connectome analysis at voxel-level granularity: graph convolutional networks for etiology classification in newborns</a></h4>

              
                Early identification of altered brain networks in neonates at risk for neurodevelopmental impairments is critical for timely intervention and improving outcomes. This study explores the potential of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) applied to structural brain connectomes at the voxel level granularity to classify neonatal connectomes by their underlying etiology: 51 children with congenital heart disease (CHD), 100 children born very preterm (PB), and 43 children with spina bifida aperta (SBA). Leveraging the flexibility of voxel-level parcellation, we captured fine-grained connectomic differences that improved classification performance (F1 = 0.78) compared to both atlas-based methods (F1 = 0.62) and a multilayer perceptron baseline model (F1 = 0.69). This approach enables subject-specific parcellation without the need for predefined anatomical templates, facilitating the analysis of diverse brain morphologies and age ranges. Attribution analysis using integrated gradients provided interpretable insights into etiology-specific connectomic patterns, highlighting regions of potential neurodevelopmental importance, such as the Rolandic operculum, inferior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus. Lateralized attribution patterns in PB reflected known neurodevelopmental alterations, underscoring the value of interpretable graph learning for understanding etiology-specific connectomic features. This work represents an important step toward atlas-independent connectome analysis, offering a novel framework for studying diverse neonatal populations and advancing our understanding of early brain development.

">Spatially Organized IGF1 mTOR Signaling Controls Human Forebrain Progenitor Fate Through Coordinated Transcriptional and Translational Programs</a></h4>

              
                The specification and maintenance of human forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs) depend on both intrinsic gene networks and spatially localized niche signals, but the interplay between these cues remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify a spatially organized, paracrine IGF1 signaling architecture that regulates human FOXG1 positive NPCs through multilayered transcriptional and translational control. Using a pluripotent stem cell derived forebrain model, we show that FOXG1 positive NPCs express IGF1 receptors but lack endogenous IGF1, instead depending on neighboring epithelial-like domains that secrete IGF1. IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation, clonal expansion, and vertical tissue growth by activating PI3K AKT mTOR and MEK ERK pathways. Ribosome profiling and 5-UTR reporter assays reveal that mTOR signaling selectively enhances translation of neurodevelopmental and biosynthetic transcripts including GSX1, a ventral fate determinant implicated in interneuron specification and autism. These findings uncover a human-specific regulatory mechanism in which spatially restricted IGF1 mTOR signaling integrates niche signals with translational output to support progenitor identity, biosynthetic capacity, and developmental resilience.

">Neurochemical imaging reveals changes in dopamine dynamics with photoperiod in a seasonally social vole species</a></h4>

              
                Studying dopamine signaling in non-model organisms is crucial for understanding the broad range of behaviors not represented in traditional model systems. However, exploring new species is often hindered by a scarcity of tools suitable for non-genetic models. In this work, we introduce near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) to investigate dopamine dynamics in meadow voles, a rodent species that exhibits distinct changes in social behavior and neurobiology across photoperiods. We observe increased dopamine release and release site density in social voles under short photoperiods, suggesting adaptations linked to environmental changes. Moreover, pharmacological and extracellular manipulations demonstrate that social voles exhibit heightened responsiveness to dopamine-increasing interventions and resilience against suppressive conditions. These findings highlight a significant association between dopamine signaling and photoperiod-driven changes in social behavior and establish nIRCats as an effective tool for expanding our understanding of dopamine dynamics across non-model organisms.

">LINKING MULTI-SCALE BRAIN CONNECTIVITY WITH VIGILANCE, WORKING MEMORY, AND BEHAVIOR IN ADOLESCENTS</a></h4>

              
                This study examines how multi-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) relate to cognitive and behavioral functions in adolescents, focusing on attention/vigilance, working memory, and behavioral regulation. Leveraging the NeuroMark 2.2 multi-scale ICN template obtained from over 100,000 subjects, we obtained multi-scale ICNs from baseline resting-state fMRI data from the ABCD Study. For this study, we are interested in "the fronto- thalamo-cerebellar (FTC) circuitry" and choose the subdomains of Neuromark 2.2 that cover it: Cerebellar (CB), Subcortical - Extended Thalamic (SC-ET), Higher Cognition - Insular Temporal (HC-IT), and Higher Cognition - Frontal (HC-FR), previously identified as relevant to cognitive and behavioral functions. Employing a multivariate approach combining principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we examined associations between these multi-scale ICNs and cognitive-behavioral outcomes. Our findings revealed significant associations, particularly for one of the estimated canonical components, linking multi-scale ICNs to cognitive and behavioral measures across both discovery and replication sets. This connectivity pattern may serve as a potential marker for attention, working memory, and behavioral regulation, offering new insights into a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

">Resting state periodic and aperiodic brain oscillations from birth to preschool years: Aperiodic maturity predicts developmental course</a></h4>

              
                The non-invasive assessment of resting-state (RS) neural activity via electrophysiology provides information on brain function and brain health. Our understanding of RS neural activity in older children and adults is limited by our poor understanding of the maturation of RS activity (oscillatory and non-oscillatory) from infancy to preschool ages. The present study used MEG with source imaging and an adapted Dark Room eyes-open task to assess oscillatory and non-oscillatory RS activity. 107 typically developing children 2 to 68 months were enrolled. For the Dark-Room eyes-open task, each child alternated between viewing an Inscapes video without audio for 20s and then resting with their eyes open for 30s in total darkness. This was repeated for 6 cycles. Whole-brain RS activity maps were computed using Minimum Norm Estimates, with RS power spectra divided into estimates of periodic measures (dominant frequency and power) and aperiodic measures (the exponent - slope of the 1/f function; the offset - vertical displacement of the 1/f function). An infant dominant peak was observed more often in the Dark-Room (94% of children) than in the Video-On condition (83% of children). The Dark-Room condition elicited a 36% increase in dominant oscillation activity than the Video-On condition. The maturation of the parietal-occipital periodic dominant frequency increased non-linearly as a function of age. The maturation of aperiodic measures decreased nonlinearly as a function of age, with aperiodic measures as well as their maturation rate differing across the brain. Finally, more mature aperiodic values predicted better adaptive behaviors and daily living skills. Present findings demonstrate that (1) the use of an appropriate Dark-Room eyes-open task provides measures of young child RS periodic activity with excellent SNR, (2) an understanding of the development of infant RS activity is best achieved via obtaining measures in brain source space in order to detect regional differences in aperiodic activity, and (3) a more mature aperiodic value predicts higher developmental behavior scores.

It has been shown that structural changes occur in the brain due to late-onset blindness, including cortical thinning in visual cortical regions. Following vision restoration, it is not yet known whether visual regions are reinvigorated and regain a normal cortical thickness or retain the diminished thickness from blindness.We evaluated the cortical thicknesses of 10 Argus II participants, 10 blind participants, and 13 sighted participants. The Argus II patients on average had a thicker left cuneus cortex and lateral occipital cortex relative to the blind patients. The duration of the Argus II use significantly partially correlated with thicker visual cortical regions in the left hemisphere. Furthermore, in the 2 case studies (scanned before and after implantation), the patient with longer device use (44.5 months) had an increase in the cortical thickness of visual regions, whereas the shorter-using patient did not (6.5 months).Overall, the Argus II participants’ cortical thickness was on average significantly rejuvenated in 2 higher visual regions, and participants using the implant for a longer duration had thicker visual regions. This research raises the possibility of structural plasticity reversing visual cortical atrophy in vision restoration participants.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Both animal and human studies indicate that individual variation in the neurometabolites gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate is linked to cognitive function. Age-related differences in these neurometabolites could potentially explain lower cognitive ability in older age. Working memory—the capacity to hold a limited amount of information online for a short period—has a central role in cognition, and this ability is also impaired in older individuals. Here, we investigated the relationship between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sup>+</sup>) levels and a composite measure of glutamate/glutamine (Glx) in the hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and how these neurochemical markers relate to working memory in younger and older adults. Across age groups, we found a significant positive association between working memory accuracy and Glx in the IFG, as well as a significant negative association between GABA<sup>+</sup> in this region and proactive interference. Age-stratified analyses demonstrated significant positive associations between components of working memory and hippocampal/IFG Glx, as well as a significant negative association between IFG GABA<sup>+</sup> and proactive interference in older adults only. These results provide novel evidence for a specific involvement of excitatory Glx and working memory accuracy as well as inhibitory GABA<sup>+</sup> for control of proactive interference in working memory, and how these effects are differentially affected by age.</span>

">Sleep stage-specific effects of 0.75 Hz phase-synchronized rTMS and tACS on delta frequency activity during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Slow oscillatory activity during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep plays a crucial role in both physical health and cognitive functions. Enhancing slow oscillatory activity during sleep has the potential to benefit these domains, yet an optimal stimulation protocol has not been established. This study aimed to investigate whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), synchronized with the trough phase of 0.75 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can modulate EEG activity in the delta frequency range during sleep and enhance cognitive functions. Healthy adults participated in a within-subject, counterbalanced study design comparing real and sham stimulation conditions. Combined rTMS and tACS was applied over the bilateral prefrontal cortex before sleep. We evaluated (1) power spectral density and functional connectivity within the delta frequency range during resting state and sleep, (2) retention of declarative memory learned before sleep, and (3) sleep parameters including spindle activity, sleep stage ratios, sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency. The combined rTMS and tACS protocol significantly increased delta oscillatory activity during the N3 sleep stage compared to sham. Functional connectivity, as measured by global efficiency, was enhanced during the N2 sleep stage. However, the stimulation did not improve declarative memory retention, spindle activity or other sleep parameters. These findings demonstrate the potential of combined rTMS and tACS as a non-invasive method to enhance delta oscillatory activity during sleep. While the stimulation did not improve memory performance, its ability to modulate delta activity during sleep suggests potential clinical applications for addressing pathological alterations in slow wave activity during sleep.

">Lifestyle, Early-life, and Genetic Health Risk Factors Underlying the Brain Age Gap: A Mega-Analysis Across 3,934 Individuals from the ENIGMA MDD Consortium</a></h4>

              
                Background: Large-scale studies show that adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) generally have a higher imaging-predicted age relative to their chronological age (i.e., positive brain age gap) compared to controls, though considerable within-group variation exists. This study examines lifestyle, early-life, and genetic health risk factors contributing to the brain age gap. Identifying risk and resilience factors could help protect brain and mental health. Methods: Using an established model trained on FreeSurfer-derived brain regions (www.photon-ai.com/enigma_brainage), we generated brain age predictions for 1,846 controls and 2,088 individuals with MDD (aged 18-75) from 12 international cohorts. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for major depression, C-reactive protein, and body mass index (BMI) using large-scale GWAS results. Linear mixed models were applied to assess lifestyle (BMI, smoking, education), early-life childhood trauma, and genetic (PRS) health risk associations with the brain age gap. Additionally, we evaluated the link between the brain age gap and peripheral biological age indicators (epigenetic clocks). Results: Higher brain age gaps were significantly associated with BMI ({beta}=0.01, PFDR=0.02) and smoking ({beta}=0.11, PFDR=0.02), while lower brain age gaps were linked to higher education ({beta}=-0.02, PFDR=0.02). Higher childhood trauma scores predicted a higher brain age gap ({beta}=0.04, P=0.01). Higher brain age gaps were positively associated with all PRS ({beta}s=0.04-0.16, PsFDR=0.02-0.03). There were no significant interactions between diagnosis and assessed factors on the brain age gap. In a multivariable model, only modifiable health factors (BMI, smoking, and education) remained uniquely associated with brain age gaps. Conclusions: Genetic liability for depression and related traits is linked to poorer brain health, but health behaviors potentially offer a key opportunity for intervention. This study underscores the importance of targeting modifiable lifestyle factors to mitigate poor brain health in depressed individuals, an approach perhaps under-recognized in clinical practice.

">Idebenone Enhances the Early Microglial Response to Traumatic Brain Injury and Mitigates Acute Gene Expression Changes to Ephrin-A and Dopamine Signaling Pathways</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) leads to persistent pro-inflammatory microglial activation implicated in neurodegeneration. Idebenone, a coenzyme Q10 analogue that interacts with both mitochondria and the tyrosine kinase adaptor SHC1, inhibits aspects of microglial activation in vitro. We used the NanoString Neuropathology panel to test the hypothesis that idebenone post-treatment mitigates TBI pathology-associated acute gene expression changes by moderating the pro-inflammatory microglial response to injury. Controlled cortical impact to adult male mice increased the microglial activation signature in peri-lesional cortex at 24 hours post-TBI. Unexpectedly, several microglial signature genes upregulated by TBI were further increased by post-injury idebenone administration. However, idebenone significantly attenuated TBI-mediated perturbations to gene expression associated with behavior, particularly in the gene ontology:biological process (GO:BP) pathways 'ephrin receptor signaling' and 'dopamine metabolic process.' Gene co-expression analysis correlated levels of microglial complement component 1q (C1q) and the neurotrophin receptor gene Ntrk1 to large (>3-fold) TBI-induced decreases in dopamine receptor genes Drd1 and Drd2 that were mitigated by idebenone treatment. Bioinformatics analysis identified SUZ12 as a candidate transcriptional regulator of idebenone-modified gene expression changes. Overall, results suggest that idebenone enhances TBI-induced microglial proliferation within the first 24 hours of TBI and identify Ephrin-A and dopamine signaling as novel idebenone targets.

">Acute E2/P4 loss compromises the biology and function of neurogenic niches during a vulnerable female aging period</a></h4>

              
                Effects of aging on neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) have been studied in males, but less is known in females. Here we comparatively assess female NSPC biology, both in the subventricular zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus niches, across different ages of F344 rats (2, 6, 9 and 14 months). The rats were ovariectomized (OVX) or remained Intact at each of the aging stages, to assess the role of the female sex hormones, estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). Results show that while age-dependent decays become prominent at 14 months, ovariectomy-induced E2/P4 loss markedly reduces neurogenesis and associated behavioral function, earlier, at 9 months of age. Coinciding with this pattern of neurogenic decline, we also detect adaptive changes in estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, antioxidant expression, and brain E2/P4 levels. Fundamentally, these results reveal specific female time-periods, when the brain is sensitive to age and E2/P4 loss, potentially setting-up for disease susceptibility.

">Vessels hiding in plain sight: quantifying brain vascular morphology in anatomical MR images using deep learning</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive assessment of brain blood vessels with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides important information about brain health and aging. Time-of- flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) in particular is commonly used to assess the morphology of blood vessels, but acquisition of MRA is time-consuming and is not as commonly employed in research studies or in the clinic as the more standard T1- or T2-weighted MR contrasts (T1w/T2w). To enable quantification of brain blood vessel morphology in T1w/T2w images, we trained a neural network model, anat2vessels, on a dataset with paired MR/MRA. The model provides accurate segmentations as assessed in cross-validation on ground truth images, particularly in cases where T2w images are used. In addition, correlation between features that are extracted from model-based vessel segmentations and from ground truth account for as much as 78% of the variance in these features. We further evaluated the model in another dataset that does not include MRA and found that anat2vessels-based vessel morphology features contain information about aging that is not captured by cortical thickness features that are routinely extracted from T1w/T2w images. Moreover, we found that vessel morphology features are associated with individual variability in blood pressure and cognitive abilities. Taken together these results suggest that anat2vessels could be fruitfully applied to a range of existing and new datasets to assess the role of brain blood vessels in aging and brain health. The model is provided as open-source software in https://github.com/nrdg/anat2vessels/.

">Histology to MRI registration quality of ex vivo human brain blocks fixed with solutions used in anatomy laboratories</a></h4>

              
                Introduction. Post-mortem brain tissue is obtained from brain banks that provide small tissue samples, while gross anatomy laboratories could become a source of complete brains for neuroscientists. These are preserved with solutions whose chemical composition differs from the classic neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) used in brain banks, such as a saturated-salt-solution (SSS) or an alcohol-formaldehyde solution (AFS) that preserve antigenicity of the main brain cell populations. Since histology remains the gold standard in neuroscientific research, while MRI is the most common imaging modality, MRI-histology registration quality needs to be assessed to ensure the suitability using brains fixed with innovative solutions for research procedures. Hence, our goal was to compare the registration quality of human brains fixed with NBF, SSS and AFS, as well as the histological characteristics that could affect the registration. Methods. We used 12 human brain blocks of 3x3x3 cm3 fixed in our anatomy laboratory using SSS (N=4), AFS (N=4), or NBF (N=4). The blocks were scanned using a 7Tesla Bruker animal MRI scanner with a T2-TurboRARE sequence at 0.13x0.13x0.5mm3. Blocks were then cut into 40m thick sections (parallel to the 0.13x0.13 plane) using a vibratome. Sections were stained with histochemistry (HC) (Cresyl violet, Prussian blue, Luxol fast blue, H&E, and Bielschowsky) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the 4 main cell populations: neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP), microglia (Iba1) and myelin (PLP) either with or without an antigen retrieval (AR) protocol. Stained sections were imaged using a slide scanner microscope and segmented with masks using Display, and the sections were manually registered to the T2-TurboRare images using landmarks in Register (MincToolKit). Results. More landmarks were needed to achieve proper alignment of the histology to MRI images for the SSS-fixed blocks, due to the lower GM-WM contrast in these brains. However, there was no significant difference in the staining intensity of the histology sections of blocks fixed with the three solutions, while SSS-fixed blocks showed a lower percentage of overlap between the good histology quality masks and the MRI masks. This resulted in a sufficient registration quality of all blocks, although more challenging when fixed with SSS. Conclusion. We have developed histology, MRI and registration protocols that are of good quality in brain blocks fixed with solutions used in gross anatomy laboratories. These results are promising for neuroscientists interested in using full brains from anatomy laboratories, either using MRI, histology or registration of both modalities to study normal aging and neurodegenerative conditions.

">Cholinergic neuron circadian clock mediates RNA-binding protein function and contributes to ALS disease phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks are encoded by a transcription-translation feedback loop that aligns physiological processes with the solar cycle. Previous work linking the circadian clock to the regulation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and alternative splicing provides a foundation for the vital examination of their mechanistic connections in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by disrupted RBP function. Here, we reveal enrichment of genes associated with ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases in the spinal cord cholinergic neuron rhythmic transcriptome. We demonstrate that there is circadian regulation of ALS-linked RBPs and rhythmic alternative splicing of genes involved in intracellular transport (Aftph and Mvb12a), microtubule cytoskeleton organization (Limch1 and Drc3), and synaptic function (Sipa1l2) in this neuronal sub-type. Further, we show that the cholinergic neuron clock regulates sporadic ALS-associated changes in cytoskeleton and neuromuscular junction synapse gene expression. Finally, we report that cell-type-specific Bmal1-deletion (i) increases sciatic nerve axon degeneration, (ii) drives alternative splicing of genes encoding ALS-linked RBPs (Matr3 and Srsf7), and (iii) drives alternative splicing of genes associated with microtubule transport and postsynaptic organization. Our results establish a role for the cholinergic neuron clock in RBP function and ALS disease phenotypes.

">APOE4-induced patterned behavioral decline and neurodegeneration requires endogenous tau in a C. elegans model of Alzheimers disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) causes a characteristic spatiotemporal pattern of neurodegeneration, resulting in the loss of associated faculties such as cognition. The factors which account for this pattern of degeneration are unclear, as AD risk genes are numerous and often broadly expressed. Previously, we generated a model of AD using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which the AD risk variant of apolipoprotein E, APOE4, is pan-neuronally expressed. We showed that HSN class motor neurons degenerate in early adult. Here, we expand on our past work by performing behavioral analyses to deduce the effect of APOE4 on the function of distinct neuronal circuits. We found evidence that APOE4 induces dysfunction of other neurons; this spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration roughly correlates with endogenous levels of PTL-1, the C. elegans homolog of human MAPT also known as tau. Moreover, deletion of ptl-1 suppressed defects in multiple behaviors, suggesting broad protective effects across the nervous system including the HSN neurons. Lastly, we show that PTL-1 in the touch receptor neurons, where PTL-1 is most abundant, is required cell nonautonomously for degeneration of the HSN neurons. Our results suggest that C. elegans may provide a useful in vivo system to study how endogenous Tau acts downstream of APOE4 to cause progressive, patterned neurodegeneration.

">Factor Analysis of Multimodal MRI, Biofluid and Vascular Health Biomarkers Reveals Latent Constructs of Brain Health</a></h4>

              
                Individual imaging and fluid biomarkers provide insights into specific components of brain health, but integrated multimodal approaches are necessary to capture the complex, interrelated biological systems that contribute to brain homeostasis and neurodegenerative disease. Using data from the Brain and Cognitive Health (BACH) cohort study (N=127; mean age=67 years, 68% women), we performed an exploratory factor analysis to identify latent constructs of brain health. We included multimodal neurovascular imaging markers, brain atrophy metrics, plasma Alzheimers disease (AD) biomarkers and cardiovascular risk factors. Five constructs emerged: Brain & Vascular Health (greater hippocampal volume, basal ganglia enlarged perivascular spaces [ePVS], cerebral blood flow and HDL cholesterol; lower ventricle volume and BMI); Structural Integrity (greater cortical thickness, fractional anisotropy and basal ganglia ePVS); Fluid Transport (greater white matter ePVS and Free Water); AD Biomarkers (higher phosphorylated tau [pTau]181 and pTau217; lower amyloid-beta 42/40 ratio); and Neuronal Injury (higher glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain). All constructs were associated with age ({beta}=-0.70-0.39, p[&le;].014), except for Fluid Transport (p>.05). Brain & Vascular Health and Structural Integrity (partial r=.305, p<.001), and AD Biomarkers and Neuronal Injury (partial r=.248, p=.005) were positively correlated. Only Brain & Vascular Health was associated with global cognition ({beta}=0.27, SE=0.13, p=.043). These findings provide a data-driven framework for examining distinct constructs underlying vascular health, fluid regulation and neurodegenerative pathology. We demonstrate the utility of using multiple biomarkers to probe these biological systems, paving the way for future research to explore how these systems change across diverse neurodegenerative conditions.

">Inhibiting glucocorticoid receptors enhances adult spinal cord neural stem cell activity and improves outcomes in spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                The internal microenvironment plays a critical role in the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). A big change in the spinal cord injury (SCI) microenvironment is the elevated level of glucocorticoids. In this study, we examined the impact of glucocorticoids on endogenous NSPCs in the adult mouse spinal cord. Our findings reveal that adult spinal cord NSPCs express glucocorticoid receptors, but not mineralocorticoid receptors. Glucocorticoids were found to significantly inhibit the proliferation and neurosphere formation of NSPCs via activation of glucocorticoid receptors, and they also impaired their differentiation. Importantly, the glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor CORT125281 was shown to enhance motor function in a traumatic SCI model in mice. Treatment with CORT125281 increased the number of NSPCs at the injury site in vivo. Flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analyses indicated that glucocorticoids induce NSPC arrest in the G1/G0 phase through the p53 signaling pathway. Glucocorticoids increased the expression of cell-cycle regulatory genes p15, p16, p18, and p27 in adult spinal cord NSPCs. In summary, our data suggest that glucocorticoids elevation following SCI suppresses the proliferation of endogenous NSPCs via glucocorticoid receptor activation. Targeting glucocorticoid receptors with specific inhibitors may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to promote recovery after spinal cord injury.

">Structural Covariance Network Properties Predictive of Early Adolescent Alcohol Initiation</a></h4>

              
                Importance: Early alcohol initiation (before age 15) is associated with adverse outcomes. Understanding mechanisms behind early alcohol initiation is essential for informing prevention efforts. Objective: To examine whether structural covariance network properties at ages 9-10 years predict early alcohol initiation. Design: Case-control, population-based study design. Setting: Data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study were used. Baseline structural brain imaging data (ages 9-10) were used for generation and comparison of structural covariance networks. Data from baseline to 4-year follow-up ([&le;]age 15) assessments were used to determine alcohol initiation. Participants: Participants were excluded if they reported consuming a full drink of alcohol at baseline, or did not meet imaging inclusion criteria. Controls were excluded if they had not yet been assessed or were missing substance use data at 4-year follow-up. In total, 3,878 participants met study criteria, of which 182 participants initiated alcohol. Structural covariance network properties were compared between the full sample and a 1:1 propensity-matched sample based on age, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, parental education, prenatal alcohol exposure, and baseline alcohol sipping. Main Outcomes and Measures: Structural covariance networks were estimated using regional cortical thickness and volume measurements. Measures of network segregation (modularity, clustering coefficient), integration (characteristic path length, global efficiency), and resilience (degree assortativity) were compared between groups. Early alcohol initiation was defined as consuming a full drink between baseline and 4-year follow-up Results: Alcohol initiators (n=182, median[IQR] age, 10.3[9.9-10.8]; 101 female[55.5%]) demonstrated lower network segregation (modularity: area-under-the-curve[AUC] difference[95%CI]=-0.017[-0.017,-0.007], p=0.030; clustering coefficient: AUC[95%CI]=-0.026[-0.027,-0.012], p=0.0495) and higher network integration (characteristic path length: AUC[95%CI]=-0.106[-0.099,-0.046], p=0.020; global efficiency: AUC[95%CI]=0.011[0.005,0.011], p=0.010), compared to non-initiators (n=3,696, median[IQR] age, 9.9[9.4-10.4]; 1750 female[47.4%]) when controlling for age, sex, and mean cortical thickness. Within the matched sample, only differences in network integration were preserved (characteristic path length: AUC[95%CI]=-0.044[-0.032,0.035], p=0.010; global efficiency: AUC[95%CI]=0.003[-0.003,0.003], p=0.040). There were no differences between full or matched samples when comparing cortical volume structural covariance networks. Conclusions and Relevance: Differences in cortical thickness structural covariance network properties at ages 9-10 predicted alcohol initiation before age 15. These findings suggest cortical thickness network topology may reflect a neuroanatomical risk marker for early alcohol initiation.

">Triple-N Dataset: Non-human Primate Neural Responses to Natural Scenes</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural mechanisms of visual perception requires data that encompass both large-scale cortical activity and the fine-grained dynamics of individual neurons. While the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) has provided substantial insights into visual processing in humans (Allen et al., 2022), its reliance on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) limits the exploration of individual neuron contributions. To bridge this gap, we present a new dataset: the Triple-N (Non-human Primate Neural Responses to Natural Scenes) dataset, which extends the NSD framework to non-human primates, incorporating single-neuron activity and fMRI recorded from the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. Using Neuropixels probes, we recorded neural responses from five macaques as they passively viewed 1,000 shared NSD images. The dataset includes 59 sessions across 27 sub-regions, capturing over 30,000 visual responsive units. Many recordings were obtained from fMRI-defined category-selective regions, such as face-, body-, scene-, and color-selective areas. Our dataset enables in-depth exploration of neural responses at multiple levels - from population dynamics to single-neuron activity, providing new insights into various aspects of visual processing, including the heterogeneity of object selectivity within functional regions and the temporal dynamics of responses to natural images. Furthermore, the dataset enables joint cross-species analyses, by integrating the macaque neural recordings with human fMRI data, offering a framework for comparing and aligning visual representations across primate species. Overall, our dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of visual perception, bridging the gap between large-scale neuroimaging and fine-grained electrophysiological signals, while also facilitating the development of computational models of the high-level visual system.

">A Foraging-Theory Based Model Captures The Full Spectrum of Human Behavioral Diversity in a Classic RL Task</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making tasks involving multiple, simultaneously presented options are mainstays of cognitive neuroscience and psychology, and are increasingly important to the emerging field of computational psychiatry. Modeling approaches to these tasks overwhelmingly assume that participants make choices based on explicitly comparing the values of the presented options. Contrary to this long-held assumption, we found instead that humans employ a compare-to-threshold decision process, similar to theories of foraging, when making sequential decisions about concurrently available options. We confirmed this result in a large (1000 participant) dataset with multiple converging lines of evidence comparing both model fits and model generative performance. Value-comparison models were restricted to a reduced area of the potential space of single-trial outcome-dependent behavior, demonstrating an intrinsic limitation in the ability to reproduce strategy diversity. Furthermore, we found that using even the best-fit value-comparison model led to a substantial, systematic bias and a compression of individual differences in reconstructed behavior compared to the foraging-based model, leading to weaker predictions of behavioral health measures. Our results imply that studies using value-comparison models to link behavior with neural activity or psychiatric symptoms may be less sensitive to individual differences than a simple alternative based on ethological foraging.

">Structure and function of otoferlin, a synaptic protein of sensory hair cells essential for hearing</a></h4>

              
                Our sense of hearing relies upon speedy synaptic transmission of sound information from cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). To accomplish this, IHCs employ a sophisticated presynaptic machinery including the multi-C2-domain protein otoferlin which is affected by human deafness mutations. Otoferlin is essential for IHC-exocytosis but how it binds Ca2+ and the target membrane to serve synaptic vesicle (SV) tethering, docking and fusion remained unclear. Here, we obtained cryo-electron-microscopy structures of Ca2+-bound otoferlin and employed molecular dynamics simulations of membrane binding. We show that membrane binding involves C2B-C2G-domains and repositions C2F- and C2G-domains. Progressive disruption of Ca2+-binding by the C2D-domain in mice increasingly altered synaptic sound encoding and eliminated the Ca2+-cooperativity of SV-exocytosis, indicating that this Ca2+-cooperativity reflects binding of several Ca2+-ions to otoferlin. Together, our findings elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying otoferlin-mediated SV-docking and support a role of otoferlin as Ca2+-sensor of SV-fusion in IHCs.

">Arousal state fluctuations are a source of internal noise underlying age-related declines in speech intelligibility</a></h4>

              
                Understanding speech in noisy, multi-talker environments is crucial for social communication but becomes increasingly challenging and frustrating as we age. Here, we simulated the acoustic challenges of multi-talker listening and found that adults over 50 years old (N = 76) recognized speech more slowly, less accurately, and less consistently than younger adults (N = 107). While peripheral hearing status accounted for average differences in speech intelligibility by age, it did not account for moment-to-moment variability in speed and accuracy - fluctuations central to the frustration experienced by older listeners in challenging environments. We hypothesized that age-related changes in brain arousal systems might account for the fluctuant 'noise' in speech processing observed in older listeners. To isolate the contribution of arousal state independent of hearing status and cognitive load, we measured the pre-stimulus pupil-indexed arousal state (PPAS) immediately prior to speech onset. Older - but not younger - adults exhibited a striking inverted-U relationship between PPAS and speech recognition accuracy. Notably, pupil-indexed listening effort measured seconds later during speech encoding was not associated with trial-to-trial performance. Moreover, older adults exhibited altered arousal regulation, occupying a lower PPAS extremum not observed in younger listeners that was specifically associated with performance deficits and subjective listening difficulties reported in hearing health questionnaires. These findings show that age-related changes in central arousal states interact with peripheral hearing status to offer a more complete explanation for why older adults find speech processing in social setting so challenging.

">Locus coeruleus-related insula activation supports implicit learning</a></h4>

              
                The noradrenergic locus coeruleus and its neuromodulatory cortical projections are critical for adaptive behavior, yet their contributions to implicit learning in novel environments remain incompletely understood, due to challenges in non-invasive assessment. Here, we combined multimodal neuroimaging -- including locus-coeruleus-sensitive structural MRI, concurrent pupillometry--fMRI, and PET-derived noradrenergic transporter maps -- with repeated behavioral assessments to investigate noradrenergic contributions to implicit learning across younger and older adults (n = 77). Salient expectation-violating stimuli elicited pupil dilation, indicating enhanced neuromodulation, activated the action-mode network and deactivated the default-mode network. Pupil-linked BOLD responses suggested a functional coupling between the locus coeruleus and action-mode network, further supported by spatial overlap of activation patterns with PET-derived noradrenergic transporter maps. Locus coeruleus MRI-guided functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that locus coeruleus activity is coupled to anterior insula activation, suggesting a noradrenergic role in shifting cortical dynamics toward action-oriented processing. Behaviorally, participants implicitly learned the statistical task structure over time, as evidenced by reaction time adjustments based on stimulus probabilities. Critically, stronger locus coeruleus integrity, greater task-related anterior insula activation, and more pronounced pupil dilation were associated with enhanced implicit learning, highlighting the behavioral relevance of noradrenergic neuromodulation. Notably, noradrenergic responses and their link to learning were preserved across age groups, suggesting a robust noradrenergic role in supporting adaptive behavior throughout adulthood. These findings provide novel insights into the neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying learning and cognitive flexibility, emphasizing the pivotal role of locus coeruleus--action-mode network interactions in behavioral adaptation.

">Excess prenatal folic acid supplementation alters cortical gene expression networks and electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Folate is crucial for various biological processes, with deficiencies during pregnancy being linked to increased risk for neural tube defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. As a proactive measure, folic acid fortification in foods has been mandated in many countries, in addition to dietary supplementation recommendations during pregnancy. However, the risks of excess prenatal folic acid supply have yet to be fully understood. To better appreciate in utero molecular changes in mouse brain exposed to 5-fold folic acid excess over normal supplementation, we investigated the transcriptome and methylome for alterations in gene networks. RNA-seq analysis of cerebral cortex collected at birth, revealed significant expression differences in 646 genes with major roles in protein translation. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing revealed 910 significantly differentially methylated regions with functions enriched in glutamatergic synapse and glutathione pathways. To explore the physiological consequences of excess prenatal folic acid exposure, we applied high-density microelectrode arrays to record network-level firing patterns of dissociated cortical neurons. Folic acid excess-derived cortical neurons exhibited significantly altered network activity, characterized by reduced burst amplitude and increased burst frequency, indicating compromised network synchronization. These functional deficits align with the observed molecular alterations in glutamatergic synapse pathways, underscoring the potential for excess prenatal folic acid exposure to disrupt developing metabolic and neurological pathways.

">Whole brain dimensional approach identifies shared and sex-specific networks of stress susceptibility in male and female mice.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stress is a significant risk factor for depression and anxiety, two highly comorbid disorders with sex differences in symptom presentation and prevalence. The Chronic Variable Stress (CVS) mouse model is a useful method for examining sex-specific susceptibility, as stress can be titrated in a sex-specific manner to produce depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours across both sexes. However, the sex-specific mechanisms regarding how CVS reorganizes brain anatomy remain unclear. Methods: Using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we provide the first whole-brain characterization of neuroanatomical changes induced by 6 or 28 days of exposure to CVS in female and male mice, respectively, and their association to behavior. We then examined the structural connectome underlying sex-specific latent dimensions of stress-susceptibility and potential molecular mechanisms using spatial gene expression analyses. Results: CVS induced significant neuroanatomical changes in regions already implicated in depression in both sexes (e.g. nucleus accumbens and hippocampus) as well as female- and male-specific neuroanatomical changes. In females, these changes were associated with both depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. While in males, we identified two orthogonal dimensions of neuroanatomical changes associated with anxiety-like behavior or social preference. These latent dimensions are associated with sex-specific hub regions and, in females, were associated with genes enriched for protein localization to the cell surface. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that different durations of CVS result in similar neuroanatomical changes in both sexes, however the direction of change and association to behavior is sex-specific. In females, these changes may be attributed to alterations in synaptic connectivity.

">A theory and recipe to construct general and biologically plausible integrating continuous attractor neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Across the brain, circuits with continuous attractor dynamics underpin the representation and storage in memory of continuous variables for motor control, navigation, and mental computations. The represented variables have various dimensions and topologies (lines, rings, euclidean planes), and the circuits exhibit continua of fixed points to store these variables, and the ability to use input velocity signals to update and maintain the representation of unobserved variables, effectively integrating the incoming velocity signal. Integration constitutes a general computational strategy that enables variable state estimation when direct observation of the variable is not possible, suggesting that it may play a critical role in other cognitive processes. While some neural network models for integration exist, a comprehensive theory for constructing neural circuits with a given topology and integration capabilities is lacking. Here, we present a theoretically-driven design framework, Manifold Attractor Direct Engineering (MADE), to automatically, analytically, and explicitly construct biologically plausible continuous attractor neural networks with diverse user-specified topologies. We show how these attractor networks can be endowed with accurate integration functionality through biologically realistic circuit mechanisms. MADE networks closely resemble biological circuits where the attractor mechanisms have been characterized. Additionally, MADE offers innovative and minimal circuit models for uncharacterized topologies, enabling a systematic approach to developing and testing mathematical theories related to cognition and computation in the brain.

                Chen et al. compared scRNA-seq profiles of four tissues in metabolic syndrome (MetS) models induced by fructose or high-fat high-sucrose diets, revealing differential tissue, cellular, and molecular vulnerability between diets. Regulatory genes and pathways were identified, and networks were rewired in MetS. mt-Rnr2 was validated as a key regulator.

                Pepe et al. demonstrate that G4 stabilization triggers cell-phase-specific replication fork stalling and restart mechanisms, relying on translesion DNA polymerases. While avoiding immediate DNA breakage, these mechanisms increase the risk of chromosomal instability in mitosis, highlighting crucial genomic stability processes and potential targets for therapies in cancer diseases.

                Hölbling et al. generate “DPReporter” iPSC neuron lines, which report the levels of endogenous dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) generated by the frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causing repeat expansion in C9orf72. Their utility for small-molecule and CRISPR-Cas9 screening was demonstrated, thus providing a powerful resource for repeat expansion disease research.

">The Parkinsons disease associated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 affects expression of Transferrin receptor 1 and phosphorylation of key signaling proteins in human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Several variants in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene account for familiar and sporadic late-onset Parkinsons disease (PD). LRRK2 is a large, multifunctional kinase involved in different intracellular pathways crucial for homeostasis and cell survival. One of the poorly understood mechanisms of Parkinsonism is the iron accumulation in Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR) plays a significant role for iron uptake into the cell. Here, we investigated the expression of TfR in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons (hDANs) generated from PD patients carrying the LRRK2 p.G2019S form and found dysregulated TfR levels. In addition, we found gene status depending variations of LRRK2 expression in differentiated hDANs, while neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) did not display these changes. This suggests an unknown regulatory mechanism of LRRK2 expression during dopaminergic differentiation. Further investigations showed dysregulated phosphorylation of the PD-associated GSK-3{beta} und the key signaling factor Akt.

">Functional organization of the spinal locomotor network based on analysis of interneuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion is a vital motor function for any leaving being. In vertebrates, a basic locomotor pattern is generated by the spinal locomotor network (SLN). Although SLN has been extensively studied, due to technical difficulties, most data were obtained during fictive locomotion, and data about activity of spinal neurons during locomotion with intact sensory feedback from limbs are extremely limited. Here, we overcame the technical problems and recorded activity of putative spinal interneurons from spinal segments L4-L6 during treadmill locomotion (with intact sensory feedback from limbs) evoked by stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region in the decerebrate cat. We analyzed activity phases of recorded interneurons, by using a new method that took into account the previously ignored information about stability of neuronal modulation in the sequential locomotor cycles. We suggested that neurons with stable modulation (i.e. small dispersion of their activity phase in sequential cycles) represent the core of SLN. Our analysis allowed to reveal functional groups of neurons with stable modulation presumably generating the vertical and horizontal components of the step, and to characterize their location in the spinal cord. Analysis of relationships between activity phases of these groups revealed possible connections between them, suggesting a novel model for generation of locomotion that combines reciprocally active half-centers with a ring consisting of four sequentially active groups, each inactivating the preceding one and activating the next one.

Here, we describe the major effective connectivity between the hippocampal memory system and the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) semantic memory system in humans. Then, we present and model a theory of how semantic representations may be formed in the human ATL using slow associative learning in semantic attractor networks that receive inputs from the hippocampal episodic memory system. The hypothesis is that if one category of semantic representations is being processed for several seconds, then a slow short-term memory trace associative biologically plausible learning rule will enable all the components during that time to be associated together in a semantic attractor network. This benefits from the binding of components provided by the hippocampal episodic memory system. The theory is modeled in a four-layer network for view-invariant visual object recognition, followed by a semantic attractor network layer that utilizes a temporal trace associative learning rule to form semantic categories based on the inputs that occur close together in time, using inputs from the hippocampal system or from the world.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Key questions for understanding hippocampal function in memory and navigation in humans are the type and source of visual information that reaches the human hippocampus. We measured bidirectional pairwise effective connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging between 360 cortical regions while 956 Human Connectome Project participants viewed scenes, faces, tools, or body parts. We developed a method using deterministic dynamical graphs to define whole cortical networks and the flow in both directions between their cortical regions over timesteps after signal is applied to V1. We revealed that a ventromedial cortical visual “Where” network from V1 via the retrosplenial and medial parahippocampal scene areas reaches the hippocampus when scenes are viewed. A ventrolateral “What” visual cortical network reaches the hippocampus from V1 via V2–V4, the fusiform face cortex, and lateral parahippocampal region TF when faces/objects are viewed. There are major implications for understanding the computations of the human vs rodent hippocampus in memory and navigation: primates with their fovea and highly developed cortical visual processing networks process information about the location of faces, objects, and landmarks in viewed scenes, whereas in rodents the representations in the hippocampal system are mainly about the place where the individual is located and self-motion between places.</span>

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

This study aims to evaluate parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding Shaken Baby Syndrome in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Al-Ahsa, focusing on all reachable parents of young children by using convenience sampling from June 2024 to August 2024, and data was collected using a pre-structured questionnaire. Results A total of 572 eligible parents participated, with ages ranging from 20 to over 40 years. The predominant gender of responders was female, comprising 433 (75.7%). A significant proportion of participants 432 (75.5%) displayed poor overall knowledge of Shaken Baby Syndrome, whereas 140 (24.5%) indicated competent knowledge and awareness. Female gender and parents with multiple children had a significant correlation with parents' understanding of Shaken Baby Syndrome (P< 0.05). Conclusion The study indicated that only around one-quarter of parents demonstrated a competent comprehension of Shaken Baby Syndrome, with mothers exhibiting more awareness. Consequently, health authorities must increase efforts to enhance public awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome.

                The WWC1 (KIBRA) gene has been repeatedly implicated in cognitive performance, with carriers of the favorable allele showing enhanced episodic memory, spatial ability, and achievements in chess and STEM fields. However, gene-level associations do not reveal the underlying biological mechanisms. Here, we applied a modern proteomic assay coupled with an AI-based protein complex quantification method to elucidate the protein interaction phenotype involving WWC1 in a Scottish cohort (Viking Genes; N = 200). Although the bulk plasma level of WWC1 was not significantly associated with cognitive g factor, several WWC1-containing protein complexes, including the DDR1-WWC1 and the DDR1-PRKCZ-WWC1 complex scores, demonstrated significant associations with cognitive performance. In particular, one standard deviation increase in the normalized DDR1-WWC1 complex score corresponded to about 14% decrease in cognitive g factor (P = 0.024), even with educational attainment adjusted. These findings validate previous genetic studies and highlight the importance of protein-protein interactions in mediating the cognitive effects of WWC1.

Our study explores how ecological aspects of motor learning enhance survival by improving movement efficiency and mitigating injury risks during task failures. Traditional motor control theories mainly address isolated body movements and often overlook these ecological factors. We introduce a novel computational motor control approach, incorporating ecological fitness and a strategy that alternates between success-driven movement efficiency and failure-driven safety, akin to win-stay/lose-shift tactics. In our experiments, participants performed squat-to-stand movements under novel force perturbations. They adapted effectively through various adaptive motor control mechanisms to avoid falls, reducing failure rates rapidly. The results indicate a high-level ecological controller in human motor learning that switches objectives between safety and movement efficiency, depending on failure or success. This approach is supported by policy learning, internal model adaptation, and adaptive feedback control. Our findings offer a comprehensive perspective on human motor control, integrating risk management in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for real-world environments.

                <p>by Debby D. Wang, Yuting Huang</p>

With a burgeoning number of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in various fields, biomolecular science has also given a big welcome to advanced AI techniques in recent years. In this broad field, scoring a protein-ligand binding structure to output the binding strength is a crucial problem that heavily relates to computational drug discovery. Aiming at this problem, we have proposed an efficient scoring framework using deep learning techniques. This framework describes a binding structure by a high-resolution atomic graph, places a focus on the inter-molecular interactions and learns the graph in a rational way. For a protein-ligand binding complex, the generated atomic graph reserves key information of the atoms (as graph nodes), and focuses on inter-molecular interactions (as graph edges) that can be identified by introducing multiple distance ranges to the atom pairs within the binding area. To provide more confidence in the predicted binding strengths, we have interpreted the deep learning model from the model level and in a post-hoc analysis. The proposed learning framework has been demonstrated to have competitive performances in scoring and screening tasks, which will prospectively promote the development of related fields further.

                <p>by Xiaoxiao Cheng, Shixian Shen, Ekaterina Ivanova, Gerolamo Carboni, Atsushi Takagi, Etienne Burdet</p>

Humans activate muscles to shape the mechanical interaction with their environment, but can they harness this control mechanism to best sense the environment? We investigated how participants adapt their muscle activation to visual and haptic information when tracking a randomly moving target with a robotic interface. The results exhibit a differentiated effect of these sensory modalities, where participants’ muscle coactivation increases with the haptic noise and decreases with the visual noise, in apparent contradiction to previous results. These results can be explained when considering muscle spring-like mechanics, where stiffness increases with coactivation to regulate motion guidance. Increasing coactivation to more closely follow the motion plan favors accurate visual over haptic information, while decreasing it filters visual noise and relies more on accurate haptic information. We formulated this active sensing mechanism as the optimization of visuo-haptic information and effort. This optimal information and effort (OIE) model can explain the adaptation of muscle activity to unimodal and multimodal sensory information when interacting with fixed or dynamic environments, or with another human, and can be used to optimize human-robot interaction.

Molecular docking is a useful method for predicting the binding affinity and conformation of small chemical entities to support lead optimisation. It is also used to virtually screen a large chemical database to find new chemical entities. There are several docking programs available with different algorithms and varying preparation steps. We identify ten quick tips that apply to molecular docking irrespective of the program one might choose. Our objective is to provide the beginners with important things to keep in mind while using molecular docking for their research. We aim to ensure that experts and beginners can perform molecular docking to yield biologically relevant and reproducible results.

                <p>by Yuru Song, Marcus K. Benna</p>

Cortical neurons often establish multiple synaptic contacts with the same postsynaptic neuron. To avoid functional redundancy of these parallel synapses, it is crucial that each synapse exhibits distinct computational properties. Here we model the current to the soma contributed by each synapse as a sigmoidal transmission function of its presynaptic input, with learnable parameters such as amplitude, slope, and threshold. We evaluate the classification capacity of a neuron equipped with such nonlinear parallel synapses, and show that with a small number of parallel synapses per axon, it substantially exceeds that of the Perceptron. Furthermore, the number of correctly classified data points can increase superlinearly as the number of presynaptic axons grows.
When training with an unrestricted number of parallel synapses, our model neuron can effectively implement an arbitrary aggregate transmission function for each axon, constrained only by monotonicity. Nevertheless, successful learning in the model neuron often requires only a small number of parallel synapses.
We also apply these parallel synapses in a feedforward neural network trained to classify MNIST images, and show that they can increase the test accuracy. This demonstrates that multiple nonlinear synapses per input axon can substantially enhance a neuron’s computational power.

AI-ready health datasets can be exploited to generate many research articles with potentially limited scientific value. A study in PLOS Biology highlights this problem, by describing a recent, sudden explosion in papers analyzing the NHANES health dataset.

A new study by Suchak et al. describes a sudden, recent explosion in papers analyzing the NHANES health dataset, where similar manuscripts have been described as overwhelming processes at some journals. In this accompanying Primer article, we summarize the study's findings and recommendations. We outline practical steps that publishers, journals, peer reviewers and readers can take to better recognize similarly formulaic, low-value submissions and publications to reduce their research impacts.

                Ongoing digitalization and data-driven developments in materials science and engineering (MSE) emphasize the growing importance of reusing research data and enabling machine accessibility, which requires robust data management and consistent semantic data representation. Ontologies have emerged as powerful tools for establishing interoperable and reusable data structures from inconsistent data structures. Despite advancements in semantic data representation for specific applications, integrating application ontologies with primary data repositories, such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), to feed world data remains an open task. As a use case in the MSE domain, this work presents a system based on semantic technologies from the point of view of engineers, developed with the help of information scientists, and unraveled on a small scale. The development of an application ontology (AO) was elaborated for flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) processes with the implementation of a data pipeline. The proposed FSP application ontology emerges from experimental in-house best-practice procedures and is adapted to the mid-level Project Material Digital core ontology (PMDco) to allow interoperability within the MSE domain. The pipeline retrieves manually acquired experimental data from an ELN, translates it into a machine-actionable format, and converts it into a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format to support semantic interoperability. The latter was stored in a triple store with a SPARQL interface, enabling findable and accessible datasets that are searchable and traceable. By creating semantically linked data structures in line with FAIR principles, this approach allows traceable and findable experimental results between stakeholders through both human-readable and machine-actionable formats. Seamless integration of the modular microservices of the data pipeline within established lab practices minimizes disruption while maintaining the software framework. The present work demonstrates the practical implementation of a FAIR data pipeline within a laboratory setting, paving the way for future data-centric science.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-482/v1?src=rss">The perceived barriers to data sharing in health and life sciences: a survey at the University of Bristol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sharing research data is critical for study validation and reuse, yet challenges persist across disciplines, such as psychology1 and biomedical science2. While global initiatives promote open science, understanding localized barriers in specific academic contexts is vital to implementing effective solutions. Objective To investigate the main perceived barriers and reasons preventing data sharing within the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences (FHLS) at the University of Bristol, a research-intensive university in the UK. Methods We distributed a comprehensive survey to FHLS researchers, addressing logistical, technical, and cultural challenges. A total of 143 participants provided insights into their experiences with data sharing. Results The primary obstacles identified were time constraints and the complexity of the preparation process, with 34% reporting they “usually” or “always” lack sufficient time to adequately prepare their data for sharing. Additional barriers included not having the rights to share (27%), insufficient technical support (15%), and limited incentives within research teams. Moreover, qualitative responses highlighted a lack of confidence in data sharing infrastructure and guidance. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions to enhance data-sharing practices. Solutions should prioritize data preparation processes, clarify data ownership policies, and offer tailored training programs. Integrating data-sharing requirements into research workflows from the outset could significantly alleviate these challenges. Our study provides actionable recommendations to inform the development of resources and infrastructure that support a culture of open science within the FHLS at the University of Bristol.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1307/v2?src=rss">Terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in the second specialty programs of a dental school over seven years [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Terminal efficiency (TE), the proportion of students completing academic programs within the expected timeframe, is a critical metric for assessing postgraduate health education quality, yet it remains underexplored in Latin American dental specialties. Efficient training is vital for producing competent professionals to meet regional healthcare demands. This study aimed to determine the TE of Peruvian university students in second specialty dental programs at a Peruvian university from 2017 to 2023. Methods A longitudinal, cross-sectional analysis was conducted using 257 complete records from the university institutional repository. Inclusion criteria encompassed full documentation of admission, academic status, and graduation dates. TE was calculated as the time from document submission to graduation, categorized as ≤1 year or ≥2 years. Statistical analyses included Chi-square tests, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests, Poisson regression, and hierarchical multiple linear regression on log-transformed TE. Results: Mean TE was 0.93 years (SD=1.22), with 72.37% of students (n=186) completing within ≤1 year. Significant variations were observed by submission year (p=0.001) and specialty (p<0.001), with Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (0.30 years) outperforming Periodontics and Implantology (1.76 years). The submission year was the only significant predictor of mean TE (β=0.144, p<0.001). Conclusion Dental programs of a Peruvian university demonstrate robust TE, though specialty-specific and temporal disparities highlight areas for improvement. Targeted interventions, such as streamlined thesis processes and specialty-specific support, could enhance efficiency, informing educational policy in Latin America.

                McFadden et al. find the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is activated by C-type lectin receptor signaling during Candida albicans infection without protein misfolding. IRE1α enhances calcium flux at the C. albicans-containing phagosome, likely through coordinating ER-phagosome contact sites. IRE1α promotes phagosome maturation and integrity, as well as macrophage fungicidal activity.

                Krell et al. show that mTORC1 in β cells acts as an activity sensor, activated by the same signals that trigger insulin secretion. This activation, in turn, inhibits insulin release via RhoA-dependent actin remodeling, establishing a negative feedback loop that allows β cells to intrinsically regulate their own activity.

Neighboring regions within a hemisphere become misaligned, while homologous regions across hemispheres are more synchronized. Their results suggest a common mechanism of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, through realignment of cortical communication.

Therefore, L1-INs are key sensory processing sites that may modulate cortex in a stimulus- and state-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102622">Diversity and functional specialization of oyster immune cells uncovered by integrative single-cell level investigations</a></h4>

              
                Mollusks are a major component of animal biodiversity and play a critical role in ecosystems and global food security. The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas</i>, is the most farmed bivalve mollusk in the world and is becoming a model species for invertebrate biology. Despite the extensive research on hemocytes, the immune cells of bivalves, their characterization remains elusive. Here, we were able to extensively characterize the diverse hemocytes and identified at least seven functionally distinct cell types and three hematopoietic lineages. A combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative cytology, cell sorting, functional assays, and pseudo-time analyses was used to deliver a comprehensive view of the distinct hemocyte types. This integrative analysis enabled us to reconcile molecular and cellular data and identify distinct cell types performing specialized immune functions, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, copper accumulation, and expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study emphasized the need for more in depth studies of cellular immunity in mollusks and non-model invertebrates and set the ground for further comparative immunology studies at the cellular level.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/5/ENEURO.0106-25.2025?rss=1">Synaptic Drive onto Inhibitory and Excitatory Principal Neurons of the Mouse Lateral Superior Olive</a></h4>

              
                <p>Principal neurons (PNs) of the lateral superior olive (LSO) are a critical component of brain circuits that compare information between the two ears to extract sound source-location-related cues. LSO PNs are not a homogenous group but differ in their transmitter type, intrinsic membrane properties, and projection pattern to higher processing centers in the inferior colliculus. Glycinergic inhibitory LSO PNs have higher input resistance than glutamatergic excitatory LSO PNs (~double). This suggests that the inhibitory cell type has a lower minimum input or signal intensity required to produce an output (activation threshold) which may impact how they integrate binaural inputs. However, cell-type-specific differences in the strength of synaptic drive could offset or accentuate such differences in intrinsic excitability and have not been assessed. To evaluate this possibility, we used a knock-in mouse model to examine spontaneous and electrically stimulated (evoked) synaptic events in LSO PN types using voltage-clamp technique. Both excitatory and inhibitory spontaneous postsynaptic currents were larger in inhibitory LSO PNs, but evoked events were not. Additionally, we found that LSO PN types had inputs with similar short-term plasticity and number of independent fibers. An important contrast was that inhibitory LSO PNs received inhibitory inputs with slower decay kinetics which could impact integrative functions. These data suggest that synaptic inputs onto LSO PNs are unlikely to offset excitability differences. Differences in activation threshold along with transmitter type and projection laterality may allow for distinct roles for LSO PN types in inferior colliculus information processing.</p>

                <p>Childhood epilepsy is a common and devastating condition, for which many children still do not have adequate treatment. Some children with drug-resistant epilepsy require surgical excision of epileptogenic brain tissue for seizure control, affording the opportunity to study this tissue ex vivo to interrogate human epileptic neurons for potentially hyperexcitable perturbations in intrinsic electrophysiological properties. In this study, we characterized the diversity of layer L2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons (PNs) in ex vivo brain slices from pediatric patients with epilepsy. We found a remarkable diversity in the firing properties of epileptic L2/3 PNs: five distinct subpopulations were identified. Additionally, we investigated whether the etiology of epilepsy influenced the intrinsic neuronal properties of L2/3 PNs when comparing tissue from patients with epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development (MCDs), other forms of epilepsy (OEs), or with deep-seated tumors. When comparing epileptic with control L2/3 PNs, we observed a decrease in voltage sag and lower maximum firing rates. Moreover, we found that MCD and OE L2/3 PNs were mostly similar indicating that epilepsy etiology may not outweigh the influences of epileptiform activity on L2/3 PN physiology. Lastly, we show that the proconvulsant drug, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), leads to increased AP half-width, reduced firing rate accommodation, and slower AHPs. These changes imply that 4-AP induces an increase in [K<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB> and a resultant increase in AP duration, leading to the release of more excitatory neurotransmitters per action potential, thereby promoting network hyperexcitability.</p>

                <p>The explore/exploit trade-off is a fundamental property of choice selection during reward-guided decision making, where the "same" choice can reflect either of these internal cognitive states. An unanswered question is whether the execution of a decision provides an underexplored measure of internal cognitive states. Touchscreens are increasingly used across species for cognitive testing and afford the ability to measure the precise location of choice touch responses. We examined how male and female mice in a restless bandit decision making task interacted with a touchscreen to determine if the explore/exploit trade-off, prior reward, and/or sex differences change the variability in the kinetics of touchscreen choices. During exploit states, successive touch responses are closer together than those made in an explore state, suggesting exploit states reflect periods of increased motor stereotypy. Although exploit decisions might be expected to be rewarded more frequently than explore decisions, we find that immediate past reward reduces choice variability independently of explore/exploit state. Male mice are more variable in their interactions with the touchscreen than females, even in low-variability trials such as exploit or following reward. These results suggest that as exploit behavior emerges in reward-guided decision making, all mice become less variable and more automated in both their choice and the actions taken to make that choice, but this occurs on a background of increased male variability. These data uncover the hidden potential for touchscreen decision making tasks to uncover the latent neural states that unite cognition and movement.</p>

                <p>by William R. Shoemaker, Álvaro Sánchez, Jacopo Grilli</p>

Ecology has historically benefited from the characterization of statistical patterns of biodiversity within and across communities, an approach known as macroecology. Within microbial ecology, macroecological approaches have identified universal patterns of diversity and abundance that can be captured by effective models. Experimentation has simultaneously played a crucial role, as the advent of high-replication community time-series has allowed researchers to investigate underlying ecological forces. However, there remains a gap between experiments performed in the laboratory and macroecological patterns documented in natural systems, as we do not know whether these patterns can be recapitulated in the lab and whether experimental manipulations produce macroecological effects. This work aims at bridging the gap between experimental ecology and macroecology. Using high-replication time-series, we demonstrate that microbial macroecological patterns observed in nature exist in a laboratory setting, despite controlled conditions, and can be unified under the Stochastic Logistic Model of growth (SLM). We found that demographic manipulations (e.g., migration) impact observed macroecological patterns. By modifying the SLM to incorporate said manipulations alongside experimental details (e.g., sampling), we obtain predictions that are consistent with macroecological outcomes. By combining high-replication experiments with ecological models, microbial macroecology can be viewed as a predictive discipline.

                <p>by Péter Polcz, István Z. Reguly, Kálmán Tornai, János Juhász, Sándor Pongor, Attila Csikász-Nagy, Gábor Szederkényi</p>

Optimal intervention planning is a critical part of epidemiological control, which is difficult to attain in real life situations. Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models can be used to optimize control but the results can not be easily translated to interventions in highly complex real life environments. Agent-based methods on the other hand allow detailed modeling of the environment but optimization is precluded by the large number of parameters. Our goal was to combine the advantages of both approaches, i.e., to allow control optimization in complex environments. The epidemic control objectives are expressed as a time-dependent reference for the number of infected people. To track this reference, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed with a compartmental ODE prediction model to compute the optimal level of stringency of interventions, which are later translated to specific actions such as mobility restriction, quarantine policy, masking rules, school closure. The effects of interventions on the transmission rate of the pathogen, and hence their stringency, are computed using PanSim, an agent-based epidemic simulator that contains a detailed model of the environment. The realism and practical applicability of the method is demonstrated by the wide range of discrete level measures that can be taken into account. Moreover, the change between measures applied during consecutive planning intervals is also minimized. We found that such a combined intervention planning strategy is able to efficiently control a COVID-19-like epidemic process, in terms of incidence, virulence, and infectiousness with surprisingly sparse (e.g. 21 day) intervention regimes. At the same time, the approach proved to be robust even in scenarios with significant model uncertainties, such as unknown transmission rate, uncertain time and probability constants. The high performance of the computation allows a large number of test cases to be run. The proposed computational framework can be reused for epidemic management of unexpected pandemic events and can be customized to the needs of any country.

As a result of rapidly accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, multiple national governments and multinational bodies have launched efforts to address safety, security and ethics issues related to AI models. One high priority among these efforts is the mitigation of misuse of AI models, such as for the development of chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological (CBRN) threats. Many biologists have for decades sought to reduce the risks of scientific research that could lead, through accident or misuse, to high-consequence disease outbreaks. Scientists have carefully considered what types of life sciences research have the potential for both benefit and risk (dual use), especially as scientific advances have accelerated our ability to engineer organisms. Here we describe how previous experience and study by scientists and policy professionals of dual-use research in the life sciences can inform dual-use capabilities of AI models trained using biological data. Of these dual-use capabilities, we argue that AI model evaluations should prioritize addressing those which enable high-consequence risks (i.e., large-scale harm to the public, such as transmissible disease outbreaks that could develop into pandemics), and that these risks should be evaluated prior to model deployment so as to allow potential biosafety and/or biosecurity measures. While biological research is on balance immensely beneficial, it is well recognized that some biological information or technologies could be intentionally or inadvertently misused to cause consequential harm to the public. AI-enabled life sciences research is no different. Scientists’ historical experience with identifying and mitigating dual-use biological risks can thus help inform new approaches to evaluating biological AI models. Identifying which AI capabilities pose the greatest biosecurity and biosafety concerns is necessary in order to establish targeted AI safety evaluation methods, secure these tools against accident and misuse, and avoid impeding immense potential benefits.

                <p>by Daniel Schmid, Heiko Neumann</p>

Object-basd visual attention marks a key process of mammalian perception. By which mechanisms this process is implemented and how it can be interacted with by means of attentional control is not completely understood yet. Incremental binding is a mechanism required in demanding scenarios of object-based attention and is experimentally well investigated. Attention spreads across a representation of the visual object and labels bound elements by constant up-modulation of neural activity. The speed of incremental binding was found to be dependent on the spatial arrangement of distracting elements in the scene and to be scale invariant giving rise to the growth-cone hypothesis. In this work, we propose a neural dynamical model of incremental binding that provides a mechanistic account for these findings. Through simulations, we investigate the model properties and demonstrate how an attentional spreading mechanism tags neurons that participate in the object binding process. They utilize Gestalt properties and eventually show growth-cone characteristics labeling perceptual items by delayed activity enhancement of neuronal firing rates. We discuss the algorithmic process underlying incremental binding and relate it to our model computations. This theoretical investigation encompasses complexity considerations and finds the model to be not only of explanatory value in terms of neurophysiological evidence, but also to be an efficient implementation of incremental binding striving to establish a normative account. By relating the connectivity motifs of the model to neuroanatomical evidence, we suggest thalamo-cortical interactions to be a likely candidate for the flexible and efficient realization suggested by the model. There, pyramidal cells are proposed to serve as the processors of incremental grouping information. Local bottom-up evidence about stimulus features is integrated via basal dendritic sites. It is combined with an apical signal consisting of contextual grouping information which is gated by attentional task-relevance selection mediated via higher-order thalamic representations.

                <p>by Wenjun Zhao, Erica Larschan, Björn Sandstede, Ritambhara Singh</p>

Inferring gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is an important and challenging problem in the biology community. We propose OTVelo, a methodology that takes time-stamped single-cell gene expression data as input and predicts gene regulation across two time points. It is known that the rate of change of gene expression, which we will refer to as gene velocity, provides crucial information that enhances such inference; however, this information is not always available due to the limitations in sequencing depth. Our algorithm overcomes this limitation by estimating gene velocities using optimal transport. We then infer gene regulation using time-lagged correlation and Granger causality via regularized linear regression. Instead of providing an aggregated network across all time points, our method uncovers the underlying dynamical mechanism across time points. We validate our algorithm on 13 simulated datasets with both synthetic and curated networks and demonstrate its efficacy on 9 experimental data sets.

We present a model to calculate the displacement and extension of deformable cellular cargo pulled by molecular motors stepping along cytoskeletal filaments. We consider the case of a single type of molecular motor and cytoskeletal filaments oriented in one dimension in opposite directions on either side of a cargo. We model a deformable cargo as a simple elastic spring. We simulate this tug-of-war simple exclusion process model using a Monte Carlo Gillespie algorithm and calculate the displacement and extension of the cargo for different configurations of motors and filaments. We apply our model to kinesin-1 motors on microtubules to investigate whether they are strong enough to translocate and deform the largest cellular cargo, the nucleus. We show that the extension caused by motors on a single microtubule saturates for larger numbers of motors but that the extension and displacement scales linearly with the number of microtubules. We also show how the binding and unbinding behaviors of molecular motors on microtubule filaments affect the nuclear deformation. Our modelling results correspond to experiments on cells treated with the drug kinesore, which is thought to increase rescue events resulting in more stable microtubules and more active kinesin-1 molecular motors bound to them. Both the experiments and our simulations result in nuclear deformation.

                <p>by Jiajie Shao, Jana F. Liewald, Wagner Steuer Costa, Christiane Ruse, Jens Gruber, Mohammad S. Djamshedzad, Wulf Gebhardt, Alexander Gottschalk</p>

Chemical synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is regulated by electrical activity of the motor circuit, but may also be affected by neuromodulation. Here, we assessed the role of neuropeptide signaling in the plasticity of NMJ function in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that the CAPS (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion) ortholog UNC-31, which regulates exocytosis of dense core vesicles, affects both pre- and post-synaptic functional properties, as well as NMJ-mediated locomotion. Despite reduced evoked acetylcholine (ACh) transmission, the loss of <i>unc-31</i> results in a more vigorous response to presynaptic stimulation, i.e., enhanced muscle contraction and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Based on expression profiles, we identified neuropeptides involved in both cholinergic (FLP-6, FLP-15, NLP-9, NLP-15, NLP-21, and NLP-38) and GABAergic motor neurons (FLP-15, NLP-15), that mediate normal transmission at the NMJ. In the absence of these peptides, neurons fail to upregulate their ACh output in response to increased cAMP signaling; for <i>flp-15; nlp-15</i> double mutants, we observed overall increased postsynaptic currents, indicating that these neuropeptides may be inhibitory. We also identified proprotein convertases encoded by <i>aex-5/kpc-3</i> and <i>egl-3/kpc-2</i> that act synergistically to generate these neuropeptides. We propose that postsynaptic homeostatic scaling, mediated by increased muscle activation, likely through excitability, might compensate for the reduced cholinergic transmission in mutants affected for neuropeptide signaling, thus maintaining net synaptic strength. We show that in the absence of UNC-31 muscle excitability is modulated by upregulating the expression of the muscular L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel EGL-19. Our results unveil a role for neuropeptidergic regulation in synaptic plasticity, linking changes in presynaptic transmission to compensatory changes in muscle excitability.

With the growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-ready datasets such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), new opportunities for data-driven research are being created, but also generating risks of data exploitation by paper mills. In this work, we focus on two areas of potential concern for AI-supported research efforts. First, we describe the production of large numbers of formulaic single-factor analyses, relating single predictors to specific health conditions, where multifactorial approaches would be more appropriate. Employing AI-supported single-factor approaches removes context from research, fails to capture interactions, avoids false discovery correction, and is an approach that can easily be adopted by paper mills. Second, we identify risks of selective data usage, such as analyzing limited date ranges or cohort subsets without clear justification, suggestive of data dredging, and post-hoc hypothesis formation. Using a systematic literature search for single-factor analyses, we identified 341 NHANES-derived research papers published over the past decade, each proposing an association between a predictor and a health condition from the wide range contained within NHANES. We found evidence that research failed to take account of multifactorial relationships, that manuscripts did not account for the risks of false discoveries, and that researchers selectively extracted data from NHANES rather than utilizing the full range of data available. Given the explosion of AI-assisted productivity in published manuscripts (the systematic search strategy used here identified an average of 4 papers per annum from 2014 to 2021, but 190 in 2024–9 October alone), we highlight a set of best practices to address these concerns, aimed at researchers, data controllers, publishers, and peer reviewers, to encourage improved statistical practices and mitigate the risks of paper mills using AI-assisted workflows to introduce low-quality manuscripts to the scientific literature.

<p>Using two different EEG tasks with static and articulating faces, deprivation-induced cortical changes in postlingually deafened individuals were found by means of reduced visual cortex activation and a relationship between these alterations and the CI outcome after 6 months. These alterations are not significantly affected by CI experience.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although a cochlear implant (CI) can partially restore auditory function, CI recipients show alterations not only in auditory but also in visual cortical processing. Yet, it is not well understood how these visual changes relate to the CI outcome and to what extent these changes are induced by auditory deprivation and the limited CI input, respectively. Here, we present a prospective longitudinal electroencephalography study which examined the deprivation- and CI-induced alterations on cortical face processing by comparing visual evoked potentials (VEP) in CI users before and 6 months after implantation. A group of normal-hearing (NH) listeners served as a control. The participants performed a word-identification task and a face-categorization task to study the cortical processing of static and articulating faces in attended and unattended conditions. The CI candidates and CI users showed a reduced visual-cortex activation, a stronger functional connectivity between the visual and auditory cortex, and a reduced attention effect in the (extended) alpha frequency range (8–18 Hz) when compared to NH listeners. There was a positive correlation between the P1 VEP amplitude recorded before implantation and the speech recognition ability after implantation. Our results suggest that the CI users' alterations in cortical face processing are mainly induced by auditory deprivation and not by CI experience. Importantly, these deprivation-induced changes seem to be related to the CI outcome. Our results suggest that the visual P1 amplitude as recorded <i>before</i> implantation provides an objective index of cortical visual reorganization that may help predict the CI outcome.</p>

                Pollution refers to the addition of harmful substances to that level where they cause an effect on the environment, it has three major categories such as water, soil, and air pollution but this report is on water pollution. It occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies such as, groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans rendering them unfavorable for various purposes for example drinking, recreation, and support to aquatic life. Globally, over 80% of wastewater worldwide is discharged into the water bodies without adequate treatment. In Africa, lack of clean water and sanitation is a significant challenge in many countries, affecting approximately 319 million people. Thus, water pollution is one of the types of pollution that has been threatening the lives of living organisms. Implementing effective policies and strategies can have a profound impact on the environment and local communities. By reducing pollution levels and improving water quality, we can create a healthier environment and decrease the incidence of waterborne diseases, leading to improved health and well-being for residents. The research on water pollution in the River Meizimera Kihihi has important implications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, and communities and society. In conclusion, effective policies can foster community involvement, raise awareness, and promote collective action to address water pollution. By achieving clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), we can contribute to the broader sustainable development goals. This research has important ramifications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, communities, and society. This study investigated the problems of water pollution, its causes, its impact, and the current effort to address the issues along the river of Meizimera-kihihi, Kanugu district, Uganda. Recommendations were made, which included encouraging the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, industrial processes, and waste management strategies to minimize pollution.

                Background Young people with mental disorders should be offered evidence-based treatments. In 2018, we developed a national evidence portal in Norway providing access to living evidence summaries. This work has been an important contribution to mental health care in Norway but is also a rich data source for exploring the existing research. At the time of this study, eight overviews of overviews (OoO) were published addressing the effects of treatments for attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder, self-harm and trauma / post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study was to do a secondary analysis of this evidence to describe the state-of-the art in this field, and to map: treatments evaluated for each diagnostic group and the longest time of follow-up treatment comparisons evaluated for more than one diagnostic group Methods We performed a mapping review. Data extraction was performed independently by two authors. All data was entered into Excel. Unique treatment comparisons were visualised in Sunburst diagrams. The longest time of follow-up and treatments evaluated across diagnostic groups were reported in descriptive tables. Results We identified 200 treatment comparisons including a wide variety of interventions. Some diagnoses are treated mostly with pharmaceutical therapies (such as bipolar disorder) or psychological therapy alone or in combination (such as anxiety and psychosis). Others are treated with a broader spectrum of therapeutic approaches (such as depression and ADHD). The evidence supporting most treatments is of low to very low certainty. Ten percent of the comparisons included follow-up assessments beyond 12 months. Cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectic behavioural therapy, physical activity and mindfulness interventions were effective across populations. Conclusions The evidence supporting treatment of mental disorders in young people has important limitations. Future research efforts should address these evidence gaps.

                The taxon Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) contains one of the most long-established evolutionary lineages of vertebrates with a tantalizing collection of species occupying critical aquatic habitats. To overcome the current limitation in molecular resources, we launched the Squalomix Consortium in 2020 to promote a genome-wide array of molecular approaches, specifically targeting shark and ray species. Among the various bottlenecks in working with elasmobranchs are their elusiveness and low fecundity as well as the large and highly repetitive genomes. Their peculiar body fluid composition has also hindered the establishment of methods to perform routine cell culturing required for their karyotyping. In the Squalomix consortium, these obstacles are expected to be solved through a combination of in-house cytological techniques including karyotyping of cultured cells, chromatin preparation for Hi-C data acquisition, and high fidelity long-read sequencing. The resources and products obtained in this consortium, including genome and transcriptome sequences, a genome browser powered by JBrowse2 to visualize sequence alignments, and comprehensive matrices of gene expression profiles for selected species are accessible through https://github.com/Squalomix/info.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) is prevalent and challenging to treat in amputees, which likely stems from maladaptive cortical reorganization, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the cortical remodeling patterns in amputees experiencing PLP, pinpointing key brain regions and neural circuits directly associated with the pain. Eighteen PLP patients and 20 healthy participants were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping method was used to identify PLP-related abnormal local and global signaling hubs. FCD changes were observed within the sensorimotor, pain-processing, and visual stream networks in PLP patients, with the precentral gyrus (PreCG), insula (INS), precuneus (PCUN), and middle occipital gyrus (MOG) identified as key hubs correlated with the visual analog scale (VAS) pain ratings. A voxel-wise functional connectivity (FC) analysis was further performed between the VAS-correlated FCD hubs and the rest of the brain. FC was significantly decreased between the hubs and widespread brain regions. In contrast, increased FC was revealed between the hubs and subregions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus [SFGdor] and middle frontal gyrus [MFG]). FC of the SFGdor-INS and MFG-PCUN pathways was negatively correlated with VAS pain ratings specifically, likely playing crucial roles in PLP. These results provide novel insights into the critical neural mechanisms of PLP, highlighting valuable targets for developing long-term effective neuromodulation modalities.</p>
