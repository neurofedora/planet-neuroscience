                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">We retrospectively collected data on all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two Italian hospitals who developed encephalopathy during disease course and were treated with IVIg.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Five patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19. Four patients suffered severe respiratory distress, three of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days). No adverse events related to IVIg were observed.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Conclusions</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Our preliminary findings suggest that IVIg may represent a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19-associated encephalopathy. Clinical efficacy may be driven by the anti-inflammatory action of IVIg, associated with its anti-cytokine qualities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Preventing type 1 diabetes in childhood</a></h4>

              
                <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing &beta; cells of the pancreas are destroyed by T lymphocytes. Recent studies have demonstrated that monitoring for pancreatic islet autoantibodies, combined with genetic risk assessment, can identify most children who will develop T1D when they still have sufficient &beta; cell function to control glucose concentrations without the need for insulin. In addition, there has been recent success in secondary prevention using immunotherapy to delay the progression of preclinical disease, and primary prevention approaches to inhibiting the initiating autoimmune process have entered large-scale clinical trials. By changing the focus of T1D management from late diagnosis and insulin replacement to early diagnosis and &beta; cell preservation, we can anticipate a future without the need for daily insulin injections for children with T1D.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Immunotherapy: Building a bridge to a cure for type 1 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy the insulin-producing &beta; cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetic and environmental factors increase T1D risk by compromising immune homeostasis. Although the discovery and use of insulin have transformed T1D treatment, insulin therapy does not change the underlying disease or fully prevent complications. Over the past two decades, research has identified multiple immune cell types and soluble factors that destroy insulin-producing &beta; cells. These insights into disease pathogenesis have enabled the development of therapies to prevent and modify T1D. In this review, we highlight the key events that initiate and sustain pancreatic islet inflammation in T1D, the current state of the immunological therapies, and their advantages for the treatment of T1D.</p>

                <p>Technological advancements in blood glucose monitoring and therapeutic insulin administration have improved the quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes. However, these efforts fall short of replicating the exquisite metabolic control provided by native islets. We examine the integrated advancements in islet cell replacement and immunomodulatory therapies that are coalescing to enable the restoration of endogenous glucose regulation. We highlight advances in stem cell biology and graft site design, which offer innovative sources of cellular material and improved engraftment. We also cover cutting-edge approaches for preventing allograft rejection and recurrent autoimmunity. These insights reflect a growing understanding of type 1 diabetes etiology, &beta; cell biology, and biomaterial design, together highlighting therapeutic opportunities to durably replace the &beta; cells destroyed in type 1 diabetes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Type 1 diabetes glycemic management: Insulin therapy, glucose monitoring, and automation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite innovations in insulin therapy since its discovery, most patients living with type 1 diabetes do not achieve sufficient glycemic control to prevent complications, and they experience hypoglycemia, weight gain, and major self-care burden. Promising pharmacological advances in insulin therapy include the refinement of extremely rapid insulin analogs, alternate insulin-delivery routes, liver-selective insulins, add-on drugs that enhance insulin effect, and glucose-responsive insulin molecules. The greatest future impact will come from combining these pharmacological solutions with existing automated insulin delivery methods that integrate insulin pumps and glucose sensors. These systems will use algorithms enhanced by machine learning, supplemented by technologies that include activity monitors and sensors for other key metabolites such as ketones. The future challenges facing clinicians and researchers will be those of access and broad clinical implementation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Horizontally transmitted parasitoid killing factor shapes insect defense to parasitoids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interkingdom competition occurs between hymenopteran parasitoids and insect viruses sharing the same insect hosts. It has been assumed that parasitoid larvae die with the death of the infected host or as result of competition for host resources. Here we describe a gene family, <I>parasitoid killing factor</I> (<I>pkf</I>), that encodes proteins toxic to parasitoids of the Microgastrinae group and determines parasitism success. <I>Pkfs</I> are found in several entomopathogenic DNA virus families and in some lepidopteran genomes. We provide evidence of equivalent and specific toxicity against endoparasites for PKFs found in entomopoxvirus, ascovirus, baculovirus, and Lepidoptera through a mechanism that elicits apoptosis in the cells of susceptible parasitoids. This highlights the evolutionary arms race between parasitoids, viruses, and their insect hosts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Drug-induced phospholipidosis confounds drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drawn much attention. Beginning with sigma receptor ligands and expanding to other drugs from screening in the field, we became concerned that phospholipidosis was a shared mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of many repurposed drugs. For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific target-based activities&mdash;rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">lncRNA SLERT controls phase separation of FC/DFCs to facilitate Pol I transcription</a></h4>

              
                <p>RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription takes place at the border of the fibrillar center (FC) and the dense fibrillar component (DFC) in the nucleolus. Here, we report that individual spherical FC/DFC units are coated by the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 in human cells. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) <I>SLERT</I> binds to DDX21 RecA domains to promote DDX21 to adopt a closed conformation at a substoichiometric ratio through a molecular chaperone&ndash;like mechanism resulting in the formation of hypomultimerized and loose DDX21 clusters that coat DFCs, which is required for proper FC/DFC liquidity and Pol I processivity. Our results suggest that <I>SLERT</I> is an RNA regulator that controls the biophysical properties of FC/DFCs and thus ribosomal RNA production.</p>

                <p>Thermoelectric materials transfer heat and electrical energy, hence they are useful for power generation or cooling applications. Many of these materials have narrow bandgaps, especially for cooling applications. We developed SnSe crystals with a wide bandgap (<I>E</I><SUB>g</SUB>  33 <I>k</I><SUB>B</SUB><I>T</I>) with attractive thermoelectric properties through Pb alloying. The momentum and energy multiband alignments promoted by Pb alloying resulted in an ultrahigh power factor of ~75 &mu;W cm<sup>&ndash;1</sup> K<sup>&ndash;2</sup> at 300 K, and an average figure of merit <I>ZT</I> of ~1.90. We found that a 31-pair thermoelectric device can produce a power generation efficiency of ~4.4% and a cooling <I>T</I><SUB>max</SUB> of ~45.7 K.

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Liquid medium annealing for fabricating durable perovskite solar cells with improved reproducibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>Solution processing of semiconductors is highly promising for the high-throughput production of cost-effective electronics and optoelectronics. Although hybrid perovskites have potential in various device applications, challenges remain in the development of high-quality materials with simultaneously improved processing reproducibility and scalability. Here, we report a liquid medium annealing (LMA) technology that creates a robust chemical environment and constant heating field to modulate crystal growth over the entire film. Our method produces films with high crystallinity, fewer defects, desired stoichiometry, and overall film homogeneity. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs) yield a stabilized power output of 24.04% (certified 23.7%, 0.08 cm<sup>2</sup>) and maintain 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 2000 hours of operation. In addition, the 1-cm<sup>2</sup> PSCs exhibit a stabilized power output of 23.15% (certified PCE 22.3%) and keep 90% of their initial PCE after 1120 hours of operation, which illustrates their feasibility for scalable fabrication. LMA is less climate dependent and produces devices in-house with negligible performance variance year round. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue to improving the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.</p>

We found that the half-integer thermal Hall plateau appears even for a magnetic field with no out-of-plane components. The measured field-angular variation of the quantized thermal Hall conductance has the same sign structure as the topological Chern number of the pure Kitaev spin liquid.

                <p>Generalization of the concept of band topology from lower-dimensional to higher-dimensional (<I>n</I> &gt; 3) physical systems is expected to introduce new bulk and boundary topological effects. However, theoretically predicted topological singularities in five-dimensional systems&mdash;Weyl surfaces and Yang monopoles&mdash;have either not been demonstrated in realistic physical systems or are limited to purely synthetic dimensions. We constructed a system possessing Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces based on metamaterials with engineered electromagnetic properties, leading to the observation of several intriguing bulk and surface phenomena, such as linking of Weyl surfaces and surface Weyl arcs, via selected three-dimensional subspaces. The demonstrated photonic Weyl surfaces and Weyl arcs leverage the concept of higher-dimension topology to control the propagation of electromagnetic waves in artificially engineered photonic media.</p>

                <p>Artificial spin ices are frustrated spin systems that can be engineered, in which fine tuning of geometry and topology has allowed the design and characterization of exotic emergent phenomena at the constituent level. Here, we report a realization of spin ice in a lattice of superconducting qubits. Unlike conventional artificial spin ice, our system is disordered by both quantum and thermal fluctuations. The ground state is classically described by the ice rule, and we achieved control over a fragile degeneracy point, leading to a Coulomb phase. The ability to pin individual spins allows us to demonstrate Gauss&rsquo;s law for emergent effective monopoles in two dimensions. The demonstrated qubit control lays the groundwork for potential future study of topologically protected artificial quantum spin liquids.</p>

Cells linking visual processing to person memory have been proposed but not found. Here, we report the discovery of such cells through recordings from an area in the macaque temporal pole identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging. These cells responded to faces that were personally familiar. They responded nonlinearly to stepwise changes in face visibility and detail and holistically to face parts, reflecting key signatures of familiar face recognition. They discriminated between familiar identities, as fast as a general face identity area. The discovery of these cells establishes a new pathway for the fast recognition of familiar individuals.</p>

We investigated PIEZO function in tip-growing cells in the moss <I>Physcomitrium patens</I> and the flowering plant <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>. <I>Pp</I>PIEZO1 and <I>Pp</I>PIEZO2 redundantly contribute to the normal growth, size, and cytoplasmic calcium oscillations of caulonemal cells. Both <I>Pp</I>PIEZO1 and <I>Pp</I>PIEZO2 localized to vacuolar membranes. Loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and overexpression mutants revealed that moss PIEZO homologs promote increased complexity of vacuolar membranes through tubulation, internalization, and/or fission. <I>Arabidopsis</I> PIEZO1 also localized to the tonoplast and is required for vacuole tubulation in the tips of pollen tubes. We propose that in plant cells the tonoplast has more freedom of movement than the plasma membrane, making it a more effective location for mechanosensory proteins.</p>

                <p>Bacteriophage predation selects for diverse antiphage systems that frequently cluster on mobilizable defense islands in bacterial genomes. However, molecular insight into the reciprocal dynamics of phage-bacterial adaptations in nature is lacking, particularly in clinical contexts where there is need to inform phage therapy efforts and to understand how phages drive pathogen evolution. Using time-shift experiments, we uncovered fluctuations in <I>Vibrio cholerae</I>&rsquo;s resistance to phages in clinical samples. We mapped phage resistance determinants to SXT integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which notoriously also confer antibiotic resistance. We found that SXT ICEs, which are widespread in -proteobacteria, invariably encode phage defense systems localized to a single hotspot of genetic exchange. We identified mechanisms that allow phage to counter SXT-mediated defense in clinical samples, and document the selection of a novel phage-encoded defense inhibitor. Phage infection stimulates high-frequency SXT ICE conjugation, leading to the concurrent dissemination of phage and antibiotic resistances.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Thymic stromal lymphopoietin induces adipose loss through sebum hypersecretion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emerging studies indicate that the immune system can regulate systemic metabolism. Here, we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulates T cells to induce selective white adipose loss, which protects against obesity, improves glucose metabolism, and mitigates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, adipose loss was not caused by alterations in food intake, absorption, or energy expenditure. Rather, it was induced by the excessive loss of lipids through the skin as sebum. TSLP and T cells regulated sebum release and sebum-associated antimicrobial peptide expression in the steady state. In human skin, <I>TSLP</I> expression correlated directly with sebum-associated gene expression. Thus, we establish a paradigm in which adipose loss can be achieved by means of sebum hypersecretion and uncover a role for adaptive immunity in skin barrier function through sebum secretion.</p>

                <p>Aging is an established risk factor for vascular diseases, but vascular aging itself may contribute to the progressive deterioration of organ function. Here, we show in aged mice that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling insufficiency, which is caused by increased production of decoy receptors, may drive physiological aging across multiple organ systems. Increasing VEGF signaling prevented age-associated capillary loss, improved organ perfusion and function, and extended life span. Healthier aging was evidenced by favorable metabolism and body composition and amelioration of aging-associated pathologies including hepatic steatosis, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, "inflammaging" (age-related multiorgan chronic inflammation), and increased tumor burden. These results indicate that VEGF signaling insufficiency affects organ aging in mice and suggest that modulating this pathway may result in increased mammalian life span and improved overall health.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The regulation of synaptic connectivity in the brain is vital to proper functioning and development of the CNS. Formation of neural networks in the CNS has been shown to be heavily influenced by astrocytes, which secrete factors, including thrombospondin (TSP) family proteins, that promote synaptogenesis. However, whether this process is different between males and females has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we found that cortical neurons purified from newborn male rats showed a significantly more robust synaptogenic response compared with female-derived cells when exposed to factors secreted from astrocytes. This difference was driven largely by the neuronal response to TSP2, which increased synapses in male neurons while showing no effect on female neurons. Blockade of endogenous 17&beta;-estradiol (E2) production with letrozole normalized the TSP response between male and female cells, indicating a level of regulation by estrogen signaling. Our results suggest that male and female neurons show a divergent response to TSP synaptogenic signaling, contributing to sex differences in astrocyte-mediated synaptic connectivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">COUNTEN, an AI-Driven Tool for Rapid and Objective Structural Analyses of the Enteric Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of an interconnected meshwork of neurons and glia residing within the wall of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While healthy GI function is associated with healthy ENS structure, defined by the normal distribution of neurons within ganglia of the ENS, a comprehensive understanding of normal neuronal distribution and ganglionic organization in the ENS is lacking. Current methodologies for manual enumeration of neurons parse only limited tissue regions and are prone to error, subjective bias, and peer-to-peer discordance. There is accordingly a need for robust, and objective tools that can capture and quantify enteric neurons within multiple ganglia over large areas of tissue. Here, we report on the development of an AI-driven tool, COUNTEN (COUNTing Enteric Neurons), which is capable of accurately identifying and enumerating immunolabeled enteric neurons, and objectively clustering them into ganglia. We tested and found that COUNTEN matches trained humans in its accuracy while taking a fraction of the time to complete the analyses. Finally, we use COUNTEN&rsquo;s accuracy and speed to identify and cluster thousands of ileal myenteric neurons into hundreds of ganglia to compute metrics that help define the normal structure of the ileal myenteric plexus. To facilitate reproducible, robust, and objective measures of ENS structure across mouse models, experiments, and institutions, COUNTEN is freely and openly available to all researchers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Deciphering Spinal Endogenous Dopaminergic Mechanisms That Modulate Micturition Reflexes in Rats with Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spinal neuronal mechanisms regulate recovered involuntary micturition after spinal cord injury (SCI). It was recently discovered that dopamine (DA) is synthesized in the rat injured spinal cord and is involved in lower urinary tract (LUT) activity. To fully understand the role of spinal DAergic machinery in micturition, we examined urodynamic responses in female rats during pharmacological modulation of the DA pathway. Three to four weeks after complete thoracic SCI, the DA precursor L-DOPA administered intravenously during bladder cystometrogram (CMG) and external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) reduced bladder overactivity and increased the duration of EUS bursting, leading to remarkably improved voiding efficiency. Apomorphine (APO), a non-selective DA receptor (DR) agonist, or quinpirole, a selective DR<SUB>2</SUB> agonist, induced similar responses, whereas a specific DR<SUB>2</SUB> antagonist remoxipride alone had only minimal effects. Meanwhile, administration of SCH 23390, a DR<SUB>1</SUB> antagonist, reduced voiding efficiency by increasing tonic EUS activity and shortening the EUS bursting period. Unexpectedly, SKF 38393, a selective DR<SUB>1</SUB> agonist, increased EUS tonic activity, implying a complicated role of DR<SUB>1</SUB> in LUT function. In metabolic cage assays, subcutaneous administration of quinpirole decreased spontaneous voiding frequency and increased voiding volume; L-DOPA and APO were inactive possibly because of slow entry into the CNS. Collectively, tonically active DR<SUB>1</SUB> in SCI rats inhibit urine storage and enhance voiding by differentially modulating EUS tonic and bursting patterns, respectively, while pharmacologic activation of DR<SUB>2</SUB>, which are normally silent, improves voiding by enhancing EUS bursting. Thus, enhancing DA signaling achieves better detrusor-sphincter coordination to facilitate micturition function in SCI rats.</p>

                <p>by Leon Avery, Brian Ingalls, Catherine Dumur, Alexander Artyukhin</p>

We describe a mathematical model for the aggregation of starved first-stage <i>C elegans</i> larvae (L1s). We propose that starved L1s produce and respond chemotactically to two labile diffusible chemical signals, a short-range attractant and a longer range repellent. This model takes the mathematical form of three coupled partial differential equations, one that describes the movement of the worms and one for each of the chemical signals. Numerical solution of these equations produced a pattern of aggregates that resembled that of worm aggregates observed in experiments. We also describe the identification of a sensory receptor gene, <i>srh–2</i>, whose expression is induced under conditions that promote L1 aggregation. Worms whose <i>srh–2</i> gene has been knocked out form irregularly shaped aggregates. Our model suggests this phenotype may be explained by the mutant worms slowing their movement more quickly than the wild type.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Accurate influenza forecasts using type-specific incidence data for small geographic units</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James Turtle, Pete Riley, Michal Ben-Nun, Steven Riley</p>

Influenza incidence forecasting is used to facilitate better health system planning and could potentially be used to allow at-risk individuals to modify their behavior during a severe seasonal influenza epidemic or a novel respiratory pandemic. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs an annual competition to forecast influenza-like illness (ILI) at the regional and national levels in the US, based on a standard discretized incidence scale. Here, we use a suite of forecasting models to analyze type-specific incidence at the smaller spatial scale of clusters of nearby counties. We used data from point-of-care (POC) diagnostic machines over three seasons, in 10 clusters, capturing: 57 counties; 1,061,891 total specimens; and 173,909 specimens positive for Influenza A. Total specimens were closely correlated with comparable CDC ILI data. Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit subpopulations of the cluster (individual counties) separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing during seasonal peaks and guide public health intervention policy during potentially severe novel influenza pandemics.

We demonstrate a modeling and computational framework that allows for rapid screening of thousands of potential network designs for particular dynamic behavior. To illustrate this capability we consider the problem of hysteresis, a prerequisite for construction of robust bistable switches and hence a cornerstone for construction of more complex synthetic circuits. We evaluate and rank most three node networks according to their ability to robustly exhibit hysteresis where robustness is measured with respect to parameters over multiple dynamic phenotypes. Focusing on the highest ranked networks, we demonstrate how additional robustness and design constraints can be applied. We compare our results to more traditional methods based on specific parameterization of ordinary differential equation models and demonstrate a strong qualitative match at a small fraction of the computational cost.

Ciliates are unicellular eukaryotes with both a germline genome and a somatic genome in the same cytoplasm. The somatic macronucleus (MAC), responsible for gene expression, is not sexually transmitted but develops from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC) at each sexual generation. In the MIC genome of <i>Paramecium tetraurelia</i>, genes are interrupted by tens of thousands of unique intervening sequences called internal eliminated sequences (IESs), which have to be precisely excised during the development of the new MAC to restore functional genes. To understand the evolutionary origin of this peculiar genomic architecture, we sequenced the MIC genomes of 9 <i>Paramecium</i> species (from approximately 100 Mb in <i>Paramecium aurelia</i> species to >1.5 Gb in <i>Paramecium caudatum</i>). We detected several waves of IES gains, both in ancestral and in more recent lineages. While the vast majority of IESs are single copy in present-day genomes, we identified several families of mobile IESs, including nonautonomous elements acquired via horizontal transfer, which generated tens to thousands of new copies. These observations provide the first direct evidence that transposable elements can account for the massive proliferation of IESs in <i>Paramecium</i>. The comparison of IESs of different evolutionary ages indicates that, over time, IESs shorten and diverge rapidly in sequence while they acquire features that allow them to be more efficiently excised. We nevertheless identified rare cases of IESs that are under strong purifying selection across the <i>aurelia</i> clade. The cases examined contain or overlap cellular genes that are inactivated by excision during development, suggesting conserved regulatory mechanisms. Similar to the evolution of introns in eukaryotes, the evolution of <i>Paramecium</i> IESs highlights the major role played by selfish genetic elements in shaping the complexity of genome architecture and gene expression.

                <p>by Hideki Terajima, Mijia Lu, Linda Zhang, Qi Cui, Yanhong Shi, Jianrong Li, Chuan He</p>

Among over 150 distinct RNA modifications, <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing represent 2 of the most studied modifications on mammalian mRNAs. Although both modifications occur on adenosine residues, knowledge on potential functional crosstalk between these 2 modifications is still limited. Here, we show that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification promotes expression levels of the ADAR1, which encodes an A-to-I RNA editing enzyme, in response to interferon (IFN) stimulation. We reveal that YTH <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) mediates up-regulation of ADAR1; YTHDF1 is a reader protein that can preferentially bind m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts and promote translation. Knockdown of YTHDF1 reduces the overall levels of IFN-induced A-to-I RNA editing, which consequently activates dsRNA-sensing pathway and increases expression of various IFN-stimulated genes. Physiologically, YTHDF1 deficiency inhibits virus replication in cells through regulating IFN responses. The A-to-I RNA editing activity of ADAR1 plays important roles in the YTHDF1-dependent IFN responses. Therefore, we uncover that m<sup>6</sup>A and YTHDF1 affect innate immune responses through modulating the ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing.

                Ventricular non-compaction (VNC) is a rare myocardium disorder, which can be both genetic and sporadic. A poor wall compaction process or an excessive trabeculae formation may be at the genesis of myocardial hypertrabeculation with multiple recesses. It is often complicated by ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias and cardiac embolism. Herein we report a case of a 20-year-old male patient with no particular past medical history who was followed up at the cardiology department for dyspnea. Echocardiography showed reduced ejection fraction of the left ventricle with potential hypertrabeculation in the right ventricle, confirmed by cardiac MRI. The patient was not put under medication and was later lost to follow-up. He died few months later without a clear cause explaining death. A forensic autopsy was performed that attributed death to acute ventricle arrhythmia secondary to VNC, emphasizing the major role of an early and specific treatment to avoid such a fatal outcome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between depression, anxiety, stress and perceived quality of life in a Malaysian B40 urban community during the COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Malaysia, B40 communities are those with a median monthly household earning of under RM 3166. With the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown, the livelihoods of those in these areas has been severely impacted. This has increased their vulnerability to psychological afflictions and has led to a poorer perception of their quality of life (QoL) in comparison to the rest of the population. We investigated the association between perceived levels of depression, anxiety and stress and their impact on quality of life (QoL) among B40 residents in a low-cost urban housing area in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2020 and February 2021 in the Seri Pantai housing settlement. The validated Malay versions of the depression, anxiety, and stress scale-21 (DASS-21) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life, brief (WHOQOL-BREF) were distributed to the participants using Google forms. The statistical significance of the association between subscales of depression, anxiety, stress and QoL domains were assessed using the Pearson’s correlation test. Results: Of the 180 participants, the majority were Malays (87.2%) and females (82.2%).  The average scores were the highest for stress (5.66 ± 4.59) and the score in the environment domain of QoL (59.27 ± 17.23) was the lowest. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the subscales of DASS-21 and the four domains of the QoL, with the social relationships and psychological domains showing a highly significant association (p < 0.001). The strongest correlation was observed between the psychological domain and depression (r= -.520) followed by psychological domain and stress (r= -.496). Conclusion: The strongest correlation was observed between psychological domain and depression. This suggests a need to address potential devastating mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the QoL of residents in B40 communities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PhD students in life sciences can benefit from team cohesion [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Scientific progress during doctoral studies is a combination of individual effort and teamwork. A recently growing body of interdisciplinary literature has investigated the determinants of early career success in academia, in which learning from supervisors and co-authors play a great role. Yet, it is less understood how collaboration patterns of the research team, in which the doctoral student participates, influences the future career of students. Here we take a social network analysis approach to investigate this and define the research team as the co-authorship network of the student. Methods: We use the Hungarian Scientific Bibliography Database, which includes all publications of PhD students who defended theses from the year 1993. The data also include thesis information, and the publications of co-authors of students. Using this data, we quantify cohesion in the ego-network of PhD students, the impact measured by citations received, and productivity measured by number of publications. We run multivariate linear regressions to measure the relation of network cohesion, and publication outputs during doctoral years with future impact. Results: We find that those students in life sciences, but not in other fields, who have a cohesive co-author network during studies and two years after defence receive significantly more citations in eight years. We find that the number of papers published during PhD years and closely after the defence correlates negatively while the impact of these papers correlates positively with future success of students in all fields. Conclusions: These results highlight that research teams are effective learning environments for PhD students where collaborations create a tightly knit knowledge network.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A giant fecaloma revealed by severe aspiration pneumonia and urinary retention [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Fecaloma is an accumulation of hardened impacted stool typically occurring in the sigmoid colon and rectum. It mainly affects elderly and bedridden patients suffering from chronic constipation and can be revealed by different signs. We report a case of 74-year-old female, with anorexia, Alzheimer’s disease, and chronic constipation, who was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and anuria. Clinical examination showed fever, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13/15, tachycardia with a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg, polypnea with hypoxia, foci of crepitant rales in pulmonary auscultation and a tender hypogastric mass with mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. Digital rectal examination revealed hard fecal material. Computed tomography (CT) images demonstrated bilateral pulmonary parenchymal condensation and a huge heterogeneous fecaloma in the sigmoid colon and rectum compressing the bladder. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of giant fecaloma causing aspiration pneumonia and urinary retention was retained. Manual disimpaction and bowel enemas were done but they were unsuccessful and surgical treatment was refused. Ultimately the patient died due to septic shock. Early diagnosis should be made to relieve symptoms and prevent complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evolution of human respiratory virus epidemics [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pathogens are often assumed to evolve towards reduced virulence, but counterexamples abound. Faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) and the overall disease burden. Considerable effort has been invested towards developing a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although many approaches accurately recapitulate complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between CFR and infection rate. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Methods: A compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity is constructed and evaluated at both short timescales and at equilibrium. Results: We reveal kinetic constraints whereby variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased CFR and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as smallpox, are often constrained by the host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: Evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in CFR should not be assumed. These results agree with previous work demonstrating an increase in virulence for smallpox and further predict that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. Herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and viruses with similar life history traits might be unachievable without vaccination. However, partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect on the epidemic dynamics not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by changing the evolutionary trajectory of moderate CFR viruses towards reduced CFR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Discrepancy between Clove and Non-Clove Cigarette Smoke-Promoted Candida albicans Biofilm Formation with Precoating RNA-aptamer [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                This study explores the influence of precoating aptamer (Ca-apt1) on C. albicans viability while the fungus was growing in the presence of exposing condensed cigarette smoke (CSC), prepared from clove (CCSC) and non-clove (NCSC) cigarettes, for 48 h. Using qPCR, we found that mRNA expression of adhesion-associated genes (ALS3 and HWP1) was impaired by precoating C. albicans yeast cells with the aptamer. Conversely, the gene transcription was upregulated when aptamer-uncoated yeast was pre-treated with either CSC. In addition, by analysing the result of MTT ([3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay, we found that the presence of added CCSC or NCSC in growth medium for 48 h was significantly enhanced C. albicans biofilm development. However, the presence of precoated aptamer was significantly impaired biofilm development accelerated by the NCSC. The inhibitory effect of the Ca-apt1 was not dependent on the precoated aptamer (1ng/μL and 10 ng/μL). Interestingly, we noted that the enhancer effect of treated CCSC was no longer effective when the yeast had been precoated with 10 ng/μL aptamer tested. Additionally, light microscopy analysis revealed that precoating aptamer alleviates morphological changes of C. albicans (from yeast to hypha formation) that are enhanced by adding CCSC or NCSC in the growth medium. In conclusion, these results suggest that administration on Ca-ap1 exhibits a significant protective effect on CSC-induced biofilm formation by C. albicans.

                In March 2019, 45 scientists and software engineers from around the world converged at the University of California, Santa Cruz for the first pangenomics codeathon. The purpose of the meeting was to propose technical specifications and standards for a usable human pangenome as well as to build relevant tools for genome graph infrastructures. During the meeting, the group held several intense and productive discussions covering a diverse set of topics, including advantages of graph genomes over a linear reference representation, design of new methods that can leverage graph-based data structures, and novel visualization and annotation approaches for pangenomes. Additionally, the participants self-organized themselves into teams that worked intensely over a three-day period to build a set of pipelines and tools for specific pangenomic applications. A summary of the questions raised and the tools developed are reported in this manuscript.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural heterogeneity of cellular K5/K14 filaments as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Keratin intermediate filaments are an essential and major component of the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. They form a stable yet dynamic filamentous network extending from the nucleus to the cell periphery, which provides resistance to mechanical stresses. Mutations in keratin genes are related to a variety of epithelial tissue diseases. Despite their importance, the molecular structure of keratin filaments remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the structure of keratin 5/keratin 14 filaments within ghost mouse keratinocytes by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. By averaging a large number of keratin segments, we have gained insights into the helical architecture of the filaments. Two-dimensional classification revealed profound variations in the diameter of keratin filaments and their subunit organization. Computational reconstitution of filaments of substantial length uncovered a high degree of internal heterogeneity along single filaments, which can contain regions of helical symmetry, regions with less symmetry and regions with significant diameter fluctuations. Cross section views of filaments revealed that keratins form hollow cylinders consisting of multiple protofilaments, with an electron dense core located in the center of the filament. These findings shed light on the complex and remarkable heterogenic architecture of keratin filaments, suggesting that they are highly flexible, dynamic cytoskeletal structures.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Murine muscle stem cell response to perturbations of the neuromuscular junction are attenuated with aging</a></h4>

              
                During aging and neuromuscular diseases, there is a progressive loss of skeletal muscle volume and function impacting mobility and quality of life. Muscle loss is often associated with denervation and a loss of resident muscle stem cells (satellite cells or MuSCs), however, the relationship between MuSCs and innervation has not been established. Herein, we administered severe neuromuscular trauma to a transgenic murine model that permits MuSC lineage tracing. We show that a subset of MuSCs specifically engraft in a position proximal to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synapse between myofibers and motor neurons, in healthy young adult muscles. In aging and in a mouse model of neuromuscular degeneration (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase knockout – <i>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup></i>), this localized engraftment behavior was reduced. Genetic rescue of motor neurons in <i>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mice reestablished integrity of the NMJ in a manner akin to young muscle and partially restored MuSC ability to engraft into positions proximal to the NMJ. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of MuSCs isolated from aged muscle, we demonstrate that a subset of MuSCs are molecularly distinguishable from MuSCs responding to myofiber injury and share similarity to synaptic myonuclei. Collectively, these data reveal unique features of MuSCs that respond to synaptic perturbations caused by aging and other stressors.

                The translation initiation complex eIF3 imparts specialized functions to regulate protein expression. However, understanding of eIF3 activities in neurons remains limited despite widespread dysregulation of eIF3 subunits in neurological disorders. Here, we report a selective role of the <i>C. elegans </i>RNA-binding subunit EIF-3.G in shaping the neuronal protein landscape. We identify a missense mutation in the conserved Zinc-Finger (ZF) of EIF-3.G that acts in a gain-of-function manner to dampen neuronal hyperexcitation. Using neuron type-specific seCLIP, we systematically mapped EIF-3.G-mRNA interactions and identified EIF-3.G occupancy on GC-rich 5′UTRs of a select set of mRNAs enriched in activity-dependent functions. We demonstrate that the ZF mutation in EIF-3.G alters translation in a 5′UTR dependent manner. Our study reveals an <i>in vivo</i> mechanism for eIF3 in governing neuronal protein levels to control neuronal activity states and offers insights into how eIF3 dysregulation contributes to neuronal disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Scanned optogenetic control of mammalian somatosensory input to map input-specific behavioral outputs</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory stimuli guide and shape behavior, from immediate protective reflexes to longer-term learning and higher-order processes related to pain and touch. However, somatosensory inputs are challenging to control in awake mammals due to the diversity and nature of contact stimuli. Application of cutaneous stimuli is currently limited to relatively imprecise methods as well as subjective behavioral measures. The strategy we present here overcomes these difficulties, achieving 'remote touch' with spatiotemporally precise and dynamic optogenetic stimulation by projecting light to a small defined area of skin. We mapped behavioral responses in freely behaving mice with specific nociceptor and low-threshold mechanoreceptor inputs. In nociceptors, sparse recruitment of single action potentials shapes rapid protective pain-related behaviors, including coordinated head orientation and body repositioning that depend on the initial body pose. In contrast, activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptors elicited slow-onset behaviors and more subtle whole-body behaviors. The strategy can be used to define specific behavioral repertoires, examine the timing and nature of reflexes, and dissect sensory, motor, cognitive and motivational processes guiding behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decoding locomotion from population neural activity in moving C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the neural representation of locomotion in the nematode C. elegans by recording population calcium activity during movement. We report that population activity more accurately decodes locomotion than any single neuron. Relevant signals are distributed across neurons with diverse tunings to locomotion. Two largely distinct subpopulations are informative for decoding velocity and curvature, and different neurons’ activities contribute features relevant for different aspects of a behavior or different instances of a behavioral motif. To validate our measurements, we labeled neurons AVAL and AVAR and found that their activity exhibited expected transients during backward locomotion. Finally, we compared population activity during movement and immobilization. Immobilization alters the correlation structure of neural activity and its dynamics. Some neurons positively correlated with AVA during movement become negatively correlated during immobilization and vice versa. This work provides needed experimental measurements that inform and constrain ongoing efforts to understand population dynamics underlying locomotion in C. elegans.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NirD curtails the stringent response by inhibiting RelA activity in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria regulate their metabolism to adapt and survive adverse conditions, in particular to stressful downshifts in nutrient availability. These shifts trigger the so-called stringent response, coordinated by the signaling molecules guanosine tetra and pentaphosphate collectively referred to as (p)ppGpp. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, accumulation of theses alarmones depends on the (p)ppGpp synthetase RelA and the bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase SpoT. A tight regulation of these intracellular activities is therefore crucial to rapidly adjust the (p)ppGpp levels in response to environmental stresses but also to avoid toxic consequences of (p)ppGpp over-accumulation. In this study, we show that the small protein NirD restrains RelA-dependent accumulation of (p)ppGpp and can inhibit the stringent response in <i>E. coli</i>. Mechanistically, our in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that NirD directly binds the catalytic domains of RelA to balance (p)ppGpp accumulation. Finally, we show that NirD can control RelA activity by directly inhibiting the rate of (p)ppGpp synthesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Interrogating theoretical models of neural computation with emergent property inference</a></h4>

              
                A cornerstone of theoretical neuroscience is the circuit model: a system of equations that captures a hypothesized neural mechanism. Such models are valuable when they give rise to an experimentally observed phenomenon -- whether behavioral or a pattern of neural activity -- and thus can offer insights into neural computation. The operation of these circuits, like all models, critically depends on the choice of model parameters. A key step is then to identify the model parameters consistent with observed phenomena: to solve the inverse problem. In this work, we present a novel technique, emergent property inference (EPI), that brings the modern probabilistic modeling toolkit to theoretical neuroscience. When theorizing circuit models, theoreticians predominantly focus on reproducing computational properties rather than a particular dataset. Our method uses deep neural networks to learn parameter distributions with these computational properties. This methodology is introduced through a motivational example of parameter inference in the stomatogastric ganglion. EPI is then shown to allow precise control over the behavior of inferred parameters and to scale in parameter dimension better than alternative techniques. In the remainder of this work, we present novel theoretical findings in models of primary visual cortex and superior colliculus, which were gained through the examination of complex parametric structure captured by EPI. Beyond its scientific contribution, this work illustrates the variety of analyses possible once deep learning is harnessed towards solving theoretical inverse problems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An autoinhibitory clamp of actin assembly constrains and directs synaptic endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic membrane-remodeling events such as endocytosis require force-generating actin assembly. The endocytic machinery that regulates these actin and membrane dynamics localizes at high concentrations to large areas of the presynaptic membrane, but actin assembly and productive endocytosis are far more restricted in space and time. Here we describe a mechanism whereby autoinhibition clamps the presynaptic endocytic machinery to limit actin assembly to discrete functional events. We found that collective interactions between the <i>Drosophila</i> endocytic proteins Nwk/FCHSD2, Dap160/intersectin, and WASp relieve Nwk autoinhibition and promote robust membrane-coupled actin assembly in vitro. Using automated particle tracking to quantify synaptic actin dynamics in vivo, we discovered that Nwk-Dap160 interactions constrain spurious assembly of WASp-dependent actin structures. These interactions also promote synaptic endocytosis, suggesting that autoinhibition both clamps and primes the synaptic endocytic machinery, thereby constraining actin assembly to drive productive membrane remodeling in response to physiological cues.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A subset of CB002 xanthine analogs bypass p53-signaling to restore a p53 transcriptome and target an S-phase cell cycle checkpoint in tumors with mutated-p53</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in TP53 occur commonly in the majority of human tumors and confer aggressive tumor phenotypes, including metastasis and therapy resistance. CB002 and structural-analogs restore p53 signaling in tumors with mutant-p53 but we find that unlike other xanthines such as caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline, they do not deregulate the G2 checkpoint. Novel CB002-analogs induce pro-apoptotic Noxa protein in an ATF3/4-dependent manner, whereas caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline do not. By contrast to caffeine, CB002-analogs target an S-phase checkpoint associated with increased p-RPA/RPA2, p-ATR, decreased Cyclin A, p-histone H3 expression, and downregulation of essential proteins in DNA-synthesis and DNA-repair. CB002-analog #4 enhances cell death, and decreases Ki-67 in patient-derived tumor-organoids without toxicity to normal human cells. Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy in mice. Thus, a novel class of anti-cancer drugs shows the activation of p53 pathway signaling in tumors with mutated p53, and targets an S-phase checkpoint.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Disrupting cortico-cerebellar communication impairs dexterity</a></h4>

              
                To control reaching, the nervous system must generate large changes in muscle activation to drive the limb toward the target, and must also make smaller adjustments for precise and accurate behavior. Motor cortex controls the arm through projections to diverse targets across the central nervous system, but it has been challenging to identify the roles of cortical projections to specific targets. Here, we selectively disrupt cortico-cerebellar communication in the mouse by optogenetically stimulating the pontine nuclei in a cued reaching task. This perturbation did not typically block movement initiation, but degraded the precision, accuracy, duration, or success rate of the movement. Correspondingly, cerebellar and cortical activity during movement were largely preserved, but differences in hand velocity between control and stimulation conditions predicted from neural activity were correlated with observed velocity differences. These results suggest that while the total output of motor cortex drives reaching, the cortico-cerebellar loop makes small adjustments that contribute to the successful execution of this dexterous movement.

                Neurons are highly polarized cells forming an intricate network of dendrites and axons. They are shaped by the dynamic reorganization of cytoskeleton components and cellular organelles. Axon branching allows to form new paths and increases circuit complexity. However, our understanding of branch formation is sparse due to technical limitations. Using in situ cellular cryo-electron tomography on primary mouse neurons, we directly visualized the remodeling of organelles and cytoskeleton structures at axon branches. Strikingly, branched areas functioned as hotspots concentrating organelles to support dynamic activities. Unaligned actin filaments assembled at the base of premature branches and remained while filopodia diminished. Microtubules and ER co-migrated into preformed branches to support outgrowth together with accumulating compact ~500 nm mitochondria and locally clustered ribosomes. We obtained a roadmap of events and present the first direct evidence of local protein synthesis selectively taking place at axon branches, allowing to serve as unique control hubs for axon development and downstream neural network formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-species comparison of human and rodent primary reward consumption under budget constraints</a></h4>

              
                We live in a world of limited resources. Optimal use of resources is therefore of great importance for survival. Previous studies have shown that rodents optimize their allocation of a limited number of operant responses (akin to a finite budget) to trade for food rewards. Here, we propose a novel human cost-benefit decision paradigm translated from an economic choice task initially developed for rodents, to examine human consumption of primary rewards in a budget-constrained consumption scenario. In the first study, heterosexual male participants made effortful presses to obtain the opportunity to watch erotic pictures (task 1: picture task) or drink milk rewards (task 2: milk task) with a limited budget (i.e. finite total amount of presses). Participants adapted their choice allocation when the price (i.e. number of presses required to produce a reward) and the budget changed. We compared our participants' choice pattern to that of rodent consumers performing a matched economic decision task. Our cross-species comparison suggests that humans responded to price and budget changes in a similar way as rat consumers when purchasing milk rewards. However, this was not the case when purchasing the opportunity to watch picture rewards: compared to the milk task and to the rodent task, participants made more internally inconsistent choices in the picture task that failed to comply to the requirements of rational choice theory, despite otherwise identical task structure. We found non-linear changes in arousal state as a function of choice selection of rewards that might potentially underlie the increased choice inconsistency in the picture task. In two control experiments, we replicated our main findings. Our study shows that humans and rodents comply surprisingly well to the predictions of rational choice theory, but that deviations from the rational ideal can be elicited depending on the reward type.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Muscarinic receptors mediate motivation via preparatory neural activity in humans</a></h4>

              
                Motivation depends on dopamine, but might be modulated by acetylcholine which influences dopamine release in the striatum, and amplifies motivation in animal studies. A corresponding effect in humans would be important clinically, since anticholinergic drugs are frequently used in Parkinson's disease, a condition that can also disrupt motivation. Reward and dopamine make us more ready to respond, as indexed by reaction times (RT), and move faster, sometimes termed vigour. These effects may be controlled by preparatory processes that can be tracked using EEG. We measured vigour in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of trihexyphenidyl (THP), a muscarinic antagonist, with an incentivised eye movement task and EEG. Participants responded faster and with greater vigour when incentives were high, but THP blunted these motivation effects, suggesting that muscarinic receptors facilitate invigoration by reward. Preparatory EEG build-up (contingent negative variation; CNV) was strengthened by high incentives and by muscarinic blockade. The amplitude of preparatory activity predicted both vigour and RT, although over distinct scalp regions. Frontal activity predicted vigour, whereas a larger, earlier, central component predicted RT. Indeed the incentivisation of RT was partly mediated by the CNV, though vigour was not. Moreover, the CNV mediated the drug's effect on dampening incentives, suggesting that muscarinic receptors underlie the motivational influence on this preparatory activity. Taken together, these findings show that a muscarinic blocker used to treat Parkinson's disease impairs motivated action in healthy people, and that medial frontal preparatory neural activity mediates this for RT.

                Creative cognition relies on the ability to form remote associations between concepts, which allows to generate novel ideas or solve new problems. Such an ability is related to the organisation of semantic memory; yet whether real-life creative behaviour relies on semantic memory organisation and its neural substrates remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored associations between brain functional connectivity patterns, network properties of individual semantic memory, and real-life creativity. We acquired multi-echo functional MRI data while participants underwent a semantic relatedness judgment task. These ratings were used to estimate their individual semantic memory networks, whose properties significantly predicted their real-life creativity. Using a connectome-based predictive modelling approach, we identified patterns of task-based functional connectivity that predicted creativity-related semantic memory network properties. Furthermore, these properties mediated the relationship between functional connectivity and real-life creativity. These results provide new insights into how brain connectivity supports the associative mechanisms of creativity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability of Mouse Behavioural Tests of Anxiety: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Anxiolytics.</a></h4>

              
                Animal research on anxiety and anxiety disorders relies on valid animal models of anxiety. However, the validity of widely used rodent behavioural tests of anxiety has repeatedly been questioned, as they often fail to produce consistent results across independent replicate studies using different study populations or different anxiolytic compounds. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of behavioural tests of anxiety in mice to detect anxiolytic effects of drugs prescribed to treat anxiety in humans. To this end, we conducted a pre-registered systematic review of studies reporting tests of anxiolytic compounds against a control treatment using common behavioural tests of anxiety in mice. PubMed and EMBASE were searched on August 21 st 2019 for studies published in English and 814 papers were identified for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed based on Syrcles risk of bias tool and the Camarades study quality checklist on a randomly selected subsample of 180 papers. Meta-analyses on effect sizes of treatments using standardized mean differences (Hedges g) showed that only two of 17 test measures reliably detected effects of anxiolytic compounds other than diazepam. Further, we report considerable variation in both direction and size of effects of most anxiolytics on most outcome variables, indicating poor replicability of test results. This was corroborated by high heterogeneity in most test measures. Finally, we found an overall high risk of bias. Our findings indicate a general lack of sensitivity of common behavioural tests of anxiety in mice to anxiolytic compounds and cast serious doubt on both construct and predictive validity of most of those tests. The use of animals to model human conditions can be justified only if the expected results are informative, reproducible, and translatable. In view of scientifically valid and ethically responsible research, we call for a revision of behavioural tests of anxiety in mice and the development of more predictive tests .

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">GFAP-IL6 transgenic mice are characterised by astroglial and microglial activation predominantly in the cerebellum, hallmarks of many neuroinflammatory conditions. However, information available regarding the proteome profile associated with IL-6 overexpression in the mouse brain is limited. This study investigated the cerebellum proteome using a top-down proteomics approach using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry and correlated these data with motor deficits using the elevated beam walking and accelerod tests. In a detailed proteomic analysis, a total of 67 differentially expressed proteoforms including 47 cytosolic and 20 membrane-bound proteoforms were identified. Bioinformatics and literature mining analyses revealed that these proteins were associated with three distinct classes: metabolic and neurodegenerative processes as well as protein aggregation. The GFAP-IL6 mice exhibited impaired motor skills in the elevated beam walking test measured by their average scores of ‘number of footslips’ and ‘time to traverse’ values. Correlation of the proteoforms' expression levels with the motor test scores showed a significant positive correlation to peroxiredoxin-6 and negative correlation to alpha-internexin and mitochondrial cristae subunit Mic19. These findings suggest that the observed changes in the proteoform levels caused by IL-6 overexpression might contribute to the motor function deficits.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of death and disability in both civilian and military population. TBI may occur via a variety of etiologies, all of which involve trauma to the head. However, the neuroprotective drugs which were found to be very effective in animal TBI models failed in phase II or phase III clinical trials, emphasizing a compelling need to review the current status of animal TBI models and therapeutic strategies. No single animal model can adequately mimic all aspects of human TBI owing to the heterogeneity of clinical TBI. However, due to the ethical limitations, it is difficult to precisely emulate the TBI mechanisms that occur in humans. Therefore, many animal models with varying severity and mechanisms of brain injury have been developed, and each model has its own pros and cons in its implementation for TBI research. These challenges pose a need for study of continued TBI mechanisms, brain injury severity, duration, treatment strategies, and optimization of animal models across the neurotrauma research community. The aim of this review is to discuss (1) causes of TBI, (2) its prevalence in military and civilian population, (3) classification and pathophysiology of TBI, (4) biomarkers and detection methods, (5) animal models of TBI, and (6) the advantages and disadvantages of each model and the species used, as well as possible treatments.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">The purpose of this study was to determine the form of the relation between the mean amplitude and variance of motor-evoked potentials (MEP). To this end, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the motor cortex of seventeen neurologically normal adult human subjects. The coil was positioned at a locus on the scalp that elicited an MEP in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) at the lowest stimulus intensity. The subjects were instructed to maintain tonic activity in the FDI of 5 or 10% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). The relation between MEP variance and amplitude was found to have an inverted parabolic shape, with maximal variance occurring near the half-maximal MEP amplitude. The coefficient of variation <span class="a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq1">

                  </span> of MEPs decreased approximately as a rectangular hyperbolic function of MEP amplitude (i.e. ~ 1/MEP). A probabilistic model is proposed to explain the inverted parabolic relation between MEP variance and MEP amplitude, as well as the sigmoid shape of the MEP input–output relation (i.e. stimulus–response curve). The model is based on a description of α-motoneurons as binary threshold units, with unit thresholds distributed according to a positively skewed probability density function. The units are driven by noisy synaptic input currents having a Gaussian distribution. The model predicts an inverse parabolic relation between MEP variance and amplitude and a sigmoid input–output relation, as experimentally observed. Furthermore, increasing model motoneuron excitability by increasing the background synaptic drive increases MEP variability independently of MEP size, a surprising prediction. The model also explains the approximately rectangular hyperbolic relation between <span class="a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq2">

                  </span> and MEP amplitude. The implications of these results for the interpretation of neurophysiological experiments and the statistical analysis of MEPs are discussed.</p>

	<p>A reliable method for non-invasive detection of dangerous intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations is still unavailable. In this preliminary study, we investigate quantitatively our observation that superimposing waveforms of transcranial Doppler blood flow velocity (FV) and arterial blood pressure (ABP) may help in non-invasive identification of ICP plateau waves. Recordings of FV, ABP and ICP in 160 patients with severe head injury (treated in the Neurocritical Care Unit at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK) were reviewed retrospectively. From that cohort, we identified 18 plateau waves registered in eight patients. A “measure of dissimilarity” (Dissimilarity/Difference Index, DI) between ABP and FV waveforms was calculated in three following steps: 1. fragmentation of ABP and FV signal according to cardiac cycle; 2. obtaining the normalised representative ABP and FV cycles; and finally; 3. assessing their difference, represented by the area between both curves. DI appeared to discriminate ICP plateau waves from baseline episodes slightly better than conventional pulsatility index did: area under ROC curve 0.92 vs. 0.90, sensitivity 0.81 vs. 0.69, accuracy 0.88 vs. 0.84, respectively. The concept of DI, if further tested and improved, might be used for non-invasive detection of ICP plateau waves.</p>

	<p>Hemispheric asymmetries in affective and cognitive functions have been extensively studied. While both cerebral hemispheres contribute to most affective and cognitive processes, neuroscientific literature and neuropsychological evidence support an overall right hemispheric dominance for emotion, attention and arousal. Emotional stimuli, especially those with survival value such as threat, tend to be prioritized in attentional resource competition. Arousing unpleasant emotional stimuli have prioritized access, especially to right-lateralized attention networks. Interference of task performance may be observed when limited resources are exhausted by task- and emotion-related processing. Tasks that rely on right hemisphere-dependent processing, like attending to the left visual hemifield or global-level visual features, are especially vulnerable to interference due to attention capture by unpleasant emotional stimuli. The aim of this review is to present literature regarding the special role of the right hemisphere in affective and attentional brain processes and their interaction. Furthermore, clinical and technological implications of this interaction will be presented. Initially, the effects of focal right hemisphere lesion or atrophy on emotional functions will be introduced. Neurological right hemisphere syndromes including aprosodia, anosognosia and neglect, which further point to the predominance of the intact right hemisphere in emotion, attention and arousal will be presented. Then there will be a brief review of electrophysiological evidence, as well as evidence from patients with neglect that support attention capture by emotional stimuli in the right hemisphere. Subsequently, experimental work on the interaction of emotion, attention and cognition in the right hemispheres of healthy subjects will be presented. Finally, clinical implications for better understanding and assessment of alterations in emotion–attention interaction due to brain disorder or treatment, such as neuromodulation, that impact affective brain functions will be discussed. It will be suggested that measuring right hemispheric emotion–attention interactions may provide basis for novel biomarkers of brain health. Such biomarkers allow for improved diagnostics in brain damage and disorders and optimized treatments. To conclude, future technological applications will be outlined regarding brain physiology-based measures that reflect engagement of the right hemisphere in affective and attentional processes.</p>

	<p> Visual encoding models are important computational models for understanding how information is processed along the visual stream. Many improved visual encoding models have been developed from the perspective of the model architecture and the learning objective, but these are limited to the supervised learning method. From the view of unsupervised learning mechanisms, this paper utilized a pre-trained neural network to construct a visual encoding model based on contrastive self-supervised learning for the ventral visual stream measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We first extracted features using the ResNet50 model pre-trained in contrastive self-supervised learning (ResNet50-CSL model), trained a linear regression model for each voxel, and finally calculated the prediction accuracy of different voxels. Compared with the ResNet50 model pre-trained in a supervised classification task, the ResNet50-CSL model achieved an equal or even relatively better encoding performance in multiple visual cortical areas. Moreover, the ResNet50-CSL model performs hierarchical representation of input visual stimuli, which is similar to the human visual cortex in its hierarchical information processing. Our experimental results suggest that the encoding model based on contrastive self-supervised learning is a strong computational model to compete with supervised models, and contrastive self-supervised learning proves an effective learning method to extract human brain-like representations.</p>

	<p>In the context of geriatric research, a growing body of evidence links normal age-related changes in sleep with many adverse health outcomes, especially a decline in cognition in older adults. The most important sleep alterations that continue to worsen after 60 years involve sleep timing, (especially early wake time, phase advance), sleep maintenance (continuity of sleep interrupted by numerous awakenings) and reduced amount of sigma activity (during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep) associated with modifications of sleep spindle characteristics (density, amplitude, frequency) and spindle–Slow Wave coupling. After 60 years, there is a very clear gender-dependent deterioration in sleep. Even if there are degradations of sleep after 60 years, daytime wake level and especially daytime sleepiness is not modified with age. On the other hand, under sleep deprivation condition, older adults show smaller cognitive impairments than younger adults, suggesting an age-related lower vulnerability to extended wakefulness. These sleep and cognitive age-related modifications would be due to a reduced homeostatic drive and consequently a reduced sleep need, an attenuation of circadian drive (reduction of sleep forbidden zone in late afternoon and wake forbidden zone in early morning), a modification of the interaction of the circadian and homeostatic processes and/or an alteration of subcortical structures involved in generation of circadian and homeostatic drive, or connections to the cerebral cortex with age. The modifications and interactions of these two processes with age are still uncertain, and still require further investigation. The understanding of the respective contribution of circadian and homeostatic processes in the regulation of neurobehavioral function with aging present a challenge for improving health, management of cognitive decline and potential early chronobiological or sleep-wake interventions.</p>

	<p>Cognitive impairment after a stroke has a direct impact on patients’ disability. In particular, impairment of Executive Functions (EFs) interferes with re-adaptation to daily life. The aim of this study was to explore whether adding a computer-based training on EFs to an ordinary rehabilitation program, regardless of the specific brain damage and clinical impairment (motor, language, or cognitive), could improve rehabilitation outcomes in patients with stroke. An EF training was designed to have minimal motor and expressive language demands and to be applied to a wide range of clinical conditions. A total of 37 stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a training group, which performed the EF training in addition to the ordinary rehabilitation program (treatment as usual), and a control group, which performed the ordinary rehabilitation exclusively. Both groups were assessed before and after the rehabilitation program on neuropsychological tests covering multiple cognitive domains, and on functional scales (Barthel index, Functional Independence Measure). The results showed that only patients who received the training improved their scores on the Attentional Matrices and Phonemic Fluency tests after the rehabilitation program. Moreover, they showed a greater functional improvement in the Barthel scale as well. These results suggest that combining an EF training with an ordinary rehabilitation program potentiates beneficial effects of the latter, especially in promoting independence in activities of daily living.</p>

	<p>Despite the high number of studies on mental health among healthcare workers, only a few have attempted to assess the mental health of people with chronic diseases during the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression among people with chronic diseases working in healthcare and in other professions. The study participants were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 441 healthcare workers, and the second consisted of 572 non-healthcare professionals. Correlation analysis showed a strong correlation between autoimmune diseases and an increase in GAD-7 scale, ISI score, and PHQ-9 scale. Therefore, only autoimmune diseases were included for further analyses as a predictor of insomnia, depression, and anxiety. After adjusting the results for gender, age, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and profession, the group with autoimmune diseases showed a more than a 2-fold increase in the risk of anxiety symptoms, a more than 2.5-fold increase in the risk of depressive symptoms, and a 4-fold increase in the risk of insomnia symptoms. This study shows that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of insomnia, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders may depend on the pre-existent health status of an individual rather than on their profession.</p>

	<p>The centrally projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWcp) is a midbrain neuronal group, adjacent but segregated from the preganglionic Edinger-Westphal nucleus that projects to the ciliary ganglion. The EWcp plays a crucial role in stress responses and in maintaining energy homeostasis under conditions that require an adjustment of energy expenditure, by virtue of modulating heart rate and blood pressure, thermogenesis, food intake, and fat and glucose metabolism. This modulation is ultimately mediated by changes in the sympathetic outflow to several effector organs, including the adrenal gland, heart, kidneys, brown and white adipose tissues and pancreas, in response to environmental conditions and the animal’s energy state, providing for appropriate energy utilization. Classic neuroanatomical studies have shown that the EWcp receives inputs from forebrain regions involved in these functions and projects to presympathetic neuronal populations in the brainstem. Transneuronal tracing with pseudorabies virus has demonstrated that the EWcp is connected polysynaptically with central circuits that provide sympathetic innervation to all these effector organs that are critical for stress responses and energy homeostasis. We propose that EWcp integrates multimodal signals (stress, thermal, metabolic, endocrine, etc.) and modulates the sympathetic output simultaneously to multiple effector organs to maintain energy homeostasis under different conditions that require adjustments of energy demands.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The aim of the present study was to validate the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11th version) scale as well as the short version of the Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS-P) in a population of Greek young adults. Secondly, we aimed at validating the BIS-11 in older adults. Methods: 167 (Group 1) university students completed the Greek version of the BIS-11 (BIS-11-G) and the UPPS (UPPS-P-G) scales. Additionally, BIS-11-G was also administered to 167 (Group 2) cognitively intact older adults, to identify whether it could be used to measure impulsivity in an older adult population. Results: Both scales had satisfactory internal reliability and test–retest reliability, as well as convergent validity in the young adult population. In regard to the factor structure, a principal component analysis (PCA) extracted two factors for the BIS-11-G in the young adult population and three factors in older adults, as well as three factors for the short UPPS-P-G in young adults. Conclusions: The BIS-11-G and the UPPS-P-G scales can be used to measure different aspects of impulsivity in the Greek population of different ages in research and clinical practice.</p>

                <p>In an interconnected world, understanding policy spillovers is essential. We propose a program evaluation framework to measure policy spillover effects and apply that framework to study the governmental responses to COVID-19 in the United States. Our analysis suggests the presence of social spillovers. We estimate that while state closures directly reduced mobility by 3 to 4%, all other states locking down further decreased mobility in the focal state by 8 to 14%. Similarly, while reopening directly increased mobility by 2 to 3%, all other states&rsquo; reopening increased mobility in the focal state by 12 to 21%. Our analysis also suggests geographic spillovers: Travel from locked down origins to open destinations increased by 12 to 29%. In contrast, travel from reopened origins to locked down destinations decreased by 6 to 7% for nearby counties and by 14 to 18% for distant counties. Despite its limitations, we believe that our approach takes the first steps toward creating a framework for interdependent program evaluation across policy domains.</p>

                <p>Self-assembled ionic liquid crystals can transport water and ions via the periodic nanochannels, and these materials are promising candidates as water treatment membranes. Molecular insights on the water transport process are, however, less investigated because of computational difficulties of ionic soft matters and the self-assembly. Here we report specific behavior of water molecules in the nanochannels by using the self-consistent modeling combining density functional theory and molecular dynamics and the large-scale molecular dynamics calculation. The simulations clearly provide the one-dimensional (1D) and 3D-interconnected nanochannels of self-assembled columnar and bicontinuous structures, respectively, with the precise mesoscale order observed by x-ray diffraction measurement. Water molecules are then confined inside the nanochannels with the formation of hydrogen bonding network. The quantitative analyses of free energetics and anisotropic diffusivity reveal that, the mesoscale geometry of 1D nanodomain profits the nature of water transport via advantages of dissolution and diffusion mechanisms inside the ionic nanochannels.</p>

                <p>Understanding of dedifferentiation, an indicator of poo prognosis for patients with thyroid cancer, has been hampered by imprecise and incomplete characterization of its heterogeneity and its attributes. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we explored the landscape of thyroid cancer at single-cell resolution with 46,205 cells and delineated its dedifferentiation process and suppressive immune microenvironment. The developmental trajectory indicated that anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells were derived from a small subset of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cells. Moreover, a potential functional role of <I>CREB3L1</I> on ATC development was revealed by integrated analyses of copy number alteration and transcriptional regulatory network. Multiple genes in differentiation-related pathways (e.g., EMT) were involved as the downstream targets of CREB3L1, increased expression of which can thus predict higher relapse risk of PTC. Collectively, our study provided insights into the heterogeneity and molecular evolution of thyroid cancer and highlighted the potential driver role of <I>CREB3L1</I> in its dedifferentiation process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Ultrafast electron cycloids driven by the transverse spin of a surface acoustic wave</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spin-momentum locking is a universal wave phenomenon promising for applications in electronics and photonics. In acoustics, Lord Rayleigh showed that surface acoustic waves exhibit a characteristic elliptical particle motion strikingly similar to spin-momentum locking. Although these waves have become one of the few phononic technologies of industrial relevance, the observation of their transverse spin remained an open challenge. Here, we observe the full spin dynamics by detecting ultrafast electron cycloids driven by the gyrating electric field produced by a surface acoustic wave propagating on a slab of lithium niobate. A tubular quantum well wrapped around a nanowire serves as an ultrafast sensor tracking the full cyclic motion of electrons. Our acousto-optoelectrical approach opens previously unknown directions in the merged fields of nanoacoustics, nanophotonics, and nanoelectronics for future exploration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Increasing precipitation variability on daily-to-multiyear time scales in a warmer world</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hydrological cycle intensifies under global warming with precipitation increases. How the increased precipitation varies temporally at a given location has vital implications for regional climates and ecosystem services. On the basis of ensemble climate model projections under a high-emission scenario, here, we show that approximately two-thirds of land on Earth will face a "wetter and more variable" hydroclimate on daily to multiyear time scales. This means wider swings between wet and dry extremes. Such an amplification of precipitation variability is particularly prominent over climatologically wet regions, with percentage increases in variability more than twice those in mean precipitation. Thermodynamic effects, linked to increased moisture availability, increase precipitation variability uniformly everywhere. It is the dynamic effects (negative) linked to weakened circulation variability that make precipitation variability changes strongly region dependent. The increase in precipitation variability poses an additional challenge to the climate resilience of infrastructures and human society.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Testosterone and socioeconomic position: Mendelian randomization in 306,248 men and women in UK Biobank</a></h4>

              
                <p>Men with more advantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) have been observed to have higher levels of testosterone. It is unclear whether these associations arise because testosterone has a causal impact on SEP. In 306,248 participants of UK Biobank, we performed sex-stratified genome-wide association analysis to identify genetic variants associated with testosterone. Using the identified variants, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis of the influence of testosterone on socioeconomic position, including income, employment status, neighborhood-level deprivation, and educational qualifications; on health, including self-rated health and body mass index; and on risk-taking behavior. We found little evidence that testosterone affected socioeconomic position, health, or risk-taking. Our results therefore suggest that it is unlikely that testosterone meaningfully affects these outcomes in men or women. Differences between Mendelian randomization and multivariable-adjusted estimates suggest that previously reported associations with socioeconomic position and health may be due to residual confounding or reverse causation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Model-based aversive learning in humans is supported by preferential task state reactivation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Harm avoidance is critical for survival, yet little is known regarding the neural mechanisms supporting avoidance in the absence of trial-and-error experience. Flexible avoidance may be supported by a mental model (i.e., model-based), a process for which neural reactivation and sequential replay have emerged as candidate mechanisms. During an aversive learning task, combined with magnetoencephalography, we show prospective and retrospective reactivation during planning and learning, respectively, coupled to evidence for sequential replay. Specifically, when individuals plan in an aversive context, we find preferential reactivation of subsequently chosen goal states. Stronger reactivation is associated with greater hippocampal theta power. At outcome receipt, unchosen goal states are reactivated regardless of outcome valence. Replay of paths leading to goal states was modulated by outcome valence, with aversive outcomes associated with stronger reverse replay than safe outcomes. Our findings are suggestive of avoidance involving simulation of unexperienced states through hippocampally mediated reactivation and replay.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Size- and composition-controlled intermetallic nanocrystals via amalgamation seeded growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Intermetallic nanocrystals are a large family of emerging materials with extensive applications in many fields. Yet, a generalized synthetic method for intermetallic nanocrystals is lacking. Here, we report the development of a colloidal synthesis method based on amalgamation of monometallic nanocrystal seeds with low&ndash;melting point metals. We use this approach to achieve crystalline and compositionally uniform intermetallic nanocrystals of Au-Ga, Ag-Ga, Cu-Ga, Ni-Ga, Pd-Ga, Pd-In, and Pd-Zn compounds. We demonstrate both compositional tunability across the phase spaces (e.g., AuGa<SUB>2</SUB>, AuGa, Au<SUB>7</SUB>Ga<SUB>2</SUB>, and Ga-doped Au), size tunability (e.g., 14.0-, 7.6-, and 3.8-nm AuGa<SUB>2</SUB>), and size uniformity (e.g., 5.4% size deviations). This approach makes it possible to systematically achieve size- and composition-controlled intermetallic nanocrystals, opening up a multitude of possibilities for these materials.</p>

                <p>Integrating signals is essential for cell survival, leading to the concept of synthetic lethality. However, how signaling is integrated to control cell migration remains unclear. By conducting a "two-hit" screen, we revealed the synergistic reduction of cell migration when serine-threonine kinase 40 (STK40) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were simultaneously suppressed. Single-cell analyses showed that STK40 knockdown reduced cell motility and coordination by strengthening focal adhesion (FA) complexes. Furthermore, STK40 knockdown reduced the stability of yes-associated protein (YAP) and subsequently decreased YAP transported into the nucleus, while MAPK inhibition further weakened YAP activities in the nucleus to disturb FA remodeling. Together, we unveiled an integrated STK40-YAP-MAPK system regulating cell migration and introduced "synthetic dysmobility" as a novel strategy to collaboratively control cell migration.</p>

                <p>Biomaterials without exogenous cells or therapeutic agents often fail to achieve rapid endogenous bone regeneration with high quality. Here, we reported a class of three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber scaffolds with hierarchical structure and controlled alignment for effective endogenous cranial bone regeneration. 3D scaffolds consisting of radially aligned nanofibers guided and promoted the migration of bone marrow stem cells from the surrounding region to the center in vitro. These scaffolds showed the highest new bone volume, surface coverage, and mineral density among the tested groups in vivo. The regenerated bone exhibited a radially aligned fashion, closely recapitulating the scaffold&rsquo;s architecture. The organic phase in regenerated bone showed an aligned, layered, and densely packed structure, while the inorganic mineral phase showed a uniform distribution with smaller pore size and an even distribution of stress upon the simulated compression. We expect that this study will inspire the design of next-generation biomaterials for effective endogenous bone regeneration with desired quality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Molecular mechanism for kinesin-1 direct membrane recognition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cargo-binding capabilities of cytoskeletal motor proteins have expanded during evolution through both gene duplication and alternative splicing. For the light chains of the kinesin-1 family of microtubule motors, this has resulted in an array of carboxyl-terminal domain sequences of unknown molecular function. Here, combining phylogenetic analyses with biophysical, biochemical, and cell biology approaches, we identify a highly conserved membrane-induced curvature-sensitive amphipathic helix within this region of a subset of long kinesin light-chain paralogs and splice isoforms. This helix mediates the direct binding of kinesin-1 to lipid membranes. Membrane binding requires specific anionic phospholipids, and it contributes to kinesin-1&ndash;dependent lysosome positioning, a canonical activity that, until now, has been attributed exclusively the recognition of organelle-associated cargo adaptor proteins. This leads us to propose a protein-lipid coincidence detection framework for kinesin-1&ndash;mediated organelle transport.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Unifying fluctuation-dissipation temperatures of slow-evolving nonequilibrium systems from the perspective of inherent structures</a></h4>

              
                <p>For nonequilibrium systems, how to define temperature is one of the key and difficult issues to solve. Although effective temperatures have been proposed and studied to this end, it still remains elusive what they actually are. Here, we focus on the fluctuation-dissipation temperatures and report that such effective temperatures of slow-evolving systems represent characteristic temperatures of their equilibrium counterparts. By calculating the fluctuation-dissipation relation of inherent structures, we obtain a temperature-like quantity <I>T</I><SUB>IS</SUB>. For monocomponent crystal-formers, <I>T</I><SUB>IS</SUB> agrees well with the crystallization temperature <I>T</I><SUB>c</SUB>, while it matches with the onset temperature <I>T</I><SUB>on</SUB> for glass-formers. It also agrees with effective temperatures of typical nonequilibrium systems, such as aging glasses, quasi-static shear flows, and quasi-static self-propelled flows. From the unique perspective of inherent structures, our study reveals the nature of effective temperatures and the underlying connections between nonequilibrium and equilibrium systems and confirms the equivalence between <I>T</I><SUB>on</SUB> and <I>T</I><SUB>c</SUB>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Regulation of telomere homeostasis and genomic stability in cancer by N6-adenosine methylation (m6A)</a></h4>

              
                <p>The role of RNA methylation on <I>N</I><sup>6</sup>-adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) in cancer has been acknowledged, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we identified homeobox containing 1 (<I>HMBOX1</I>) as an authentic target mRNA of m<sup>6</sup>A machinery, which is highly methylated in malignant cells compared to the normal counterparts and subject to expedited degradation upon the modification. m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated down-regulation of <I>HMBOX1</I> causes telomere dysfunction and inactivation of p53 signaling, which leads to chromosome abnormalities and aggressive phenotypes. CRISPR-based, m<sup>6</sup>A-editing tools further prove that the methyl groups on <I>HMBOX1</I> per se contribute to the generation of altered cancer genome. In multiple types of human cancers, expression of the RNA methyltransferase <I>METTL3</I> is negatively correlated with the telomere length but favorably with fractions of altered cancer genome, whereas <I>HMBOX1</I> mRNA levels show the opposite patterns. Our work suggests that the cancer-driving genomic alterations may potentially be fixed by rectifying particular epitranscriptomic program.</p>

An open access atlas has been launched to allow researchers to explore the expression of human protein-coding genes in 192 individual cell type clusters. An expression specificity classification was performed to determine the number of genes elevated in each cell type, allowing comparisons with bulk transcriptomics data. The analysis highlights distinct expression clusters corresponding to cell types sharing similar functions, both within the same organs and between organs.</p>

                <p>Rationally designed protein subunit vaccines are being developed for a variety of viruses including influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. These vaccines are based on stabilized versions of the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies on the viral surface, namely, viral fusion glycoproteins. While these immunogens display the epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies, they also present epitopes recognized by non-neutralizing or weakly neutralizing ("off-target") antibodies. Using our recently developed electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping approach, we have uncovered a phenomenon wherein off-target antibodies elicited by HIV trimer subunit vaccines cause the otherwise highly stabilized trimeric proteins to degrade into cognate protomers. Further, we show that these protomers expose an expanded suite of off-target epitopes, normally occluded inside the prefusion conformation of trimer, that subsequently elicit further off-target antibody responses. Our study provides critical insights for further improvement of HIV subunit trimer vaccines for future rounds of the iterative vaccine design process.</p>

                <p>Bacteria often interact with their environment through extracellular molecules that increase access to limiting resources. These secretions can act as public goods, creating incentives for exploiters to invade and "steal" public goods away from producers. This phenomenon has been studied extensively in vitro, but little is known about the occurrence and impact of public good exploiters in the environment. Here, we develop a genomic approach to systematically identify bacteria that can exploit public goods produced during the degradation of polysaccharides. Focusing on chitin, a highly abundant marine biopolymer, we show that public good exploiters are active in natural chitin degrading microbial communities, invading early during colonization, and potentially hindering degradation. In contrast to in vitro studies, we find that exploiters and degraders belong to distant lineages, facilitating their coexistence. Our approach opens novel avenues to use the wealth of genomic data available to infer ecological roles and interactions among microbes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Predicting risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis using multimodality imaging and personalized heart modeling in a multivariable classifier</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS), an inflammatory disease characterized by formation of granulomas in the heart, is associated with high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular arrhythmias. Current "one-size-fits-all" guidelines for SCD risk assessment in CS result in insufficient appropriate primary prevention. Here, we present a two-step precision risk prediction technology for patients with CS. First, a patient&rsquo;s arrhythmogenic propensity arising from heterogeneous CS-induced ventricular remodeling is assessed using a novel personalized magnetic-resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography fusion mechanistic model. The resulting simulations of arrhythmogenesis are fed, together with a set of imaging and clinical biomarkers, into a supervised classifier. In a retrospective study of 45 patients, the technology achieved testing results of 60% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI): 57-63%], 72% specificity [95% CI: 70-74%], and 0.754 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI: 0.710-0.797]. It outperformed clinical metrics, highlighting its potential to transform CS risk stratification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cannabidiol Inhibition of Murine Primary Nociceptors: Tight Binding to Slow Inactivated States of Nav1.8 Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to have analgesic effects in animal studies but little is known about its mechanism of action. We examined the effects of CBD on intrinsic excitability of primary pain-sensing neurons. Studying acutely dissociated capsaicin-sensitive mouse DRG neurons at 37&deg;C, we found that CBD effectively inhibited repetitive action potential firing, from 15&ndash;20 action potentials evoked by 1 s current injections in control to 1&ndash;3 action potentials with 2 &mu;<scp>m</scp> CBD. Reduction of repetitive firing was accompanied by a reduction of action potential height, widening of action potentials, reduction of the afterhyperpolarization, and increased propensity to enter depolarization block. Voltage-clamp experiments showed that CBD inhibited both TTX-sensitive and TTX-resistant (TTX-R) sodium currents in a use-dependent manner. CBD showed strong state-dependent inhibition of TTX-R channels, with fast binding to inactivated channels during depolarizations and slow unbinding on repolarization. CBD alteration of channel availability at various voltages suggested that CBD binds especially tightly [<I>K</I><SUB>d</SUB> (dissociation constant), ~150 n<scp>m</scp>] to the slow inactivated state of TTX-R channels, which can be substantially occupied at voltages as negative as &ndash;40 mV. Remarkably, CBD was more potent in inhibiting TTX-R channels and inhibiting action potential firing than the local anesthetic bupivacaine. We conclude that CBD might produce some of its analgesic effects by direct effects on neuronal excitability, with tight binding to the slow inactivated state of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 channels contributing to effective inhibition of repetitive firing by modest depolarizations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to inhibit pain in various rodent models, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. We describe the ability of CBD to inhibit repetitive action potential firing in primary nociceptive neurons from mouse dorsal root ganglia and analyze the effects on voltage-dependent sodium channels. We find that CBD interacts with TTX-resistant sodium channels in a state-dependent manner suggesting particularly tight binding to slow inactivated states of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 channels, which dominate the overall inactivation of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 channels for small maintained depolarizations from the resting potential. The results suggest that CBD can exert analgesic effects in part by directly inhibiting repetitive firing of primary nociceptors and suggest a strategy of identifying compounds that bind selectively to slow inactivated states of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 channels for developing effective analgesics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subregion-Specific Regulation of Dopamine D1 Receptor Signaling in the Striatum: Implication for L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>The striatum is the main structure of the basal ganglia. The striatum receives inputs from various cortical areas, and its subregions play distinct roles in motor and emotional functions. Recently, striatal maps based on corticostriatal connectivity and striosome-matrix compartmentalization were developed, and we were able to subdivide the striatum into seven subregions. Dopaminergic modulation of the excitability of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) is critical for striatal function. In this study, we investigated the functional properties of dopamine signaling in seven subregions of the striatum from male mice. By monitoring the phosphorylation of PKA substrates including DARPP-32 in mouse striatal slices, we identified two subregions with low D1 receptor signaling: the dorsolateral portion of the intermediate/rostral part (DL-IR) and the intermediate/caudal part (IC). Low D1 receptor signaling in the two subregions was maintained by phosphodiesterase (PDE)10A and muscarinic M4 receptors. In an animal model of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced hemi-parkinsonism, D1 receptor signaling was upregulated in almost all subregions including the DL-IR, but not in the IC. When L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) was developed, D1 receptor signaling in the IC was upregulated and correlated with the severity of LID. Our results suggest that the function of the striatum is maintained through the subregion-specific regulation of dopamine D1 receptor signaling and that the aberrant activation of D1 receptor signaling in the IC is involved in LID. Future studies focusing on D1 receptor signaling in the IC of the striatum will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for LID.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent progress in striatal mapping based on corticostriatal connectivity and striosome-matrix compartmentalization allowed us to subdivide the striatum into seven subregions. Analyses of D1 receptor signaling in the seven subregions identified two unique subregions with low D1 receptor signaling: the dorsolateral portion of the intermediate/rostral part (DL-IR) and the intermediate/caudal part (IC). Aberrant activation of D1 receptor signaling in the IC is involved in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Previous studies of LID have mainly focused on the DL-IR, but not on the IC of the striatum. Future studies to clarify aberrant D1 receptor signaling in the IC are required to develop novel therapeutics for LID.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Protein Kinase C-Mediated Phosphorylation and {alpha}2{delta}-1 Interdependently Regulate NMDA Receptor Trafficking and Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>N</I>-methyl-<scp>d</scp>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are important for synaptic plasticity associated with many physiological functions and neurologic disorders. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation increases the phosphorylation and activity of NMDARs, and &alpha;2-1 is a critical NMDAR-interacting protein and controls synaptic trafficking of NMDARs. In this study, we determined the relative roles of PKC and &alpha;2-1 in the control of NMDAR activity. We found that &alpha;2-1 coexpression significantly increased NMDAR activity in HEK293 cells transfected with GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B. PKC activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased receptor activity only in cells coexpressing GluN1/GluN2A and &alpha;2-1. Remarkably, PKC inhibition with Go&#x0308;6983 abolished &alpha;2-1-coexpression-induced potentiation of NMDAR activity in cells transfected with GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B. Treatment with PMA increased the &alpha;2-1&ndash;GluN1 interaction and promoted &alpha;2-1 and GluN1 cell surface trafficking. PMA also significantly increased NMDAR activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons and the amount of &alpha;2-1-bound GluN1 protein complexes in spinal cord synaptosomes in wild-type mice, but not in &alpha;2-1 knockout mice. Furthermore, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with pregabalin or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction with the &alpha;2-1 C-terminus peptide abolished the potentiating effect of PMA on NMDAR activity. Additionally, using quantitative phosphoproteomics and mutagenesis analyses, we identified S929 on GluN2A and S1413 (S1415 in humans) on GluN2B as the phosphorylation sites responsible for NMDAR potentiation by PKC and &alpha;2-1. Together, our findings demonstrate the interdependence of &alpha;2-1 and PKC phosphorylation in regulating NMDAR trafficking and activity. The phosphorylation-dependent, dynamic &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction constitutes an important molecular mechanism of synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A major challenge in studies of protein phosphorylation is to define the functional significance of each phosphorylation event and determine how various signaling pathways are coordinated in response to neuronal activity to shape synaptic plasticity. PKC phosphorylates transporters, ion channels, and G-protein-coupled receptors in signal transduction. In this study, we showed that &alpha;2-1 is indispensable for PKC-activation-induced surface and synaptic trafficking of NMDARs, whereas the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction is controlled by PKC-induced phosphorylation. Our findings reveal that &alpha;2-1 mainly functions as a phospho-binding protein in the control of NMDAR trafficking and activity. This information provides new mechanistic insight into the reciprocal roles of PKC-mediated phosphorylation and &alpha;2-1 in regulating NMDARs and in the therapeutic actions of gabapentinoids.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Serine Protease Homolog, Scarface, Is Sensitive to Nutrient Availability and Modulates the Development of the Drosophila Blood-Brain Barrier</a></h4>

              
                <p>The adaptable transcriptional response to changes in food availability not only ensures animal survival but also lets embryonic development progress. Interestingly, the CNS is preferentially protected from periods of malnutrition, a phenomenon known as "brain sparing." However, the mechanisms that mediate this response remain poorly understood. To get a better understanding of this, we used <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> as a model, analyzing the transcriptional response of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) and glia of the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB) from larvae of both sexes during nutrient restriction using targeted DamID. We found differentially expressed genes in both neuroblasts and glia of the BBB, although the effect of nutrient deficiency was primarily observed in the BBB. We characterized the function of a nutritional sensitive gene expressed in the BBB, the serine protease homolog, <I>scarface</I> (<I>scaf</I>). Scaf is expressed in subperineurial glia in the BBB in response to nutrition. Tissue-specific knockdown of <I>scaf</I> increases subperineurial glia endoreplication and proliferation of perineurial glia in the blood&ndash;brain barrier. Furthermore, neuroblast proliferation is diminished on <I>scaf</I> knockdown in subperineurial glia. Interestingly, reexpression of Scaf in subperineurial glia is able to enhance neuroblast proliferation and brain growth of animals in starvation. Finally, we show that loss of <I>scaf</I> in the blood&ndash;brain barrier increases sensitivity to drugs in adulthood, suggesting a physiological impairment. We propose that Scaf integrates the nutrient status to modulate the balance between neurogenesis and growth of the BBB, preserving the proper equilibrium between the size of the barrier and the brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The <I>Drosophila</I> BBB separates the CNS from the open circulatory system. The BBB glia are not only acting as a physical segregation of tissues but participate in the regulation of the metabolism and neurogenesis during development. Here we analyze the transcriptional response of the BBB glia to nutrient deprivation during larval development, a condition in which protective mechanisms are switched on in the brain. Our findings show that the gene <I>scarface</I> reduces growth in the BBB while promoting the proliferation of neural stem, assuring the balanced growth of the larval brain. Thus, Scarface would link animal nutrition with brain development, coordinating neurogenesis with the growth of the BBB.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Generation and Characterization of a Cell Type-Specific, Inducible Cre-Driver Line to Study Olfactory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>In sensory systems of the brain, mechanisms exist to extract distinct features from stimuli to generate a variety of behavioral repertoires. These often correspond to different cell types at various stages in sensory processing. In the mammalian olfactory system, complex information processing starts in the olfactory bulb, whose output is conveyed by mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs). Despite many differences between them, and despite the crucial position they occupy in the information hierarchy, Cre-driver lines that distinguish them do not yet exist. Here, we sought to identify genes that are differentially expressed between MCs and TCs of the mouse, with an ultimate goal to generate a cell type-specific Cre-driver line, starting from a transcriptome analysis using a large and publicly available single-cell RNA-seq dataset (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B73">Zeisel et al., 2018</cross-ref>). Many genes were differentially expressed, but only a few showed consistent expressions in MCs and at the specificity required. After further validating these putative markers using ISH, two genes (i.e., <I>Pkib</I> and <I>Lbdh2</I>) remained as promising candidates. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we generated Cre-driver lines and analyzed the resulting recombination patterns. This indicated that our new inducible Cre-driver line, <I>Lbhd2-CreERT2</I>, can be used to genetically label MCs in a tamoxifen dose-dependent manner, both in male and female mice, as assessed by soma locations, projection patterns, and sensory-evoked responses <I>in vivo</I>. Hence, this is a promising tool for investigating cell type-specific contributions to olfactory processing and demonstrates the power of publicly accessible data in accelerating science.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the brain, distinct cell types play unique roles. It is therefore important to have tools for studying unique cell types specifically. For the sense of smell in mammals, information is processed first by circuits of the olfactory bulb, where two types of cells, mitral cells and tufted cells, output different information. We generated a transgenic mouse line that enables mitral cells to be specifically labeled or manipulated. This was achieved by looking for genes that are specific to mitral cells using a large and public gene expression dataset, and creating a transgenic mouse using the gene editing technique, CRISPR/Cas9. This will allow scientists to better investigate parallel information processing underlying the sense of smell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Comodulation of h- and Na+/K+ Pump Currents Expands the Range of Functional Bursting in a Central Pattern Generator by Navigating between Dysfunctional Regimes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Central pattern generators (CPGs), specialized oscillatory neuronal networks controlling rhythmic motor behaviors such as breathing and locomotion, must adjust their patterns of activity to a variable environment and changing behavioral goals. Neuromodulation adjusts these patterns by orchestrating changes in multiple ionic currents. In the medicinal leech, the endogenous neuromodulator myomodulin speeds up the heartbeat CPG by reducing the electrogenic Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump current and increasing h-current in pairs of mutually inhibitory leech heart interneurons (HNs), which form half-center oscillators (HN HCOs). Here we investigate whether the comodulation of two currents could have advantages over a single current in the control of functional bursting patterns of a CPG. We use a conductance-based biophysical model of an HN HCO to explain the experimental effects of myomodulin. We demonstrate that, in the model, comodulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump current and h-current expands the range of functional bursting activity by avoiding transitions into nonfunctional regimes, such as asymmetric bursting and plateau-containing seizure-like activity. We validate the model by finding parameters that reproduce temporal bursting characteristics matching experimental recordings from HN HCOs under control, three different myomodulin concentrations, and Cs<sup>+</sup> treated conditions. The matching cases are located along the border of an asymmetric regime away from the border with more dangerous seizure-like activity. We found a simple comodulation mechanism with an inverse relation between the pump and h-currents makes a good fit of the matching cases and comprises a general mechanism for the robust and flexible control of oscillatory neuronal networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Rhythm-generating neuronal circuits adjust their oscillatory patterns to accommodate a changing environment through neuromodulation. In different species, chemical messengers participating in such processes may target two or more membrane currents. In medicinal leeches, the neuromodulator myomodulin speeds up the heartbeat central pattern generator by reducing Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump current and increasing h-current. In a computational model, we show that this comodulation expands the range of central pattern generator's functional activity by navigating the circuit between dysfunctional regimes resulting in a much wider range of cycle period. This control would not be attainable by modulating only one current, emphasizing the synergy of combined effects. Given the prevalence of h-current and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump current in neurons, similar comodulation mechanisms may exist across species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Moving a Shape behind a Slit: Partial Shape Representations in Inferior Temporal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current models of object recognition are based on spatial representations build from object features that are simultaneously present in the retinal image. However, one can recognize an object when it moves behind a static occlude, and only a small fragment of its shape is visible through a slit at a given moment in time. Such anorthoscopic perception requires spatiotemporal integration of the successively presented shape parts during slit-viewing. Human fMRI studies suggested that ventral visual stream areas represent whole shapes formed through temporal integration during anorthoscopic perception. To examine the time course of shape-selective responses during slit-viewing, we recorded the responses of single inferior temporal (IT) neurons of rhesus monkeys to moving shapes that were only partially visible through a static narrow slit. The IT neurons signaled shape identity by their response when that was cumulated across the duration of the shape presentation. Their shape preference during slit-viewing equaled that for static, whole-shape presentations. However, when analyzing their responses at a finer time scale, we showed that the IT neurons responded to particular shape fragments that were revealed by the slit. We found no evidence for temporal integration of slit-views that result in a whole-shape representation, even when the monkey was matching slit-views of a shape to static whole-shape presentations. These data suggest that, although the temporally integrated response of macaque IT neurons can signal shape identity in slit-viewing conditions, the spatiotemporal integration needed for the formation of a whole-shape percept occurs in other areas, perhaps downstream to IT.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Under Threat, Weaker Evidence Is Required to Reach Undesirable Conclusions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Critical decisions, such as in domains ranging from medicine to finance, are often made under threatening circumstances that elicit stress and anxiety. The negative effects of such reactions on learning and decision-making have been repeatedly underscored. In contrast, here we show that perceived threat alters the process by which evidence is accumulated in a way that may be adaptive. Participants (<I>n</I> = 91) completed a sequential evidence sampling task in which they were incentivized to accurately judge whether they were in a desirable state, which was associated with greater rewards than losses, or an undesirable state, which was associated with greater losses than rewards. Before the task participants in the "threat group" experienced a social-threat manipulation. Results show that perceived threat led to a reduction in the strength of evidence required to reach an undesirable judgment. Computational modeling revealed this was because of an increase in the relative rate by which negative information was accumulated. The effect of the threat manipulation was global, as the alteration to evidence accumulation was observed for information which was not directly related to the cause of the threat. Requiring weaker evidence to reach undesirable conclusions in threatening environments may be adaptive as it can lead to increased precautionary action.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To make good judgments, people gather information. As information is often unlimited, a decision has to be made as to when the data are sufficiently strong to reach a conclusion. Here, we show that this decision is significantly influenced by perceived threat. In particular, under threat, the rate of negative information accumulation increased, such that weaker evidence was required to reach an undesirable conclusion. Such modulation could be adaptive as it can result in enhanced cautious behavior in dangerous environments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Anterior Thalamic Inputs Are Required for Subiculum Spatial Coding, with Associated Consequences for Hippocampal Spatial Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Just as hippocampal lesions are principally responsible for "temporal lobe" amnesia, lesions affecting the anterior thalamic nuclei seem principally responsible for a similar loss of memory, "diencephalic" amnesia. Compared with the former, the causes of diencephalic amnesia have remained elusive. A potential clue comes from how the two sites are interconnected, as within the hippocampal formation, only the subiculum has direct, reciprocal connections with the anterior thalamic nuclei. We found that both permanent and reversible anterior thalamic nuclei lesions in male rats cause a cessation of subicular spatial signaling, reduce spatial memory performance to chance, but leave hippocampal CA1 place cells largely unaffected. We suggest that a core element of diencephalic amnesia stems from the information loss in hippocampal output regions following anterior thalamic pathology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At present, we know little about interactions between temporal lobe and diencephalic memory systems. Here, we focused on the subiculum, as the sole hippocampal formation region directly interconnected with the anterior thalamic nuclei. We combined reversible and permanent lesions of the anterior thalamic nuclei, electrophysiological recordings of the subiculum, and behavioral analyses. Our results were striking and clear: following permanent thalamic lesions, the diverse spatial signals normally found in the subiculum (including place cells, grid cells, and head-direction cells) all disappeared. Anterior thalamic lesions had no discernible impact on hippocampal CA1 place fields. Thus, spatial firing activity within the subiculum requires anterior thalamic function, as does successful spatial memory performance. Our findings provide a key missing part of the much bigger puzzle concerning why anterior thalamic damage is so catastrophic for spatial memory in rodents and episodic memory in humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disentangling Semantic Composition and Semantic Association in the Left Temporal Lobe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although composing two words into a complex representation (e.g., "coffee cake") is conceptually different from forming associations between a pair of words (e.g., "coffee, cake"), the brain regions supporting semantic composition have also been implicated for associative encoding. Here, we adopted a two-word magnetoencephalography (MEG) paradigm which varies compositionality ("French/Korean cheese" vs "France/Korea cheese") and strength of association ("France/French cheese" vs "Korea/Korean cheese") between the two words. We collected MEG data while 42 English speakers (24 females) viewed the two words successively in the scanner, and we applied both univariate regression analyses and multivariate pattern classification to the source estimates of the two words. We show that the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) and left middle temporal lobe (LMTL) are distinctively modulated by semantic composition and semantic association. Specifically, the LATL is mostly sensitive to high-association compositional phrases, while the LMTL responds more to low-association compositional phrases. Pattern-based directed connectivity analyses further revealed a continuous information flow from the anterior to the middle temporal region, suggesting that the integration of adjective and noun properties originated earlier in the LATL is consistently delivered to the LMTL when the complex meaning is newly encountered. Taken together, our findings shed light into a functional dissociation within the left temporal lobe for compositional and distributional semantic processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior studies on semantic composition and associative encoding have been conducted independently within the subfields of language and memory, and they typically adopt similar two-word experimental paradigms. However, no direct comparison has been made on the neural substrates of the two processes. The current study relates the two streams of literature, and appeals to audiences in both subfields within cognitive neuroscience. Disentangling the neural computations for semantic composition and association also offers insight into modeling compositional and distributional semantics, which has been the subject of much discussion in natural language processing and cognitive science.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Model-Based Planning Deficits in Compulsivity Are Linked to Faulty Neural Representations of Task Structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Compulsive individuals have deficits in model-based planning, but the mechanisms that drive this have not been established. We examined two candidates&mdash;that compulsivity is linked to (1) an impaired model of the task environment and/or (2) an inability to engage cognitive control when making choices. To test this, 192 participants performed a two-step reinforcement learning task with concurrent EEG recordings, and we related the neural and behavioral data to their scores on a self-reported transdiagnostic dimension of compulsivity. To examine subjects' internal model of the task, we used established behavioral and neural responses to unexpected events [reaction time (RT) slowing, P300 wave, and parietal-occipital alpha band power] measured when an unexpected transition occurred. To assess cognitive control, we probed theta power at the time of initial choice. As expected, model-based planning was linked to greater behavioral (RT) and neural (alpha power, but not P300) sensitivity to rare transitions. Critically, the sensitivities of both RT and alpha to task structure were weaker in those high in compulsivity. This RT-compulsivity effect was tested and replicated in an independent pre-existing dataset (<I>N</I> = 1413). We also found that mid-frontal theta power at the time of choice was reduced in highly compulsive individuals though its relation to model-based planning was less pronounced. These data suggest that model-based planning deficits in compulsive individuals may arise, at least in part, from having an impaired representation of the environment, specifically how actions lead to future states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Compulsivity is linked to poorer performance on tasks that require model-based planning, but it is unclear what precise mechanisms underlie this deficit. Do compulsive individuals fail to engage cognitive control at the time of choice? Or do they have difficulty in building and maintaining an accurate representation of their environment, the foundation needed to behave in a goal-directed manner? With reaction time and EEG measures in 192 individuals who performed a two-step decision-making task, we found that compulsive individuals are less sensitive to surprising action&ndash;state transitions, where they slow down less and show less alpha band suppression following a rare transition. These findings implicate failures in maintaining an accurate model of the world in model-based planning deficits in compulsivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">{alpha}2{delta}-1-Dependent NMDA Receptor Activity in the Hypothalamus Is an Effector of Genetic-Environment Interactions That Drive Persistent Hypertension</a></h4>

              
                <p>The interplay between genetic and environmental factors is critically involved in hypertension development. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus regulates sympathetic output during stress responses and chronic hypertension. In this study, we determined mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in the PVN in chronic stress-induced persistent hypertension in male borderline hypertensive rats (BHR), the first offspring of spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. In Wistar-Kyoto rats, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) increased arterial blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate, which quickly returned to baseline after CUMS ended. In contrast, in BHR, CUMS caused persistent elevation in ABP, which lasted at least 2 weeks after CUMS ended. CUMS also increased the mRNA level of &alpha;2-1 and synaptic protein levels of GluN1, &alpha;2-1, and &alpha;2-1&ndash;GluN1 complexes in the PVN in BHR. Furthermore, CUMS significantly increased the frequency of miniature EPSCs and the amplitude of NMDAR currents in spinally projecting PVN neurons in BHR; these increases were normalized by blocking NMDARs with AP5, inhibiting &alpha;2-1 with gabapentin, or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDAR interaction with &alpha;2-1Tat peptide. Microinjection of AP5 or &alpha;2-1Tat peptide into the PVN normalized elevated ABP and renal sympathetic nerve activity in stressed BHR. In addition, systemically administered gabapentin or memantine attenuated higher ABP induced by CUMS in BHR. Our findings indicate that chronic stress-induced persistent hypertension is mediated by augmented sympathetic outflow via &alpha;2-1&ndash;bound NMDARs in the PVN. This new information provides a cellular and molecular basis for how the genetic-environment interactions cause persistent hypertension.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic stress is a major risk factor for hypertension development, especially for individuals with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Using a rat model of borderline hypertension, we showed that chronic stress induced long-lasting hypertension and sympathetic nerve hyperactivity, which were maintained by NMDAR activation in the hypothalamus. Chronic stress also increased the expression of &alpha;2-1, previously regarded as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunit, promoting physical interaction with and synaptic trafficking of NMDARs in the hypothalamus. Inhibiting &alpha;2-1, blocking NMDARs, or disrupting &alpha;2-1&ndash;bound NMDARs reversed chronic stress-induced sympathetic outflow and persistent hypertension. Thus, &alpha;2-1&ndash;dependent NMDAR activity in the hypothalamus is an effector of genetic-environment interactions and may be targeted for treating stress-induced neurogenic hypertension.</p>
